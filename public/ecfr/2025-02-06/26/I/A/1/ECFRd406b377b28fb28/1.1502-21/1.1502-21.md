# § 1.1502-21   Net operating losses.

(a) *Consolidated net operating loss deduction*—(1) *In general.* Subject to any limitations under the Internal Revenue Code or this chapter (for example, the limitations under section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section), the consolidated net operating loss deduction (or CNOL deduction) for any consolidated return year is the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to the year. The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks consist of—


(i) Any CNOLs (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) of the consolidated group; and


(ii) Any net operating losses (or NOLs) of the members arising in separate return years.


(2) *Application of section 172 for computing net operating loss deductions*—(i) *Overview.* For purposes of § 1.1502-11(a)(2) (regarding a CNOL deduction), the rules of section 172 regarding the use of net operating losses are taken into account as provided by this paragraph (a)(2) in calculating the consolidated taxable income of a group for a particular consolidated return year. More specifically, in computing taxable income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, section 172(a) generally limits the deductibility of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 NOLs). However, these limitations do not apply to net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (pre-2018 NOLs). Therefore, in any particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, the group's CNOL deduction includes CNOLs arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (pre-2018 CNOLs), without limitation under section 172(a). Following the deduction of pre-2018 CNOLs, this paragraph (a)(2) applies to compute the maximum amount of CNOLs from taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 CNOLs), that can be deducted against taxable income in a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020 (post-2017 CNOL deduction limit). See section 172(a)(2)(A) and (B).


(ii) *Computation of the 80-percent limitation and special rule for nonlife insurance companies*—(A) *Determinations based on status of group members.* If a portion of a post-2017 CNOL is carried back or carried over to a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, whether the members of the group include nonlife insurance companies, other types of corporations, or both determines whether section 172(a) (including the limitation described in section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) (80-percent limitation)), section 172(f) (providing special rules for nonlife insurance companies), or both, apply to the group for the consolidated return year.


(B) *Determination of post-2017 CNOL deduction limit.* The post-2017 CNOL deduction limit is determined under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section by applying section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) (that is, the 80-percent limitation), section 172(f) (that is, the special rule for nonlife insurance companies), or both, to the group's consolidated taxable income for that year.


(C) *Inapplicability of 80-percent limitation.* The 80-percent limitation does not apply to CNOL deductions taken in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, or to CNOLs arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (that is, pre-2018 CNOLs). See section 172(a).


(iii) *Computations under sections 172(a)(2)(B) and 172(f).* This paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides rules for applying sections 172(f) and 172(a)(2)(B) to consolidated return years beginning after December 31, 2020 (that is, for computing the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit). Section 172(f) applies to income of nonlife insurance company members, whereas section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) applies to income of members that are not nonlife insurance companies. Thus, this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides specific rules for groups with no nonlife insurance company members, only nonlife insurance company members, or a combination of nonlife insurance company members and other members. For groups with both nonlife insurance company members and life insurance company members, see paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(E) of this section.


(A) *Groups without nonlife insurance company members.* If no member of a group is a nonlife insurance company during a particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) (that is, the 80-percent limitation) applies to all income of the group for that year. Therefore, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for that year is the lesser of—


(*1*) The aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year; or


(*2*) The amount determined by multiplying—


(*i*) 80 percent, by


(*ii*) Consolidated taxable income for the group for that year (determined without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250) less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year.


(B) *Groups comprised solely of nonlife insurance companies.* If a group is comprised solely of nonlife insurance companies during a particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, section 172(f) applies to all income of the group for that year. Therefore, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for that year equals the lesser of—


(*1*) The aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or


(*2*) Consolidated taxable income less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year.


(C) *Groups that include both nonlife insurance companies and other corporations*—(*1*) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*5*) of this section, if a group has at least one member that is a nonlife insurance company and at least one member that is not a nonlife insurance company during a particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for that year equals the lesser of—


(*i*) The aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or


(*ii*) The sum of the amounts in the income pools determined under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section.


(*2*) *Residual income pool.* The amount determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) (residual income pool) is eighty percent of the excess of—


(*i*) The consolidated taxable income of the group for a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, determined without regard to any income, gain, deduction, or loss of members that are nonlife insurance companies and without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250, over


(*ii*) The aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year that are allocated to this income pool under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*4*) of this section (that is, by applying the 80-percent limitation). See section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii).


(*3*) *Nonlife income pool.* The amount determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*3*) (nonlife income pool) is the consolidated taxable income of the group for a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, determined without regard to any income, gain, deduction, or loss of members included in the computation under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) of this section, less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year that are allocated to this income pool under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*4*) of this section. See section 172(f).


(*4*) *Pro rata allocation of pre-2018 NOLs between pools of income.* For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section, the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to any particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, is prorated between the residual income pool and the nonlife income pool based on the relative amounts of positive income of those two pools. For example, if $30 of pre-2018 NOLs is carried over to a consolidated return year in which the residual income pool contains $75 and the nonlife income pool contains $150, the residual income pool is allocated $10 of the pre-2018 NOLs ($30 × $75/($75 + $150), or $30 × 
1/3), and the nonlife income pool is allocated the remaining $20 of pre-2018 NOLs ($30 × $150/($75 + $150), or $30 × 
2/3).


(*5*) *Exception.* The post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for a consolidated return year is determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*5*) if the amounts computed under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section for that year are not both positive.


(*i*) *Positive residual income pool and negative nonlife income pool.* This paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*5*)(*i*) applies if the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) of this section for the residual income pool is positive and the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*3*) of this section for the nonlife income pool is negative. If this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*5*)(*i*) applies, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for a consolidated return year equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or 80 percent of the consolidated taxable income of the entire group (determined without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250) after subtracting the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year (that is, by applying the 80-percent limitation). See section 172(a)(2)(B).


(*ii*) *Positive nonlife income pool and negative residual income pool.* If the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*3*) of this section for the nonlife income pool is positive and the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) of this section for the residual income pool is negative, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for a consolidated return year equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or the consolidated taxable income of the entire group less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year. See section 172(f).


(b) *Net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to consolidated return and separate return years.* Net operating losses of members arising during a consolidated return year are taken into account in determining the group's CNOL under paragraph (e) of this section for that year. Losses taken into account in determining the CNOL may be carried to other taxable years (whether consolidated or separate) only under this paragraph (b).


(1) *Carryovers and carrybacks generally.* The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to a taxable year are determined under the principles of, and are subject to any limitations under, section 172 and this section. Thus, losses permitted to be absorbed in a consolidated return year generally are absorbed in the order of the taxable years in which they arose, and losses carried from taxable years ending on the same date, and which are available to offset consolidated taxable income for the year, generally are absorbed on a pro rata basis. In addition, except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of any CNOL absorbed by the group in any year is apportioned among members based on the percentage of the CNOL eligible for carryback or carryover that is attributable to each member as of the beginning of the year. The percentage of the CNOL attributable to a member is determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Additional rules provided under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations also apply. See, for example, section 382(l)(2)(B) (if losses are carried from the same taxable year, losses subject to limitation under section 382 are absorbed before losses that are not subject to limitation under section 382). See paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, (Example 2), for an illustration of pro rata absorption of losses subject to a SRLY limitation. 


(2) *Carryovers and carrybacks of CNOLs to separate return years*—(i) *In general.* If any CNOL that is attributable to a member may be carried to a separate return year of the member, the amount of the CNOL that is attributable to the member is apportioned to the member (apportioned loss) and carried to the separate return year. If carried back to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried back to an equivalent, or earlier, consolidated return year of the group; if carried over to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried over to an equivalent, or later, consolidated return year of the group. 


(ii) *Special rules*—(A) *Year of departure from group.* If a corporation ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, net operating loss carryovers attributable to the corporation are first carried to the consolidated return year, then are subject to reduction under section 108 and § 1.1502-28 (regarding discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a)), and then are subject to reduction under § 1.1502-36 (regarding transfers of loss shares of subsidiary stock). Only the amount that is neither absorbed by the group in that year nor reduced under section 108 and § 1.1502-28 or under § 1.1502-36 may be carried to the corporation's first separate return year. For rules concerning a member departing a subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.


(B) *Offspring rule.* In the case of a member that has been a member continuously since its organization (determined without regard to whether the member is a successor to any other corporation), the CNOL attributable to the member is included in the carrybacks to consolidated return years before the member's existence. If the group did not file a consolidated return for a carryback year, the loss may be carried back to a separate return year of the common parent under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, but only if the common parent was not a member of a different consolidated group or of an affiliated group filing separate returns for the year to which the loss is carried or any subsequent year in the carryback period. Following an acquisition described in § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3), references to the common parent are to the corporation that was the common parent immediately before the acquisition.


(iii) *Equivalent years.* Taxable years are equivalent if they bear the same numerical relationship to the consolidated return year in which a CNOL arises, counting forward or backward from the year of the loss. For example, in the case of a member's third taxable year (which was a separate return year) that preceded the consolidated return year in which the loss arose, the equivalent year is the third consolidated return year preceding the consolidated return year in which the loss arose. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section for certain short taxable years that are disregarded in making this determination.


(iv) *Operating rules.* (A) *Amount of CNOL attributable to a member.* The amount of a CNOL that is attributable to a member equals the product obtained by multiplying the CNOL and the percentage of the CNOL attributable to the member.


(B) *Percentage of CNOL attributable to a member*—(*1*) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section, the percentage of the CNOL for the consolidated return year attributable to a member equals the separate net operating loss of the member for the consolidated return year divided by the sum of the separate net operating losses for that year of all members having such losses for that year. For this purpose, the separate net operating loss of a member is determined by computing the CNOL by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss, including the member's losses and deductions actually absorbed by the group in the consolidated return year (whether or not absorbed by the member). The source and section 904(d) separate category of the CNOL attributable to a member is determined under § 1.1502-4(c)(1)(iii).


(*2*) *Recomputed percentage.* If, for any reason, a member's portion of a CNOL is absorbed or reduced on a non-pro rata basis (for example, under § 1.1502-11(b) or (c), paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, § 1.1502-28, or 1.1502-36(d), or as the result of a carryback to a separate return year), the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member is recomputed. In addition, if a member with a separate net operating loss ceases to be a member, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each remaining member is recomputed. The recomputed percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member equals the remaining CNOL attributable to the member at the time of the recomputation divided by the sum of the remaining CNOL attributable to all of the remaining members at the time of the recomputation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*), a CNOL that is permanently disallowed or eliminated is treated as absorbed.


(C) *Net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks*—(*1*) *General rules.* Subject to the rules regarding allocation of special status losses under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) of this section—


(*i*) *Nonlife insurance companies.* The portion of a CNOL attributable to any members of the group that are nonlife insurance companies is carried back or carried over under the rules in section 172(b) applicable to nonlife insurance companies.


(*ii*) *Corporations other than nonlife insurance companies.* The portion of a CNOL attributable to any other members of the group is carried back or carried over under the rules in section 172(b) applicable to corporations other than nonlife insurance companies.


(*2*) *Recomputed percentage.* For rules governing the recomputation of the percentage of a CNOL attributable to each remaining member if any portion of the CNOL attributable to a member is carried back under section 172(b)(1)(B) or (C) and absorbed on a non-pro rata basis, see paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section.


(D) *Allocation of special status losses.* The amount of the group's CNOL that is determined to constitute a farming loss (as defined in section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii)) or any other net operating loss that is subject to special carryback or carryover rules (special status loss) is allocated to each member separately from the remainder of the CNOL based on the percentage of the CNOL attributable to the member, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. This allocation is made without regard to whether a particular member actually incurred specific expenses or engaged in specific activities required by the special status loss provisions. This paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) applies only with regard to losses for which the special carryback or carryover rules are dependent on the type of expense generating the loss, rather than on the special status of the entity to which the loss is allocable. See section 172(b)(1)(C) and paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C)(*1*)(*i*) of this section (applicable to losses of nonlife insurance companies). This paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) does not apply to farming losses incurred by a consolidated group in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021.


(E) *Coordination with rules for life-nonlife groups under § 1.1502-47.* For groups that include at least one member that is a life insurance company and for which an election is in effect under section 1504(c)(2), any computation of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section is computed only with respect to items of income, gain, deduction, and loss of the members of the nonlife subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-47(b)(9)). For rules regarding the use of CNOLs of the nonlife subgroup to offset life insurance company taxable income of the life subgroup (each as defined in § 1.1502-47(b)), or the use of CNOLs of the life subgroup to offset consolidated taxable income of the nonlife subgroup, see generally section 1503(c)(1) and § 1.1502-47.


(v) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (b)(2)(v), unless otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations have calendar taxable years, all losses are farming losses within the meaning of section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii), all taxable years begin after December 31, 2020, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, value means fair market value and the adjusted basis of each asset equals its value, all transactions are with unrelated persons, and the application of any limitation or threshold under section 382 is disregarded. The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples: 


(A) *Example 1: Offspring rule.* (*1*) During Year 1, Individual A forms P and T, and they each file a separate return. P forms S on March 15 of Year 2, and P and S file a consolidated return. P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes a member of the P group. P's acquisition of T is not an ownership change within the meaning of section 382. P, S, and T sustain a $1,100 CNOL in Year 3 and, under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable $200 to P, $300 to S, and $600 to T.


(*2*) Of the $1,100 CNOL in Year 3, the $500 amount of the CNOL that is attributable to P and S ($200 + $300) may be carried to P's separate return in Year 1. Even though S was not in existence in Year 1, the $300 amount of the CNOL attributable to S may be carried back to P's separate return in Year 1 because S (unlike T) has been a member of the P group since its organization and P is a qualified parent under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. To the extent not absorbed in that year, the loss may then be carried to the P group's return in Year 2. The $600 amount of the CNOL attributable to T is a net operating loss carryback to T's separate return in Year 1, and if not absorbed in Year 1, then to Year 2.


(B) *Example 2: Departing members.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 1.* In addition, on June 15 of Year 4, P sells all the stock of T. The P group's consolidated return for Year 4 includes the income of T through June 15. T files a separate return for the period from June 16 through December 31.


(*2*) $600 of the Year 3 CNOL attributable to T is apportioned to T and is carried back to its separate return in Year 1. To the extent the $600 is not absorbed in T's separate return in Year 1 or Year 2, it is carried to the consolidated return in Year 4 before being carried to T's separate return in Year 4. Any portion of the loss not absorbed in T's Year 1 or Year 2 or in the P group's Year 4 is then carried to T's separate return in Year 4.


(C) *Example 3. Offspring rule following acquisition.* (*1*) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 1, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T. P acquires all of the stock of T at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $200 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2, and $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 3 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). At the beginning of Year 4, T forms a subsidiary, Y, in a transaction described in section 351. The P group has a $300 consolidated net operating loss in Year 4, and under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable entirely to Y.


(*2*) Even though Y was not in existence in Year 2, $300, the amount of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to Y, may be carried back to the P group's Year 2 consolidated return under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because Y has been a member of the P group since its organization. To the extent not absorbed in that year, the loss may then be carried to the P group's consolidated return in Year 3.


(D) *Example 4: Allocation of a CNOL arising in a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020.* (*1*) P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes S. Neither P nor S is a nonlife insurance company. The P group also includes nonlife insurance companies PC1, PC2, and PC3. In the P group's 2021 consolidated return year, all members except S have separate net operating losses, and the P group's CNOL in that year is $40. No member of the P group engages in farming activities. See section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii).


(*2*) Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section, for purposes of carrying losses to other taxable years, the P group's $40 CNOL is allocated pro rata among the group members that have separate net operating losses. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, those respective portions of the CNOL attributable to PC1, PC2, and PC3 (that is, members that are nonlife insurance companies) are carried back to each of the two preceding taxable years and then carried over to each of the 20 subsequent taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(C). The portion attributable to P (which is not a nonlife insurance company) may not be carried back but is carried over to future years. See section 172(b)(1)(A).


(E) *Example 5: Allocation of a CNOL arising in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 2021.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D)(*1*) of this section, except that the P group incurred the CNOL during the P group's 2020 consolidated return year. The allocation among the P group members of the CNOL described in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D)(*2*) of this section would be the same. However, those respective portions of the CNOL attributable to PC1, PC2, and PC3 (that is, members that are nonlife insurance companies) will be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years and then carried over to each of the 20 subsequent taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(C) and section 172(b)(1)(D)(i). The portion attributable to P (which is not a nonlife insurance company) will be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years and then carried over to future years. See section 172(b)(1)(A) and section 172(b)(1)(D)(i).


(F) *Example 6: CNOL deduction and application of section 172.* (*1*) P (a type of corporation other than a nonlife insurance company) is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes PC1 (a nonlife insurance company). P and PC1 were both incorporated in Year 1 (a year beginning after December 31, 2020). In Year 1, P and PC1 have separate taxable income of $20 and $25, respectively. As a result, the P group has Year 1 consolidated taxable income of $45. In Year 2, P has separate taxable income of $24, and PC1 has a separate taxable loss of $40, resulting in a P group CNOL of $16. Additionally, in Year 3, P has separate taxable income of $15, and PC1 has a separate taxable loss of $45, resulting in a P group CNOL of $30. No member of the P group engages in farming activities. See section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii).


(*2*) Under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the P group's Year 2 CNOL and Year 3 CNOL are entirely attributable to PC1, a nonlife insurance company. Therefore, under section 172(b)(1)(C)(i), the entire amount of each of these CNOLs is eligible to be carried back to Year 1.


(*3*) Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of the Year 2 CNOL that may be used by the P group in Year 1 is determined by taking into account the status (nonlife insurance company or other type of corporation) of the member that has separate taxable income composing in whole or in part the P group's consolidated taxable income. Because the P group includes both a nonlife insurance company member and a member that is not a nonlife insurance company, paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section applies to determine the computation of the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for Year 1. Therefore, the 80-percent limitation is applied to the residual income pool, which consists of the taxable income of P, a type of corporation other than a nonlife insurance company. Under the 80-percent limitation, the maximum amount of P's Year 1 income that may be offset by the P group's post-2017 CNOLs is $16, which equals 80 percent of the excess of P's taxable income for Year 1 ($20) over the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs allocable to P ($0) (80 percent × ($20−$0)). See paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) and (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*4*) of this section. PC1 is a nonlife insurance company to which section 172(f), rather than the 80-percent limitation in section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii), applies. Therefore, the maximum amount of PC1's Year 1 income that may be offset by the P group's post-2017 CNOLs is $25, which equals the excess of PC1's taxable income for Year 1 ($25) over the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs allocable to PC1 ($0). See paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(*3*) and (*4*) of this section.


(*4*) Based on paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section and the analysis set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F)(*3*) of this section, at the end of Year 2, the P group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for Year 1 is the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to Year 1 ($16), or $41 ($16 + $25). Therefore, the P group can offset $16 of its Year 1 income with its CNOL carryback from Year 2.


(*5*) When the Year 3 CNOL is carried back to Year 1, the P group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for Year 1 is the lesser of $46 (the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to Year 1) or $41 ($16 + $25; see the computation in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F)(*3*) of this section). Thus, the total amount of the P group's Year 1 income that may be offset by the P group's Year 2 and Year 3 CNOLs is $41 ($16 from Year 2 + $25 from Year 3). As a result, the P group reports $4 of income ($45−$41) in Year 1 that is ineligible for offset by any other NOLs. The P group carries over its remaining $5 CNOL ($46−$41) to future years.


(G) *Example 7: Pre-2018 and post-2017 CNOLs.* (*1*) P is the common parent of a consolidated group. No member of the P group is a nonlife insurance company or is engaged in a farming business, and no member of the P group has a loss that is subject to a SRLY limitation. The P group had the following consolidated taxable income or CNOL for the following taxable years:


(*2*) Under section 172(a)(1), all $30 of the P group's 2018 consolidated taxable income is offset by the 2017 CNOL carryover without limitation. The remaining $60 of the P group's 2017 CNOL is carried over to 2021 under section 172(b)(1)(A)(ii)(I).


(*3*) Under section 172(b)(1)(D)(i)(I), the P group's $40 2019 CNOL is carried back to the five taxable years preceding the year of the loss. Thus, the P group's $40 2019 CNOL is carried back to offset $40 of its 2014 consolidated taxable income.


(*4*) Under section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the P group's CNOL deduction for 2021 equals the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 plus the group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit. The P group has $60 of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 ($90−$30). Because no member of the P group is a nonlife insurance company, paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section applies to determine the computation of the group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for 2021. See also section 172(a)(2)(B). Therefore, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit of the P group for 2021 is $48, which equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to 2021 ($100), or 80 percent of the excess of the P group's consolidated taxable income for that year computed without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250 ($120) over the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 ($60) (that is, 80 percent × $60). Thus, the P group's CNOL deduction for 2021 equals $108 ($60 pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 + $48 post-2017 CNOL deduction limit). See section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The P group offsets $108 of its $120 of 2021 consolidated taxable income, resulting in $12 of consolidated taxable income in 2021. The remaining $52 of the P group's 2020 CNOL ($100−$48) is carried over to future taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II).






(3) *Election to relinquish entire carryback period*—(i) *In general.* A group may make an irrevocable election under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a CNOL for any consolidated return year. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, the election may not be made separately for any member (whether or not it remains a member), and must be made in a separate statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-21(b)(3)(i) TO WAIVE THE ENTIRE CARRYBACK PERIOD PURSUANT TO SECTION 172(b)(3) FOR THE [insert consolidated return year] CNOLs OF THE CONSOLIDATED GROUP OF WHICH [insert name and employer identification number of common parent] IS THE COMMON PARENT.” The statement must be filed with the group's income tax return for the consolidated return year in which the loss arises. The election may be made in an unsigned statement.


(ii) *Groups that include insolvent financial institutions.* For rules applicable to relinquishing the entire carryback period with respect to losses attributable to insolvent financial institutions, *see* § 301.6402-7 of this chapter.




(4) *General split-waiver election.* If one or more members of a consolidated group becomes a member of another consolidated group, the acquiring group may make an irrevocable election to relinquish, with respect to all consolidated net operating losses attributable to the member, the portion of the carryback period for which the corporation was a member of another group, provided that any other corporation joining the acquiring group that was affiliated with the member immediately before it joined the acquiring group is also included in the waiver. This election is not a yearly election and applies to all losses that would otherwise be subject to a carryback to a former group under section 172. The election must be made in a separate statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-21(b)(4) TO WAIVE THE PRE- [insert first taxable year for which the member (or members) was not a member of another group] CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLs attributable to [insert names and employer identification number of members].” The statement must be filed with the acquiring consolidated group's original income tax return for the year the corporation (or corporations) became a member. The election may be made in an unsigned statement.


(5) *Split-waiver elections to which amended carryback rules apply*—(i) *In general.* An acquiring group may make either (but not both) an amended statute split-waiver election or an extended split-waiver election with respect to a particular amended carryback CNOL. These elections are available only if the statutory amendment to the carryback period referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D) of this section occurs after the date of acquisition of an acquired member. A separate election is available for each taxable year to which amended carryback rules apply. An acquiring group may make an amended statute split-waiver election or an extended split-waiver election only if the acquiring group, with regard to that election—


(A) Satisfies the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section; and


(B) Follows the procedures in paragraphs (b)(5)(v) and (vi) of this section, as relevant to that election.

(A) The acquiring group has not filed a valid election described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section with respect to the acquired member on or before the effective date of the amended carryback rules;


(B) The acquiring group has not filed a valid election described in section 172(b)(3) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section with respect to a CNOL of the acquiring group from which the amended carryback CNOL is attributed to the acquired member;


(C) Any other corporation joining the acquiring group that was affiliated with the acquired member immediately before the acquired member joined the acquiring group is included in the waiver; and


(D) A former group does not claim any carryback (as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section) to any taxable year in the carryback period (in the case of an amended statute split-waiver election) or in the extended carryback period (in the case of an extended split-waiver election) with respect to the amended carryback CNOL on a return or other filing filed on or before the date the acquiring group files the election.


(iv) *Claim for a carryback.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(D) of this section, a carryback is claimed with respect to an amended carryback CNOL if there is a claim for refund, an amended return, an application for a tentative carryback adjustment, or any other filing that claims the benefit of the NOL in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of the loss, whether or not subsequently revoked in favor of a claim based on the period provided for in the amended carryback rules.


(v) *Procedures for making an amended statute split-waiver election or an extended split-waiver election*—(A) *Amended statute split-waiver election.* An amended statute split-waiver election must be made in a separate amended statute split-waiver election statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER SECTION 1.1502-21(b)(5)(i) TO WAIVE THE PRE-[insert first day of the first taxable year for which the acquired member was a member of the acquiring group] CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE [insert taxable year of losses] TAXABLE YEAR(S) OF [insert names and employer identification numbers of members]”. The amended statute split-waiver election statement must be filed as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section.


(B) *Extended split-waiver election.* An extended split-waiver election must be made in a separate extended split-waiver election statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER SECTION 1.1502-21(b)(5)(i) TO WAIVE THE PRE-[insert first day of the first taxable year for which the acquired member was a member of the acquiring group] EXTENDED CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE [insert taxable year of losses] TAXABLE YEAR(S) OF [insert names and employer identification numbers of members]”. The extended split-waiver election statement must be filed as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section.


(vi) *Time and manner for filing statement*—(A) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(B) or (C) of this section, an amended statute split-waiver election statement or extended split-waiver election statement must be filed with the acquiring group's timely filed consolidated return (including extensions) for the year during which the amended carryback CNOL is incurred.


(B) *Amended returns.* This paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(B) applies if the date of the filing required under paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(A) of this section is not at least 150 days after the date of the statutory amendment to the carryback period referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. Under this paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(B), an amended statute split-waiver election statement or extended split-waiver election statement may be attached to an amended return filed by the date that is 150 days after the date of the statutory amendment referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D) of this section.


(C) *Certain taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021.* This paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(C) applies to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, for which the date of the filing required under paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(A) of this section precedes November 30, 2020. Under this paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(C), an amended statute split-waiver election statement or extended split-waiver election statement may be attached to an amended return filed by November 30, 2020.


(6) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For purposes of these examples: All affiliated groups file consolidated returns; all corporations are includible corporations that have calendar taxable years; each of P, X, and T is a corporation having one class of stock outstanding; each of P and X is the common parent of a consolidated group (P Group and X Group, respectively); neither the P Group nor the X Group includes an insolvent financial institution or an insurance company; no NOL is a farming loss; there are no other relevant NOL carrybacks to the X Group's consolidated taxable years; except as otherwise stated, the X Group has sufficient consolidated taxable income determined under § 1.1502-11 (CTI) to absorb the stated NOL carryback by T; T has sufficient SRLY register income within the X Group to absorb the stated NOL carryback by T; all transactions occur between unrelated parties; and the facts set forth the only relevant transactions.


(i) *Example 1: Computation and absorption of amended carrybacks*—(A) *Facts.* In Year 1, T became a member of the X Group. On the last day of Year 5, P acquired all the stock of T from X. At the time of P's acquisition of T stock, the default carryback period was zero taxable years. The P Group did not make an irrevocable split-waiver election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section to relinquish, with respect to all CNOLs attributable to T while a member of the P Group, the portion of the carryback period for which T was a member of the X Group (that is, a former group). In Year 7, the P Group sustained a $1,000 CNOL, $600 of which was attributable to T pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. In that year, P did not make an irrevocable general waiver election under section 172(b)(3) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section with respect to the $1,000 CNOL when the P Group filed its consolidated return for Year 7. In Year 8, legislation was enacted that amended section 172 to require a carryback period of five years for NOLs arising in a taxable year beginning after Year 5 and before Year 9.


(B) *Analysis.* As a result of the amended carryback rules enacted in Year 8, the P Group's $1,000 CNOL in Year 7 must be carried back to Year 2. Therefore, T's $600 attributed portion of the P Group's Year 7 CNOL (that is, T's amended carryback CNOL) must be carried back to taxable years of the X Group. *See* paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section. To the extent T's amended carryback CNOL is not absorbed in the X Group's Year 2 taxable year, the remaining portion must be carried to the X Group's Year 3, Year 4, and Year 5 taxable years, as appropriate. *See id.* Any remaining portion of T's amended carryback CNOL is carried to consolidated return years of the P Group. *See* paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(ii) *Example 2: Amended statute split-waiver election*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A) of this section (*Example 1*), except that, following the change in statutory carryback period in Year 8, the P Group made a valid amended statute split-waiver election under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section to relinquish solely the carryback of T's amended carryback CNOL.


(B) *Analysis.* Because the P Group made a valid amended statute split-waiver election, T's amended carryback CNOL is not eligible to be carried back to any taxable years of the X Group (that is, a former group). However, the amended statute split-waiver election does not prevent T's Year 7 amended carryback CNOL from being carried back to years of the P group (that is, the acquiring group) during which T was a member. *See* paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(E) of this section. As a result, the entire amount of T's amended carryback CNOL is eligible to be carried back to taxable Year 6 of the P Group. Any remaining CNOL may then be carried over within the P Group. *See* paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(iii) *Example 3: Computation and absorption of extended carrybacks*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A) of this section (*Example 1*), except that the X Group had $300 of CTI in Year 4 and $200 of CTI in Year 5 and, at the time of the P Group's acquisition of T, the default carryback period was two years. Therefore, T's $600 attributed portion of the P Group's Year 7 CNOL was required to be carried back to the X Group's Year 5 taxable year, and the X Group was able to offset $200 of CTI in Year 5.


(B) *Analysis.* As a result of the amended carryback rules, the X Group must offset its $300 of CTI in Year 4 against T's amended carryback CNOL. *See* paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section. The remaining $100 ($600-$300-$200) of T's amended carryback CNOL is carried to taxable years of the P Group. *See* paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(iv) *Example 4: Extended split-waiver election*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section (*Example 3*), except that, following the change in law in Year 8, the P Group made a valid extended split-waiver election under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section to relinquish the extended carryback period for T's amended carryback CNOL for years in which T was a member of the X Group.


(B) *Analysis.* As a result of the P Group's extended split-waiver election, T's amended carryback CNOL is not eligible to be carried back to any portion of the extended carryback period (that is, any taxable year prior to Year 5). *See* paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(I) of this section. As a result, the X Group absorbs $200 of T's $600 loss in Year 5, and the remaining $400 ($600-$200) is carried to taxable years of the P Group. *See* paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(7) *Short years in connection with transactions to which section 381(a) applies.* If a member distributes or transfers assets to a corporation that is a member immediately after the distribution or transfer in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the transaction does not cause the distributor or transferor to have a short year within the consolidated return year of the group in which the transaction occurred that is counted as a separate year for purposes of determining the years to which a net operating loss may be carried.




(c) *Limitations on net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks from separate return limitation years*—(1) *SRLY limitation*—(i) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an overlap with section 382), the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of a member (SRLY member) arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs (SRLY NOLs) that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss (cumulative register). For this purpose—


(A) Consolidated taxable income is computed without regard to CNOL deductions;


(B) Consolidated taxable income takes into account the member's losses and deductions (including capital losses) actually absorbed by the group in consolidated return years (whether or not absorbed by the member);


(C) In computing consolidated taxable income, the consolidated return years of the group include only those years, including the year to which the loss is carried, that the member has been continuously included in the group's consolidated return, but exclude—


(*1*) For carryovers, any years ending after the year to which the loss is carried; and


(*2*) For carrybacks, any years ending after the year in which the loss arose;


(D) The treatment under § 1.1502-15 of a built-in loss as a hypothetical net operating loss carryover in the year recognized is solely for purposes of determining the limitation under this paragraph (c) with respect to the loss in that year and not for any other purpose. Thus, for purposes of determining consolidated taxable income for any other losses, a built-in loss allowed under this section in the year it arises is taken into account; and


(E) If a limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset under section 172(a) (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section) applies in a taxable year to a member whose carryovers or carrybacks are subject to a SRLY limitation (SRLY member), the amount of net operating loss subject to a SRLY limitation that is available for use by the group in that year is limited to the percentage of the balance in the cumulative register that would be available for offset under section 172(a) if the SRLY member filed a separate return and reported as taxable income in that year the amount contained in the cumulative register. For example, assume that a consolidated group has a SRLY member that is a corporation other than a nonlife insurance company, and that the SRLY member has a SRLY NOL that arose in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 NOL). The group's consolidated taxable income for a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020 is $200, but the cumulative register has a positive balance of only $120 (and no other net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks are available for the year). Because the SRLY limitation would be $96 ($120 × 80 percent), only $96 of SRLY loss may be used, rather than $160 ($200 × 80 percent). In addition, to the extent that this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) applies, the cumulative register is decreased by the full amount of income required under section 172(a) to support the amount of SRLY NOL absorption. See, for example, paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section for examples illustrating the application of this rule.


(ii) *Losses treated as arising in SRLYs.* If a net operating loss carryover or carryback did not arise in a SRLY but is attributable to a built-in loss (as defined under § 1.1502-15), the carryover or carryback is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c) as arising in a SRLY if the built-in loss was not allowed, after application of the SRLY limitation, in the year it arose. For an illustration, see § 1.1502-15(d), *Example 5.* But see § 1.1502-15(g)(1).


(iii) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (c)(1)(iii), no corporation is a nonlife insurance company and, unless otherwise specified, all taxable years begin after December 31, 2020, and all CNOLs arise in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. The principles of this paragraph (c)(1) are illustrated by the following examples: 


(A) *Example 1: Determination of SRLY limitation.* (*1*) Individual A owns P. In Year 1, Individual A forms T, and T sustains a $100 net operating loss that is carried forward. P acquires all the stock of T at the beginning of Year 2, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items.


(*2*) T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 arose in a SRLY. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, the $100 net operating loss carryover is subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 2 equals the consolidated taxable income of the P group determined by reference to only T's items, or $70. However, due to the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, the SRLY limitation is $56 ($70 × 80 percent). No losses from equivalent years are available, and the P group otherwise has sufficient consolidated taxable income to support the CNOL deduction ($300 × 80 percent = $240). Therefore, $56 of the SRLY net operating loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 2. Although only $56 is absorbed, the cumulative register of T is reduced by $70, the full amount of income necessary to support the $56 deduction after taking into account the 80-percent limitation ($70 × 80 percent = $56).


(*3*) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this *Example 1,* except that such consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) for Year 2 is a loss (a CNOL) of $370. Because the SRLY limitation may not exceed the consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, and such items aggregate to a CNOL, T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is not allowed under the SRLY limitation in Year 2. Moreover, if consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) did not exceed $370 in Year 3, the carryover would still be restricted under paragraph (c) of this section in Year 3, because the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group computed by reference to only T's items would not be a positive amount.


(B) *Example 2: Net operating loss carryovers.* (*1*) In Year 1, Individual A forms P, and P sustains a $40 net operating loss that is carried forward. P has no income in Year 2. Individual A also owns T which sustains a net operating loss of $50 in Year 2 that is carried forward. P acquires the stock of T from Individual A during Year 3, but T is not a member of the P group for each day of the year. P and T file separate returns and sustain net operating losses of $120 and $60, respectively, for Year 3. The P group files consolidated returns beginning in Year 4. During Year 4, the P group has $160 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items. These results are summarized as follows:


(*2*) P's Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 are not SRLYs with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(i). Thus, P's $40 net operating loss arising in Year 1 and $120 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are not subject to the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. Although the P group has $160 of taxable income in Year 4, the 80-percent limitation reduces the P group's net operating loss deduction in that year to $128 ($160 × 80 percent). Under the principles of section 172, paragraph (b) of this section requires that P's $40 loss arising in Year 1 be the first loss absorbed by the P group in Year 4. Absorption of this loss leaves $88 ($128−$40) of the P group's Year 4 consolidated taxable income available for offset by loss carryovers.


(*3*) T's Year 2 and Year 3 are SRLYs with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(ii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's $50 net operating loss arising in Year 2 and $60 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 4 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $70. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, T's SRLY limitation is $56 ($70 × 80 percent). Therefore, the P group can absorb up to $56 of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 4. Under the principles of section 172, T's $50 SRLY net operating loss from Year 2 is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 4. After absorption of this loss, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, $6 of SRLY limit remains in Year 4 ($56−$50). Further, the total amount of Year 4 consolidated taxable income available for offset by other loss carryovers under section 172(a) is $38 ($88−$50).


(*4*) P and T each carry over net operating losses to Year 4 from a taxable year ending on the same date (that is, Year 3). The losses carried over from Year 3 total $180. However, the remaining Year 4 SRLY limit is $6. Therefore, the total amount of loss available for absorption is $126 ($120 allocable to P and $6 allocable to T). Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses available for absorption that are carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though one loss arises in a SRLY and the other loss does not. Thus, $36.19 of P's Year 3 loss is absorbed ($120/($120 + $6)) × $38 = $36.19. In addition, $1.81 of T's Year 3 loss is absorbed ($6/($120 + $6)) × $38 = $1.81.


(*5*) After deduction of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. A total of $51.81 of SRLY net operating losses were absorbed in Year 4 ($50 + $1.81). After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $64.76 ($64.76 × 80 percent = $51.81). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $64.76, and $5.24 remains in the cumulative register ($70−$64.76).


(*6*) P carries its remaining $83.81 ($120−$36.19) Year 3 net operating loss and T carries its remaining $58.19 ($60−$1.81) Year 3 net operating loss over to Year 5. Assume that, in Year 5, the P group has $90 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). The P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items is a CNOL of $4. Therefore, the positive balance of the cumulative register of T in Year 5 equals $1.24 ($5.24−$4). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, T's SRLY limitation is $0.99 ($1.24 × 80 percent). For Year 5, the total amount of Year 5 consolidated taxable income available for offset by loss carryovers as a result of the 80-percent limitation is $72 ($90 × 80 percent). Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though one loss arises in a SRLY and the other loss does not. Therefore, $71.16 of P's Year 3 loss is absorbed (($83.81/($83.81 + $0.99)) × $72 = $71.16). In addition, $0.84 of T's Year 3 losses is absorbed (($0.99/($83.81 + $0.99)) × $72 = $0.84).


(C) *Example 3: Net operating loss carrybacks.* (*1*) P owns all of the stock of S and T. The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated taxable income of the P group for Years 1, 2, and 3:


(*2*) P sells all of the stock of T to Individual A at the beginning of Year 4, a taxable year that begins on January 1, 2021. For its Year 4 separate return year, T has a net operating loss of $30.


(*3*) T's Year 4 is a SRLY with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(1). T's $30 net operating loss carryback to the P group from Year 4 is not allowed under paragraph (c) of this section to be included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section for Year 1, 2, or 3, because the P group's consolidated taxable income would not be a positive amount if determined by reference to only T's items for all consolidated return years through Year 4 (without regard to the $30 net operating loss). The $30 loss is carried forward to T's Year 5 and succeeding taxable years as provided under the Internal Revenue Code.


(D) *Example 4: Computation of SRLY limitation for built-in losses treated as net operating loss carryovers.* (*1*) Individual A owns P. In Year 1, Individual A forms T by contributing $300 and T sustains a $100 net operating loss. During Year 2, T's assets decline in value by $100. At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P group in a transaction that does not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). At the time of the acquisition, T has a $100 net unrealized built-in loss, which exceeds the threshold requirements of section 382(h)(3)(B). During Year 3, T recognizes its unrealized loss as a $100 ordinary loss. The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated taxable income of the P group for Years 3 and 4 (computed without regard to T's recognition of its unrealized loss and any CNOL deduction under this section):


(*2*) Under § 1.1502-15(a), T's $100 of ordinary loss in Year 3 constitutes a built-in loss that is subject to the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. The amount of the limitation is determined by treating the deduction as a net operating loss carryover from a SRLY. The built-in loss is therefore subject to both a SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation for Year 3. The built-in loss is treated as a net operating loss carryover solely for purposes of determining the extent to which the loss is not allowed by reason of the SRLY limitation, and for all other purposes the loss remains a loss arising in Year 3. See § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(i)(D). Consequently, under paragraph (b) of this section, the built-in loss is absorbed by the P group before the net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is absorbed. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 3 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $60. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 3 is $48 ($60 × 80 percent). Therefore, $48 of the built-in loss is absorbed by the P group. None of T's $100 SRLY net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is allowed.


(*3*) After deduction of T's $48 SRLY built-in loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 × 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($60−$60).


(*4*) Under § 1.1502-15(a), the $52 balance of the built-in loss that is not allowed in Year 3 because of the SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation is treated as a $52 net operating loss arising in Year 3 that is subject to the SRLY limitation because, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, Year 3 is treated as a SRLY. The built-in loss is carried to other years in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 4 equals $40 (zero from Year 3 + $40). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 4 is $32 ($40 × 80 percent). Therefore, under paragraph (c) of this section, $32 of T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 4.


(*5*) After deduction of T's $32 SRLY net operating loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $40 ($40 × 80 percent = $32). Therefore, the cumulative register is decreased by $40, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($40−$40).


(E) *Example 5: Dual SRLY registers and accounting for SRLY losses actually absorbed.* (*1*) In Year 1, T sustains a $100 net operating loss and a $50 net capital loss. At the beginning of Year 2, T becomes a member of the P group in a transaction that does not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). Both of T's carryovers from Year 1 are subject to SRLY limits under this paragraph (c) and § 1.1502-22(c). The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated taxable income for Years 2 and 3 (computed without regard to T's CNOL deduction under this section or net capital loss carryover under § 1.1502-22):


(*2*) For Year 2, the P group computes separate SRLY limits for each of T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group determines its ability to use its capital loss carryover before it determines its ability to use its ordinary loss carryover. Under section 1212, because the P group has no Year 2 capital gain, it cannot absorb any capital losses in Year 2. T's Year 1 net capital loss and the P group's Year 2 consolidated net capital loss (all of which is attributable to T) are carried over to Year 3.


(*3*) The P group's ability to deduct net operating losses in Year 2 is subject to the 80-percent limitation, based on the P group's consolidated taxable income for the year. Thus, the group's limitation for Year 2 is $72 ($90 × 80 percent). However, use of the Year 1 net operating loss also is subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T applicable to SRLY net operating losses for Year 2 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $60. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 2 is $48 ($60 × 80 percent). Therefore, only $48 of T's Year 1 SRLY net operating loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 2. T carries over its remaining $52 of its Year 1 loss to Year 3.


(*4*) After deduction of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 2, the net operating loss cumulative register is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. The P group deducted $48 of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 2. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of taxable income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 × 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the net operating loss cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the net operating loss cumulative register ($60−$60).


(*5*) For Year 3, the P group again computes separate SRLY limits for each of T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group has consolidated net capital gain (without taking into account a net capital loss carryover deduction) of $30. Under § 1.1502-22(c), the aggregate amount of T's $50 capital loss carryover from Year 1 that is included in computing the P group's consolidated net capital gain for all years of the group (in this case, Years 2 and 3) may not exceed $30 (the aggregate consolidated net capital gain computed by reference only to T's items, including losses and deductions actually absorbed (that is, $30 of capital gain in Year 3)). Thus, the P group may include $30 of T's Year 1 capital loss carryover in its computation of consolidated net capital gain for Year 3, which offsets the group's capital gains for Year 3. T carries over its remaining $20 of its Year 1 capital loss to Year 4. Therefore, the capital loss cumulative register of T is decreased by $30, and zero remains in the capital loss cumulative register ($30−$30). Further, because the net operating loss cumulative register includes all taxable income of T included in the P group, as well as all absorbed losses of T (including capital items), a zero net increase occurs in the net operating loss cumulative register. The P group carries over the Year 2 consolidated net capital loss to Year 4.


(*6*) The P group's ability to deduct net operating losses in Year 3 is subject to the 80-percent limitation, based on the P group's consolidated taxable income for the year. Thus, the P group's taxable income for Year 3 that can be offset, before use of net operating losses, is $40 (80 percent × the sum of zero capital gain, after use of the capital loss carryover, plus $50 of ordinary income). However, use of the Year 1 net operating loss also is subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T applicable to SRLY net operating losses for Year 3 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference only to T's items, or $40. This amount equals the sum obtained by adding the zero carryover from Year 2, a net inclusion of zero from capital items implicated in Year 3 ($30−$30), and $40 of taxable income in Year 3. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 3 is $32 ($40 × 80 percent). Therefore, only $32 of the Year 1 net operating loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 3. T carries over its remaining $20 of its Year 1 loss to Year 4.


(F) *Example 6: Pre-2018 NOLs and post-2017 NOLs.* (*1*) Individual A owns P. On January 1, 2017, A forms T. P and T are calendar-year taxpayers. In 2017, T sustains a $100 net operating loss that is carried over. During 2018, 2019, and 2020, T deducts a total of $90 of its 2017 net operating loss against its taxable income, and T carries over the remaining $10 of its 2017 net operating loss. In 2021, T sustains a net operating loss of $50. On December 31, 2021, P acquires all the stock of T, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $300 of consolidated taxable income in 2022 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items. The P group has no other SRLY net operating loss carryovers or CNOL carryovers.


(*2*) T's remaining $10 of net operating loss carryover from 2017 and its $50 net operating loss carryover from 2021 are both SRLY losses in the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's net operating loss carryovers are subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The SRLY limitation for the P group's 2022 consolidated return year is consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's $70 of items.


(*3*) Because T's oldest (2017) carryover was sustained in a year beginning before January 1, 2018, its use is not subject to limitation under section 172(a)(2)(B). Therefore, all $10 of T's 2017 SRLY net operating loss (that is, a pre-2018 NOL) is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for 2022. After deduction of T's $10 SRLY net operating loss from 2017, the cumulative register of T is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $10, and $60 remains in the cumulative register ($70−$10).


(*4*) The P group's deduction of T's 2021 net operating loss is subject to both a SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation under section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii). Therefore, the total limitation on the use of T's 2021 net operating loss in the P group is $48 (the remaining cumulative register of $60 × 80 percent). No losses from equivalent years are available, and the P group otherwise has sufficient consolidated taxable income to support the CNOL deduction ($290 × 80 percent = $232). Therefore, $48 of T's 2021 SRLY net operating loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for 2022. The remaining $2 of T's 2021 SRLY net operating loss ($50−$48) is carried over to the P group's 2023 consolidated return year.


(*5*) After deduction of T's $48 SRLY NOL in 2022, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 × 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($60−$60).


(2) *SRLY subgroup limitation.* In the case of a net operating loss carryover or carryback for which there is a SRLY subgroup, the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. Thus, the contribution to consolidated taxable income and the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section are based on the aggregate amounts of income, gain, deduction, and loss of the members of the SRLY subgroup for the relevant consolidated return years (as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section). For an illustration of aggregate amounts during the relevant consolidated return years following the year in which a member of a SRLY subgroup ceases to be a member of the group, see paragraph (c)(2)(viii) *Example 4* of this section. A SRLY subgroup may exist only for a carryover or carryback arising in a year that is not a SRLY (and is not treated as a SRLY under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) with respect to another group (the former group), whether or not the group is a consolidated group, or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group). A separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each such carryover or carryback. A consolidated group may include more than one SRLY subgroup, and a member may be a member of more than one SRLY subgroup. Solely for purposes of determining the members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to a loss:


(i) *Carryovers.* In the case of a carryover, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member carrying over the loss (the loss member) and each other member that was a member of the former group that becomes a member of the group at the same time as the loss member. A member remains a member of the SRLY subgroup until it ceases to be affiliated with the loss member. The aggregate determination described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and this paragraph (c)(2) includes the amounts of income, gain, deduction, and loss of each member of the SRLY subgroup for the consolidated return years during which it remains a member of the SRLY subgroup. For an illustration of the aggregate determination of a SRLY subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(viii) *Example 2* of this section.


(ii) *Carrybacks.* In the case of a carryback, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member carrying back the loss (the loss member) and each other member of the group from which the loss is carried back that has been continuously affiliated with the loss member from the year to which the loss is carried through the year in which the loss arises.


(iii) *Built-in losses.* In the case of a built-in loss, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member recognizing the loss (the loss member) and each other member that was part of the subgroup with respect to the loss determined under § 1.1502-15(c)(2) immediately before the members became members of the group. The principles of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to determine the SRLY subgroup for the built-in loss that is, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, treated as arising in a SRLY with respect to the group in which the loss is recognized. For this purpose and as the context requires, a reference in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to a group or former group is a reference to the subgroup determined under § 1.1502-15(c)(2).


(iv) *Principal purpose of avoiding or increasing a SRLY limitation.* The members composing a SRLY subgroup are not treated as a SRLY subgroup if any of them is formed, acquired, or availed of with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of, or increasing any limitation under, this paragraph (c). Any member excluded from a SRLY subgroup, if excluded with a principal purpose of so avoiding or increasing any SRLY limitation, is treated as included in the SRLY subgroup.


(v) *Coordination with other limitations.* This paragraph (c)(2) does not allow a net operating loss to offset income to the extent inconsistent with other limitations or restrictions on the use of losses, such as a limitation based on the nature or activities of members. For example, a net operating loss may not offset income in excess of any limitations under section 172(a) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Additionally, any dual consolidated loss may not reduce the taxable income to an extent greater than that allowed under section 1503(d) and §§ 1.1503(d)-1 through 1.1503(d)-8. See also § 1.1502-47(k) (relating to preemption of rules for life-nonlife groups).


(vi) *Anti-duplication.* If the same item of income or deduction could be taken into account more than once in determining a limitation under this paragraph (c), or in a manner inconsistent with any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations incorporating this paragraph (c), the item of income or deduction is taken into account only once and in such manner that losses are absorbed in accordance with the ordering rules in paragraph (b) of this section and the underlying purposes of this section.


(vii) *Corporations that leave a SRLY subgroup.* If a loss member ceases to be affiliated with a SRLY subgroup, the amount of the member's remaining SRLY loss from a specific year is determined pursuant to the principles of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(iv) of this section.


(viii) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (c)(2)(viii), no corporation is a nonlife insurance company or has any farming losses. The principles of this paragraph (c)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1: Members of SRLY subgroups.* (*1*) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, S, T and M. P and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. During Year 1, P sustains a $50 net operating loss. At the beginning of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S at a time when the aggregate basis of S's assets exceeds their aggregate value by $70, and S becomes a member of the P group. At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T, T has a $60 net operating loss carryover at the time of the acquisition, and T becomes a member of the P group. During Year 4, S forms S1 and T forms T1, each by contributing assets with built-in gains which are, in the aggregate, material. S1 and T1 become members of the P group. During Year 7, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the members of the P group become members of the M group for the balance of Year 7. The $50 and $60 loss carryovers of P and T are carried to Year 7 of the M group, and the value and basis of S's assets did not change after it became a member of the former P group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).


(*2*) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each loss carryover and built-in loss. In the P group, P's $50 loss carryover is not treated as arising in a SRLY. See § 1.1502-1(f). Consequently, the carryover is not subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section in the P group.


(*3*) In the M group, P's $50 loss carryover is treated as arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. A SRLY subgroup with respect to that loss is composed of members which were members of the P group, the group as to which the loss was not a SRLY. The SRLY subgroup is composed of P, the member carrying over the loss, and each other member of the P group that became a member of the M group at the same time as P. A member of the SRLY subgroup remains a member until it ceases to be affiliated with P. For Year 7, the SRLY subgroup is composed of P, S, T, S1, and T1.


(*4*) In the P group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the P group, is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. See § 1.1502-15 and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Because S was not continuously affiliated with P, T, or T1 for 60 consecutive months prior to joining the P group, these corporations cannot be included in a SRLY subgroup with respect to S's unrealized loss in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. As a successor to S, S1 is included in a subgroup with S in the P group, and, because 100 percent of S1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that may be offset by the built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.


(*5*) In the M group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the M group, is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. Prior to becoming a member of the M group, S had been continuously affiliated with P (but not T or T1) for 60 consecutive months, and S1 is a successor that has remained continuously affiliated with S. Those members had a net unrealized built-in loss immediately before they became members of the group under § 1.1502-15(c). Consequently, in Year 7, S, S1, and P compose a subgroup in the M group with respect to S's unrealized loss. Because S1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when it became a member of the M group and also because 100 percent of S1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the M group that may be offset by the recognized built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.


(*6*) In the P group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. P, S, and S1 were not members of the group in which T's loss arose, and T's loss carryover was not subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section with respect to the P group (the former group). Thus, P, S, and S1 are not members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the T carryover in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. As a successor to T, T1 is included in a SRLY subgroup with T in the P group, and, because 100 percent of T1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that may be offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of this section.


(*7*) In the M group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. T and T1 remain the only members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the carryover. Because T1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when it became a member of the M group and also because 100 percent of T1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the M group that may be offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of this section.


(B) *Example 2: Computation of SRLY subgroup limitation.* (*1*) Individual A owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M, none of which is a nonlife insurance company. P and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S and T from Individual A, and S and T become members of the P group. For Year 3 (a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020), the P group has a $45 CNOL, which is attributable to P, and which P carries forward. M is the common parent of another group. At the beginning of Year 4, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former members of the P group become members of the M group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).


(*2*) P's year to which the loss is attributable, Year 3, is a SRLY with respect to the M group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(1). However, P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to the Year 3 loss under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section because Year 3 is not a SRLY (and is not treated as a SRLY) with respect to the P group. P's loss is carried over to the M group's Year 4 and is therefore subject to the SRLY subgroup limitation in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(*3*) In Year 4, the M group has $10 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 4). That consolidated taxable income would be $45 if determined by reference only to the items of P, S, and T, the members included in the SRLY subgroup with respect to P's loss carryover. Therefore, the positive balance of the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup for Year 4 equals $45 and, due to the application of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the SRLY subgroup limitation under this paragraph (c)(2) is $36 ($45 × 80 percent). However, the M group has only $10 of consolidated taxable income in Year 4. Thus, due to the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the M group's deduction of all net operating losses in Year 4 is limited to $8 ($10 × 80 percent). As a result, the M group deducts $8 of P's SRLY net operating loss carryover, and the remaining $37 is carried over to Year 5.


(*4*) After deduction of $8 of P's SRLY net operating loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $10 ($10 × 80 percent = $8). Therefore, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is decreased by $10, and $35 remains in the cumulative register ($45−$10).


(*5*) In Year 5, the M group has $100 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 5). None of P, S, or T has any items of income, gain, deduction, or loss in Year 5. Although the members of the P SRLY subgroup do not contribute to the $100 of consolidated taxable income in Year 5, the positive balance of the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup for Year 5 is $35 and, due to the application of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the SRLY subgroup limitation under this paragraph (c)(2) is $28 ($35 × 80 percent). Because of the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the M group's deduction of net operating losses in Year 5 is limited to $80 ($100 × 80 percent). Because the $28 of net operating loss available to be absorbed is less than 80 percent of the M group's consolidated taxable income, $28 of P's SRLY net operating loss is absorbed in Year 5, and the remaining $9 ($37−$28) is carried over to Year 6.


(*6*) After deduction of $28 of P's SRLY net operating loss in Year 5, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $35 ($35 × 80 percent = $28). Therefore, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is decreased by $35, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($35−$35).


(C) *Example 3: Inclusion in more than one SRLY subgroup.* (*1*) Individual A owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M. S, P, and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. At the beginning of Year 1, S acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the S group. For Year 1, the S group has a CNOL of $10, all of which is attributable to S and is carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S, and S and T become members of the P group. For Year 2, the P group has a CNOL of $35, all of which is attributable to P and is carried over to Year 3. At the beginning of Year 3, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former members of the P group become members of the M group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).


(*2*) P's and S's net operating losses arising in SRLYs with respect to the M group are subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup for purposes of determining the limitation for P's $35 net operating loss carryover arising in Year 2 because, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, Year 2 is not a SRLY with respect to the P group. Similarly, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup for purposes of determining the limitation for S's $10 net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 because Year 1 is not a SRLY with respect to the S group.


(*3*) S and T are members of both the SRLY subgroup with respect to P's losses and the SRLY subgroup with respect to S's losses. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, S's and T's items cannot be included in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for both SRLY subgroups for the same consolidated return year; paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section requires the M group to consider the items of S and T only once so that the losses are absorbed in the order of the taxable years in which they were sustained. Because S's loss was incurred in Year 1, while P's loss was incurred in Year 2, the items will be added in the determination of the consolidated taxable income of the S and T SRLY subgroup to enable S's loss to be absorbed first. The taxable income of the P, S, and T SRLY subgroup is then computed by including the consolidated taxable income for the S and T SRLY subgroup less the amount of any net operating loss carryover of S that is absorbed after applying this section to the S subgroup for the year.


(D) *Example 4: Corporation ceases to be affiliated with a SRLY subgroup.* (*1*) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, and M. P and S are members of the P group and the P group has a CNOL of $30 in Year 1, all of which is attributable to P and carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of Year 2, M acquires all of the stock of P, and P and S become members of the M group. P and S compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to P's net operating loss carryover. For Year 2, consolidated taxable income of the M group determined by reference to only the items of P (and without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 2) is $40. However, such consolidated taxable income of the M group determined by reference to the items of both P and S is a loss of $20. Thus, the SRLY subgroup limitation under paragraph (c)(2) of this section prevents the M group from including any of P's net operating loss carryover in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 2, and P carries the Year 1 loss to Year 3.


(*2*) At the end of Year 2, P sells all of the S stock, and S ceases to be a member of the M group and the P subgroup. For Year 3, consolidated taxable income of the M group is $50 (determined without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 3), and such consolidated taxable income would be $10 if determined by reference to only items of P. However, the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section for Year 3 for P's net operating loss carryover still prevents the M group from including any of P's loss in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section. The limitation results from the inclusion of S's items for Year 2 in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for Year 3 even though S ceased to be a member of the M group (and the P subgroup) at the end of Year 2. Thus, the M group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only the SRLY subgroup members' items for all consolidated return years of the group through Year 3 (determined without regard to the CNOL deduction) is not a positive amount.


(ix) *Application to other than loss carryovers.* Paragraph (g) of this section and the phrase “or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)” in this paragraph (c)(2) apply only to carryovers of net operating losses, net capital losses, and for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, to carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2). Accordingly, as the context may require, if another regulation references this section and such other regulation does not concern a carryover of net operating losses, net capital losses, or for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2), then such reference does not include a reference to such paragraph or phrase. 


(3) *Cross-reference.* For rules governing the application of a SRLY limitation to business interest expense for which a deduction is disallowed under section 163(j), see § 1.163(j)-5(d) and (f).


(d) [Reserved]




(e) *Consolidated net operating loss.* Any excess of deductions over gross income, as determined under § 1.1502-11(a) (without regard to any consolidated net operating loss deduction), is also referred to as the consolidated net operating loss (or CNOL).


(f) *Predecessors and successors*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of this section, any reference to a corporation, member, common parent, or subsidiary, includes, as the context may require, a reference to a successor or predecessor, as defined in § 1.1502-1(f)(4).


(2) *Limitation on SRLY subgroups*—(i) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, if a successor's items of income and gain exceed the successor's items of deduction and loss (net positive income), then the net positive income attributable to the successor is excluded from the computation of the consolidated taxable income of a SRLY subgroup.


(ii) *Exceptions.* A successor's net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of a SRLY subgroup if—


(A) The successor acquires substantially all the assets and liabilities of its predecessor, and the predecessor ceases to exist;


(B) The successor was a member of the SRLY subgroup when the SRLY subgroup members became members of the group;


(C) 100 percent of the stock of the successor is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the SRLY subgroup members became members of the group; or


(D) The Commissioner so determines.


(g) *Overlap with section 382*—(1) *General rule.* The limitation provided in paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to net operating loss carryovers (other than a hypothetical carryover described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section and a carryover described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) when the application of paragraph (c) of this section results in an overlap with the application of section 382. For a similar rule applying in the case of net operating loss carryovers described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(D) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, see § 1.1502-15(g).


(2) *Definitions*—(i) *Generally.* For purposes of this paragraph (g), the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382, the regulations thereunder, and §§ 1.1502-90 through 1.1502-99 apply.


(ii) *Overlap.* (A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of this section and the application of section 382 with respect to a net operating loss carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to that carryover (the section 382 event).


(B) If an overlap described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section occurs with respect to net operating loss carryovers of a corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period beginning on the date of a section 382 event, then an overlap is treated as also occurring with respect to that corporation's net operating loss carryover that arises within the period beginning with the section 382 event and ending with the SRLY event.


(C) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup and/or a loss subgroup as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect to a carryover, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.


(3) *Operating rules*—(i) *Section 382 event before SRLY event.* If a SRLY event occurs on the same date as a section 382 event or within the six month period beginning on the date of the section 382 event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies beginning with the tax year that includes the SRLY event.


(ii) *SRLY event before section 382 event.* If a section 382 event occurs within the period beginning the day after the SRLY event and ending six months after the SRLY event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies starting with the first tax year that begins after the section 382 event.


(4) *Subgroup rules.* In general, in the case of a net operating loss carryover for which there is a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(1)), the principles of this paragraph (g) apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies—


(i) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section only if—


(A) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover are also included in a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover; and


(B) All members of a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover; and


(ii) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section only if all members of the SRLY subgroup for that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup that has net operating loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that are subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(5) *Examples.* The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples: 


(i) *Example 1: Overlap—Simultaneous Acquisition.* (A) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, which in turn owns all of the stock of S. P and S file a consolidated return. In Year 2, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T which incurs a $100 net operating loss for that year. At the beginning of Year 3, S acquires T.


(B) S's acquisition of T results in T becoming a member of the P group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of T, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to the T carryover.


(C) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382.


(D) Consequently, under this paragraph (g), in Year 3 the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 2 $100 net operating loss.


(ii) *Example 2: Overlap—Section 382 event before SRLY event.* (A) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, which in turn owns all of the stock of S. P and S file a consolidated return. In Year 1, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T which incurs a $100 net operating loss for that year. On February 28 of Year 2, S purchases 55% of T from Individual B. On June 30, of Year 2, S purchases an additional 35% of T from Individual B.


(B) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover. The June 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.


(C) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382.


(D) Consequently, under paragraph (g) of this section, in Year 2 the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 1 $100 net operating loss.


(iii) *Example 3: No overlap—Section 382 event before SRLY event.* (A) The facts are the same as in *Example 2* except that Individual B does not sell the additional 35% of T to S until September 30, Year 2.


(B) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover. The September 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.


(C) Because the SRLY event did not occur within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is no overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382. Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to a SRLY limitation and a section 382 limitation.


(iv) *Example 4: Overlap—SRLY event before section 382 event.* (A) P and S file a consolidated return. S has owned 40% of T for 6 years. For Year 6, T has a net operating loss of $500 that is carried forward. On March 31, Year 7, S acquires an additional 40% of T, and on August 31, Year 7, S acquires the remaining 20% of T.


(B) The March 31 purchase of 40% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event. The August 31 purchase of 20% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover.


(C) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of this paragraph (g).


(D) Under this paragraph (g), the SRLY rules of paragraph (c) of this section will apply to the Year 7 tax year. Beginning in Year 8 (the year after the section 382 event), any unabsorbed portion of the Year 6 net operating loss will not be subject to a SRLY limitation.


(v) *Example 5: Overlap—Coextensive subgroups.* (A) Individual A owns all of the stock of S, which in turn owns all of the stock of T. S and T file a consolidated return beginning in Year 1. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 2, the S group has a $200 consolidated net operating loss which is carried forward, of which $100 is attributable to S, and $100 is attributable to T. At the beginning of Year 3, the P group acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A.


(B) P's acquisition of S results in S and T becoming members of the P group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 2 net operating loss carryover, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(C) S and T also compose a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect to the Year 2 net operating loss carryover. P's acquisition also results in an ownership change of S, the subgroup parent, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to the Year 2 carryover.


(D) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section. Because the SRLY subgroup and the loss subgroup are coextensive, under paragraph (g) of this section, the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 2 $200 net operating loss.


(vi) *Example 6: No overlap—Different subgroups.* (A) Individual B owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. P owns all of the stock of S and all of the stock of T. Individual A owns all of the stock of X, the common parent of another consolidated group. In Year 1, the P group has a $200 consolidated net operating loss, of which $100 is attributable to S and $100 is attributable to T. At the beginning of Year 3, the X group acquires all of the stock of S and T from P and does not make an election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4) (concerning an election to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as having been satisfied).


(B) X's acquisition of S and T results in S and T becoming members of the X group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(C) S and T do not bear (and are not treated as bearing) a section 1504(a)(1) relationship. Therefore S and T do not qualify as a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1). X's acquisition of S and T results in separate ownership changes of S and T, that give rise to separate limitations under section 382(a) (the section 382 events) with respect to each of S and T's Year 1 net operating loss carryovers. See § 1.1502-94.


(D) The SRLY event and the change dates of the section 382 events occur on the same date. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply because the SRLY subgroup (composed of S and T) is not coextensive with a loss subgroup with respect to the Year 1 carryovers. Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to both a SRLY subgroup limitation and also separate section 382 limitations for each of S and T.


(vii) *Example 7: No overlap—Different subgroups.* (A) Individual A owns all of the stock of T and all of the stock of S, the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of another consolidated group. In Year 1, T has a net operating loss of $100 that is carried forward. At the end of Year 2, S acquires all of the stock of T from Individual A. In Year 3, the S group sustains a $200 consolidated net operating loss that is carried forward. In Year 8, the P group acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A.


(B) S's acquisition of T in Year 1 results in T becoming a member of the S group. The acquisition, however, did not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). As a result, T's Year 1 net operating loss is subject to SRLY within the S group. At the end of Year 7, § 1.1502-96(a) treats T's Year 1 net operating loss as not having arisen in a SRLY with respect to the S group. Section 1.1502-96(a), however, applies only for purposes of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and § 1.1502-98 but not for purposes of this section. See § 1.1502-96(a)(5).


(C) P's acquisition of S in Year 8 results in S and T becoming members of the P group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T do not compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(D) S and T compose a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover. P's acquisition of S results in an ownership change of the loss subgroup, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a subgroup limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to that carryover.


(E) The SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date. However, under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, because the SRLY subgroup and the loss subgroup are not coextensive, T's Year 1 net operating loss carryover is subject to a SRLY limitation.


(F) With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss carryover, S and T compose both a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1). Thus, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies, and the S group's Year 3 net operating loss carryover is not subject to a SRLY limitation.


(viii) *Example 8: SRLY after overlap.* (A) Individual A owns all of the stock of R and M, each the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of D. In Year 1, D incurs a $100 net operating loss that is carried forward. At the beginning of Year 3, R acquires all of the stock of D. In Year 5, M acquires all of the stock of R in a transaction that did not result in an ownership change of R.


(B) R's Year 3 acquisition of D results in D becoming a member of the R group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of D, that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to D's net operating loss carryover.


(C) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of this section and section 382 with respect to D's net operating loss. Consequently, under this paragraph (g), D's Year 1 $100 net operating loss is not subject to a SRLY limitation in the R group.


(D) M's Year 5 acquisition of R results in R and D becoming members of the M group (the SRLY event), but does not result in an ownership change of R or D that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a). Because there is no section 382 event, the application of the SRLY rules and section 382 do not overlap. Consequently, D's Year 1 $100 net operating loss is subject to a SRLY limitation in the M group.


(E) Because D's Year 1 net operating loss carryover was subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g) of this section when it joined the R group, under § 1.1502-21(c)(2), the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover includes all of the members of the R group that joined the M group at the same time as D.


(ix) *Example 9: Overlap—Interim losses.* (A) Individual A owns all of the stock of P and S, each the common parent of a consolidated group. S owns all of the stock of T, its only subsidiary. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of M, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 1, the S group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss. On January 1 of Year 2, P acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A. On December 31 of Year 2, M acquires 51% of the stock of P from Individual A. On May 31 of Year 3, M acquires the remaining 49% of the stock of P from Individual A. The P group, for the Year 3 period prior to June 1, had a $50 consolidated net operating loss, and under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable entirely to S. Other than the losses described above, the P group does not have any other consolidated net operating losses.


(B) In the P group, S's $100 loss carryover is treated as arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. A SRLY subgroup with respect to that loss is composed of S and T, the members which were members of the S group as to which the loss was not a SRLY.


(C) M's December 31 purchase of 51% of P is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of the S loss subgroup that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation (the section 382 event) with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover. The purchase, however, does not result in an ownership change of P because it is not a loss corporation under section 382(k)(1). M's May 31 purchase of 49% of P results in P, S, and T becoming members of the M group and is therefore a SRLY event.


(D) With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1). The loss subgroup does not include P because the only loss at the time of the section 382 event was subject to SRLY with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-91(d)(1).


(E) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the change date of the section 382 event and the SRLY subgroup and loss subgroup are coextensive with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section. Thus, the SRLY limitation does not apply to that carryover.


(F) The Year 3 net operating loss, which arose between the section 382 event and the SRLY event, is a net operating loss described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because it is the net operating loss of a corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period beginning on the date of a section 382 event.


(G) With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss, P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Because P, a member of the SRLY subgroup for the Year 3 carryover, is not also a member of a SRLY subgroup that has net operating loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the Year 1 net operating loss), the Year 3 carryover is subject to a SRLY limitation in the M group. See paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.


(h) *Effective/applicability date*—(1) *In general.* This section generally applies to taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999. However—


(i) In the event that paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to a particular net operating loss carryover in the current group, then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (c) of this section to determine a limitation with respect to that carryover and with respect to which the SRLY register (consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only the member's or subgroup's items of income, gain, deduction, or loss) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return was on or before June 25, 1999, paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be applied without regard to the phrase “or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)”; and


(ii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, only an ownership change to which section 382(a), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, applies shall constitute a section 382 event.


(iii) Paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section apply to taxable years for which the due date of the original return (without regard to extensions) is on or after September 17, 2008.


(2) *SRLY limitation.* Except in the case of those members (including members of a SRLY subgroup) described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, a group does not take into account a consolidated taxable year beginning before January 1, 1997, in determining the aggregate of the consolidated taxable income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (including for purposes of § 1.1502-15 and § 1.1502-22(c)) for the members (or SRLY subgroups).


(3) *Prior retroactive election.* A consolidated group that applied the rules of § 1.1502-21T(g)(3) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, to all consolidated return years ending on or after January 29, 1991, and beginning before January 1, 1997, does not take into account a consolidated taxable year beginning before January 29, 1991, in determining the aggregate of the consolidated taxable income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (including for purposes of § 1.1502-15 and § 1.1502-22(c)) for the members (or SRLY subgroups).


(4) *Offspring rule.* Paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section applies to net operating losses arising in taxable years ending on or after June 25, 1999.


(5) *Waiver of carrybacks.* Paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relating to the waiver of carrybacks for acquired members) applies to acquisitions occurring after June 25, 1999.


(6) *Certain prior periods.* Paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2)(iv)(A), (b)(2)(iv)(B)(1), and (c)(2)(vii) of this section apply to taxable years for which the due date of the original return (without regard to extensions) is after March 21, 2005.




(7) *Prior periods.* For certain taxable years ending on or before June 25, 1999, see § 1.1502-21T in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable.


(8) *Losses treated as expired under § 1.1502-35(f)(1).* For rules regarding losses treated as expired under § 1.1502-35(f) on or after March 10, 2006, *see* § 1.1502-21(b)(3)(v) as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.






(9) *Amended carryback rules.* Paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this section apply to any CNOLs arising in a taxable year ending after July 2, 2020. However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this section to any CNOLs arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017.




(10) The rules of paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(2)(iv), and (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020.
