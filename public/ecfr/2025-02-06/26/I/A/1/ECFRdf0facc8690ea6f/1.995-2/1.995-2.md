# § 1.995-2   Deemed distributions in qualified years.

(a) *General rule.* Under section 995 (b)(1), each shareholder of a DISC shall be treated as having received a distribution taxable as a dividend with respect to his stock on the last day of each taxable year of the DISC, in an amount which is equal to his pro rata share of the sum (as limited by paragraph (b) of this section), of the following seven items:


(1) An amount equal to the gross interest derived by the DISC during such year from producer's loans (as defined in § 1.993-4).


(2) An amount equal to the lower of—


(i) Any gain recognized by the DISC during such year on the sale or exchange of property (other than property which in the hands of the DISC is a qualified export asset) which was previously transferred to it in a transaction in which the transferor realized gain which was not recognized in whole or in part, or


(ii) The amount of the transferor's gain which was not recognized on the previous transfer of the property to the DISC.


(3) An amount equal to the lower of—


(i) Any gain recognized by the DISC during such year on the sale or exchange of property which in the hands of the DISC is a qualified export asset (other than stock in trade or property described in section 1221(1)) and which was previously transferred to the DISC in a transaction in which the transferor realized gain which was not recognized in whole or in part, or


(ii) The amount of the transferor's gain which was not recognized on the previous transfer of the property to the DISC and which would have been includible in the transferor's gross income as ordinary income if its entire realized gain had been recognized upon the transfer.


(4) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, an amount equal to 50 percent of the taxable income of the DISC for the taxable years attributable to military property (as defined in § 1.995-6).


(5) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, the taxable income for the taxable year attributable to base period export gross receipts (as defined in § 1.995-7).


(6) The sum of—


(i)(A) In the case of a corporate share holder, an amount equal to 57.5 percent of the excess (if any) (one-half for DISCs' taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983) of the taxable income of the DISC for such year (computed as provided in § 1.991-1(b)(1)) over the sum of the amounts deemed distributed for the taxable year in accordance with subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this paragraph, or


(B) In the case of a non-corporate share holder, an amount equal to one-half of the excess (if any) of the taxable income of the DISC for such year (computed as provided in § 1.991-1(b)(1)) over the sum of the amounts deemed distributed for the taxable year in accordance with subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph.


(ii)(A) An amount equal to the amount under subdivision (i) of paragraph (a)(6) of this section multiplied by the international boycott factor as determined under section 999 (c)(1) , or


(B) In lieu of the amount determined under subdivision (ii)(A) of paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the amount described under section 999 (c)(2) of such international boycott income, and


(iii) An amount equal to the sum of any illegal bribes, kickbacks, or other payments paid by or on behalf of the DISC directly or indirectly to an official, employee, or agent in fact of a government. An amount is paid by a DISC where it is paid by any officer, director, employee, shareholder, or agent of the DISC for the benefit of such DISC. For purposes of this section, the principles of section 162 (c) and the regulations thereunder shall apply. The fair market value of an illegal payment made in the form of property or services shall be considered the amount of such illegal payment.


(7) The amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of the DISC, as of the close of the “group taxable year” ending with such taxable year of the DISC, determined in accordance with § 1.995-5. The amount of such foreign investment attributable to producer's loans so determined for any taxable year of a former DISC shall be deemed distributed as a dividend to the shareholders of such former DISC on the last day of such taxable year. See § 1.995-3(e) for the effect that such deemed distribution has on scheduled installments of deemed distributions of accumulated DISC income under § 1.995-3(a) upon disqualification.


(b) *Limitation on amount of deemed distributions under section 995(b)(1).* (1) The sum of the amounts described in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section which is deemed distributed pro rata to the DISC's shareholders a dividend for any taxable year of the corporation shall not exceed the DISC's earnings and profits for such year.


(2) The amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of the DISC (as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section) which is deemed to be distributed pro rata to the DISC's shareholders as dividends for any taxable year of the corporation shall not exceed the lower of the corporation's accumulated DISC income at the beginning of such year or the corporation's accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of such year (but not less than zero)—


(i) Increased by any DISC income of the corporation for such year as defined in § 1.996-3(b)(2) (*i.e.,* any excess of the DISC's earnings and profits for such year over the sum of the amounts described in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section), or


(ii) Decreased by any deficit in the corporation's earnings and profits for such year.


(3) If, by reason of the limitation in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, less than the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section is deemed distributed, then the portion of such sum which is deemed distributed shall be attributed first to the amount described in subparagraph (1) of such paragraph, to the extent thereof; second to the amount described in subparagraph (2) of such paragraph, to the extent thereof; third to the amount described in subparagraph (3) of such paragraph, to the extent thereof; and so forth, and finally to the amount described in paragraph (b)(6) of this paragraph.


(c) *Examples.* Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Special rules for certain tax-free acquisitions of property by the DISC.* (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (3)(i) of this section, if—


(i) A DISC acquires property in a first transaction and in a second transaction it disposes of such property in exchange for other property, and


(ii) By reason of the application of section 1031 (relating to like-kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), the basis in the DISC's hands of the other property acquired in such second transaction is determined in whole or in part with reference to the basis of the property acquired in the first transaction,


(2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (3)(i) of this section, if a DISC acquires property in a first transaction and it transfers such property to a transferee DISC in a second transaction in which the transferor DISC's gain is not recognized in whole or in part, then such property shall be treated as though it had been transferred to the transferee DISC in the same manner in which it was acquired in the first transaction by the transferor DISC. For example, if X and Y both qualify as DISC's and X transfers property to Y in a second transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized, paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section does not apply to a sale of such property by Y in a third transaction if X had acquired the property in a first transaction by a purchase for cash. If, however, X acquired the property from a transferor other than a DISC in the first transaction in which the transferor's realized gain was not recognized, then paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section may apply to the sale by Y if the other conditions of such paragraph (a)(2) or (3) are met.


(3) If a DISC acquires property in a second transaction described in subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph in which it (or, in the case of a second transaction described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the transferor DISC) recognizes a portion (but not all) of the realized gain, then the amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to a disposition by the DISC of such acquired property in a third transaction shall not exceed the transferor's gain which was not recognized on the first transaction minus the amount of gain recognized by the DISC (or transferor DISC) on the second transaction.


(4) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(e) *Carry back of net operating loss and capital loss to prior DISC taxable year.* For purposes of sections 991, 995, and 996, the amount of the deduction for the taxable year under section 172 for a net operating loss carryback or carryover or under section 1212 for a capital loss carryback or carryover shall be determined in the same manner as if the DISC were a domestic corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Thus, the amount of the deduction will be the same whether or not the corporation was a DISC in the year of the loss or in the year to which the loss is carried. For provisions setting forth adjustments to the DISC's, or former DISC's, deemed distributions, adjustments to its divisions of earnings and profits, and other tax consequences arising from such carrybacks, see § 1.996-8.
