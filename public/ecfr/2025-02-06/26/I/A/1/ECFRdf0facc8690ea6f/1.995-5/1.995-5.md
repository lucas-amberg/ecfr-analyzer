# § 1.995-5   Foreign investment attributable to producer's loans.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Limitation.* Under section 995(d), the amount as of the close of a “group taxable year” (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of a DISC for purposes of section 995(b)(1)(G) shall be the excess (as of the close of such year) of—


(i) The smallest of—


(*a*) The amount of the net increase in foreign assets (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) by domestic and foreign members of the controlled group which includes the DISC,


(*b*) The amount of the actual foreign investment by the domestic members of such group (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section), or


(*c*) The amount of outstanding producer's loans (as determined under § 1.993-4) by such DISC to members of such controlled group, over


(ii) The amount (determined under § 1.995-2 (a)(5) and (b)(2)) of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans treated under section 995(b)(1)(G) as deemed distributions by the particular DISC taxable as dividends for prior taxable years of that particular DISC.


(2) *Controlled group; domestic and foreign member.* For purposes of this section—


(i) The term “controlled group” has the meaning assigned to such term by § 1.993-1(k).


(ii) The term *domestic member* means a domestic corporation which is a member of a controlled group, and the term *foreign member* means a foreign corporation which is a member of a controlled group.


(3) *Group taxable year.* (i) The term *group taxable year* refers collectively to the taxable year of the DISC and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the taxable year of the DISC. Thus, for example, if a corporation has a subsidiary which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and which elects to be treated as a DISC, and if the parent has a taxable year ending on October 31, the “group taxable year” for 1973 would refer to calendar year 1973 for the DISC and to the parent's taxable year ending October 31, 1973.


(ii) In cases in which the DISC makes a return for a short taxable year, that is, for a taxable year consisting of a period of less than 12 months, pursuant to section 443 and the regulations thereunder, or § 1.991-1(b)(3), the following rules shall apply—


(*a*) In the case of a change in the annual accounting period of the DISC resulting in a short taxable year, the *group taxable year* refers collectively to the short taxable year and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the short taxable year.


(*b*) In the case of a DISC which is in existence during only part of what would otherwise be its taxable year, the *group taxable year* refers collectively to the short period during which the DISC was in existence and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the 12-month period ending on the last day of the short period.


(iii) With respect to periods prior to the first taxable year for which a member of the group qualified (or is treated) as a DISC, each group taxable year shall be determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as if such member was in existence, it qualified as a DISC, and its taxable year ended on that date corresponding to the date such member's first taxable year ended after it qualified (or is treated) as a DISC whether or not the corporation which qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC used the same taxable year before it so qualified (or is so treated). Thus, for example, if a corporation which is organized on March 3, 1975, uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and is a member of a controlled group which does not include a DISC, first qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC for calendar year 1975, then the term “group taxable year” with respect to years prior to 1975 refers collectively to such prior calendar years and to the taxable year of each corporation in the group ending with or within such prior calendar years.


(iv) For special rules in the case of a group which includes more than one DISC, see paragraph (g) of this section.


(4) *Amounts determined for prior years.* Unless the 3-year limitation is properly elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, the amounts described in paragraphs (b) (relating to net increase in foreign assets) and (c) (relating to actual foreign investments by domestic members) of this section reflect, as of the close of a group taxable year, amounts for all taxable years of members of the group beginning after December 31, 1971 (and amounts arising after December 31, 1971, or such other date prescribed in paragraph (b)(7) of this section), provided that such amounts relate to such group taxable year and preceding group taxable years. Thus, for example, if all members of a controlled group use the calendar year as the taxable year, and 1980 is the first taxable year for which any member of the group qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC, then, unless the 3-year limitation is elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, the amounts described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will be taken into account beginning with the dates specified in the preceding sentence. For rules as to carryovers on certain corporate acquisitions and reorganizations, see paragraph (d) of this section.


(5) *Three-year elective limitation.* (i) A DISC may elect to take into account only amounts described in paragraphs (b) (relating to net increase in foreign assets) and (c) (relating to actual foreign investment by domestic members) of this section for the 3 taxable years of each member immediately preceding its taxable year included in that first group taxable year which includes a member's first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. For purposes of the preceding sentence, determinations shall be made by reference to the taxable year of the issuer or transferor (as the case may be). If an election is made under this subdivision, the offset for uncommitted transitional funds under paragraph (b)(7) of this section is not allowed. If an election is made under this subdivision, the 3-year limitation applies to amounts described in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(1) and (2) of this section.


(ii) An election under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply with respect to amounts which must be carried over under paragraph (d) of this section in the case of certain corporate acquisitions and reorganizations.


(iii) An election under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be made by the DISC attaching to its first return, filed under section 6011(e)(2), a statement to the effect that the 3-year limitation is being elected under § 1.995-5(a)(5)(i).


(6) *Cumulative basis.* Pursuant to section 995(d)(5), all determinations of amounts specified in this section are to be made on a cumulative basis from the 1st year (or date) provided for in this section. Thus, each such determination shall take into account a net increase or a net decrease during the year, as the case may be. However, if the 3-year limitation is elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, then only amounts with respect to periods specified in such subparagraph (5) are amounts taken into account for years before a member of the group qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. The computations described in this section may be made in any way chosen by the DISC (including a corporation being tested as to whether it qualifies as a DISC), provided such method results in the amount prescribed by this section.


(7) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(b) *Net increase in foreign assets*—(1) *In general.* (i) The term *net increase in foreign assets* when used in this section means the excess for the controlled group (as of the close of the group taxable year) of (*a*) the investment in foreign assets to be taken into account under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph over (*b*) the aggregate of the five offsets allowed by subparagraphs (3) through (7) of this paragraph.


(ii) No amount described in this paragraph (other than amounts described in subparagraphs (4) and (7) of this paragraph) with respect to a member of the group (or foreign branch of a member) shall be taken into account unless it is attributable to a taxable year of such member beginning after December 31, 1971. For a 3-year elective limitation with respect to the first taxable year for which a member qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC, see paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For manner of determining amounts on a cumulative basis, see paragraph (a)(6) of this section.


(2) *Investments made in foreign assets.* (i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, there shall be taken into account as investment in foreign assets the aggregate of the amounts expended (within the meaning of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) during the period described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph by all members of the controlled group which includes the DISC to acquire assets described in section 1231(b) (determined without regard to any holding period therein provided) which are located outside the United States (as defined in § 1.993-7) reduced by the aggregate of the amounts received by all such members of the controlled group from the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of such assets described in section 1231(b) which are located outside the United States. For purposes of this section, amounts expended for assets which are qualified export assets (as defined in § 1.993-2) of a DISC (or which would be qualified export assets if owned by a DISC) shall not be taken into account. Thus, for example, if a DISC acquires a qualified export asset located outside the United States, the asset is not to be taken into account for purposes of determining the net increase in foreign assets.


(ii) As used in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the term *amounts expended* (or amounts received) means the amount of any money or the fair market value (on the date of acquisition, sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion) of any property (other than money) used to acquire (or received for) the assets described in such subdivision (i).


(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, an asset (other than an aircraft or vessel) is considered as located outside the United States if it was used predominantly outside the United States during the group taxable year. The determination as to whether such an asset is used predominantly outside the United States during the group taxable year in which it was acquired or sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted shall be made by applying the rules of § 1.993-3(d) except that an aircraft described in section 48(a)(2)(B)(i) or a vessel described in section 48(a)(2)(B)(iii) shall be considered located in the United States and all other aircraft or vessels shall be considered located outside the United States. Thus, for example, if a member of a controlled group which includes a DISC acquires a vessel which is documented under the laws of a foreign country, the amount expended to acquire that vessel is an amount described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.


(iv) *Examples.* The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Depreciation with respect to all foreign assets of a controlled group.* (i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph is the depreciation (determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) or depletion (determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) attributable to taxable years of the member beginning after December 31, 1971, with respect to all of the group's foreign assets described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph including such assets acquired prior to the date provided in such subparagraph (2), and without regard to whether the 3-year election in paragraph (a)(5) of this section is made. Thus, for example, depreciation for a taxable year of a member beginning after December 31, 1971, with respect to an asset described in section 1231(b) which is located outside of the United States and which was acquired during a taxable year of the member beginning before January 1, 1972, is an offset allowed by this subparagraph. For a further example, depreciation with respect to a qualified export asset is not such an offset.


(ii) The depreciation taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be—


(*a*) In the case of an asset owned by a domestic member, only the amount allowed under section 167(b)(1) (relating to the allowance of the straight-line method of depreciation) and § 1.162-11 (b) (relating to amortization in lieu of depreciation), but not the amount allowed under section 179 (relating to the additional first-year depreciation allowance).


(*b*) In the case of an asset owned by a foreign member, the depreciation and amortization (referred to in (*a*) of this subdivision) allowable for purposes of computing earnings and profits under subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph.


(iii) The depletion taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be limited to cost depletion computed under sections 611 and 612 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, percentage depletion is not to be taken into account in computing the offset under this subparagraph.


(4) *Amount of outstanding stock or debt.* (i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph is the outstanding amount of stock (including treasury stock) or debt obligations of any member of the group issued, sold, or exchanged after December 31, 1971, by any member (whether or not the same member) to persons who (on the date of such issuance, sale, or exchange) were neither United States persons (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30)) nor members of the group: *Provided,* That, in the case of a debt obligation, such obligation is not repaid within 12 months after such issuance, sale, or exchange. Thus, for example, if stock is issued to a member of the group before January 1, 1972, and after December 31, 1971, it is sold to a person who is neither a United States person nor a member of the group, an offset allowed by this subparagraph includes the outstanding amount of such stock. For purposes of this subparagraph, foreign branches of United States banks are not considered to be United States persons.


(ii) The outstanding amount of stock or debt obligations shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions:


(*a*) The outstanding amount of stock or debt obligations described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is equal to the net amount described in (*b*) of this subdivision reduced (but not below zero) by the amount described in (*c*) of this subdivision.


(*b*) The net amount described in this subdivision (*b*) is the excess of (*1*) the aggregate of the amount of money and the fair market value of property (other than money) transferred by persons who are not members of the group and who are not U.S. persons as consideration for such stock and debt obligations over (*2*) fees and commission expenses borne by the issuer or transferror with respect to their issuance, sale, or exchange.


(*c*) The amount described in this subdivision (*c*) is the aggregate amount of money and fair market value of property (other than money) distributed to such persons on distributions in respect of such stock from other than earnings and profits or on distributions in redemption of such stock and the amount of principal paid pursuant to such debt obligations.


(*d*) For purposes of this subdivision (ii), in the case of a redemption, the stock or debt redeemed shall be charged against the earliest of such stock or debt issued, sold, or exchanged in order to determine the amount by which the balance of outstanding stock or debt is to be reduced. For purposes of this subparagraph, the fair market value of property received as consideration shall be determined as of the date the transaction occurs, and a contribution to capital within the meaning of section 118 shall be treated as the issuance of stock.


(iii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph apply regardless of the treatment under the Code of the transaction in which the stock or debt was issued, sold, or exchanged. Thus, for example, if X Corporation, a member of a controlled group which includes a DISC, acquires from a nonresident alien individual in exchange solely for X's voting stock all of the stock of Y Corporation pursuant to a reorganization as defined in section 368(a)(1)(B), the fair market value of the Y stock on the date of the exchange would be an offset allowed by this subparagraph.


(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(5) *Earnings and profits.* (i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph is one-half the aggregate of the earnings and profits accumulated for all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, computed (without regard to any distributions from earnings and profits by a foreign corporation to a domestic corporation in accordance with § 1.964-1 (relating to a controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits), of each foreign member of the group which is controlled directly or indirectly (as determined under the principles of section 958 and the regulations thereunder) by a domestic member of the group and each foreign branch of a domestic member of the group (computed as if the branch were a foreign corporation). The DISC is bound by any action on behalf of a foreign member that was taken pursuant to § 1.964-1(c)(3) or by any failure to take action by or on behalf of a foreign member within the time specified in § 1.964-1(c)(6). With respect to a foreign member for which action was not previously required under § 1.964-1(c)(6) to be taken, the DISC may take action on behalf of such member by attaching a statement to that effect to the return of the DISC under section 6011(e)(2) for the first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC and there is outstanding a producer's loan made by such DISC to a member of the controlled group which includes the DISC.


(ii) If the aggregate of the accumulated earnings and profits described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is a deficit, the amount allowable as an offset under this subparagraph is zero.


(6) *Royalties and fees.* An offset allowed by this subparagraph is one-half the royalties and fees paid by foreign members of the group to domestic members of the group and by foreign branches of domestic members of the group to domestic members of the group during the taxable years of such members beginning after December 31, 1971.


(7) *Uncommitted transitional funds.* (i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph for the uncommitted transitional funds of the group is the sum described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph of the amount of certain capital raised under the foreign direct investment program and the amounts described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph of certain foreign excess working capital held on October 31, 1971.


(ii) The amount described in this subdivision of certain capital raised under the foreign direct investment program is the excess (if any) of—


(*a*) The amount of the offset allowed by subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, determined, however, with respect to the stock and debt obligations of domestic members of the group outstanding on December 31, 1971 (including amounts treated as stock outstanding by reason of a contribution to capital), whether or not outstanding after such date, which were issued, sold, or exchanged on or after January 1, 1968, by any member (whether or not the same member) to persons who (on the date of such issuance, sale, or exchange) were neither United States persons (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30)) nor members of the group, but only to the extent the taxpayer establishes that such amount constitutes a long-term borrowing (see 15 CFR 1000.324 
1) for purposes of the foreign direct investment program (see 15 CFR part 1000 
1), over


(*b*) The amount (determined under paragraph (c) of this section) of actual foreign investment by the domestic members of the group during the portion of the period such stock or debt obligations have been outstanding prior to January 1, 1972, such determination to be made by substituting January 1, 1968, for the December 31, 1971, date specified in such paragraph (c) and by not taking into account the earnings and profits described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(iii)(*a*) A taxpayer may establish that an amount under subdivision (ii) (*a*) of this subparagraph constitutes a long-term borrowing for purposes of the foreign direct investment program by keeping records sufficient to demonstrate that appropriate reports were filed with the Office of Foreign Direct Investment of the Department of Commerce with respect to the foreign borrowing or by any other method satisfactory to the district director.


(*b*) The amounts described in subdivision (ii) (*a*) of this subparagraph include amounts with respect to which an election under section 4912(c), to subject certain obligations of a United States person to the interest equalization tax, has been made: *Provided,* That the obligations to which such amounts relate were issued by an “overseas financing subsidiary” described in 15 CFR part 1000 
1 and were assumed by a United States person from such overseas financing subsidiary. Thus, for example, if an overseas financing subsidiary issues its notes to a foreign person in 1968, and such notes are assumed by its United States parent in 1973, which parent elects under section 4912(c) to have the notes subject to the interest equalization tax, then the amount of money received by the subsidiary is an amount described in subdivision (ii)(*a*) of this subparagraph.


(iv) The amount described in this subdivision of foreign excess working capital is the amount of liquid assets held by the foreign members of such group and foreign branches of domestic members of such group on October 31, 1971 (whether or not so held after such date) in excess of their reasonable working capital needs (as defined in § 1.993-2 (e)) on that date, but only to the extent not included in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subdivision, the term *liquid assets* means money, bank deposits (not including time deposits), and indebtedness of any kind (including time deposits) which on the day acquired had a maturity of 2 years or less.


(8) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Actual foreign investment by domestic members.* For purposes of determining the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of the actual foreign investment by domestic members of a controlled group is the sum (as of the close of the group taxable year) determined on a cumulative basis (see paragraph (a)(6) of this section) of—


(1) *Outstanding stock or debt (including contributions to capital).* The outstanding amount (determined in accordance with the principles of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, applied with respect to stock or debt obligations described in this subparagraph) of stock (including treasury stock) or debt obligations (other than normal trade indebtedness) of foreign members of the group issued, sold, or exchanged after December 31, 1971, by any person (whether or not a member) which is not a domestic member to domestic members of the group: *Provided,* That the outstanding amount of debt obligations of any foreign member shall be the greater of such amount outstanding at the close of the taxable year of such member or the highest such amount outstanding at any time during the immediately preceding 90 days,


(2) *Transfers to foreign branches.* The amount of money or the fair market value of property (other than money) transferred by domestic members of the group after December 31, 1971, to foreign branches of such members in transactions which would, if the branch were a corporation, be in consideration for the sale of stock or debt obligations of (or a contribution of capital to) such foreign branches (as determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), and


(3) *Earnings and profits of foreign members.* One-half of the earnings and profits (computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section for purposes of computing net increase in foreign assets) of foreign members of the group which are controlled directly or indirectly (as determined under the principles of section 958 and the regulations thereunder) by a domestic member of the group and foreign branches (treated for this purpose as a corporation) of domestic members of the group accumulated during the taxable years of such foreign members (or branches) beginning after December 31, 1971, or, if later, the taxable year referred to in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section if the 3-year election provided for in such paragraph (a)(5)(i) is made.


(d) *Carryovers on certain corporate acquisitions and reorganizations*—(1) *Certain corporate acquisitions.* (i) If—


(*a*) A member of a controlled group (“first controlled group”) acquires in a transaction to which section 381 applies the assets of a corporation which is a member of a second controlled group or acquires stock in such a corporation pursuant to a reorganization as defined in section 368(a)(1)(B) to which section 361 applies, or


(*b*) A member or combination of members of the first controlled group acquire in a transaction not described in (*a*) of this subdivision a majority interest (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) in the stock of a corporation which is a member of a second controlled group which includes a DISC so that such DISC after the acquisition is a member of the new controlled group,


(ii) If a member or combination of members of a controlled group, immediately after an acquisition of stock to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies, do not control the total combined voting power (determined under § 1.957-1(b)) of the corporation whose stock was acquired, proper apportionment consistent with the principles of paragraph (e)(5) of this section shall be made with respect to amounts to which paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply.


(iii)(*a*) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies, then for purposes of determining the application of the 3-year elective limitation provided for in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the rules in (*b*), (*c*), and (*d*) of this subdivision (iii) apply.


(*b*) If both the “first controlled group” and the “second controlled group” (as those terms are defined in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) include a DISC, and a DISC in either group has elected the 3-year limitation provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, then only those amounts taken into account under such paragraph (a)(5) by the electing DISC or DISC's shall be taken into account.


(*c*) If one of the groups includes a DISC and the other does not, and if the DISC has elected the 3-year limitation provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, then, for purposes of computing foreign investment attributable to producer's loans with respect to the new controlled group as constituted after the acquisition, all amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section with respect to members of the controlled group which did not include the DISC shall carry over to such new controlled group, but only to the extent provided in such paragraph (a)(5), computed as if the group taxable year in which the acquisition occurred was the first group taxable year which includes a member's first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC.


(*d*) If (*c*) of this subdivision (iii) applies, except that the DISC has not elected the 3-year limitation provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, then the DISC in the new controlled group as constituted after the acquisition may, with respect to members of the controlled group which did not include the DISC, make the election provided in such paragraph (a)(5), and treat the year in which the acquisition occurred as if it were the first group taxable year which includes a member's first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC.


(iv) If a majority interest, or an interest in addition to a majority interest, is acquired in a transaction other than a transaction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, then the rules in paragraph (e) of this section (relating to the acquisition of the foreign assets of a corporation) apply.


(2) *Corporation ceasing to be a member.* As of the date a corporation which is a member of a controlled group ceases to be a member of such group, the amounts of such group described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section will be reduced by such amounts which are attributable to the corporation which is no longer a member of the group.


(e) *Acquisition of a majority interest in a corporation*—(1) *In general.* If paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (relating to certain corporate acquisitions in which all amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section carry over) does not apply, then, for purposes of determining under paragraph (b)(2) of this section the investments made in foreign assets by a controlled group, the acquisition of a majority interest (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) or an interest in addition to a majority interest in a corporation by any member or combination of members of the controlled group is considered an acquisition of the assets (to the extent provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph) of the acquired corporation by the group, including the assets of any foreign corporation in which the acquired corporation owns a majority interest (to the extent provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph). For the rules concerning the date upon which an acquisition of a majority interest is considered to have occurred, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(2) *Majority interest.* For purposes of this section, a majority interest is more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of a corporation's stock entitled to vote, as determined under § 1.957-1(b).


(3) *Acquisition date.* For purposes of this paragraph, an acquisition of a majority interest shall be considered to have occurred on the day on which the combined voting power of the group first reached the percentage required in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.


(4) *Valuation of assets.* For purposes of this section, the amount of a corporation's assets deemed acquired is the fair market value of the assets on the date a majority interest, or an interest in addition to a previously held majority interest, is acquired.


(5) *Apportionment in the case of the acquisition of less than all of the voting stock.* (i) If the acquisition described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph of a majority interest is of less than 100 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the acquired corporation entitled to vote, then for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the amount of the foreign assets of the corporation deemed acquired as of the day the majority interest is considered acquired shall be an amount equal to the fair market value of all of the corporation's foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of such day multiplied by the percentage of the total combined voting power (determined under § 1.957-1(b)) held by members of the group on the day the majority interest is considered acquired.


(ii) If any member or combination of members of the controlled group hold a majority interest in a corporation, then for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the acquisition of additional combined voting power by members of the controlled group shall be considered an acquisition of its foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in an amount equal to the fair market value of all such assets held by the foreign corporation on the date of the acquisition, multiplied by the increase (expressed in percentage points) in total combined voting power (as determined under § 1.957-1(b)) which occurred.


(6) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(f) *Records.* A DISC shall keep or be readily able to produce such permanent books of account or records as are sufficient to establish the transactions and amounts described in this section. Where applicable, such books of account or records shall be cumulative and shall show transactions and amounts of the members of the controlled group which includes the DISC which occurred prior to the date the DISC qualified (or is treated) as a DISC.


(g) *Multiple DISC's*—(1) *Allocation among DISC's.* In the case of a controlled group which includes more than one DISC, the amounts described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be allocated among the DISC's in order to determine the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section. Each DISC's allocable portion of these amounts shall be equal to the total of such amounts multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the individual DISC's outstanding producer's loans to members of the group, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amounts of outstanding producer's loans to members of the group by all DISC's which are members of the group.


(2) *Different taxable years.* If all of the DISC's which are members of the controlled group do not have the same taxable year, then one such DISC shall on behalf of all such DISC's elect to make all computations under section 995(d) as if all DISC's that are members of the group use the same taxable year as the actual taxable year of any one of the DISC's. The election as to which DISC's taxable year is to be used shall be made by the electing DISC attaching to its first return, filed under section 6011(e)(2), a statement indicating which such taxable year will be used. Once such an election is made it may not be revoked until such time as all of the DISC's which are members of the group use the same taxable year. If this subparagraph applies, books and records must be kept by the group which are adequate to show the necessary computations under section 995(d).
