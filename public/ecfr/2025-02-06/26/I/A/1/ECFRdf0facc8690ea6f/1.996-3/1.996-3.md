# § 1.996-3   Divisions of earnings and profits.

(a) *In general.* For purposes of sections 991 through 997, the earnings and profits of a DISC, or former DISC, shall be treated as composed of the following three divisions:


(1) Accumulated DISC income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section),


(2) Previously taxed income (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), and


(3) Other earnings and profits (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section),


(b) *Accumulated DISC income defined.* (1) Accumulated DISC income is that portion of a corporation's earnings and profits which were derived during taxable years for which it qualified as a DISC and which were deferred from taxation. Accumulated DISC income as of the close of each taxable year of the corporation is—


(i) The amount of accumulated DISC income as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year increased by,


(ii) The amount of DISC income for the year (as determined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) and reduced (but not below zero) by,


(iii) The items enumerated in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(2) Under section 996(f)(1), DISC income is (i) the earnings and profits derived by the corporation during a taxable year for which such corporation is a DISC minus (ii) amounts deemed distributed under § 1.995-2 other than the amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans described in § 1.995-2(a)(5). For example, the earnings and profits of a DISC for a taxable year include any amounts includible in such DISC's gross income pursuant to section 951(a) (relating to controlled foreign corporations). Deemed distributions under § 1.995-2(a)(5) are taken into account under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as a reduction in computing accumulated DISC income.


(3) The accumulated DISC income (as increased by DISC income for the year determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) is reduced by each of the following items in the following order:


(i) Any amount deemed distributed for such year under § 1.995-3 (relating to deemed distributions upon disqualification),


(ii) Any amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans deemed distributed for such year under § 1.995-2(a)(5) to the extent it is charged to accumulated DISC income under § 1.996-1(b)(1)(i),


(iii) The amount of any adjustment to accumulated DISC income for such year under § 1.966-4(b)(1), and


(iv) To the extent they are treated, under § 1.996-1 (a) or (b) (relating to ordering rules for distributions), as made out of accumulated DISC income, the amounts of any actual qualifying distributions pursuant to § 1.992-3 in the order in which they are made, and thereafter by the amounts of any other actual distributions in the order in which they are made, except that, prior to each actual distribution, accumulated DISC income shall be reduced by the portion of any deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year chargeable at that time under § 1.996-2(a)(2) to accumulated DISC income.


(4) Every distribution or other reduction in accumulated DISC income pursuant to subparagraph (3) of this paragraph shall be charged to the most recently accumulated DISC income.


(c) *Previously taxed income.* Under section 996(f)(2), previously taxed income as of the close of each taxable year of the corporation is an amount equal to—


(1) The sum of—


(i) The amount of previously taxed income as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year,


(ii) Amounts deemed distributed for the current year under § 1.995-2 (relating to deemed distributions in qualified years),


(iii) Amounts deemed distributed for the current year under § 1.995-3 (relating to deemed distributions upon disqualification),


(iv) With respect to a distribution in redemption to which § 1.996-4(b)(1) applies, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (*a*) the amount of the reduction under § 1.996-4(b)(1) in accumulated DISC income over (*b*) the reduction in the corporation's earnings and profits (see section 312(e)), and


(v) Any amount by which accumulated DISC income is reduced under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section by reason of a deemed distribution as a dividend, under § 1.995-2(a)(5), of an amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans,


(2) Decreased (but not below zero), to the extent they are treated, under § 1.996-1 (a) or (b) (relating to ordering rules for distributions), as made out of previously taxed income, by the amounts of any actual qualifying distributions pursuant to § 1.992-3 in the order in which they are made, and thereafter by the amounts of any other actual distributions in the order in which they are made, except that, prior to any actual distribution, previously taxed income shall be reduced by the portion of any deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year chargeable at that time under § 1.996-2(a)(3) to previously taxed income.


(d) *Other earnings and profits.* Under section 996(f)(3), other earnings and profits consist of earnings and profits other than accumulated DISC income and previously taxed income described respectively in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Other earnings and profits as of the close of each taxable year of the corporation is (subject to paragraph (e) of this section) an amount equal to the amount of other earnings and profits as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year decreased (if necessary, below zero) in the following order by—


(1) To the extent they are treated, under § 1.996-1 (a) or (b) (relating to ordering rules for distributions), as made out of other earnings and profits, the amounts of any actual qualifying distributions pursuant to § 1.992-3 in the order in which they are made, and thereafter the amounts of any other actual distributions in the order in which they are made, except that, prior to any actual distribution, other earnings and profits shall be reduced by the portion of any deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year chargeable at that time under § 1.996-2(a)(1) to other earnings and profits, and


(2) With respect to a distribution in redemption to which § 1.996-4(b)(1) applies, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (*a*) the reduction in the corporation's earnings and profits (see section 312(e)) over (*b*) the amount of the reduction under § 1.996-4(b)(1) in accumulated DISC income.


(e) *Distributions in kind.* (1) For purposes of determining, under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the amount by which any division of earnings and profits is reduced by reason of a distribution of property (other than money or the DISC's, or former DISC's, own obligations), the amount of such distribution is the fair market value of such property at the time of the distribution.


(2) For any taxable year in which the DISC makes a distribution of such property, the amount of other earnings and profits determined under paragraph (d) of this section (without regard to this subparagraph) shall be—


(i) Increased by the excess (if any) of the amount of such distribution treated as a dividend under section 316(a) over the adjusted basis of such property, and


(ii) Decreased by the excess (if any) of the adjusted basis of such property over the amount of such distribution treated as a dividend under section 316 (a).


(f) *Examples.* The provisions of §§ 1.996-1, 1.996-2, and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(g) *DISCs having corporate and noncorporate shareholders.* In the case of a DISC having one or more corporate shareholders but less than all of its shareholders subject to the special rules of section 291(a)(4), relating to certain deferred DISC income as a corporate preference item, accumulated DISC income and previously taxed income of the DISC are divided between the corporate shareholders, as a class, and the other shareholders, as a class, in proportion to amounts of DISC income not deemed distributed and amounts deemed distributed to each class. Subsequent taxation of actual and qualifying distributions shall be based upon this division. Thus, if a DISC is owned 50 percent by corporate shareholders and 50 percent by individual shareholders and has undistributed taxable income of $2,000 for its year, the division is made as follows:
