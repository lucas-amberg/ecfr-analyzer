# § 1.852-1   Taxation of regulated investment companies.

(a) *Requirements applicable thereto*—(1) *In general.* Section 852(a) denies the application of the provisions of part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code (other than section 852(c), relating to earnings and profits), to a regulated investment company for a taxable year beginning after February 28, 1958, unless—


(i) The deduction for dividends paid for such taxable year as defined in section 561 (computed without regard to capital gain dividends) is equal to at least 90 percent of its investment company taxable income for such taxable year (determined without regard to the provisions of section 852(b)(2)(D) and paragraph (d) of § 1.852-3); and


(ii) The company complies for such taxable year with the provisions of § 1.852-6 (relating to records required to be maintained by a regulated investment company).


(2) *Special rule for taxable years of regulated investment companies beginning before March 1, 1958.* The provisions of part I of subchapter M (including section 852(c)) are not applicable to a regulated investment company for a taxable year beginning before March 1, 1958, unless such company meets the requirements of section 852(a) and subparagraph (1) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.


(b) *Failure to qualify.* If a regulated investment company does not meet the requirements of section 852(a) and paragraph (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section for the taxable year, it will, even though it may otherwise be classified as a regulated investment company, be taxed in such year as an ordinary corporation and not as a regulated investment company. In such case, none of the provisions of part I of subchapter M (other than section 852(c) in the case of taxable years beginning after February 28, 1958) will be applicable to it. For the rules relating to the applicability of section 852(c), see § 1.852-5.
