# § 1.853-1   Foreign tax credit allowed to shareholders.

(a) *In general.* Under section 853, a regulated investment company, meeting the requirements set forth in section 853(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, may make an election with respect to the income, war-profits, and excess profits taxes described in section 901(b)(1) which it pays to foreign countries or possessions of the United States during the taxable year, including such taxes as are deemed paid by it under the provisions of any income tax convention to which the United States is a party. If an election is made, the shareholders of the regulated investment company shall apply their proportionate share of such foreign taxes paid, or deemed to have been paid by it pursuant to any income tax convention, as either a credit (under section 901) or as a deduction (under section 164(a)) as provided by section 853(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 1.853-2. The election is not applicable with respect to taxes deemed to have been paid under section 902 (relating to the credit allowed to corporate stockholders of a foreign corporation for taxes paid by such foreign corporation). In addition, the election is not applicable to any tax with respect to which the regulated investment company is not allowed a credit by reason of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 853(b)(1), including, but not limited to, section 901(j), section 901(k), or section 901(l).


(b) *Requirements.* To qualify for the election provided in section 853(a), a regulated investment company (1) must have more than 50 percent of the value of its total assets, at the close of the taxable year for which the election is made, invested in stocks and securities of foreign corporations, and (2) must also, for that year, comply with the requirements prescribed in section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.852-1. The term “value”, for purposes of the first requirement, is defined in section 851(c)(4). For the definition of foreign corporation, see section 7701(a).


(c) *Effective/applicability date.* The final sentence of paragraph (a) of this section is applicable for RIC taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2007.
