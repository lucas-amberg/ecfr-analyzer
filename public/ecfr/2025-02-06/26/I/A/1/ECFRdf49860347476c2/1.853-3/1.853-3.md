# ยง 1.853-3   Notice to shareholders.

(a) *General rule.* If a regulated investment company makes an election under section 853(a), in the manner provided in ยง 1.853-4, the regulated investment company is required under section 853(c) to furnish its shareholders with a written notice mailed not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year. The notice must designate the shareholder's portion of creditable foreign taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States and the portion of the dividend that represents income derived from sources within each country that is attributable to a period during which section 901(j) applies to such country, if any, and the portion of the dividend that represents income derived from other foreign countries and possessions of the United States. For purposes of section 853(b)(2) and ยง 1.853-2(b), the amount that a shareholder may treat as the shareholder's proportionate share of foreign taxes paid and the amount to be included as gross income derived from any foreign country that is attributable to a period during which section 901(j) applies to such country or gross income from sources within other foreign countries or possessions of the United States shall not exceed the amount so designated by the regulated investment company in such written notice. If, however, the amount designated by the regulated investment company in the notice exceeds the shareholder's proper proportionate share of foreign taxes or gross income from sources within foreign countries or possessions of the United States, the shareholder is limited to the amount correctly ascertained.


(b) *Shareholder of record custodian of certain unit investment trusts.* In any case where a notice is mailed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by a regulated investment company with respect to a taxable year of the regulated investment company ending after December 8, 1970 to a shareholder of record who is a nominee acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (b) of ยง 1.851-7, the nominee shall furnish each holder of an interest in such trust with a written notice mailed on or before the 70th day following the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year. The notice shall designate the holder's proportionate share of the amounts of creditable foreign taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States and the holder's proportionate share of the dividend that represents income derived from sources within each country that is attributable to a period during which section 901(j) applies to such country, if any, and the holder's proportionate share of the dividend that represents income derived from other foreign countries or possessions of the United States shown on the notice received by the nominee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. This paragraph shall not apply if the regulated investment company agrees with the nominee to satisfy the notice requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to each holder of an interest in the unit investment trust whose shares are being held by the nominee as custodian and not later than 45 days following the close of the company's taxable year, files with the Internal Revenue Service office where such company's return for the taxable year is to be filed, a statement that the holders of the unit investment trust with whom the agreement was made have been directly notified by the regulated investment company. Such statement shall include the name, sponsor, and custodian of each unit investment trust whose holders have been directly notified. The nominee's requirements under this paragraph shall be deemed met if the regulated investment company transmits a copy of such statement to the nominee within such 60-day period: *Provided however,* if the regulated investment company fails or is unable to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph with respect to the holders of interest in the unit investment trust, it shall so notify the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days following the close of its taxable year. The custodian shall, upon notice by the Internal Revenue Service that the regulated investment company has failed to comply with the agreement, satisfy the requirements of this paragraph within 30 days of such notice.


(c) *Effective/applicability date.* This section is applicable for RIC taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2007. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for a taxable year that ends on or after December 31, 2007, and begins before August 24, 2007, a taxpayer may rely on this section as it was in effect on August 23, 2007.
