# § 1.854-1   Limitations applicable to dividends received from regulated investment company.

(a) *In general.* Section 854 provides special limitations applicable to dividends received from a regulated investment company for purposes of the exclusion under section 116 for dividends received by individuals, the deduction under section 243 for dividends received by corporations, and, in the case of dividends received by individuals before January 1, 1965, the credit under section 34.


(b) *Capital gain dividend.* Under the provisions of section 854(a) a capital gain dividend as defined in section 852(b)(3) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4 shall not be considered a dividend for purposes of the exclusion under section 116, the deduction under section 243, and, in the case of taxable years ending before January 1, 1965, the credit under section 34.


(c) *Rule for dividends other than capital gain dividends.* (1) Section 854(b)(1) limits the amount that may be treated as a dividend (other than a capital gain dividend) by the shareholder of a regulated investment company, for the purposes of the credit, exclusion, and deduction specified in paragraph (b) of this section, where the investment company receives substantial amounts of income (such as interest, etc.) from sources other than dividends from domestic corporations, which dividends qualify for the exclusion under section 116.


(2) Where the “aggregate dividends received” (as defined in section 854(b)(3)(B) and paragraph (b) of § 1.854-3) during the taxable year by a regulated investment company (which meets the requirements of section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.852-1 for the taxable year during which it paid such dividend) are less than 75 percent of its gross income for such taxable year (as defined in section 854(b)(3)(A) and paragraph (a) of § 1.854-3), only that portion of the dividend paid by the regulated investment company which bears the same ratio to the amount of such dividend paid as the aggregate dividends received by the regulated investment company, during the taxable year, bears to its gross income for such taxable year (computed without regard to gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks or securities) may be treated as a dividend for purposes of such credit, exclusion, and deduction.


(3) Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(d) *Dividends received from a regulated investment company during taxable years of shareholders ending after July 31, 1954, and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.* For the application of section 854 to taxable years of shareholders of a regulated investment company ending after July 31, 1954, and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, see § 1.34-5 and § 1.116-2.
