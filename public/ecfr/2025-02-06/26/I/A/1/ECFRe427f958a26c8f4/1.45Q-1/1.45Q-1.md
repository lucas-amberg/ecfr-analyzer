# § 1.45Q-1   Credit for Carbon Oxide Sequestration.

(a) *In general.* For purposes of section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the carbon oxide sequestration credit is determined under section 45Q of the Code and this section (section 45Q credit). Generally, the amount of the section 45Q credit and the party that is eligible to claim the credit depend on whether the taxpayer captures qualified carbon oxide using carbon capture equipment originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018, or on or after February 9, 2018, and whether the taxpayer disposes of the qualified carbon oxide in secure geological storage without using it as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project (disposal), uses it as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposes of it in secure geological storage (injection), or utilizes it in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5) and § 1.45Q-4 (utilization). The section 45Q credit applies only with respect to qualified carbon oxide the capture and disposal, injection, or utilization of which is within the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1) of the Code) or a possession of the United States (within the meaning of section 638(2)).


(b) *Credit amount for carbon capture equipment originally placed in service before February 9, 2018—(1) In general.* For carbon capture equipment originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018, the amount of credit determined under section 45Q(a) and this section is the sum of—


(i) $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide that is—


(A) Captured by the taxpayer at the qualified facility and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, and


(B) Not used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project or utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5) and § 1.45Q-4, and


(ii) $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide that is—


(A) Captured by the taxpayer at the qualified facility and used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or


(B) Captured by the taxpayer at the qualified facility and utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5) and § 1.45Q-4.


(2) *Inflation adjustment.* In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2009, there is substituted for each dollar amount contained in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section an amount equal to the product of—


(i) Such dollar amount, multiplied by


(ii) The inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for such calendar year, determined by substituting “2008” for “1990.”


(c) *Credit amount for carbon capture equipment originally placed in service on or after February 9, 2018.* For carbon capture equipment originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, the amount of credit determined under section 45Q(a)(3) and (4) and this section is the sum of—


(1) The applicable dollar amount (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide that is captured during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service, and is—


(i) Disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, and


(ii) Not used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project or utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5) and § 1.45Q-4; and


(2) The applicable dollar amount (as determined under paragraph (d)(3) and (4) of this section) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide that is captured during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service and is—


(i) Used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or


(ii) Utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5) and § 1.45Q-4.


(d) *Applicable dollar amount.* In general, the applicable dollar amount depends on whether section 45Q(a)(3) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies or section 45Q(a)(4) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, and the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.


(1) *Applicable dollar amount for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2016 and before 2027 for qualified carbon oxide not used as a tertiary injectant or utilized.* For purposes of section 45Q(a)(3) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the applicable dollar amount for each taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2016 and before 2027 is:


(2) *Applicable dollar amount for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026 for qualified carbon oxide not used as a tertiary injectant or utilized.* For purposes of section 45Q(a)(3) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the applicable dollar amount for any taxable year beginning in any calendar year after 2026 is an amount equal to the product of $50 and the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for the calendar year, determined by substituting “2025” for “1990.”


(3) *Applicable dollar amount for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2016 and before 2027 for qualified carbon oxide used as a tertiary injectant or utilized.* For purposes of section 45Q(a)(4) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable dollar amount for each taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2016 and before 2027 is:


(4) *Applicable dollar amount for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026 for qualified carbon oxide used as a tertiary injectant or utilized.* For purposes of section 45Q(a)(4) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable dollar amount for any taxable year beginning in any calendar year after 2026, is an amount equal to the product of $35 and the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for such calendar year, determined by substituting “2025” for “1990.”


(e) *Election to apply the $10 and $20 credit amounts in lieu of the applicable dollar amounts.* For purposes of determining the carbon oxide sequestration credit under this section, a taxpayer may elect to have the dollar amounts applicable under section 45Q(a)(1) or (2) and paragraph (b) of this section apply in lieu of the dollar amounts applicable under section 45Q(a)(3) or (4) and paragraph (d) of this section for each metric ton of qualified carbon oxide which is captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018. The election must be made on a *Form 8933* (as defined in § 1.45Q-2(j)), and applies to all metric tons of qualified carbon oxide captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at the qualified facility throughout the full 12-year credit period.


(f) *Application of section 45Q for certain carbon capture equipment placed in service before February 9, 2018.* In the case of any carbon capture equipment placed in service before February 9, 2018, the credits under section 45Q(a)(1) and (2) and paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply with respect to qualified carbon oxide captured using such equipment before the end of the calendar year in which the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), certifies that, during the period beginning after October 3, 2008, a total of 75,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide have been taken into account in accordance with section 45Q(a), as in effect on February 8, 2018, and section 45Q(a)(1) and (2). In general, a taxpayer may not claim credits under section 45Q(a)(1) and (2) in taxable years after the year in which the 75,000,000 metric ton limit is certified with respect to carbon capture equipment placed in service before February 9, 2018. However, see § 1.45Q-2(g)(4) regarding the election for applicable facilities to treat certain carbon capture equipment as having been placed in service on February 9, 2018 (section 45Q(f)(6) election).


(g) *Installation of additional carbon capture equipment.* In general, the credit amounts for property placed in service before February 9, 2018, apply to a qualified facility at which carbon capture equipment was placed in service before February 9, 2018, subject to the limitations under paragraph (f) of this section. The same qualified facility may place additional carbon capture equipment in service on or after February 9, 2018. The additional carbon capture equipment is eligible to qualify for the section 45Q credit amounts for equipment placed in service on or after February 9, 2018.


(1) *Allocation of section 45Q credits for facilities installing additional carbon capture equipment.* In the case of a qualified facility placed in service before February 9, 2018, for which additional carbon capture equipment is placed in service on or after February 9, 2018, the amount of qualified carbon oxide which is captured by the taxpayer is equal to—


(i) For purposes of section 45Q(a)(1)(A) and (2)(A), and paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the lesser of the total amount of qualified carbon oxide captured at such facility for the taxable year, or the total amount of the carbon dioxide capture capacity of the carbon capture equipment in service at such facility on February 8, 2018, and


(ii) For purposes of section 45Q(a)(3)(A) and (4)(A), and paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, an amount (not less than zero) equal to the excess of the total amount of qualified carbon oxide captured at such facility for the taxable year, over the total amount of the carbon dioxide capture capacity of the carbon capture equipment in service at such facility on February 8, 2018.


(2) *Additional carbon capture equipment.* A physical modification or equipment addition that results in an increase in the carbon dioxide capture capacity of existing carbon capture equipment constitutes the installation of additional carbon capture equipment. Increasing the amount of carbon dioxide captured without physically modifying existing carbon capture equipment or adding new equipment, for example, by merely operating the existing carbon capture equipment above the carbon dioxide capture capacity, does not constitute the installation of additional carbon capture equipment. For purposes of this section, the term *carbon dioxide capture capacity* means capture design capacity. Section 45Q credits attributable to qualified carbon oxide captured by additional carbon capture equipment that is placed in service on or after February 9, 2018, are not subject to the 75,000,000 metric ton limitation described in section 45Q(g) and paragraph (f) of this section.


(3) *New carbon capture equipment.* A physical modification or equipment addition with a cost that satisfies the 80/20 Rule provided in § 1.45Q-2(g)(5) constitutes the installation of new carbon capture equipment rather than the installation of additional carbon capture equipment.


(4) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g):


(i) *Example 1.* Taxpayer X owns qualified facility QF. In 2017, X placed in service three units of carbon capture equipment—CC1, CC2, and CC3—to capture carbon dioxide emitted by QF. Each of CC1, CC2, and CC3 are capable of capturing 50,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. In 2017, X entered into a binding written contract with Y to provide 80,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually for Y to dispose of in secure geological storage. X operates CC1 and CC2 to capture carbon dioxide pursuant to the binding written contract with Y, leaving CC3 idle. In 2020, X enters into a binding written contract with Z to provide 40,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually for Z to dispose of in secure geological storage. X operates CC3 to capture carbon dioxide pursuant to the binding written contract with Z. CC3 is not additional carbon capture equipment under paragraph (g)(2) of this section simply because it began operating CC3 in 2020. X merely increased the amount of carbon dioxide captured by existing carbon capture equipment. As a result, any section 45Q credits attributable to the carbon dioxide captured by CC3 and disposed of by Z are calculated under section 45Q(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and are subject to the 75,000,000 metric ton limitation described in section 45Q(g) and paragraph (f) of this section.


(ii) *Example 2.* Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that in 2019, X physically modified CC3 to enable CC3 to capture 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The physical modification to upgrade CC3 does not satisfy the 80/20 Rule in § 1.45Q-2(g)(5). In 2020 X enters into a binding written contract with Z to provide 80,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually for Z to dispose of in secure geological storage. X operates CC3 to capture carbon dioxide pursuant to the binding written contract with Z. Because the physical modification to upgrade CC3 does not satisfy the 80/20 Rule, the physical modification to upgrade CC3 is considered the installation of additional carbon capture equipment under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, rather than new carbon capture equipment under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. As a result, any section 45Q credits attributable to the first 50,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide captured by CC3 and disposed of by Z are calculated under section 45Q(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and are subject to the 75,000,000 metric ton limitation described in section 45Q(g) and paragraph (f) of this section. Any section 45Q credits attributable to additional carbon dioxide captured by CC3 and disposed of by Z in excess of those first 50,000 metric tons are calculated under section 45Q(a)(4) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and are not subject to the 75,000,000 metric ton limitation described in section 45Q(g) and paragraph (f) of this section.


(iii) *Example 3.* Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that the physical modification to CC3 satisfies the 80/20 Rule in § 1.45Q-2(g)(5). The physical modification to CC3 is considered the installation of new carbon capture equipment under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. As a result, any section 45Q credits attributable to carbon dioxide captured by CC3 and disposed of by Z are calculated under section 45Q(a)(4) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and are not subject to the 75,000,000 metric ton limitation described in section 45Q(g) and paragraph (f) of this section.


(h) *Eligibility for the section 45Q credit.* The following rules determine who may claim the section 45Q credit.


(1) *Person to whom the section 45Q credit is attributable.* In general, the person to whom the credit is attributable is the person who may claim the credit. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the section 45Q credit is attributable to the following persons—


(i) *Equipment placed in service before February 9, 2018.* In the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment that is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018, the section 45Q credit is attributable to the person that captures and physically or contractually ensures the disposal, injection, or utilization of such qualified carbon oxide.


(ii) *Equipment placed in service on or after February 9, 2018.* In the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment that is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, the section 45Q credit is attributable to the person that owns the carbon capture equipment and physically or contractually ensures the capture and disposal, injection, or utilization of such qualified carbon oxide. For each single process train of carbon capture equipment (as described in § 1.45Q-2(c)(3)), only one taxpayer will be considered the person to whom the credit is attributable under this paragraph (h)(1)(ii). That person will be the taxpayer who either physically ensures the capture and disposal, injection, or utilization of such qualified carbon oxide or contracts with others to capture and dispose, inject, or utilize such qualified carbon oxide.


(iii) *Reporting.* The taxpayer described in this paragraph (h)(1) as eligible to claim the section 45Q credit must claim the credit on a *Form 8933,* “Carbon Dioxide Sequestration Credit,” with the taxpayer's Federal income tax return or *Form 1065,* “U.S. Return of Partnership Income,” for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is eligible. The taxpayer must provide the name and location of the qualified facilities at which the qualified carbon oxide was captured. If the taxpayer is claiming the section 45Q credit on an amended Federal income tax return, an amended *Form 1065,* or an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 (AAR), as applicable, the taxpayer must state AMENDED RETURN FOR SECTION 45Q CREDIT at the top of the amended Federal income tax return, the amended *Form 1065,* or the AAR, as applicable. The amended Federal income tax return or the amended *Form 1065* must be filed, in any event, not later than the applicable period of limitations on filing an amended Federal income tax return or *Form 1065* is being filed. A BBA partnership may make a late election by filing an AAR on or before October 15, 2021, but in any event, not later than the period of limitations on filing an AAR under section 6227(c).


(2) *Contractually ensuring capture and disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide.* In the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, a taxpayer is not required to physically carry out the capture and disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide to claim the section 45Q credit if the taxpayer contractually ensures in a binding written contract that the party that physically carries out the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide does so in the manner required under section 45Q, this section and §§ 1.45Q-2, 1.45Q-3, 1.45Q-4, and 1.45Q-5. A taxpayer may enter into a binding written contract with a general contractor that hires subcontractors to physically carry out the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide, but the contract must bind the subcontractors to the requirements of this paragraph (h)(2). In the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018, a taxpayer that contractually ensures the capture of the qualified carbon oxide is not eligible for the section 45Q credit. However, the taxpayer is not required to physically carry out the disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide to claim the section 45Q credit if the taxpayer contractually ensures in a binding written contract that the party that physically carries out the disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide does so in the manner required under section 45Q, this section, and §§ 1.45Q-2, 1.45Q-3, 1.45Q-4, and 1.45Q-5.


(i) *Binding written contract.* A written contract is binding only if it is enforceable under State law against both the taxpayer and the party that physically carries out the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide, or a predecessor or successor of either, and does not limit damages to a specified amount (for example, by use of a liquidated damages provision). For this purpose, a contractual provision that limits damages to an amount equal to at least five percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting damages to a specified amount. For additional guidance regarding the definition of a binding written contract, see § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4)(ii)(A)-(D).


(ii) *Multiple binding written contracts permitted.* A taxpayer may enter into multiple binding written contracts with multiple parties for the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide. A party that physically carries out the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide may enter into multiple binding written contracts with multiple parties that own carbon capture equipment or capture or contractually ensure the capture of qualified carbon oxide.


(iii) *Contract provisions.* Contracts ensuring the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide—


(A) Must include commercially reasonable terms and provide for enforcement of the party's obligation to perform the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of the qualified carbon oxide;


(B) May, but are not required to, include long-term liability provisions, indemnity provisions, penalties for breach of contract, or liquidated damages provisions;


(C) May, but are not required to, include information including how many metric tons of qualified carbon oxide the parties agree to dispose of, inject, or utilize;


(D) May, but are not required to, include minimum quantities that the parties agree to dispose of, inject, or utilize;


(E) Must, in the case of qualified carbon oxide that is intended to be disposed of in secure geological storage and not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, obligate the disposing party to comply with §§ 1.45Q-3(b)(1) and (c), and, in the case of a recapture event, promptly inform the capturing party of all information that is pertinent to the recapture (*e.g.,* location of leak, leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide, dollar value of section 45Q credit attributable to leaked qualified carbon oxide);


(F) Must, for qualified carbon oxide that is intended to be used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery, obligate the disposing party to comply with § 1.45Q-3(b)(2) and (c), and in the case of a recapture event, promptly inform the capturing party of all information that is pertinent to recapture of the section 45Q credit as listed in § 1.45Q-5; and


(G) Must, for qualified carbon oxide that is intended to be utilized in a manner specified in § 1.45Q-4, obligate the utilizing party to comply with § 1.45Q-4.


(iv) *Pre-existing contracts.* If a taxpayer entered into a contract for the capture, disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide prior to January 13, 2021, and that contract does not satisfy all of the requirements of this paragraph (h)(2), the taxpayer must amend its existing contract or execute a new contract that satisfies all of the requirements of this paragraph (h)(2) by July 12, 2021.


(v) *Reporting of contract information.* The existence of each contract and the parties involved must be reported to the IRS annually. Each party to a contract must complete a signed *Form 8933* (as defined in § 1.45-2(j)) and provide information required by the instructions to *Form 8933.* The party that contracts with the taxpayer claiming the credit must also provide that taxpayer with a signed *Form 8933* in accordance with the instructions to *Form 8933.* The taxpayer claiming the credit must attach and file all other signed *Forms 8933* received by each other party to the contract to its own signed *Form 8933.* Failure of the taxpayer claiming the credit to satisfy this reporting requirement in a taxable year will result in the inability of that taxpayer to claim the credit with respect to any qualified carbon oxide that is disposed of, injected, or utilized in that taxable year pursuant to that particular contract. In addition to any information stated as required on *Form 8933,* the report must include the following information—


(A) The name and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer to whom the credit is attributable;


(B) The name and taxpayer identification number of each party with whom the taxpayer has entered into a contract to ensure the disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide;


(C) The date each contract to ensure the disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide was entered into;


(D) The number of metric tons of qualified carbon oxide each contracting party disposes of, injects, or utilizes on behalf of the contracting taxpayer each taxable year for reporting to the IRS; and


(E) For contracts for the disposal of qualified carbon oxide in secure geological storage or the use of qualified carbon oxide as a tertiary injectant in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery, the name of the operator, the field, unit, and reservoir, location by county and state, and identification number assigned to the facility by the EPA's electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT ID number) for submission of the facility's 40 CFR part 98 annual reports.


(vi) *Relationship with election to allow section 45Q credit.* A taxpayer does not elect to allow all or a portion of the credit to any of the contracting parties merely by contracting with that party to ensure the disposal, injection, or utilization of qualified carbon oxide. Any election to allow all or a portion of the credit to be claimed by another party must be made separately pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section.


(3) *Election to allow the section 45Q credit to another taxpayer.* The taxpayer described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section as the person to whom the section 45Q credit is attributable (electing taxpayer) may elect to allow the person that enters into a contract with the electing taxpayer to dispose of the qualified carbon oxide (disposer), utilize the qualified carbon oxide (utilizer), or use the qualified carbon oxide as a tertiary injectant (injector) to claim the credit (credit claimant) (section 45Q(f)(3)(B) election). However, the electing taxpayer may not elect or otherwise allow the section 45Q credit to a contractor or subcontractor that physically captures carbon oxide on behalf of the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), the disposer or injector that is eligible to be a credit claimant is the party that obtains the permit to dispose of the qualified carbon oxide in secure geological storage. In the case of an injector that is itself a joint venture (not a federal tax partnership), only those taxpayers that hold a working interest in the joint venture may be credit claimants. A credit claimant may not allow the section 45Q credit to a subcontractor that performs the disposal, utilization, or injection for the credit claimant. The electing taxpayer may not claim any section 45Q credits that are allowable to a credit claimant. An electing taxpayer may elect to allow a credit claimant to claim the full amount or a partial amount of section 45Q credits arising during the taxable year. An electing taxpayer may elect to allow a single credit claimant or multiple credit claimants to claim section 45Q credits in the same taxable year. If an electing taxpayer elects to allow multiple credit claimants to claim section 45Q credits, the maximum amount of section 45Q credits allowable to each credit claimant is proportional to the amount of qualified carbon oxide disposed of, utilized, or used as a tertiary injectant by the credit claimant. A credit claimant may receive allowances of section 45Q credits from multiple electing taxpayers in the same taxable year. In the case of an electing taxpayer with multiple qualified facilities, the electing taxpayer must make a separate election for each qualified facility.


(i) *Example.* Electing Taxpayer, E, captures 1,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide with carbon capture equipment that was placed in service in 2020. In 2021, E contracts with two companies, A and B, for the disposal of the qualified carbon oxide. E is eligible for a section 45Q credit at a rate of $22.68 per metric ton, for a total section 45Q credit of $22,680,000. E contractually ensures that A will dispose of 300,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide and that B will dispose of 700,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide. E may make a section 45Q(f)(3)(B) election to allow up to $6,804,000 of section 45Q credit to A and up to $15,876,000 of section 45Q credit to B, equal to the value of the number of metric tons each party has contracted to ensure disposal, multiplied by the credit value of the metric tons disposed of.


(ii) *Time and manner of making election.* The electing taxpayer makes a section 45Q(f)(3)(B) election by filing a statement of election containing the information described in paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section with the taxpayer's Federal income tax return or *Form 1065* for each taxable year in which the credit arises. The section 45Q(f)(3)(B) election must be made in accordance with *Form 8933* no later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the Federal income tax return or *Form 1065* for the year in which the credit arises. The election may not be filed with an amended Federal income tax return, an amended *Form 1065,* or an AAR, as applicable, after the prescribed date (including extensions) for filing the original Federal income tax return or *Form 1065* for the year, with the exception of amended Federal income tax returns, amended *Forms 1065,* or AARs, as applicable, for any taxable year ending after February 9, 2018, and beginning on or before January 13, 2021. The amended Federal income tax return or the amended *Form 1065* must be filed, in any event, not later than the applicable period of limitations on assessment for the taxable year for which the amended Federal income tax return or *Form 1065* is being filed. A BBA partnership may make a late election by filing an AAR on or before October 15, 2021, but in any event, not later than the period of limitations on filing an AAR under section 6227(c).


(iii) *Annual election.* A section 45(Q)(f)(3)(B) election is only effective for the taxable year for which it is made. A new section 45Q(f)(3)(B) election must be made for each taxable year for which an electing taxpayer wishes to allow section 45Q credits to a credit claimant.


(iv) *Required information.* For the section 45Q(f)(3)(B) election to be valid under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, the election statement of the electing taxpayer must be made on *Form 8933* and must indicate that an election is being made under section 45Q(f)(3)(B). The electing taxpayer must provide each credit claimant with a copy of the electing taxpayer's *Form 8933.* The electing taxpayer must, in addition to any information required on *Form 8933* set forth the following information—


(A) The electing taxpayer's name, address, taxpayer identification number, location, and e-GGRT ID number(s) (if available) of each qualified facility where qualified carbon oxide was captured;


(B) The full amount of credit attributable to the taxpayer prior to the election and the corresponding metric tons of qualified carbon oxide;


(C) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each credit claimant, and the name and location and e-GGRT ID number(s) (if available) of:


(*i*) Each secure geological storage site where the qualified carbon oxide is disposed of or injected, or


(*ii*) Each site where the qualified carbon oxide is utilized;


(D) The dollar amount of section 45Q credits the taxpayer is allowing each credit claimant to claim and the corresponding metric tons of qualified carbon oxide; and


(E) The dollar amount of section 45Q credits retained by the electing taxpayer and the corresponding metric tons of qualified carbon oxide.


(v) *Requirements for section 45Q credit claimant.* For a section 45Q(f)(3)(B) election to be valid, the section 45Q credit claimant must include the following information on *Form 8933*—


(A) The name, address, taxpayer identification number of the credit claimant;


(B) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each taxpayer making an election under section 45Q(f)(3)(B) to allow the credit to the credit claimant;


(C) The name and location and e-GGRT ID number(s) (if available) of each qualified facility where qualified carbon oxide was captured;


(D) The name and location and e-GGRT ID number(s) (if available) of:


(*i*) Each secure geological storage site where the qualified carbon oxide is disposed of or injected, or


(*ii*) Each site where the qualified carbon oxide is utilized.


(E) The full dollar amount of section 45Q credits attributable to each electing taxpayer prior to the election and the corresponding metric tons of qualified carbon oxide;
