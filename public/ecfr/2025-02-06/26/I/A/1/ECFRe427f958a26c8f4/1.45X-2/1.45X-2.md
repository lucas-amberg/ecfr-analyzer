# § 1.45X-2   Sale to unrelated person.

(a) *In general.* The amount of the section 45X credit for any taxable year is equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under section 45X(b) (and described in §§ 1.45X-3 and 1.45X-4) with respect to each eligible component that is produced by the taxpayer and, during the taxable year, sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person. Applicable Federal income tax principles apply to determine whether a transaction is in substance a sale (or the provision of a service, or some other disposition). *See* § 1.45X-1(d) and (e) for additional requirements relating to sales.


(b) *Definitions.* This paragraph (b) provides definitions of terms that apply for purposes of this section.


(1) *Person.* The term *person* means an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation, as provided in section 7701(a)(1) of the Code. For purposes of this section, an entity disregarded as separate from a person (for example, under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter) is not a person.


(2) *Related person.* The term *related person* means a person who is related to another person if such persons would be treated as a single employer under the regulations in this chapter under section 52(b) of the Code.


(3) *Unrelated person.* The term *unrelated person* means a person who is not a related person as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(c) *Special rule for sale to related person*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 45X(a), a taxpayer is treated as selling an eligible component to an unrelated person if such component is sold to such person by a person who is a related person with respect to the taxpayer.


(2) *Example.* X and Y are members of a group of trades or businesses under common control under section 52(b), and thus are related persons under section 45X(d)(1). Each of X and Y has a calendar year taxable year. Z is an unrelated person. X is in the trade or business of producing and selling solar modules. X produces and sells solar modules to Y in 2023. Y sells the solar modules to Z in 2024. X may claim a section 45X credit for the sale of the solar modules in 2024, the taxable year of X in which Y sells the solar modules to Z.


(d) *Related person election*—(1) *Availability of election*—(i) *In general.* In such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe, a taxpayer may make an election under section 45X(a)(3)(B) (Related Person Election), to treat a sale of eligible components by such taxpayer to a related person as if made to an unrelated person. As a condition of, and prior to, a taxpayer making a Related Person Election (as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section), the Secretary may require such information or registration as the Secretary deems necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, or any improper or excessive credit amount determined under section 45X(a)(1).


(ii) *Members of a consolidated group.* A Related Person Election is made by a member of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)) in the manner described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. A member of a consolidated group that sells eligible components in an intercompany transaction (as defined in § 1.1502-13(b)(1)) may make the Related Person Election to claim the section 45X credit in the year of the intercompany sale. For the treatment of the selling member's gain or loss from that sale, *see* § 1.1502-13.


(2) *Time and manner of making election*—(i) *In general.* A taxpayer must make an affirmative Related Person Election annually on the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal income tax return, including extensions in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed in guidance. The Related Person Election will be applicable to all sales of eligible components to related persons by the taxpayer for each trade or business that the taxpayer engages in during the taxable year that resulted in a credit claim and for which the taxpayer has made the Related Person Election.


(ii) *Required information.* For all sales of eligible components to related persons, the taxpayer must provide all required information set forth in guidance. Such information may include, for example, the taxpayer's name, employer identification number (EIN), a description of the taxpayer's trade or business (including principal business activity code); the name(s) and EINs of all related persons; a listing of the eligible components that are sold; and the intended purpose of any sales of eligible components to or from related persons.


(3) *Scope and effect of election*—(i) *In general.* A separate Related Person Election must be made with respect to related person sales made by a taxpayer for each eligible trade or business of the taxpayer. The election applies only to such trade or business for which the Related Person Election is made. An election under this section applies to all sales to related persons (including between members of the same consolidated group) of eligible components produced by the taxpayer during the taxable year with respect to each trade or business for which the Related Person Election is made and is irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. An election under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section applies solely for purposes of the section 45X credit and the section 45X regulations (and the regulations in this chapter under sections 6417 and 6418 related to the section 45X credit).


(ii) *Application to consolidated groups.* For a trade or business of a consolidated group, a Related Person Election must be made by the agent for the group on behalf of the members claiming the section 45X credit and filed with the group's timely filed original Federal income tax return, including extensions, with respect to each trade or business that the consolidated group conducts. *See* § 1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members). A separate election must be filed on behalf of each member claiming the section 45X credit, and each election must include the name and EIN of the agent for the group and the member on whose behalf the election is being made.


(iii) *Application to partnerships.* The Related Person Election for a partnership must be made on the partnership's timely filed original Federal income tax return, including extensions, with respect to each trade or business that the partnership conducts. The election applies only to such trade or business for which the Related Person Election is made. An election by a partnership does not apply to any trade or business conducted by a partner outside the partnership.


(4) *Anti-abuse rule*—(i) *In general.* A Related Person Election may not be made if, with respect to the eligible components relevant to such election, the taxpayer fails to provide the information described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, provides information described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section that shows that such components are described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section, or such components are described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section.


(ii) *Improper use.* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4) the term *improper use* means a use that is wasteful, such as discarding, disposing of, or destroying the eligible component without putting it to a productive use by the related person to which the eligible component is sold.


(iii) *Defective components.* The term *defective component* means a component that does not meet the requirements of section 45X and the section 45X regulations.


(e) *Sales of integrated components to related person*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 45X and the section 45X regulations (and the regulations in this chapter under sections 6417 and 6418 related to the section 45X credit), a taxpayer that produces and then sells an eligible component to a related person, who then integrates, incorporates, or assembles the taxpayer's eligible component into another complete and distinct eligible component that is subsequently sold to an unrelated person, may claim a section 45X credit (or make an election under section 6417 or section 6418) with respect to the taxable year in which the related person's sale to the unrelated person occurs.


(2) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(i) *Example 1: Sales of multiple incorporated eligible components to related persons.* X and Y are C corporations that are members of a group of trades or businesses under common control under section 52(b), and thus are related persons under section 45X(d)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each of X and Y has a calendar year taxable year. Z is an unrelated person. X and Y are in the trade or business of producing and selling photovoltaic wafers and cells. X produces and sells photovoltaic wafers to Y in 2023. Y incorporates the photovoltaic wafers into photovoltaic cells and sells the photovoltaic cells to Z in 2024. X may claim a section 45X credit for the sale of the photovoltaic wafers in 2024, the taxable year of X in which Y sells the photovoltaic cells to Z.


(ii) *Example 2: Sales of multiple incorporated eligible components to related and unrelated persons.* W, X, and Y are domestic C corporations that are members of a group of trades or businesses under common control under section 52(b), and thus are related persons under section 45X(d)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each of W, X, and Y has a calendar year taxable year. W produces electrode active materials (EAMs) and sells the EAMs to X in 2023. In 2024, X incorporates the EAMs into battery cells that it produces and sells the battery cells to Y. In 2025, Y incorporates the battery cells into battery modules (within the meaning of § 1.45X-3(e)(4)(i)(A)) that it produces and sells the battery modules to Z, an unrelated person. W may claim a section 45X credit for EAMs sold to X, X may claim a section 45X credit for the battery cells sold to Y, and Y may claim a section 45X credit for the battery modules sold to Z in 2025, the taxable year of each of W, X, and Y in which the battery modules are sold to Z.


(3) *Special rules applicable to related person election*—(i) *In general.* If a taxpayer makes a valid Related Person Election under section 45X(a)(3)(B)(i) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and the taxpayer produces and then sells an eligible component to a related person, who then integrates, incorporates, or assembles the taxpayer's eligible component into another complete and distinct eligible component that is subsequently sold to an unrelated person, the taxpayer's sale of the eligible component to the related person is treated (solely for purposes of the section 45X credit and the section 45X regulations, and the regulations in this chapter under sections 6417 and 6418 related to the section 45X credit) as if made to an unrelated person in the taxable year in which the sale to the related person occurs.


(ii) *Example: Sales of multiple integrated eligible components to related and unrelated persons with a related person election.* W, X, and Y are domestic C corporations that are members of a group of trades or businesses under common control and thus are related persons under section 45X(d)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each of W, X, and Y has a calendar year taxable year. W produces electrode active materials (EAMs) and sells the EAMs to X in 2023. W makes a valid Related Person Election under paragraph (d)(1) of this section in 2023 with regard to the sale. In 2024, X incorporates the EAMs into battery cells that it produces and sells the battery cells to Y. X makes a valid Related Person Election under paragraph (d)(1) of this section in 2024 with regard to the sale. In 2025, Y incorporates the battery cells into battery modules that it produces and sells the battery modules to Z, an unrelated person. W may claim a section 45X credit for the sale of the EAMs in 2023 because the sale to X is treated as if made to an unrelated person solely for purposes of section 45X(a). X may claim a section 45X credit for the sale of the battery cells in 2024 because the sale to Y is treated as if made to an unrelated person solely for purposes of section 45X(a). Y may claim a section 45X credit for the sale of battery modules in 2025 because Z is an unrelated person.


(f) *Applicability date.* This section applies to eligible components for which production is completed and sales occur after December 31, 2022, and during a taxable year ending on or after October 28, 2024.
