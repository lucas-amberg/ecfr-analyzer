A taxpayer may not include the same production costs in the calculation of the credit amount for more than one eligible component. For example, if the taxpayer pays or incurs production costs of $50X for eligible component 1 and an additional $100X of production costs for eligible component 2 that included integrating eligible component 1 within the meaning of § 1.45X-1(f)(1), then the production costs for eligible component 1 equal $50X and the production costs for eligible component 2 equal $100X.


(3) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:


(*i*) *Example 1.* Taxpayers X, Y and Z are unrelated C corporations that have calendar year taxable years. In 2024, X extracts raw nickel from natural mineral deposits located in the United States and purifies the extracted material to 99% nickel by mass (qualifying nickel) as required by section 45X(c)(6)(S) and § 1.45X-4(b)(19)(ii). Y subsequently purchases the qualifying nickel and uses the material to produce battery-grade nickel salts which qualify as electrode active materials within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Y sells the battery-grade nickel salts to Z in tax year 2026. Y may claim a section 45X credit for the battery-grade nickel salts in tax year 2026 because Y produced, within the meaning of § 1.45X-1(c)(2), an eligible component. In calculating its production costs with respect to such credit, Y may not include the purchase price it paid to X for the qualifying nickel because the qualifying nickel met the minimum purity requirement prescribed by section 45X(c)(6)(S) such that the material constituted an applicable critical mineral (and, accordingly, an eligible component) at the time at which Y acquired the qualifying nickel.


(*ii*) *Example 2.* Assume the facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(A)(*3*)(*i*) of this section (*Example 1*), except that X purifies the extracted raw nickel material to a purity of 90% nickel by mass, rather than 99% nickel by mass as required by section 45X(c)(6)(S) and § 1.45X-4(b)(19)(ii). Y may claim a section 45X credit for the battery-grade nickel salts in tax year 2026 because Y produced, within the meaning of § 1.45X-1(c)(2), an eligible component. In calculating its production costs with respect to such credit, Y may include the purchase price of the 90% nickel material among its production costs, provided that Y satisfies the substantiation requirements described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, because, at the time at which Y acquired such material, the material did not meet the minimum purity as required by section 45X(c)(6)(S) to constitute an applicable critical mineral.


(B) *Definition of extraction.* The term *extraction* means the activities performed to harvest minerals or natural resources from the ground or from a body of water. Extraction includes, but is not limited to, operating equipment to harvest minerals or natural resources from mines and wells and the physical processes involved in refining. Extraction also includes operating equipment to extract minerals or natural resources from the waste or residue of prior extraction, including crude oil extraction to the extent that processes applied to that crude oil yield an applicable critical mineral or an electrode active material as a byproduct. Extraction concludes when activities are performed to convert raw mined or harvested products or raw well effluent to substances that can be readily transported or stored for direct use in critical mineral or electrode active material processing. Extraction does not include activities that begin with a recyclable commodity (as such activities are recycling). Extraction does not include the chemical and thermal processes involved in refining.


(C) *Substantiation.* In order to include direct or indirect materials costs as defined in § 1.263A-1(e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(3)(ii)(E) as production costs when calculating a section 45X credit for the production and sale of an electrode active material, a taxpayer, as part of filing an annual tax return (or a return for a short year within the meaning of section 443 of the Code), must include the information in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C)(*1*) of this section as an attachment to that return, prepare the information required in paragraphs (e)(2)(iv)(C)(*2*) through (*4*) of this section and maintain that information in the taxpayer's books and records under section 6001, and comply with directions for the information required in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C)(*5*) of this section as specified in guidance:


(*1*) Certifications from any supplier, including the supplier's employer identification number and that is signed under penalties of perjury, from which the taxpayer purchased any constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents of the taxpayer's electrode active material, stating that the supplier is not claiming the section 45X credit with respect to any of the material acquired by the taxpayer, nor is the supplier aware that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that material claimed a section 45X credit for the material.


(*2*) A document that provides an analysis of any constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents that concludes the material did not meet the definition of an eligible component (for example, did not meet the definition of applicable critical mineral or electrode active material) at the time of acquisition by the taxpayer. The document may be prepared by the taxpayer or ideally by an independent third-party.


(*3*) A list of all direct and indirect material costs and the amount of such costs that were included within the taxpayer's total production cost for each electrode active material.


(*4*) A document related to the taxpayer's production activities with respect to the direct and indirect material costs that establishes the materials were used in the production of the electrode active material. The document may be prepared by the taxpayer or ideally by an independent third-party.


(*5*) Any other information related to the direct or indirect materials specified in guidance.


(D) Failure to provide the documentation described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C) of this section with the return filing, or providing an available upon request statement, will constitute a failure to substantiate the claim.


(v) *Materials that are both electrode active materials and applicable critical minerals*—(A) *In general.* A material that qualifies as an electrode active material and an applicable critical material is eligible for the section 45X credit. A taxpayer may claim the section 45X credit with respect to such material either as an electrode active material or an applicable critical material, but not both.


(B) *Example.* Lithium carbonate is an electrode active material because it is a direct battery-grade precursor to electrolyte salts, which are processed materials found in a final battery cell.

(A) *Modules using battery cells.* A module using battery cells, is a module with two or more battery cells that are configured electrically, in series or parallel, to create voltage or current, as appropriate, to a specified end use, meaning an end-use configuration of battery technologies. An end-use configuration is the product that combines cells into a module such that any subsequent manufacturing is done to the module rather than to the cells. Where multiple points in a supply chain may be eligible under this section, the first module produced and sold that meets the requirements of this section and the kilowatt-hour requirement in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section will be the only module eligible.




(B) *Modules with no battery cells.* A *module with no battery cells* means a product with a standardized manufacturing process and form that is capable of storing and dispatching useful energy, that contains an energy storage medium that remains in the module (for example, it is not consumed through combustion), and that is not a custom-built electricity generation or storage facility. For example, neither standalone fuel storage tanks nor fuel tanks connected to engines or generation systems qualify as modules with no battery cells.


(ii) *Capacity measurement*—(A) *Modules using battery cells.* Taxpayers must measure the capacity of a module using battery cells with a testing procedure that complies with a national or international standard published by a recognized standard setting organization. The capacity of a battery module may not exceed the total nameplate capacity of the battery cells in the module. Taxpayers must measure the capacity of a battery cell in accordance with a national or international standard, such as IEC 60086-1 (Primary Batteries), or an equivalent standard. Taxpayers can reference the USABC Battery Test Manual for additional guidance.


(B) *Modules with no battery cells.* Taxpayers must measure the capacity of a module with no battery cells with a testing procedure that complies with a national or international standard published by a recognized standard setting organization. Taxpayers producing thermal and thermochemical battery modules described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section must convert the energy storage to a kilowatt-hour basis and provide both methodology and testing regarding this conversion. Such conversion of the kilowatt-hour basis cannot exceed the total direct conversion of the total nameplate capacity of the thermal battery module to kilowatt-hours.


(C) *Substantiation of capacity measurement.* Taxpayers must maintain the testing standard and methodology with respect to the capacity measurement described in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section as part of books and records under section 6001 and § 1.6001-1. The testing procedure and methodology must consistently be used, subject to any updated standard of the same methodology and testing, for battery modules (with or without cells) sold in the taxpayer's trade or business.


(iii) *Credit amount*—(A) *Modules using battery cells.* For a battery module with cells, the credit amount is equal to the product of $10 multiplied by the capacity of such battery module, subject to the limitation provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. The capacity of each battery module is expressed on a kilowatt-hour basis.


(B) *Modules with no battery cells.* For a battery module without cells, the credit amount is equal to the product of $45 multiplied by the capacity of such battery module, subject to the limitation provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. The capacity of each battery module is expressed on a kilowatt-hour basis.


(5) *Limitation on capacity of battery cells and battery modules*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) and (e)(4)(iii) of this section, the capacity determined with respect to a battery cell or battery module must not exceed a capacity-to-power ratio of 100:1.


(ii) *Capacity to power ratio.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, *capacity-to-power ratio* means, with respect to a battery cell or battery module, the ratio of the capacity of such cell or module to the maximum discharge amount of such cell or module.


(f) *Phase out rule*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, in the case of any eligible component sold after December 31, 2029, the amount of the section 45X credit determined with respect to such eligible component must be equal to the product of—


(i) The amount determined under this section with respect to such eligible component, multiplied by


(ii) The phase out percentage under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.


(2) *Phase out percentages.* The phase out percentage is equal to—


(i) 75 percent for eligible components sold during calendar year 2030;


(ii) 50 percent for eligible components sold during calendar year 2031;


(iii) 25 percent for eligible components sold during calendar year 2032, and


(iv) Zero percent for eligible components sold after calendar year 2032.


(3) *Exception for applicable critical minerals.* The phase out rules described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section apply to all eligible components except applicable critical minerals.


(g) *Applicability date.* This section applies to eligible components for which production is completed and sales occur after December 31, 2022, and during a taxable year ending on or after October 28, 2024.
