# § 1.46-1   Determination of amount.

(a) *Effective dates*—(1) *In general.* This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975. However, transitional rules under paragraph (g) of this section are effective for certain earlier taxable years.


(2) *Acts covered.* This section reflects changes made by the following Acts of Congress: 


(3) *Prior regulations.* For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, see 26 CFR 1.46-1 (Rev. as of April 1, 1979). Those regulations do not reflect changes made by Pub. L. 89-384, Pub. L. 89-389, and Pub. L. 91-172.


(b) *General rule.* The amount of investment credit (credit) allowed by section 38 for the taxable year is the portion of credit available under section 46(a)(1) that does not exceed the limitation based on tax under section 46(a)(3).


(c) *Credit available.* The credit available for the taxable year is the sum of—


(1) Unused credit carried over from prior taxable years under section 46(b) (carryovers).


(2) Amount of credit determined under section 46(a)(2) for the taxable year (credit earned), and


(3) Unused credit carried back from succeeding taxable years under section 46(b) (carrybacks).


(d) *Credit earned.* The credit earned for the taxable year is the sum of the following percentages of qualified investment (as determined under section 46 (c) and (d))— 


(1) The regular percentage (as determined under section 46), 


(2) For energy property, the energy percentage (as determined under section 46), and 


(3) For the portion of the basis of a qualified rehabilitated building (as defined in § 1.48-12(b)) that is attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures (as defined in § 1.48-12(c)), the rehabilitation percentage (as determined under section 46(b)(4)). 


(e) *Designation of credits.* The credit available for the taxable year is designated as follows:


(1) The credit attributable to the regular percentage is the “regular credit”.


(2) The credit attributable to the ESOP percentage is the “ESOP credit”.


(3) The credit attributable to the energy percentage for energy property other than solar or wind is the “nonrefundable energy credit”.


(4) The credit attributable to the energy percentage for solar or wind energy property is the “refundable energy credit”.


(5) The credit attributable to the rehabilitation percentage for qualified rehabilitation expenditures is the rehabilitation investment credit. 


(f) *Special rules for certain energy property.* Energy property is defined in section 48(l). Under section 46(a)(2)(D), energy property that is section 38 property solely by reason of section 48(l)(1) qualifies only for the energy credit. Other energy property qualifies for both the regular credit (and, if applicable, the ESOP credit) and the energy credit. For limitation on the energy percentage for property financed by industrial development bonds, see section 48(l)(11).


(g) *Transitional rule for regular and ESOP credit*—(1) *In general.* Although section 46(a)(2) was amended by section 301(a)(1) of the Energy Tax Act of 1977 to eliminate the transitional rules under section 46(a)(2)(D), those rules still apply in certain instances. Section 46(a)(2)(D) was added by section 301(a) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 and amended by section 802(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976.


(2) *Regular credit.* Under section 46(a)(2)(D), the regular credit is 10 percent and applies for the following property:


(i) Property to which section 46 (d) does not apply, the construction, reconstruction, or erection of which is completed by the taxpayer after January 21, 1975, but only to the extent of basis attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after that date.


(ii) Property to which section 46(d) does not apply, acquired by the taxpayer after January 21, 1975.


(iii) Qualified progress expenditures (as defined in section 46(d)) made after January 21, 1975. 


(3) *ESOP credit.* See section 48(m) for transitional rules limiting the period for which the ESOP percentage under section 46(a)(2)(E) applies. For prior statutes, see section 46(a)(2) (B) and (D), as added by section 301 of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 and amended by section 802 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976.


(4) *Cross reference.* (i) The principles of § 1.48-2 (b) and (c) apply in determining the portion of basis attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after January 21, 1975, and in determining the time when property is acquired.


(ii) Section 311 of the Revenue Act of 1978 made the 10 percent regular credit permanent.


(5) *Seven percent credit.* To the extent that, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the 10 percent does not apply, the regular credit, in general, is 7 percent. For a special limitation on qualified investment for public utility property (other than energy property), see section 46(c)(3)(A).


(6) *Qualified progress expenditures.* For progress expenditure property that is constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer within the meaning of § 1.48-2(b), the ten-percent credit applies in the year the property is placed in service to the portion of the qualified investment that remains after reduction for qualified progress expenditures under section 46(c)(4), but only to the extent that the remaining qualified investment is attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after January 21, 1975. For progress expenditure property that is acquired by the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.48-2(b)) after January 21, 1975, and placed in service after that date, the ten-percent credit applies in the year the property is placed in service to the entire portion of qualified investment that remains after reduction for qualified progress expenditures. 


(h) *Tax liability limitation*—(1) *In general.* Section 46(a)(3) provides a tax liability limitation on the amount of credit allowed by section 38 (other than the refundable energy credit) for any taxable year. See section 46(a)(10)(C)(i). Tax liability is defined in paragraph (j) of this section. The excess of available credit over the applicable tax liability limitation for the year is an unused credit which may be carried forward or carried back under section 46(b).


(2) *Regular and ESOP tax liability limitation.* In general, the tax liability limitation for the regular and ESOP credits is the portion of tax liability that does not exceed $25,000 plus a percentage of the excess, as determined under section 46(a)(3)(B).


(3) *Nonrefundable energy credit tax liability limitation.* (i) For nonrefundable energy credit carrybacks to a taxable year ending before October 1, 1978, the tax liability limitation is the portion of tax liability that does not exceed $25,000 plus a percentage of the excess, as determined under section 46(a)(3)(B).


(ii) For a taxable year ending after September 30, 1978, the tax liability limitation for available nonrefundable energy credit is 100 percent of the year's tax liability.


(4) *Alternative limitations.* Alternative limitations apply for certain utilities, railroads, and airlines in determining the regular tax liability limitation and, for nonrefundable energy credit carrybacks to taxable years ending before October 1, 1978, the nonrefundable energy credit tax liability limitation. These alternative limitations do not apply in determining the energy tax liability limitation for a taxable year ending after October 1, 1978. The provisions listed below set forth the alternative limitations:


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Tax liability*—(1) *In general.* “Tax liability” for purposes of the regular and ESOP credit and carrybacks of nonrefundable energy credit to a taxable year ending before October 1, 1978, means the liability for tax as defined in section 46(a)(4). For ordering of regular, ESOP, and nonrefundable energy credits, see paragraph (m) of this section. In addition to taxes excluded under section 46(a)(4), tax liability does not include tax resulting from recapture of credit under section 47 and the alternative minimum tax imposed by section 55. See sections 47(c) and 55(c)(1).


(2) *Certain nonrefundable energy credit.* For a taxable year ending after September 30, 1978, “tax liability” for purposes of the nonrefundable energy credit is liability for tax, as defined in section 46(a)(4) and paragraph (j)(1) of this section, reduced by the regular and ESOP credit allowed for the taxable year. Thus, carrybacks of regular or ESOP credit to a taxable year may displace nonrefundable energy carryovers or credit earned taken into account in that year. However, carrybacks of regular, ESOP, or nonrefundable energy credit do not affect refundable energy credit which is treated as an overpayment of tax under section 6401(b). See paragraph (k) of this section.


(k) *Special rule for refundable energy credit.* The amount of the refundable energy credit is determined under the rules of section 46 (other than section 46(a)(3)). However, to permit the refund, the refundable energy credit for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (other than section 38, part IVB, and chapter 63 of the Code) is treated as allowed by section 39 and not by section 38. The refundable credit is not applied against tax liability for purposes of determining the tax liability limitation for other investment credits. Rather, it is treated as an overpayment of tax under section 6401(b).


(l) *FIFO rule.* If the credit available for a taxable year is not allowed in full because of the tax liability limitation, special rules determine the order in which credits are applied. Under the first-in-first-out rule of section 46(a)(1) (FIFO), carryovers are applied against the tax liability limitation first. To the extent the tax liability limitation exceeds carryovers, credit earned, and carrybacks are then applied.


(m) *Special ordering rule*—(1) *In general.* Under section 46(a)(10)(A), the FIFO rule applies separately—


(i) First, with respect to regular and ESOP credits, and


(ii) Second, with respect to nonrefundable energy credit.


(2) *Regular and ESOP credit.* Under § 1.46-8(c)(9)(ii), regular and ESOP credits available are applied in the following order: 


(i) Regular carryovers;


(ii) ESOP carryovers;


(iii) Regular credit earned;


(iv) ESOP credit earned;


(v) Regular carrybacks; and


(vi) ESOP carrybacks.


(3) *Example.* For an example of the order of application of regular and ESOP credits, see § 1.46-8(c)(9)(iii). 


(n) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section.


(o) *Married individuals.* If a separate return is filed by a husband or wife, the tax liability limitation is computed by substituting a $12,500 amount for the $25,000 amount that applies under section 46(a)(3). However, this reduction of the $25,000 amount to $12,500 applies only if the taxpayer's spouse is entitled to a credit under section 38 for the taxable year of such spouse which ends with, or within, the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer's spouse is entitled to a credit under section 38 either because of investment made in qualified property for such taxable year of the spouse (whether directly made by such spouse or whether apportioned to such spouse, for example, from an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371(b)), or because of an investment credit carryback or carryover to such taxable year. The determination of whether an individual is married shall be made under the principles of section 143 and the regulations thereunder. 


(p) *Apportionment of $25,000 amount among component members of a controlled group*—(1) *In general.* In determining the tax liability limitation under section 46(a)(3) for corporations that are component members of a controlled group on December 31, only one $25,000 amount is available to those component members for their taxable years that include that December 31. See subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for apportionment of such amount among such component members. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for definition of “component member”. 


(2) *Manner of apportionment.* (i) In the case of corporations which are component members of a controlled group on a particular December 31, the $25,000 amount may be apportioned among such members for their taxable years that include such December 31 in any manner the component members may select, provided that each such member less than 100 percent of whose stock is owned, in the aggregate, by the other component members of the group on such December 31 consents to an apportionment plan. The consent of a component member to an apportionment plan with respect to a particular December 31 shall be made by means of a statement, signed by a person duly authorized to act on behalf of the consenting member, stating that such member consents to the apportionment plan with respect to such December 31. The statement shall set forth the name, address, employer identification number, and taxable year of each component member of the group on such December 31, the amount apportioned to each such member under the plan, and the location of the Service Center where the statement is to be filed. The consent of more than one component member may be incorporated in a single statement. The statement shall be timely filed with the Service Center where the component member having the taxable year first ending on or after such December 31 files its return for such taxable year and shall be irrevocable after such filing. If two or more component members have the same such taxable year, a statement of consent may be filed by any one of such members. However, if the due date (including any extensions of time) of the return of such member is on or before December 15, 1971, the required statement shall be considered as timely filed if filed on or before March 15, 1972. Each component member of the group on such December 31 shall keep as a part of its records a copy of the statement containing all the required consents. 


(ii) An apportionment plan adopted by a controlled group with respect to a particular December 31 shall be valid only for the taxable year of each member of the group which includes such December 31. Thus, a controlled group must file a separate consent to an apportionment plan with respect to each taxable year which includes a December 31 as to which an apportionment plan is desired. 


(iii) If the apportionment plan is not timely filed, the $25,000 amount specified in section 46(a)(3) shall be reduced for each component member of the controlled group, for its taxable year which includes a December 31, to an amount equal to $25,000 divided by the number of component members of such group on such December 31. 


(iv) If a component member of the controlled group makes its income tax return on the basis of a 52-53-week taxable year, the principles of section 441(f)(2)(A)(ii) and § 1.441-2 apply in determining the last day of such taxable year. 


(3) *Definitions of controlled group of corporations and component member of controlled group.* For the purpose of this paragraph, the terms “controlled group of corporations” and “component member” of a controlled group of corporations shall have the same meaning assigned to those terms in section 1563 (a) and (b). For purposes of applying § 1.1563-1(b)(2)(ii)(*c*), an electing small business corporation shall be treated as an excluded member whether or not it is subject to the tax imposed by section 1378. 


(4) *Members of a controlled group filing a consolidated return.* If some component members of a controlled group join in filing a consolidated return pursuant to § 1.1502-3(a)(3), and other component members do not join, then, unless a consent is timely filed apportioning the $25,000 amount among the group filing the consolidated return and the other component members of the controlled group, each component member of the controlled group (including each component member which joins in filing the consolidated return) shall be treated as a separate corporation for purposes of equally apportioning the $25,000 amount under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph. In that case, the tax liability limitation for the group filing the consolidated return is computed by substituting for the $25,000 amount under section 46(a)(3) the total amount apportioned to each component member that joins in filing the consolidated return. If the affiliated group filing the consolidated return and the other component members of the controlled group adopt an apportionment plan, the affiliated group shall be treated as a single member for the purpose of applying subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph. Thus, for example, only one consent executed by the common parent to the apportionment plan is required for the group filing the consolidated return. If any component member of the controlled group which joins in the filing of the consolidated return is an organization to which section 593 applies or a cooperative organization described in section 1381(a), see paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of § 1.1502-3. 


(5) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(q) *Rehabilitation percentage*—(1) *General rule*—(i) *In general.* Due to amendments made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, different rules apply depending on when the property attributable to the qualified rehabilitated expenditures (as defined in § 1.48-12(c)) is placed in service. Paragraph (q)(1)(ii) of this section contains the general rule relating to property placed in service after December 31, 1986. Paragraph (q)(1)(iii) of this section contains rules relating to property placed in service before January 1, 1987. Paragraph (q)(1)(iv) of this section contains rules relating to property placed in service after December 31, 1986, that qualifies for a transition rule. 


(ii) *Property placed in service after December 31, 1986.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (q)(1)(iv) of this section, in the case of section 38 property described in section 48(a)(1)(E) placed in service after December 31, 1986, the term “rehabilitation percentage” means— 


(A) 10 percent in the case of qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building other than a certified historic structure, and 


(B) 20 percent in the case of qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a certified historic structure. 


(iii) *Property placed in service before January 1, 1987.* For qualified rehabilitation expenditures (as defined in § 1.48-12(c)) with respect to property placed in service before January 1, 1987, section 46(b)(4)(A) as in effect prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provided for a three-tier rehabilitation percentage. The applicable rehabilitation percentage for such expenditures depends on whether the qualified rehabilitated building is a “30-year building,” a “40-year building,” or a certified historic structure (as defined in section 48(g)(3) and § 1.48-12(d)(1)). The rehabilitation percentage for such qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building is 15 percent to the extent that the building is a 30-year building (*i.e.,* at least 30 years, but less than 40 years, has elapsed between the date the physical work on the rehabilitation began and the date the building was first placed in service), 20 percent to the extent that the building is a 40-year building (*i.e.,* at least 40 years has so elapsed), and 25 percent for certified historic structures, regardless of age. See paragraph (q)(2)(ii) of this section for rules concerning buildings to which additions have been added. 


(iv) *Property placed in service after December 31, 1986, that qualifies under the transition rules.* In the case of section 38 property described in section 48(a)(1)(E) placed in service after December 31, 1986, and to which the amendments made by section 251 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 do not apply because the transition rules in section 251(d) of that Act and § 1.48-12(a)(2)(iv)(B) or (C) apply, the rehabilitation percentage for a “30-year building” (within the meaning of paragraph (q)(1)(iii) of this section) shall be 10 percent, the rehabilitation percentage for a “40-year building” (within the meaning of paragraph (q)(1)(iii) of this section) shall be 13 percent, and the rehabilitation percentage for a certified historic structure shall be 25 percent. 


(2) *Special rules*—(i) *Moved buildings.* With respect to paragraph (q)(1)(ii) of this section, § 1.48-12(b)(5) provides that a building (other than a certified historic structure) is not a qualified rehabilitated building unless it has been at the location where it is being rehabilitated since January 1, 1936. In addition, for purposes of paragraph (q)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, a building is not a “30-year building” unless it has been at the location where it is being rehabilitated for the thirty-year period immediately preceding the beginning of the rehabilitation process, and is not a “40-year building” unless it has been at the location where it is being rehabilitated for the forty-year period immediately preceding the beginning of the rehabilitation process. 


(ii) *Building to which additions have been added*—(A) *Property placed in service after December 31, 1986.* For purposes of paragraph (q)(1)(ii) of this section, if part of a building meets the definition of a qualified rehabilitated building, and part of the building does not meet the definition of a qualified rehabilitated building because such part is an addition that was placed in service after December 31, 1935, the qualified rehabilitation expenditures made to the building must be allocated to the pre-1936 portion of the building and the post-1935 portion of the building using the principles in § 1.48-12(c)(10)(ii). Qualified rehabilitation expenditures attributable to the post-1935 addition shall not qualify for the 10 percent rehabilitation percentage. 


(B) *Property placed in service before January 1, 1987, and property qualifying for a transitional rule.* For purposes of paragraphs (q)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, if part of a building meets the definition of a “40-year building” and part of the building is an addition that was placed in service less than forty years before physical work on the rehabilitation began but more than thirty years before such date, then the qualified rehabilitation expenditures made to the building shall be allocated between the forty year old portion of the building and the thirty year old portion of the building, and a 20 percent rehabilitation percentage shall be applied to the forty year old portion of the building and a 15 percent rehabilitation percentage shall be applied to the thirty year old portion. This allocation shall be made using the principles in § 1.48-12(c)(10)(ii). If an allocation cannot be made between the expenditures to the forty year old portion of the building and the thirty year old portion of the building, then the building will be considered to be a 30-year building. Furthermore, for purposes of this paragraph (q), a building (other than a certified historic structure) is not a qualified rehabilitated building to the extent of that portion of the building that is less than 30 years old. If rehabilitation expenditures are incurred with respect to an addition to a qualified rehabilitated building, but the addition is not considered to be part of the qualified rehabilitated building because the addition does not meet the age requirement in section 48(g)(1)(B) (as in effect prior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and § 1.48-12(b)(4)(i)(B), then no rehabilitation percentage will be applied to the expenditures attributable to the rehabilitation of the addition. Thus, for purposes of paragraphs (q)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, it may be necessary to allocate rehabilitation expenditures incurred with respect to a building between the original portion of the building and the addition. 


(iii) *Mixed-use buildings.* If qualified rehabilitation expenditures are incurred for property that is excluded from section 38 property described in section 48(a)(1)(E) (because, for example, they are made with respect to a portion of the building used for lodging within the meaning of section 48(a)(3) and § 1.48-1(h)), an allocation of the expenditures must be made between the expenditures that result in an addition to basis that is section 38 property and the expenditures that result in an addition to basis that is excluded from the definition of section 38 property since the rehabilitation percentage is applicable only to section 38 property. These allocations should be made using the principles contained in § 1.48-12(c)(10)(ii). 


(3) *Regular and energy percentages not to apply.* The regular percentage and the energy percentage shall not apply to that portion of the basis of any building that is attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures (as defined in § 1.48-12(c)).


(4) *Effective date.* The rehabilitation percentage is applicable only to qualified rehabilitation expenditures (as defined in § 1.48-12(c)). For rules relating to applicability of the regular percentage to qualified rehabilitation expenditures (as defined in § 1.48-11(c)), see § 1.48-11.
