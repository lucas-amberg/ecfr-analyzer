# § 1.47-3   Exceptions to the application of § 1.47-1.

(a) *In general.* Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2, relating to “disposition” and “cessation,” paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply if paragraph (b) of this section (relating to transfers by reason of death), paragraph (c) of this section (relating to property destroyed by casualty), paragraph (d) of this section (relating to reselection of used section 38 property), paragraph (e) of this section (relating to transactions to which section 381(a) applies), paragraph (f) of this section (relating to mere change in form of conducting a trade or business), paragraph (g) of this section (relating to sale-and-leaseback transactions), or paragraph (h) of this section (relating to certain property replaced after Apr. 18, 1969) applies with respect to such disposition or cessation. 


(b) *Transfers by reason of death*—(1) *General rule.* Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2, relating to “disposition” and “cessation”, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to a transfer of section 38 property by reason of the death of the taxpayer. Thus, for example, with respect to section 38 property held in joint tenancy, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to the transfer of the deceased taxpayer's interest to the surviving joint tenant. If, under § 1.48-4, the lessor of new section 38 property made a valid election to treat the lessee as having purchased such property for purposes of the credit allowed by section 38, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 does not apply if, by reason of the death of the lessee, there is a termination of the lease and transfer of the leased property to the lessor, or there is an assignment of the lease and transfer of the leased property to another person. Moreover, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 does not apply to the transfer of a partner's interest in a partnership, a beneficiary's interest in an estate or trust, or shares of stock of a shareholder of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)) by reason of the death of such partner, beneficiary, or shareholder. Paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to property prior to his death even if the value of such gift is included in his gross estate for estate tax purposes (such as, a gift in contemplation of death under section 2035). The effect of this subparagraph is that any section 38 property held by a taxpayer at the time of his death is deemed to have been held by him for its entire estimated useful life. 


(2) *Examples.* Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(c) *Property destroyed by casualty*—(1) *Dispositions after April 18, 1969.* Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2, relating to “disposition” and “cessation”, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to property which, after April 18, 1969, and before August 16, 1971, is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer on account of its destruction or damage by fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or by reason of its theft. 


(2) *Dispositions before April 19, 1969.* (i) In the case of property which, before April 19, 1969, is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer on account of its destruction or damage by fire, storm, shipwreck or other casualty, or by reason of its theft, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall apply except to the extent provided in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph. 


(ii) Paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply if— 


(*a*) Section 38 property is placed in service by the taxpayer to replace (within the meaning of paragraph (h) of § 1.46-3) the destroyed, damaged, or stolen property, and 


(*b*) The basis (or cost) of the section 38 property which is placed in service by the taxpayer to replace the destroyed, damaged, or stolen property is reduced under paragraph (h) of § 1.46-3. 


(iii) If property which would be section 38 property but for section 49 is placed in service by the taxpayer to replace the destroyed, damaged, or stolen property, then the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section (other than the requirement that the replacement take place within 6 months after the disposition) shall apply. 


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(d) *Reselection of used section 38 property*—(1) *Reselection.* If— 


(i) Used section 38 property (as defined in § 1.48-3) the cost of which was taken into account in computing the taxpayer's qualified investment is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing such qualified investment, and 


(ii) For the taxable year in which the property described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph was placed in service, the sum of (*a*) the cost of used section 38 property placed in service by the taxpayer, and (*b*) the cost of used section 38 property apportioned to such taxpayer exceeded $50,000, 


(2) *Application of paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1.* (i) If a taxpayer treats, under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the cost of any used section 38 property which was not originally selected as having been selected in place of the cost of used section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, then, not withstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2 (relating to “disposition” and “cessation”), paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph to the extent of the cost of the newly selected used section 38 property. 


(ii) If the cost of the used section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph exceeds the cost of the newly selected used section 38 property, then the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall cease to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer to the extent of such excess. 


(iii) If the newly selected used section 38 property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of the estimated useful life of the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, then, unless he reselects other used section 38 property, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall apply with respect to such newly selected used section 38 property. For purposes of recomputing qualified investment with respect to such newly selected used section 38 property the actual useful life shall be deemed to be the period beginning with the date on which the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph was placed in service by the taxpayer and ending with the date of the disposition or cessation with respect to such newly selected used section 38 property. See paragraph (c) of § 1.47-1, relating to date placed in service and date of disposition or cessation. 


(3) *Information requirement.* (i) If in any taxable year this paragraph applies to a taxpayer, such taxpayer shall attach to his income tax return for such taxable year a statement containing the information required by subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. 


(ii) The statement referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall contain the following information: 


(*a*) The taxpayer's name, address and taxpayer account number; and 


(*b*) With respect to the originally selected used section 38 property and the newly selected used section 38 property, the month and year placed in service, cost, and estimated useful life. 


(4) *Examples.* This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(e) *Transactions to which section 381(a) applies*—(1) *General rule.* Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2, relating to “disposition” and “cessation”, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to a disposition of section 38 property in a transaction to which section 381(a) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies. If the section 38 property described in the preceding sentence is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the acquiring corporation, before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing the transferor corporation's qualified investment, then paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall apply to the acquiring corporation with respect to such section 38 property. For purposes of recomputing qualified investment with respect to such property its actual useful life shall be the period beginning with the date on which it was placed in service by the transferor corporation and ending with the date of the disposition by, or cessation with respect to, the acquiring corporation. 


(2) *Examples.* This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(f) *Mere change in form of conducting a trade or business*—(1) *General rule.* (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2, relating to “disposition” and “cessation”, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply to section 38 property which is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing the taxpayer's qualified investment by reason of a mere change in the form of conducting the trade or business in which such section 38 property is used provided that the conditions set forth in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph are satisfied. 


(ii) The conditions referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph are as follows: 


(*a*) The section 38 property described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is retained as section 38 property in the same trade or business, 


(*b*) The transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation, the partner, beneficiary, or shareholder) of such section 38 property retains a substantial interest in such trade or business, 


(*c*) Substantially all the assets (whether or not section 38 property) necessary to operate such trade or business are transferred to the transferee to whom such section 38 property is transferred, and 


(*d*) The basis of such section 38 property in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such section 38 property in the hands of the transferor. This subparagraph shall not apply to the transfer of section 38 property if paragraph (e) of this section, relating to transactions to which section 381 applies, applies with respect to such transfer. 


(2) *Substantial interest.* For purposes of this paragraph, a transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation, the partner, beneficiary, or shareholder) shall be considered as having retained a substantial interest in the trade or business only if, after the change in form, his interest in such trade or business— 


(i) Is substantial in relation to the total interest of all persons, or 


(ii) Is equal to or greater than his interest prior to the change in form. 


(3) *Property held for the production of income.* Subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph applies to section 38 property held for the production of income (within the meaning of section 167(a)(2)) as well as to section 38 property used in a trade or business. 


(4) *Leased property.* In a case where a lessor of new section 38 property made a valid election, under § 1.48-4, to treat the lessee as having purchased such property for purposes of the credit allowed by section 38, in determining whether subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph applies to an assignment of the lease and transfer of possession of such property, the condition contained in subparagraph (1)(ii)(*d*) of this paragraph is not applicable. 


(5) *Disposition or cessation.* (i) If section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph is disposed of by the transferee, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the transferee, before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing the qualified investment of the transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation, the qualified investment of the partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders) then under paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 such property ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the transferor (or such partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders), and a recapture determination shall be made with respect to such property. For purposes of recomputing qualified investment with respect to such property, the actual useful life shall be the period beginning with the date on which it was placed in service by the transferor and ending with the date of the disposition by, or cessation with respect to, the transferee. 


(ii) If in any taxable year the transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation, the partner, beneficiary, or shareholder) of the section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph does not retain a substantial interest in the trade or business directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided that such other entities' bases in such interest are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the transferor) then, under paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1, such property ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the transferor and he (or the partner, beneficiary, or shareholder) shall make a recapture determination. For purposes of recomputing qualified investment with respect to property described in this subdivision, its actual useful life shall be the period beginning with the date on which it was placed in service by the transferor and ending with the first date on which the transferor (or the partner, beneficiary, or shareholder) does not retain a substantial interest in the trade or business. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in a trade or business under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in such trade or business after any such transfer or transfers. 


(iii) In making a recapture determination under this subparagraph there shall be taken into account any prior recapture determinations with respect to the transferor in connection with the same property. 


(iv) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in the case of a mere change in the form of a trade or business, if the interest of a taxpayer in the trade or business is reduced but such taxpayer has retained a substantial interest in such trade or business, paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.47-4 (relating to electing small business corporations), paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.47-5 (relating to estates or trusts) or paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.47-6 (relating to partnerships) shall apply, as the case may be. 


(6) *Examples.* This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that the transfer satisfies the conditions of subparagraphs (1)(ii) (*a*), (*c*), and (*d*) of this paragraph. 


(g) *Sale-and-leaseback transactions*—(1) *In general.* Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.47-2, relating to “disposition” and “cessation”, paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall not apply where section 38 property is disposed of and as part of the same transaction is leased back to the vendor even though gain or loss is recognized to the vendor-lessee and the property ceases to be subject to depreciation in his hands. If paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 applies with respect to such property subsequent to the transaction, the actual useful life shall begin with the date on which such property was first placed in service by the vendor-lessee as owner. 


(2) *Special rule for progress expenditure property.* The sale and leaseback (or agreement or contract to leaseback) of progress expenditure property (including any contract rights to the property), in general, will be treated as a cessation described in section 47(a)(3)(A) with respect to the seller-lessee. However, a sale and leaseback (or agreement or contract to leaseback) will not be treated as a cessation to the extent qualified investment passed through to the lessee under section 48(d) in the year the property is placed in service equals or exceeds qualified progress expenditures for the property taken into account by the lessee. If a sale-leaseback transaction is treated as a cessation, qualified investment must be reduced and the credit recomputed, beginning with the most recent credit year (*i.e.,* the most recent year property is taken into account in computing qualified investment under § 1.46-3 or 1.46-5). The amount of the reduction is the amount, if any, by which qualified progress expenditures taken into account by the lessee in all prior years exceeds qualified investment passed through to the lessee under section 48(d). This paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to any progress expenditure property that has been placed in service by a vendor-lessee (as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) prior to a sale-leaseback of that property in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(h) *Certain property replaced after April 18, 1969*—(1) *In general.* (i) If section 38 property is disposed of and property which is, for purposes of section 1033 and the regulations thereunder, similar or related in service or use to the property disposed of and which would be section 38 property but for the application of section 49 is placed in service to replace the property disposed of, the increase in income tax and adjustment of investment credit carryovers and carrybacks resulting from the recomputation under paragraph (a) of § 1.47-1 shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the credit that would be allowed for the qualified investment of the replacement property (determined as if such property were section 38 property). The preceding sentence shall not apply unless the replacement takes place within 6 months after the disposition. If property otherwise qualifies as replacement property, it is immaterial that it is placed in service (for example, to undergo testing) before the replaced property is disposed of. The assignment by the taxpayer in his return of an estimated useful life to the replacement property in computing its qualified investment will be considered a representation by the taxpayer that he expects to retain the replacement property for its entire estimated useful life. If such property is disposed of before the end of such life, then the circumstances surrounding the replacement will be examined to determine whether the taxpayer's representation was in good faith and, if appropriate, the qualified investment of the replacement property will be recomputed for the year of replacement using the actual useful life of such property. 


(ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example: 


(2) *Leased property.* Property disposed of may be replaced with property leased from another, provided (i) an election with respect to the newly leased property could be made under section 48(d) but for section 49, and (ii) the lessee obtains the lessor's written statement that he will not claim such property as replacement property under this paragraph. The statement of the lessor shall contain the information specified in subdivisions (i) through (vii) of § 1.48-4(f)(1) and the statement (or a copy thereof) shall be retained in the records of the lessor and the lessee for a period of at least 3 years after the property is transferred to the lessee.
