# § 1.47-5   Estates and trusts.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Disposition or cessation in hands of estate or trust.* If an estate or trust disposes of any section 38 property (or if any section 38 property otherwise ceases to be section 38 property in the hands of the estate or trust) before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing qualified investment with respect to such property, a recapture determination shall be made with respect to the estate or trust, and each beneficiary who is treated, under § 1.48-6, as a taxpayer with respect to such property. Each such recapture determination shall be made with respect to the share of the basis (or cost) of such property taken into account by such estate or trust and such beneficiary in computing its or his each such recapture determination the actual useful life of such property shall be the period beginning with the date on which it was placed in service by the estate or trust and ending with the date of the disposition or cessation. In making a recapture determination under this subparagraph with respect to a taxpayer there shall be taken into account any prior recapture determinations made with respect to such taxpayer in connection with the same property. For definition of “recapture determination” see paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.47-1. 


(2) *Disposition of interest.* (i) If— 


(*a*) The basis (or cost) of section 38 property is apportioned, under § 1.48-6, to an estate or trust which, or to a beneficiary of an estate or trust who, takes such basis (or cost) into account in computing his qualified investment, and 


(*b*) After the date on which such section 38 property was placed in service by the estate or trust and before the close of the estimated useful life of the property, such estate's, trust's, or such beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust is reduced (for example, by a sale, or by the terms of the estate or trust instrument) below the percentage specified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, then, on the date of such reduction, such section 38 property ceases to be section 38 property with respect to such estate, trust, or beneficiary to the extent of the actual reduction in such estate's, trust's, or beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust. (For example, if $100 of the basis of section 38 property was apportioned to a beneficiary and if his proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust is reduced from 60 percent to 30 percent (that is, 50 percent of his original interest), then such property shall be treated as having ceased to be section 38 property to the extent of $50). Accordingly, a recapture determination shall be made with respect to such estate, trust, or beneficiary. For purposes of such recapture determination the actual useful life of such property shall be the period beginning with the date on which it was placed in service by the estate or trust and ending with the date on which it is treated as having ceased to be section 38 property with respect to the estate, trust, or beneficiary. In making a recapture determination under this subparagraph there shall be taken into account any prior recapture determination made with respect to the estate, trust, or beneficiary in connection with the same property. 


(ii) The percentage referred to in subdivision (i)(*b*) of this subparagraph is 66
2/3 percent of the estate's, trust's, or beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust for the taxable year of the apportionment under § 1.48-6. However, once property has been treated under this subparagraph as having ceased to be section 38 property to any extent the percentage referred to shall be 33
1/3 percent of the estate's, trust's, or beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust for the taxable year of the apportionment under § 1.48-6. 


(iii) In determining a beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of an estate or trust for purposes of this subparagraph, the beneficiary shall be considered to own any interest in such an estate or trust which he owns directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided such other entities' bases in such interest are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the beneficiary). For example, if A, whose proportionate interest in the income of trust X is 30 percent, transfers all of such interest to corporation Y in exchange for all of the stock of Y in a transaction to which section 351 applies, then, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, A shall be considered to own a 30-percent interest in trust X. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in an estate or trust under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in the estate or trust after any such transfer or transfers. 


(b) *Examples.* Paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that XYZ Trust, which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, acquired and placed in service on June 1, 1962, three items of section 38 property. The basis and estimated useful life of each item of section 38 property are as follows:
