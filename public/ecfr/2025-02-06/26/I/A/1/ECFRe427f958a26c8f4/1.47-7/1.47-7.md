# § 1.47-7   Rehabilitation credit allocated over a 5-year period.

(a) *In general.* For purposes of section 46, for any taxable year during the 5-year period beginning in the taxable year in which a qualified rehabilitated building, as defined in section 47(c)(1) and § 1.48-12(b), is placed in service, the rehabilitation credit for the taxable year is an amount equal to the ratable share for the taxable year, provided the requirements of section 47 are satisfied. Except as provided by section 13402(c)(2) of Public Law 115-97, 131 Stat. 2054 (2017), this section applies with respect to qualified rehabilitation expenditures, as defined in section 47(c)(2) and § 1.48-12(c), paid or incurred after December 31, 2017.


(b) *Ratable share.* For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term *ratable share* means, for any taxable year during the 5-year period described in such paragraph, the amount equal to 20 percent of the rehabilitation credit determined with respect to the qualified rehabilitated building, allocated ratably to each year during such period.


(c) *Rehabilitation credit determined.* The term *rehabilitation credit determined* means the amount equal to 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures, as defined in section 47(c)(2) and § 1.48-12(c), taken into account under section 47(b)(1) for the taxable year in which the qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service. However, if the taxpayer claims the additional first year depreciation for the qualified rehabilitation expenditures pursuant to § 1.168(k)-2(g)(9), the term *rehabilitation credit determined* means the amount equal to 20 percent of the remaining rehabilitated basis, as defined in § 1.168(k)-2(g)(9)(i)(B), of the qualified rehabilitated building for the taxable year in which such building is placed in service.


(d) *Coordination with section 50.* For purposes of section 50 and § 1.50-1, the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined is the amount defined in paragraph (c) of this section.


(e) *Examples.* The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are illustrated by the following examples. Assume that the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k) is not allowed or allowable for the qualified rehabilitation expenditures.


(1) *Example 1: Rehabilitation Credit Determined and Ratable Share.* Between February 1, 2021 and October 1, 2021, X, a calendar year C corporation, incurred qualified rehabilitation expenditures of $200,000 with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building. X placed the building in service on October 15, 2021. X's rehabilitation credit determined in 2021 under paragraph (c) of this section is $40,000 ($200,000 × 0.20). For purposes of section 46, for each taxable year during the 5-year period beginning in 2021, the ratable share allocated under paragraph (b) of this section for the year is $8,000 ($40,000 × 0.20).


(2) *Example 2: Coordination with section 50(c).* The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (Example 1). For purposes of determining the amount of X's basis adjustment in 2021 under section 50(c), the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined under paragraph (c) of this section is $40,000.


(3) *Example 3: Coordination with section 50(a).* The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (Example 1). In 2021 and 2022, X claimed the full amount of the ratable share allowed under section 46, or $8,000 per taxable year. X's total allowable ratable share for 2023 through 2025 is $24,000 ($8,000 allowable per taxable year). On November 1, 2023, X disposes of the qualified rehabilitated building. Under section 50(a)(1)(B)(iii), because the period of time between when the qualified rehabilitated building was placed in service is more than two, but less than 3 full years, the applicable recapture percentage is 60%. Based on these facts, X has an increase in tax of $9,600 under section 50(a) ($16,000 of credit claimed in 2021 and 2022 × 0.60) and has $3,200 of credits remaining in each of 2023 through 2025, after forgoing $4,800 in credits in each of the years 2023 through 2025 ($8,000 × 0.60).


(4) *Example 4: Coordination with section 50(d)(5) and § 1.50-1; C corporation lessee.* X, a calendar year C corporation, leases nonresidential real property from Y. The property is a qualified rehabilitated building that is placed in service on October 15, 2021. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined is $100,000. Y elects under § 1.48-4 to treat X as having acquired the property. The shortest recovery period that could be available to the property under section 168 is 39 years. Because Y has elected to treat X as having acquired the property, Y does not reduce its basis in the property under section 50(c). Instead, pursuant to section 50(d)(5) and § 1.50-1, X, the lessee of the property, must include ratably in gross income over 39 years an amount equal to the rehabilitation credit determined with respect to such property.


(5) *Example 5: Coordination with section 50(d)(5) and § 1.50-1; partnership lessee.* A and B, calendar year taxpayers, form a partnership, the AB partnership, that leases nonresidential real property from Y. The property is a qualified rehabilitated building that is placed in service on October 15, 2021. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined is $200,000. Y elects under § 1.48-4 to treat the AB partnership as having acquired the property. The shortest recovery period that could be available to the property under section 168 is 39 years. Because Y has elected to treat the AB partnership as having acquired the property, Y does not reduce its basis in the building under section 50(c). Instead, A and B, the ultimate credit claimants, as defined in § 1.50-1(b)(3)(ii), must include the amount of the rehabilitation credit determined under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to A and B ratably in gross income over 39 years, the shortest recovery period available with respect to such property.


(f) *Applicability date.* This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after September 18, 2020. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section for taxable years beginning before September 18, 2020, provided the taxpayer applies this section in its entirety and in a consistent manner.
