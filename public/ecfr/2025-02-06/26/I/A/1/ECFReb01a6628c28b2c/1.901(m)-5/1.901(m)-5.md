# § 1.901(m)-5   Basis difference taken into account.

(a) *In general.* This section provides rules for determining the amount of basis difference with respect to an RFA that is taken into account in a U.S. taxable year for purposes of determining the disqualified portion of a foreign income tax amount. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for determining a cost recovery amount and assigning that amount to a U.S. taxable year of a single section 901(m) payor when the RFA owner (U.S.) is the section 901(m) payor. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining a disposition amount and assigning that amount to a U.S. taxable year of a single section 901(m) payor when the RFA owner (U.S.) is the section 901(m) payor. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for allocating cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes. Paragraph (e) of this section provides special rules for allocating cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts with respect to certain section 743(b) CAAs. Paragraph (f) of this section provides special rules for allocating certain disposition amounts when a foreign payor is transferred in a mid-year transaction. Paragraph (g) of this section provides special rules for allocating both cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts in certain cases in which the RFA owner (U.S.) either is a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid. Paragraph (h) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of this section. Paragraph (i) of this section provides the applicability dates.


(b) *Basis difference taken into account under applicable cost recovery method*—(1) *In general.* When the RFA owner (U.S.) is a section 901(m) payor, all of a cost recovery amount is attributed to the section 901(m) payor and assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the corresponding U.S. basis deduction is taken into account under the applicable cost recovery method. This is the case regardless of whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes. If instead the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes, a cost recovery amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section. If a cost recovery amount arises from an RFA with respect to a section 743(b) CAA, in certain cases the cost recovery amount is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (e) of this section. In certain cases in which the RFA owner (U.S.) either is a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid, a cost recovery amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (g) of this section.


(2) *Determining a cost recovery amount*—(i) *General rule.* A cost recovery amount for an RFA is determined by applying the applicable cost recovery method to the basis difference rather than to the U.S. basis.


(ii) *U.S. basis subject to multiple cost recovery methods.* If the entire U.S. basis is not subject to the same cost recovery method, the applicable cost recovery method for determining the cost recovery amount is the cost recovery method that applies to the portion of the U.S. basis that corresponds to the basis difference.


(3) *Applicable cost recovery method.* For purposes of section 901(m), an applicable cost recovery method includes any method for recovering the cost of property over time for U.S. income tax purposes (each application of a method giving rise to a *U.S. basis deduction*). Such methods include depreciation, amortization, or depletion, as well as a method that allows the cost (or a portion of the cost) of property to be expensed in the year of acquisition or in the placed-in-service year, such as under section 179. Applicable cost recovery methods do not include any provision allowing the U.S. basis to be recovered upon a disposition of an RFA.


(c) *Basis difference taken into account as a result of a disposition*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a section 901(m) payor, all of a disposition amount is attributed to the section 901(m) payor and assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the disposition occurs. If instead the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes, except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, a disposition amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (d) of this section. If a disposition amount arises from an RFA with respect to a section 743(b) CAA, in certain cases the disposition amount is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (e) of this section. If there is a disposition of an RFA in a foreign taxable year of a foreign payor during which there is a mid-year transaction, in certain cases a disposition amount is allocated under paragraph (f) of this section. In certain cases in which the RFA owner (U.S.) either is a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid, a disposition amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (g) of this section.


(2) *Determining a disposition amount*—(i) *Disposition is fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax.* If a disposition of an RFA is fully taxable (that is, results in all gain or loss, if any, being recognized with respect to the RFA) for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, the disposition amount is equal to the unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.


(ii) *Disposition is not fully taxable for purposes of U.S. income tax or the foreign income tax (or both).* If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, the disposition amount is determined under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). See § 1.901(m)-6 for rules regarding the continued application of section 901(m) if the RFA has any unallocated basis difference after determining the disposition amount under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.


(A) *Positive basis difference.* If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, and the RFA has a positive basis difference, the disposition amount equals the lesser of:


(*1*) Any foreign disposition gain plus any U.S. disposition loss (for this purpose, expressed as a positive amount), or


(*2*) Unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.


(B) *Negative basis difference.* If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, and the RFA has a negative basis difference, the disposition amount equals the greater of:


(*1*) Any U.S. disposition gain (for this purpose, expressed as a negative amount) plus any foreign disposition loss, or


(*2*) Unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.


(iii) *Disposition of an RFA after a section 743(b) CAA.* If an RFA was subject to a section 743(b) CAA and subsequently there is a disposition of the RFA, then, for purposes of determining the disposition amount, foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss are specially defined to mean the amount of gain or loss recognized for purposes of the foreign income tax on the disposition of the RFA that is allocable to the partnership interest that was transferred in the section 743(b) CAA. In addition, U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss are specially defined to mean the amount of gain or loss recognized for U.S. income tax purposes on the disposition of the RFA that is allocable to the partnership interest that was transferred in the section 743(b) CAA, taking into account the basis adjustment under section 743(b) that was allocated to the RFA under section 755.


(d) *General rules for allocating and assigning a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, this paragraph (d) provides rules for allocating a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest, as well as for assigning the allocated amount to a U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor. For purposes of this paragraph (d), unless otherwise indicated, a reference to direct or indirect ownership in an entity means for U.S. income tax purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for U.S. income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for U.S. income tax purposes, and at least one of the fiscally transparent entities is not a disregarded entity. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for foreign income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for foreign income tax purposes. If the RFA owner (U.S.) is a lower-tier fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which the section 901(m) payor indirectly owns an interest, the rules of this section apply in a manner consistent with the application of these rules when the section 901(m) payor directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.).


(2) *Allocation of a cost recovery amount.* A cost recovery amount is allocated to a section 901(m) payor that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) to the extent the U.S. basis deduction that corresponds to the cost recovery amount is (or will be) included in the section 901(m) payor's distributive share of the income of the RFA owner (U.S.) for U.S. income tax purposes.


(3) *Allocation of a disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section) is allocated under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (d)(3)(iii) of this section to a section 901(m) payor that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.).


(ii) *First allocation rule.* This paragraph (d)(3)(ii) applies when a section 901(m) payor, or a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor, is the foreign payor whose foreign income includes a distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) and, therefore, all of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor is paid or accrued by, or considered paid by, the section 901(m) payor. Thus, this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) applies when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes and a section 901(m) payor either directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) or directly owns an interest in another fiscally transparent entity for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, which, in turn, directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes. In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portion of a disposition amount that is equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss recognized by the RFA owner (foreign) for foreign income tax purposes that is (or will be) included in the foreign payor's distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign), and the denominator of which is the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss.


(iii) *Second allocation rule.* This paragraph (d)(3)(iii) applies when neither a section 901(m) payor nor a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor is the foreign payor with respect to the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign). Instead, a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest in the foreign payor, which is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes (other than a disregarded entity directly owned by the section 901(m) payor), and, therefore, the section 901(m) payor is considered to pay or accrue only its allocated portion of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor. This will be the case when the foreign payor is either the RFA owner (U.S.), another fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes (other than a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor) that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, or a disregarded entity directly owned by the RFA owner (U.S.). In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portion of a disposition amount that is equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss that is included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss. If allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined because there is no foreign income tax amount, the numerator is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss that would be included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor if there were a foreign income tax amount.


(4) *Allocation of a disposition amount attributable to U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss.* A section 901(m) payor that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) is allocated the portion of a disposition amount that is equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section), as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss that is (or will be) included in the section 901(m) payor's distributive share of income of the RFA owner (U.S.) for U.S. income tax purposes, and the denominator of which is the U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss.


(5) *Determining the extent to which a disposition amount is attributable to foreign or U.S. disposition gain or loss*—(i) *RFA with a positive basis difference.* When there is a disposition of an RFA with a positive basis difference and the disposition results in either a foreign disposition gain or a U.S. disposition loss, but not both, the entire disposition amount is attributable to foreign disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss, as applicable, even if the disposition amount exceeds the foreign disposition gain or the absolute value of the U.S. disposition loss. If the disposition results in both a foreign disposition gain and a U.S. disposition loss, the disposition amount is attributable first to foreign disposition gain to the extent thereof, and the excess disposition amount, if any, is attributable to the U.S. disposition loss, even if the excess disposition amount exceeds the absolute value of the U.S. disposition loss.


(ii) *RFA with a negative basis difference.* When there is a disposition of an RFA with a negative basis difference and the disposition results in either a foreign disposition loss or a U.S. disposition gain, but not both, the entire disposition amount is attributable to foreign disposition loss or U.S. disposition gain, as applicable, even if the absolute value of the disposition amount exceeds the absolute value of the foreign disposition loss or the U.S. disposition gain. If the disposition results in both a foreign disposition loss and a U.S. disposition gain, the disposition amount is attributable first to foreign disposition loss to the extent thereof, and the excess disposition amount, if any, is attributable to the U.S. disposition gain, even if the absolute value of the excess disposition amount exceeds the U.S. disposition gain.


(6) *U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor to which an allocated cost recovery amount or disposition amount is assigned.* A cost recovery amount or a disposition amount allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (d) of this section is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the RFA owner (U.S.) in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the RFA owner (U.S.) takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs.


(e) *Special rules for certain section 743(b) CAAs.* If a section 901(m) payor acquires a partnership interest in a section 743(b) CAA, including a section 743(b) CAA with respect to a lower-tier partnership that results from a direct acquisition by the section 901(m) payor of an interest in an upper-tier partnership, and subsequently there is a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount that arises from an RFA with respect to that section 743(b) CAA, all of the cost recovery amount or the disposition amount is allocated to that section 901(m) payor. The U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor to which the cost recovery amount or the disposition amount is assigned is the U.S. taxable year in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the section 901(m) payor takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs.


(f) *Mid-year transactions*—(1) *In general.* When a disposition of an RFA occurs in the same foreign taxable year that a foreign payor is involved in a mid-year transaction, the portion of the disposition amount that is attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section) is allocated to a section 901(m) payor and assigned to a U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor under this paragraph (f). To the extent the disposition amount is attributable to U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section), see paragraph (c)(1) or (d) of this section, as applicable.


(2) *Allocation rule.* To the extent a disposition amount is attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, a section 901(m) payor is allocated the portion of the disposition amount equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss that is included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss. If allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined because there is no foreign income tax amount, the numerator is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss that would be included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor if there were a foreign income tax amount.


(3) *Assignment to a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor.* A disposition amount allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (f)(2) of this section is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss (or portion thereof) is included in allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor or, if allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined because there is no foreign income tax amount, the U.S. taxable year in which the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss would be included in allocable foreign income if there were a foreign income tax amount.


(g) *Reverse hybrids*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (g) provides rules for allocating a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is either a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, and in each case, the foreign payor whose foreign income includes a distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) directly or indirectly owns an interest in the reverse hybrid for foreign income tax purposes. Application of the allocation rules under paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section depend upon whether a section 901(m) payor or a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor is the foreign payor, or, instead, a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest in the foreign payor. For purposes of this paragraph (g), unless otherwise indicated, a reference to direct or indirect ownership in an entity means for U.S. income tax purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (g), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for U.S. income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for U.S. income tax purposes, and at least one of the fiscally transparent entities is not a disregarded entity. For purposes of this paragraph (g), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for foreign income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for foreign income tax purposes. If the RFA owner (U.S.) is a lower-tier fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which the reverse hybrid indirectly owns an interest, the rules of this section apply in a manner consistent with the application of these rules when the reverse hybrid directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.).


(2) *First allocation rule*—(i) *Allocation to a section 901(m) payor.* This paragraph (g)(2)(i) applies when a section 901(m) payor, or a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor, is the foreign payor whose foreign income includes a distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign), and, therefore, all of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor is paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor. Thus, this paragraph (g)(2)(i) applies when a section 901(m) payor either directly owns an interest in the reverse hybrid or directly owns an interest in a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, which, in turn, directly or indirectly owns an interest in the reverse hybrid for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes. In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portions of cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) with respect to RFAs that are equal to the product of the sum of the cost recovery amounts and the disposition amounts and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) that is included in the foreign income of the foreign payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign).


(ii) *Assignment to a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor.* This paragraph (g)(2)(ii) applies when a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount, or portion thereof, is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. If the reverse hybrid is the RFA owner (U.S.), a cost recovery amount or disposition amount, or portion thereof, is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the reverse hybrid in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the reverse hybrid takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or, in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs. If the reverse hybrid is not the RFA owner (U.S.) but instead the reverse hybrid directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, a cost recovery amount or disposition amount, or portion thereof, is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the reverse hybrid, which, in turn, includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the RFA owner (U.S.) in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the RFA owner (U.S.) takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or, in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs.


(3) *Second allocation rule*—(i) *Allocation to a section 901(m) payor.* This paragraph (g)(3)(i) applies when neither a section 901(m) payor nor a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor is the foreign payor with respect to the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign). Instead, a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest in the foreign payor, which is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes (other than a disregarded entity directly owned by the section 901(m) payor), and, therefore, the section 901(m) payor is considered to pay or accrue only its allocated portion of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor. In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portions of cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) with respect to RFAs that are equal to the product of the sum of the cost recovery amounts and the disposition amounts and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) that is included in the foreign income of the foreign payor and included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign). If allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined for a section 901(m) payor because there is no foreign income tax amount, the numerator is the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) that is included in the foreign income of the foreign payor and that would be included in allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor if there were a foreign income tax amount.


(ii) *Assignment to a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor.* A cost recovery amount or a disposition amount, or portion thereof, that is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section is included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, or, if there is no foreign income tax amount, the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section would be included in allocable foreign income if there were a foreign income tax amount.


(h) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. In addition to any facts described in a particular example, the following facts apply to all the examples unless otherwise specified: CFC1, CFC2, and DE are organized in Country F and treated as corporations for Country F tax purposes. CFC1 and CFC2 are each an applicable foreign corporation that is wholly owned by the same U.S. corporation, and DE is a disregarded entity. CFC1 and CFC2 each have a U.S. taxable year that is a calendar year, and CFC1, CFC2, and DE each have a foreign taxable year that is a calendar year. Country F imposes a single tax that is a foreign income tax. CFC1, CFC2, and DE each have a functional currency of the u with respect to all activities. At all relevant times, 1u equals $1. All amounts are stated in millions. The examples assume that the applicable cost recovery method for property results in basis being recovered ratably over the life of the property beginning on the first day of the U.S. taxable year in which the property is acquired or placed into service.


(1) *Example 1: CAA followed by disposition: Fully taxable for both U.S. income tax and foreign income tax purposes*—(i) *Facts.* (A) On January 1, Year 1, USP acquires all of the stock of CFC1 in a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies (Section 338 Acquisition). At the time of the Section 338 Acquisition, CFC1 owns a single asset (Asset A) that is located in Country F. Asset A gives rise to income that is taken into account for Country F tax purposes. Asset A is tangible personal property that, under the applicable cost recovery method in the hands of CFC1, is depreciable over 5 years. There are no cost recovery deductions available for Country F tax purposes with respect to Asset A. Immediately before the Section 338 Acquisition, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 10u and a foreign basis of 40u. Immediately after the Section 338 Acquisition, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 100u and foreign basis of 40u.


(B) On July 1, Year 2, Asset A is transferred to an unrelated third

party in exchange for 120u in a transaction in which all realized gain

is recognized for both U.S. income tax and Country F tax purposes

(subsequent transaction). For U.S. income tax purposes, CFC1

recognizes U.S. disposition gain of 50u (amount realized of 120u, less

U.S. basis of 70u (100u cost basis, less 30u of accumulated

depreciation)) with respect to Asset A. The 30u of accumulated

depreciation is the sum of 20u of depreciation in Year 1 (100u cost

basis/5 years) and 10u of depreciation in Year 2 ((100u cost basis/5

years) × 6/12). For Country F tax purposes, CFC1 recognizes foreign

disposition gain of 80u (amount realized of 120u, less foreign basis

of 40u) with respect to Asset A. Immediately after the subsequent

transaction, Asset A has a U.S. basis and a foreign basis of 120u.


(ii) *Result.* (A) Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1), USP's acquisition of the stock of CFC1 in the Section 338 Acquisition is a section 338 CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(i), Asset A is an RFA with respect to Country F tax because it is relevant in determining the foreign income of CFC1 for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-4(b), the basis difference with respect to Asset A is 90u (100u−10u). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), CFC1 is a foreign payor for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41), CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor with respect to a foreign income tax amount for which CFC1 is the foreign payor (see § 1.901-2(f)(1)).


(B) Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(5), allocated basis differences are the sum of cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts. In Year 1, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes only a cost recovery amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 1 is determined by applying the applicable cost recovery method of Asset A in the hands of CFC1 to the basis difference with respect to Asset A. Accordingly, the cost recovery amount is 18u (90u basis difference/5 years). Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, all of the 18u cost recovery amount is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 1, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 1 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 20u of depreciation. Immediately after Year 1, under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(47), unallocated basis difference is 72u with respect to Asset A (90u−18u).


(C) In Year 2, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes both a cost recovery amount and a disposition amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 2, as of the date of the subsequent transaction, is 9u ((90u basis difference/5 years) × 6/12). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(15), the subsequent transaction is a disposition of Asset A, because the subsequent transaction is an event that results in an amount of gain being recognized for U.S. income tax and Country F tax purposes. Because all realized gain in Asset A is recognized for U.S. income tax and Country F tax purposes, the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to determine the disposition amount. Under that rule, the disposition amount for Year 2 is the unallocated basis difference of 63u (90u basis difference, less total 27u taken into account as cost recovery amounts in Year 1 and Year 2). Accordingly, the allocated basis difference for Year 2 is 72u (9u of cost recovery amount, plus 63u of disposition amount). Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section, all of the 72u of allocated basis difference is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 2, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 2 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 10u of depreciation and in which the disposition occurred.


(D) Unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A, as determined immediately after the subsequent transaction, is 0u (90u basis difference less 90u basis difference taken into account as 27u total cost recovery amount in Year 1 and Year 2 and as a 63u disposition amount in Year 2). Accordingly, because there is no unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A attributable to the Section 338 Acquisition, the subsequent transaction is not a successor transaction as defined in § 1.901(m)-6(b)(2). Furthermore, the subsequent transaction is not a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b). For these reasons, section 901(m) no longer applies to Asset A.


(2) *Example 2: CAA followed by disposition: nontaxable for U.S. income tax purposes and taxable for foreign income tax purposes*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (i)(A) of *Example 1*) but the facts in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section (paragraph (i)(B) of *Example 1*) are instead that on July 1, Year 2, Asset A is transferred to CFC2, in exchange for 100u of stock of CFC2 (subsequent transaction). For U.S. income tax purposes, CFC1 does not recognize any U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss with respect to Asset A. For Country F tax purposes, CFC1 recognizes foreign disposition gain of 60u (amount realized of 100u, less foreign basis of 40u) with respect to Asset A. Immediately after the subsequent transaction, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 70u (100u cost basis less 30u accumulated depreciation) and a foreign basis of 100u. The 30u of accumulated depreciation is the sum of 20u of depreciation in Year 1 (100u cost basis/5 years) and 10u in Year 2 ((100u cost basis/5 years) × 6/12).


(ii) *Result.* (A) The results described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (paragraph (ii)(A) of *Example 1)* also apply to this paragraph (h)(2)(ii) (the results of this *Example 2*).


(B) The result for Year 1 is the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (paragraph (ii)(B) of *Example 1*).


(C) In Year 2, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes both a cost recovery amount and a disposition amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 2, as of the date of the subsequent transaction, is 9u ((90u basis difference/5 years) × 6/12). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(15), the subsequent transaction is a disposition of Asset A, because the subsequent transaction is an event that results in an amount of gain being recognized for Country F tax purposes. Because the disposition is not also fully taxable for U.S. income tax purposes, the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies to determine the disposition amount. Under that rule, the disposition amount is 60u, the lesser of (i) 60u (60u foreign disposition gain plus absolute value of 0u U.S. disposition loss), and (ii) 63u unallocated basis difference (90 basis difference less total 27u taken into account as cost recovery amounts, 18u in Year 1 and 9u in Year 2). Accordingly, the allocated basis difference for the first half of Year 2 is 69u (9u of cost recovery amount, plus 60u of disposition amount). Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section, all of the 69u of allocated basis difference is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 2, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 2 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 10u of depreciation and in which the disposition occurred.


(D) Unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A immediately after the subsequent transaction is 3u (90u basis difference less 87u basis difference taken into account as a 27u total cost recovery amount in Year 1 and Year 2 and as a 60u disposition amount in Year 2). Accordingly, because there is unallocated basis difference of 3u with respect to Asset A attributable to the Section 338 Acquisition, as determined immediately after the subsequent transaction, the subsequent transaction is a successor transaction as defined in § 1.901(m)-6(b)(2). Following the subsequent transaction, the unallocated basis difference of 3u must be taken into account as cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) by CFC2, the new section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) of Asset A. See § 1.901(m)-6(b)(3)(ii). Because the subsequent transaction is not a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b), there is no additional basis difference with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction.


*(3) Example 3: CAA followed by disposition: nontaxable for both U.S. income tax and foreign income tax purposes*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (i)(A) of *Example 1*) but the facts in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section (paragraph (i)(B) of *Example 1*) are instead that on July 1, Year 2, CFC1 transfers Asset A to CFC2, in exchange for 110u of stock of CFC2 (subsequent transaction). For U.S. income tax purposes, CFC1 does not recognize any U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction. Furthermore, for Country F tax purposes, CFC1 recognizes no foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction. Immediately after the subsequent transaction, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 70u (100u cost basis less 30u accumulated depreciation) and a foreign basis of 40u. The 30u of accumulated depreciation is the sum of 20u of depreciation in Year 1 (100u cost basis/5 years) and 10u in Year 2 ((100u cost basis/5 years) × 6/12).


(ii) *Result.* (A) The result for Year 1 is the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (paragraph (ii)(A) of *Example 1*).


(B) The result for Year 1 is the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (paragraph (ii)(B) of *Example 1*).


(C) In Year 2, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes only a cost recovery amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 2, as of the date of the subsequent transaction, is 9u ((90u basis difference/5 years) x 6/12). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(15), the subsequent transaction does not constitute a disposition of Asset A, because the subsequent transaction is not an event that results in an amount of gain or loss being recognized for U.S. income tax or for Country F tax purposes. Therefore, no disposition amount is taken into account for Asset A in Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, all of the 9u of allocated basis difference is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 2, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 2 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 10u of depreciation.


(D) Unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A immediately after the subsequent transaction is 63u (90u basis difference, less 27u total cost recovery amounts, 18u in Year 1 and 9u in Year 2). Accordingly, because there is unallocated basis difference of 63u with respect to Asset A attributable to the CAA, as determined immediately after the subsequent transaction, the subsequent transaction is a successor transaction as defined in § 1.901(m)-6(b)(2). Following the subsequent transaction, the unallocated basis difference of 63u must be taken into account as cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) by CFC2, the new section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) of Asset A. See § 1.901(m)-6(b)(3)(ii). Because the subsequent transaction is not a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b), there is no additional basis difference with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction.


(i) *Applicability dates.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, this section applies to CAAs occurring on or after March 23, 2020.


(2) Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (c)(2) of this section apply to CAAs occurring on or after July 21, 2014, and to CAAs occurring before that date resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014. Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (c)(2) of this section also apply to CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than CAAs occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014, but only with respect to basis difference determined under § 1.901(m)-4T(e) with respect to the CAA.


(3) Taxpayers may, however, choose to apply provisions in this section before the date such provisions are applicable pursuant to paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section, provided that they (along with any persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) to the taxpayer)—


(i) Consistently apply this section, § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(*c*)(*4*)(*v*) through (*vii*), § 1.901(m)-1, § 1.901(m)-3, § 1.901(m)-4 (excluding § 1.901(m)-4(e)), § 1.901(m)-6, § 1.901(m)-7, and § 1.901(m)-8 to all CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and consistently apply § 1.901(m)-2 (excluding § 1.901(m)-2(d)) to all CAAs occurring on or after December 7, 2016, on any original or amended tax return for each taxable year for which the application of the provisions listed in this paragraph (i)(3)(i) affects the tax liability and for which the statute of limitations does not preclude assessment or the filing of a claim for refund, as applicable;


(ii) File all tax returns described in paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section for any taxable year ending on or before March 23, 2020, no later than March 23, 2021; and


(ii) Make appropriate adjustments to take into account deficiencies that would have resulted from the consistent application under paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section for taxable years that are not open for assessment.
