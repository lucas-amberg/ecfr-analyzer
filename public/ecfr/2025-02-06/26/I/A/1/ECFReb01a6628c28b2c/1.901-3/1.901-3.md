# § 1.901-3   Reduction in amount of foreign taxes on foreign mineral income allowed as a credit.

(a) *Determination of amount of reduction*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of determining the amount of taxes which are allowed as a credit under section 901(a) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the amount of any income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, during the taxable year to any foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) from sources within such country or possession shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which—


(i) The smaller of—


(*a*) The amount of such foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes, or


(*b*) The amount of the tax which would be computed under chapter 1 of the Code for such year with respect to such foreign mineral income if the deduction for depletion were determined under section 611 without regard to the deduction for percentage depletion under section 613, exceeds


(ii) The amount of the tax computed under chapter 1 of the Code for such year with respect to such foreign mineral income.


(2) *Determination of amount of tax on foreign mineral income*—(i) *Foreign tax.* For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(*a*) of this paragraph, the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to a foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession is an amount which is the greater of—


(*a*) The amount by which the total amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to such country or possession exceeds the amount of such taxes that would be paid or accrued for such year to such country or possession without taking into account such foreign mineral income, or


(*b*) The amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes that would be paid or accrued to such country or possession if such foreign mineral income were the taxpayer's only income for the taxable year, except that in no case shall the amount so determined exceed the total of all income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to such country or possession. For such purposes taxes which are paid or accrued also include taxes which are deemed paid under section 902. In the case of a dividend described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) (*a*) of this section which is from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States and is attributable in whole or in part to foreign mineral income, the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes deemed paid under section 902 during the taxable year to such country or possession with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession is an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes deemed paid under section 902 during such year to such country or possession with respect to such dividend as the portion of the dividend which is attributable to foreign mineral income bears to the total dividend. For purposes of (*a*) and (*b*) of this subdivision, foreign mineral income is to be reduced by any credits, expenses, losses, and other deductions which are properly allocable to such income under the law of the foreign country or possession of the United States from which such income is derived.


(ii) *U.S. tax.* For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the amount of the tax computed under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States is the greater of—


(*a*) The amount by which the tax under chapter 1 of the Code on the taxpayer's taxable income for the taxable year exceeds a tax determined under such chapter on the taxable income for such year determined without regard to such foreign mineral income, or


(*b*) The amount of tax that would be determined under chapter 1 of the Code if such foreign mineral income were the taxpayer's only income for the taxable year.


(iii) *U.S. income tax computed without deduction allowed by section 613.* For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(*b*) of this paragraph, the amount of the tax which would be computed under chapter 1 of the Code (without regard to section 613) for the taxable year with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States is the amount of the tax on such income that would be computed under such chapter by using as the allowance for depletion cost depletion computed upon the adjusted depletion basis of the property. For purposes of this subdivision the tax is to be determined without regard to any credits against the tax and without taking into account any tax against which credit is not allowed under section 901(a). If the greater tax with respect to the foreign mineral income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is the tax determined under (*a*) of such subdivision, the tax determined for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(*b*) of this paragraph is to be determined by applying the principles of (*a*) (rather than of (*b*)) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. On the other hand, if the greater tax with respect to the foreign mineral income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is the tax determined under (*b*) of such subdivision, the tax determined for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(*b*) of this paragraph is to be determined by applying the principles of (*b*) (rather than of (*a*)) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.


(3) *Special rules.* (i) The reduction required by this paragraph in the amount of taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States applies only where the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for percentage depletion under section 613 with respect to any part of his foreign mineral income for the taxable year from sources within such country or possession, whether or not such deduction is allowed with respect to the entire foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession for such year.


(ii) For purposes of this section, the term “foreign country” or “possession of the United States” includes the adjacent continental shelf areas to the extent, and in the manner, provided by section 638(2) and the regulations thereunder.


(iii) The provisions of this section are to be applied before making any reduction required by section 1503(b) in the amount of income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries or possessions of the United States by a Western Hemisphere trade corporation.


(iv) If a taxpayer chooses with respect to any taxable year to claim a credit under section 901 and has any foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to which the deduction under section 613 is allowed, he must attach to his return a schedule showing the computations required by subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.


(v) A taxpayer who has elected to use the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) on the amount of the foreign tax credit for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, may, for his first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, revoke his election without first securing the consent of the Commissioner. See paragraph (d) of § 1.904-1.


(b) *Foreign mineral income defined*—(1) *In general.* The term “foreign mineral income” means income (determined under chapter 1 of the Code) from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States derived from—


(i) The extraction of minerals from mines, wells, or other natural deposits,


(ii) The processing of minerals into their primary products, or


(iii) The transportation, distribution, or sale of minerals or of the primary products derived from minerals.


(2) *Income included in foreign mineral income*—(i) *In general.* Foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States includes, but is not limited to—


(*a*) Dividends from such sources, as determined under § 1.902-1(h)(1), received from a foreign corporation in respect of which taxes are deemed paid by the taxpayer under section 902, to the extent such dividends are attributable to foreign mineral income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. The portion of such a dividend which is attributable to such income is that amount which bears the same ratio to the total dividend received as the earnings and profits out of which such dividend is paid that are attributable to foreign mineral income bear to the total earnings and profits out of which such dividend is paid. For such purposes, the foreign mineral income of a foreign corporation is its foreign mineral income described in this paragraph (including any dividends described in this (*a*) which are received from another foreign corporation), whether or not such income is derived from sources within the foreign country or possession of the United States in which, or under the laws of which, the former corporation is created or organized. A foreign corporation is considered to have no foreign mineral income for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.


(*b*) Any section 78 dividend to which a dividend described in (*a*) of this subdivision gives rise, but only to the extent such section 78 dividend is deemed paid under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession and to the extent it is treated under of § 1.902-1(h)(1) as income from sources within such country or possession.


(*c*) Any amounts includible in income of the taxpayer under section 702(a) as his distributive share of the income of a partnership consisting of income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.


(*d*) Any amounts includible in income of the taxpayer by virtue of section 652(a), 662(a), 671, 682(a), or 691(a), to the extent such amounts consist of income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.


(ii) *Illustration.* The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Limitations on foreign tax credit*—(1) *In general.* The reduction under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the amount of foreign taxes allowed as a credit under section 901(a) is to be made whether the per-country limitation under section 904(a)(1) or the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) is used for the taxable year, but the reduction in the amount of foreign taxes allowed as a credit under section 901(a) must be made on a country-by-country basis before applying the limitation under section 904(a) to the reduced amount of taxes. If for the taxable year the separate limitation under section 904(f) applies to any foreign mineral income, that limitation must also be applied after making the reduction under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(2) *Carrybacks and carryovers of excess tax paid*—(i) *In general.* Any amount by which (*a*) any income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, during the taxable year to any foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession exceed (b) the reduced amount of such taxes as determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may not be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in any other taxable year. See § 1.904-2(b)(2)(iii). However, to the extent such reduced amount of taxes exceeds the applicable limitation under section 904(a) for the taxable year it shall be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in another taxable year as a carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax. The amount so deemed paid or accrued in another taxable year is not, however, deemed paid or accrued with respect to foreign mineral income in such other taxable year. See § 1.904-2(c)(3).


(ii) *Carryovers to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.* Where, under the provisions of section 904(d), taxes paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, to any foreign country or possession of the United States in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, are deemed paid or accrued in one or more taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the amount of such taxes so deemed paid or accrued shall not be deemed paid or accrued with respect to foreign mineral income and shall not be reduced under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(iii) *Carrybacks to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.* Where income, war profits, and excess profits taxes are paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, to any foreign country or possession of the United States in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession, they must first be reduced under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section before they may be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in one or more taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.


(d) *Illustrations.* The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples, in which the surtax exemption provided by section 11(d) and the tax surcharge provided by section 51(a) are disregarded for purposes of simplification:
