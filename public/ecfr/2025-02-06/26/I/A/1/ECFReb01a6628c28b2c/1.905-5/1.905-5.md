# § 1.905-5   Foreign tax redeterminations of foreign corporations that relate to taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Effect of foreign tax redetermination of a foreign corporation.* Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a foreign tax redetermination (as defined in § 1.905-3(a)) of a foreign corporation that relates to a taxable year of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and that may affect a taxpayer's foreign tax credit in any taxable year, must be accounted for by adjusting the foreign corporation's taxable income and earnings and profits, post-1986 undistributed earnings as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(9), and post-1986 foreign income taxes as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(8) (or its pre-1987 accumulated profits as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)(i) and pre-1987 foreign income taxes as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii), as applicable) in the taxable year of the foreign corporation to which the foreign taxes relate.


(2) *Required redetermination of U.S. tax liability.* Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required to account for the effect of the foreign tax redetermination on the earnings and profits and taxable income of the foreign corporation, the taxable income of a United States shareholder, and the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by the United States shareholder under section 902 or 960 (as in effect before December 22, 2017), in the year to which the redetermined foreign taxes relate. For example, in the case of a refund of foreign income taxes, the subpart F income, earnings and profits, and post-1986 undistributed earnings (or pre-1987 accumulated profits, as applicable) of the foreign corporation are increased in the year to which the foreign tax relates to reflect the functional currency amount of the foreign income tax refund. The required redetermination of U.S. tax liability must account for the effect of the foreign tax redetermination on the characterization and amount of distributions or inclusions under section 951 or 1293 taken into account by each of the foreign corporation's United States shareholders and on the application of the high-tax exception described in section 954(b)(4), as well as on the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid in such year. In addition, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required for any subsequent taxable year in which the United States shareholder received or accrued a distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation, up to and including the taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs, as well as any year to which unused foreign taxes from such year were carried under section 904(c).


(b) *Notification requirements*—(1) *In general.* The notification requirements of § 1.905-4, as modified by paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, apply if a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required under paragraph (a) or (e) of this section.


(2) *Notification relating to post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes.* In the case of foreign tax redeterminations with respect to taxes included in post-1986 foreign income taxes, in addition to the information required by § 1.905-4(c), the taxpayer must provide the balances of the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes before and after adjusting the pools, the dates and amounts of any dividend distributions or other inclusions made out of earnings and profits for the affected year or years, and the amount of earnings and profits from which such dividends were paid or such inclusions were made for the affected year or years.


(3) *Notification relating to pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes.* In the case of foreign tax redeterminations with respect to pre-1987 accumulated profits, in addition to the information required by § 1.905-4(c), the taxpayer must provide the following: The dates and amounts of any dividend distributions made out of earnings and profits for the affected year or years; the rate of exchange on the date of any such distribution; and the amount of earnings and profits from which such dividends were paid for the affected year or years.


(c) *Currency translation rules for adjustments to pre-1987 foreign income taxes.* Foreign income taxes paid with respect to pre-1987 accumulated profits that are deemed paid under section 960 (or under section 902 in the case of an amount treated as a dividend under section 1248) are translated into dollars at the spot rate for the date of the payment of the foreign income taxes, and refunds of such taxes are translated into dollars at the spot rate for the date of the refund. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a taxpayer under section 902 with respect to an actual distribution of pre-1987 accumulated profits and refunds of such taxes are translated into dollars at the spot rate for the date of the distribution of the earnings to which the foreign income taxes relate. See section 902(c)(6) (as in effect before December 22, 2017) and § 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii). For purposes of this section, the term *spot rate* has the meaning provided in § 1.988-1(d).


(d) *Timing and effect of pooling adjustments.* The redetermination of U.S. tax liability required by paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section is made in accordance with section 905(c) as in effect for those taxable years, without regard (except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section) to rules that required adjustments to a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the year of the foreign tax redetermination rather than in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates. No underpayment or overpayment of U.S. tax liability results from a foreign tax redetermination unless the required adjustments change the U.S. tax liability. Consequently, no interest is paid by or to a taxpayer as a result of adjustments, required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination, to a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates (or a subsequent year) that did not result in a change to U.S. tax liability, for example, because no foreign taxes were deemed paid in that year.


(e) *Election to account for certain foreign tax redeterminations with respect to pre-2018 taxable years in the foreign corporation's last pooling year*—(1) *In general.* A taxpayer may elect under the rules in paragraph (e)(2) of this section to account for foreign tax redeterminations of a foreign corporation that occur in the foreign corporation's taxable years ending with or within a taxable year of a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation ending on or after November 2, 2020, and that relate to taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, by treating such foreign tax redeterminations as if they occurred in the foreign corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018 (the “last pooling year”), and applying the rules in §§ 1.905-3T(d) and 1.905-5T for purposes of determining whether the foreign tax redetermination is accounted for in the foreign corporation's last pooling year or must be accounted for in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates. Except with respect to determining under the preceding sentence whether the foreign tax redetermination is accounted for in the foreign corporation's last pooling year or in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates, the rules of this section apply to foreign tax redeterminations covered by an election under this paragraph (e). Therefore, unless an exception in § 1.905-3T(d)(3) applies, a foreign tax redetermination to which an election under this paragraph (e) applies is accounted for under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by adjusting the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the last pooling year, rather than in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates. For purposes of this paragraph (e), references to §§ 1.905-3T and 1.905-5T are to such provisions as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2019.


(2) *Rules regarding the election*—(i) *Time and manner of election.* For a foreign corporation's first taxable year that ends with or within a taxable year of a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation ending on or after November 2, 2020 in which the foreign corporation has a foreign tax redetermination (the “first redetermination year”), the controlling domestic shareholders (as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5)) of the foreign corporation make the election described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by—


(A) Filing the statement required under § 1.964-1(c)(3)(ii) with a timely filed original income tax return for the taxable year of each controlling domestic shareholder of the foreign corporation in which or with which the foreign corporation's first redetermination year ends;


(B) Providing any notices required under § 1.964-1(c)(3)(iii);


(C) Filing amended returns as required under § 1.905-4 and this section for each controlling domestic shareholder's taxable year with or within which ends the foreign corporation's last pooling year and each other affected year before the controlling domestic shareholder's taxable year with or within which ends the foreign corporation's first redetermination year reflecting a redetermination of the controlling domestic shareholder's U.S. tax liability for each such taxable year, in cases where a redetermination of the shareholder's U.S. tax liability for taxable years ending before the foreign corporation's last pooling year ends is not required under the rules in §§ 1.905-3T(d) and 1.905-5T;


(D) Filing amended returns as required under § 1.905-4 and this section with respect to each affected year before the controlling domestic shareholder's taxable year with or within which ends the foreign corporation's first redetermination year reflecting a redetermination of the controlling domestic shareholder's U.S. tax liability for each such taxable year, in cases where a redetermination of the shareholder's U.S. tax liability for taxable years ending before the foreign corporation's last pooling year ends is required under the rules in §§ 1.905-3T(d) and 1.905-5T and this section; and


(E) Providing any additional information required by applicable administrative pronouncements.


(ii) *Scope, duration, and effect of election.* An election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section with respect to the first redetermination year of a foreign corporation is binding on all persons who are, or were in a prior year to which the election applies, United States shareholders of the foreign corporation. In addition, such election applies to all foreign tax redeterminations in the first redetermination year and all subsequent taxable years of such foreign corporation and cannot be revoked. For foreign tax redeterminations that occur in taxable years after the first redetermination year, all United States shareholders of such foreign corporation must account for the foreign tax redeterminations under the rules in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by filing amended returns and providing other information as required by § 1.905-4 and paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(C) through (E) of this section.


(iii) *Requirements for valid election.* An election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is valid only if all of the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, including the requirement to provide notice under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, are satisfied by each of the controlling domestic shareholders with respect to the first redetermination year.


(iv) *CFC group conformity requirement*—(A) *In general.* An election made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies to all controlled foreign corporations that are members of the same CFC group, and the rules in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply by reference to the CFC group. Therefore, an election by the controlling domestic shareholders of any controlled foreign corporation with respect to that controlled foreign corporation's first redetermination year also applies to foreign tax redeterminations of all members of the CFC group that includes that controlled foreign corporation, determined as of the close of that controlled foreign corporation's first redetermination year. The election is binding on all persons who are, or were in a prior year to which the election applies, United States shareholders of any member of the CFC group, applies with respect to foreign tax redeterminations of each member that occur in and after that member's first taxable year with or within which ends such controlled foreign corporation's first redetermination year, and cannot be revoked.


(B) *Determination of the CFC group*—(*1*) *Definition.* Subject to the rules in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section, the term *CFC group* means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) without regard to section 1504(b)(1) through (6), except that section 1504(a) is applied by substituting “more than 50 percent” for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears, and section 1504(a)(2)(A) is applied by substituting “or” for “and.” For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(*1*), stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a), other than section 318(a)(3)(A) and (B), by applying section 318(a)(4) only to options (as defined in § 1.1504-4(d)) that are reasonably certain to be exercised as described in § 1.1504-4(g), and by substituting in section 318(a)(2)(C) “5 percent” for “50 percent.”


(*2*) *Member of a CFC group.* The determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is included in a CFC group is made as of the close of the first redetermination year of any controlled foreign corporation for which an election is made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. One or more controlled foreign corporations are members of a CFC group if the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section are satisfied as of the end of the first redetermination year of at least one of the controlled foreign corporations, even if the requirements are not satisfied as of the end of the first redetermination year of all controlled foreign corporations. If the controlling domestic shareholders do not have the same taxable year, the determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is a member of a CFC group is made with respect to the first redetermination year that ends with or within the taxable year of the majority of the controlling domestic shareholders (determined based on voting power) or, if no such majority taxable year exists, the calendar year.


(*3*) *Controlled foreign corporations included in only one CFC group.* A controlled foreign corporation cannot be a member of more than one CFC group. If a controlled foreign corporation would be a member of more than one CFC group under paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section, then ownership of stock of the controlled foreign corporation is determined by applying paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section without regard to section 1504(a)(2)(B) or, if applicable, by reference to the ownership existing as of the end of the first redetermination year of a controlled foreign corporation that would cause a CFC group to exist.


(3) *Rules for successor entities.* All of the United States persons that own equity interests in a successor entity to a foreign corporation (“U.S. owners”) may elect under the principles of paragraph (e)(2) of this section to apply the rules in paragraph (e)(1) to foreign tax redeterminations of such foreign corporation that occur in taxable years of the successor entity that end with or within taxable years of its U.S. owners ending on or after November 2, 2020.


(f) *Applicability date.* This section applies to foreign tax redeterminations (as defined in § 1.905-3(a)) of foreign corporation and successor entities that occur in taxable years that end with or within taxable years of a United States shareholder or other United States persons ending on or after November 2, 2020, and that relate to taxable years of such foreign corporations beginning before January 1, 2018.
