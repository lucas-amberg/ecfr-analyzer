# § 1.1502-1   Definitions.

For purposes of the consolidated return regulations (and any provision of this chapter that refers to the consolidated return regulations):


(a) *Group.* The term *group* means an affiliated group of corporations as defined in section 1504. See § 1.1502-75(d) as to when a group remains in existence. Except as the context otherwise requires, references to a group are references to a consolidated group (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section).


(b) *Member.* The term *member* means a corporation (including the common parent) that is included in the group, or as the context may require, a corporation that is included in a subgroup.


(c) *Subsidiary.* The term *subsidiary* means a corporation other than the common parent which is a member of such group.


(d) *Consolidated return year.* The term *consolidated return year* means a taxable year for which a consolidated return is filed or required to be filed by such group.


(e) *Separate return year.* The term *separate return year* means a taxable year of a corporation for which it files a separate return or for which it joins in the filing of a consolidated return by another group.


(f) *Separate return limitation year*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the term *separate return limitation year* (or *SRLY*) means any separate return year of a member or of a predecessor of a member.


(2) *Exceptions.* The term *separate return limitation year* (or SRLY) does not include:


(i) A separate return year of the corporation which is the common parent for the consolidated return year to which the tax attribute is to be carried (except as provided in § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) and paragraph (f)(3) of this section);


(ii) A separate return year of any corporation which was a member of the group for each day of such year; or


(iii) A separate return year of a predecessor of any member if such predecessor was a member of the group for each day of such year.


(3) *Reverse acquisitions.* In the event of an acquisition to which § 1.1502-75(d)(3) applies, all taxable years of the first corporation and of each of its subsidiaries ending on or before the date of the acquisition are treated as separate return limitation years, and the separate return years (if any) of the second corporation and each of its subsidiaries are not treated as separate return limitation years (unless they were so treated immediately before the acquisition). For example, if corporation P merges into corporation T, and the persons who were stockholders of P immediately before the merger, as a result of owning the stock of P, own more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of T, then a loss incurred before the merger by T (even though it is the common parent), or by a subsidiary of T, is treated as having been incurred in a separate return limitation year. Conversely, a loss incurred before the merger by P, or by a subsidiary of P in a separate return year during all of which such subsidiary was a member of the group of which P was the common parent, is treated as having been incurred in a year which is not a separate return limitation year.




(4) *Predecessor and successors.* The term *predecessor* means a transferor or distributor of assets to a member (the successor) in a transaction—


(i) To which section 381(a) applies; or


(ii) That occurs on or after January 1, 1997, in which the successor's basis for the assets is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the assets of the transferor or distributor, but in the case of a transaction that occurs before June 25, 1999, only if the amount by which basis differs from value, in the aggregate, is material. For a transaction that occurs before June 25, 1999, only one member may be considered a predecessor to or a successor of one other member.


(g) *Consolidated return regulations.* The term *consolidated return regulations* means the regulations issued under the authority of section 1502.


(h) *Consolidated group.* The term “consolidated group” means a group filing (or required to file) consolidated returns for the tax year.


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Affiliated.* Corporations are affiliated if they are members of a group with each other.


(k) *Nonlife insurance company.* The term *nonlife insurance company* means a member that is an insurance company other than a *life insurance company,* each as defined in section 816(a).


(l) *U.S. territory.* The *term U.S. territory* means—


(1) American Samoa;


(2) The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands;


(3) The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;


(4) Guam; and


(5) The U.S. Virgin Islands.


(m) *Applicability date.* Paragraph (k) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (k) of this section to taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2020.
