# § 1.337(d)-1   Transitional loss limitation rule.

(a) *Loss limitation rule for transitional subsidiary*—(1) *General rule.* No deduction is allowed for any loss recognized by a member of a consolidated group with respect to the disposition of stock of a transitional subsidiary. However, for transactions involving loss shares of subsidiary stock occurring on or after September 17, 2008, see § 1.1502-36. Further, this section does not apply to a transaction that is subject to § 1.1502-36.


(2) *Allowable loss*—(i) *In general.* Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent the taxpayer establishes that the loss is not attributable to the recognition of built-in gain by any transitional subsidiary on the disposition of an asset (including stock and securities) after January 6, 1987.


(ii) *Statement of allowable loss.* Paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section applies only if a separate statement entitled “Allowable Loss Under § 1.337(d)-1(a)” is filed with the taxpayer's return for the year of the stock disposition. If the separate statement is required to be filed with a return the due date (including extensions) of which is before January 16, 1991, or with a return due (including extensions) after January 15, 1991 but filed before that date, the statement may be filed with an amended return for the year of the disposition or with the taxpayer's first subsequent return the due date (including extensions) of which is after January 15, 1991.


(iii) *Contents of statement.* The statement required under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must contain—


(A) The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of the transitional subsidiary.


(B) The basis of the stock of the transitional subsidiary immediately before the disposition.


(C) The amount realized on the disposition.


(D) The amount of the deduction not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by reason of this paragraph (a)(2).


(E) The amount of loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(3) *Coordination with loss deferral and other disallowance rules.* (i) For purposes of this section, the rules of § 1.1502-20(a)(3) apply, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the approach of this section and that of § 1.1502-20.


(ii) *Other loss deferral rules.* If paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to a loss subject to deferral or disallowance under any other provision of the Code or the regulations, the other provision applies to the loss only to the extent it is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1).


(4) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section—


(i) The definitions in § 1.1502-1 apply.


(ii) *Transitional subsidiary* means any corporation that became a subsidiary of the group (whether or not the group was a consolidated group) after January 6, 1987. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a subsidiary is not a transitional subsidiary if the subsidiary (and each predecessor) was a member of the group at all times after the subsidiary's (and each predecessor's) organization.


(iii) *Built-in gain* of a transitional subsidiary means gain attributable, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to any excess of value over basis, determined immediately before the transitional subsidiary became a subsidiary, with respect to any asset owned directly or indirectly by the transitional subsidiary at that time.


(iv) *Disposition* means any event in which gain or loss is recognized, in whole or in part.


(v) *Value* means fair market value.


(5) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, the group files consolidated returns on a calendar year basis, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, and all sales and purchases are with unrelated buyers or sellers. The basis of each asset is the same determining earnings and profits adjustments and taxable income. Tax liability and its effect on basis, value, and earnings and profits are disregarded. *Investment adjustment system* means the rules of § 1.1502-32. The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples: 


(b) *Indirect disposition of transitional subsidiary*—(1) *Loss limitation rule for transitional parent.* No deduction is allowed for any loss recognized by a member of a consolidated group with respect to the disposition of stock of a transitional parent.


(2) *Allowable loss*—(i) *In general.* Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent the taxpayer establishes that the loss exceeds the amount that would be disallowed under paragraph (a) of this section if each highest tier transitional subsidiary's stock in which the transitional parent has a direct or indirect interest had been sold immediately before the disposition of the transitional parent's stock. In applying the preceding sentence, appropriate adjustments shall be made to take into account circumstances where less than all the stock of a transitional parent owned by members of a consolidated group is disposed of in the same transaction, or the stock of a transitional subsidiary or a transitional parent is directly owned by more than 1 member.


(ii) *Statement of allowable loss.* Paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section applies only if a separate statement entitled “Allowable Loss Under Section 1.337(d)-1(b)” is filed with the taxpayer's return for the year of the stock disposition. If the separate statement is required to be filed with a return the due date (including extensions) of which is before January 16, 1991, or with a return due (including extensions) after January 15, 1991 but filed before that date, the statement may be filed with an amended return for the year of the disposition or with the taxpayer's first subsequent return the due date (including extensions) of which is after January 15, 1991.


(iii) *Contents of statement.* The statement required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section must contain—


(A) The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of the transitional parent.


(B) The basis of the stock of the transitional parent immediately before the disposition.


(C) The amount realized on the disposition.


(D) The amount of the deduction not disallowed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by reason of this paragraph (b)(2).


(E) The amount of loss disallowed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(3) *Coordination with loss deferral and other disallowance rules.* (i) For purposes of this section, the rules of § 1.1502-20(a)(3) apply, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the approach of this section and that of § 1.1502-20.


(ii) *Other loss deferral rules.* If paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to a loss subject to deferral or disallowance under any other provision of the Code or the regulations, the other provision applies to the loss only to the extent it is not disallowed under paragraph (b)(1). 


(4) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section—


(i) *Transitional parent* means any subsidiary, other than a transitional subsidiary, that owned at any time after January 6, 1987, a direct or indirect interest in the stock of a corporation that is a transitional subsidiary.


(ii) *Highest tier transitional subsidiary* means the transitional subsidiary (or subsidiaries) in which the transitional parent has a direct or indirect interest and that is the highest transitional subsidiary (or subsidiaries) in a chain of members.


(5) *Examples.* The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Successors*—(1) *General rule.* This section applies, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, to—


(i) Any property owned by a member or former member, the basis of which is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis in a subsidiary's stock, and 


(ii) Any property owned by any other person whose basis in the property is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to a member's (or former member's) basis in a subsidiary's stock. 


(2) *Examples.* The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Investment adjustments and earnings and profits*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of determining investment adjustments under § 1.1502-32 and earnings and profits under § 1.1502-33(c) with respect to a member of a consolidated group that owns stock in a subsidiary, any deduction that is disallowed under this section is treated as a loss arising and absorbed by the member in the tax year in which the disallowance occurs.


(2) *Example.* (i) In 1986, P forms S with a contribution of $100, and S becomes a member of the P group. On February 1, 1987, S buys all the stock of T for $100. T has an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. In 1988, T sells the asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment system, S's basis in the T stock increases to adjustment system, S's basis in the T stock increases to $200, P's basis in the S stock increases to $200, and P's earnings and profits and S's earnings and profits increase by $100. In 1989, S sells all of the T stock for $100, and S's recognized loss of $100 is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 


(ii) Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, S's earnings and profits for 1989 are reduced by $100, the amount of the loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1). As a result, P's basis in the S stock is reduced from $200 to $100 under the investment adjustment system. P's earnings and profits for 1989 are correspondingly reduced by $100.


(e) *Effective dates*—(1) *General rule.* This section applies with respect to dispositions after January 6, 1987. For dispositions on or after November 19, 1990, however, this section applies only if the stock was deconsolidated (as that term is defined in § 1.337(d)-2(b)(2)) before November 19, 1990, and only to the extent the disposition is not subject to § 1.337(d)-2 or § 1.1502-20.


(2) *Binding contract rule.* For purposes of this paragraph (e), if a corporation became a subsidiary pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before January 6, 1987, and in continuous effect until the corporation became a subsidiary, or a disposition was pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before March 9, 1990, and in continuous effect until the disposition, the date the contract became binding shall be treated as the date the corporation became a subsidiary or as the date of disposition.


(3) *Application of § 1.1502-20T to certain transactions*—(i) *In general.* If a group files the certification described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, it may apply § 1.1502-20T (as contained in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1990), to all of its members with respect to all dispositions and deconsolidations by the certifying group to which § 1.1502-20T otherwise applied by its terms occurring—


(A) On or after March 9, 1990 (but only if not pursuant to a binding contract described in § 1.337(d)-1T(e)(2) (as contained in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1990) that was entered into before March 9, 1990); and


(B) Before November 19, 1990 (or thereafter, if pursuant to a binding contract described in § 1.1502-20T(g)(3) that was entered into on or after March 9, 1990 and before November 19, 1990).


(ii) *Time and manner of filing certification.* The certification described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section must be made in a separate statement entitled “[insert name and employer identification number of common parent] hereby certifies under § 1.337(d)-1 (e)(3) that the group of which it is the common parent is applying § 1.1502-20T to all transactions to which that section otherwise applied by it terms.” The statement must be signed by the common parent and filed with the group's income tax return for the taxable year of the first disposition or deconsolidation to which the certification applies. If the separate statement required under this paragraph (e)(3) is to be filed with a return the due date (including extensions) of which is before November 16, 1991, the statement may be filed with an amended return for the year of the disposition or deconsolidation that is filed within 180 days after September 13, 1991. Any other filings required under § 1.1502-20T, such as the statement required under § 1.1502-20T(f)(5), may be made with the amended return, regardless of whether § 1.1502-20T permits such filing by amended return.
