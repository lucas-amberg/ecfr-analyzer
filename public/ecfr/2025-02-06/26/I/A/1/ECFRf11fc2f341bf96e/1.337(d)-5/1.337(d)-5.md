# § 1.337(d)-5   Old transitional rules imposing tax on property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT

(a) *Treatment of C corporations*—(1) *Scope.* This section applies to the net built-in gain of C corporation assets that become assets of a RIC or REIT by— 


(i) The qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT; or 


(ii) The transfer of assets of a C corporation to a RIC or REIT in a transaction in which the basis of such assets are determined by reference to the C corporation's basis (a carryover basis). 


(2) *Net built-in gain.* Net built-in gain is the excess of aggregate gains (including items of income) over aggregate losses. 


(3) *General rule.* Unless an election is made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the C corporation will be treated, for all purposes including recognition of net built-in gain, as if it had sold all of its assets at their respective fair market values on the deemed liquidation date described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section and immediately liquidated.


(4) *Loss.* Paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall not apply if its application would result in the recognition of net built-in loss. 


(5) *Basis adjustment.* If a corporation is subject to corporate-level tax under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the bases of the assets in the hands of the RIC or REIT will be adjusted to reflect the recognized net built-in gain. This adjustment is made by taking the C corporation's basis in each asset, and, as appropriate, increasing it by the amount of any built-in gain attributable to that asset, or decreasing it by the amount of any built-in loss attributable to that asset. 


(6) *Exception*—(i) *In general.* Paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not apply to any C corporation that— 


(A) Immediately prior to qualifying to be taxed as a RIC was subject to tax as a C corporation for a period not exceeding one taxable year; and 


(B) Immediately prior to being subject to tax as a C corporation was subject to the RIC tax provisions for a period of at least one taxable year. 


(ii) *Additional requirement.* The exception described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section applies only to assets acquired by the corporation during the year when it was subject to tax as a C corporation in a transaction that does not result in its basis in the asset being determined by reference to a corporate transferor's basis. 


(7) *Deemed liquidation date*—(i) *Conversions.* In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the deemed liquidation date is the last day of its last taxable year before the taxable year in which it qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT. 


(ii) *Carryover basis transfers.* In the case of a C corporation that transfers property to a RIC or REIT in a carryover basis transaction, the deemed liquidation date is the day before the date of the transfer. 


(b) *Section 1374 treatment*—(1) *In general.* Paragraph (a) of this section will not apply if the transferee RIC or REIT elects (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) to be subject to the rules of section 1374, and the regulations thereunder. The electing RIC or REIT will be subject to corporate-level taxation on the built-in gain recognized during the 10-year period on assets formerly held by the transferor C corporation. The built-in gains of electing RICs and REITs, and the corporate-level tax imposed on such gains, are subject to rules similar to the rules relating to net income from foreclosure property of REITs. See sections 857(a)(1)(A)(ii), and 857(b)(2)(B), (D), and (E). An election made under this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable. 


(2) *Ten-year recognition period.* In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the 10-year recognition period described in section 1374(d)(7) begins on the first day of the RIC's or REIT's taxable year for which the corporation qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT. In the case of a C corporation that transfers property to a RIC or REIT in a carryover basis transaction, the 10-year recognition period begins on the day the assets are acquired by the RIC or REIT. 


(3) *Making the election.* A RIC or REIT validly makes a section 1374 election with the following statement: “[Insert name and employer identification number of electing RIC or REIT] elects under paragraph (b) of this section to be subject to the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder with respect to its assets which formerly were held by a C corporation, [insert name and employer identification number of the C corporation, if different from name and employer identification number of RIC or REIT].” This statement must be signed by an official authorized to sign the income tax return of the RIC or REIT and attached to the RIC's or REIT's Federal income tax return for the first taxable year in which the assets of the C corporation become assets of the RIC or REIT. 


(c) *Special rule.* In cases where the first taxable year in which the assets of the C corporation become assets of the RIC or REIT ends after June 10, 1987 but before March 8, 2000, the section 1374 election may be filed with the first Federal income tax return filed by the RIC or REIT after March 8, 2000. 


(d) *Effective date.* In the case of carryover basis transactions involving the transfer of property of a C corporation to a RIC or REIT, the regulations apply to transactions occurring on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002. In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the regulations apply to such qualifications that are effective for taxable years beginning on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002. However, RICs and REITs that are subject to section 1374 treatment under this section may not rely on paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but must apply paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(3) of § 1.337(d)-6, with respect to built-in gains and losses recognized in taxable years beginning on or after January 2, 2002. In lieu of applying this section, taxpayers may rely on § 1.337(d)-6 to determine the tax consequences (for all taxable years) of any conversion transaction. For transactions and qualifications that occur on or after January 2, 2002, see § 1.337(d)-7.
