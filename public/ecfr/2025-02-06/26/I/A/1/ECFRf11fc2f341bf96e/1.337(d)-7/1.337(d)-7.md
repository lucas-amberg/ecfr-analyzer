# § 1.337(d)-7   Tax on property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT.

(a) *General rule*—(1) *Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or a REIT.* If property owned by a C corporation (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) becomes the property of a RIC or a REIT in a conversion transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section), then section 1374 treatment will apply as described in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the C corporation elects, or is treated as electing, deemed sale treatment with respect to the conversion transaction as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for exceptions to this paragraph (a).


(2) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section:


(i) *C corporation.* The term *C corporation* has the meaning provided in section 1361(a)(2) except that the term does not include a RIC or a REIT.


(ii) *Conversion transaction.* The term *conversion transaction* means the qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT or the transfer of property owned by a C corporation to a RIC or REIT.


(iii) *RIC.* The term *RIC* means a regulated investment company within the meaning of section 851(a).


(iv) *REIT.* The term *REIT* means a real estate investment trust within the meaning of section 856(a).


(v) *S corporation.* The term *S corporation* has the meaning provided in section 1361(a)(1).


(vi) *Section 355 distribution.* The term *section 355 distribution* means any distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, including a distribution on which the distributing corporation recognizes gain pursuant to sections 355(d) or 355(e).


(vii) *Converted property.* The term *converted property* means—


(A) Property owned by a C corporation that becomes the property of a RIC or a REIT; and


(B) Any other property of a RIC or a REIT the basis of which is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of property described in paragraph (a)(2)(vii)(A) of this section.


(viii) *Distribution property.* The term *distribution property* means—


(A) Property owned immediately after a section 355 distribution by the distributing corporation, a controlled corporation (as those terms are defined in section 355(a)(1)), or a member of a separate affiliated group (as defined in section 355(b)(3)(B)) of which the distributing corporation or a controlled corporation is the common parent (but no formulation of the step transaction doctrine will be used to determine whether property acquired after the distribution is distribution property pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A)); and


(B) Property with a basis determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to property described in paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section.


(b) *Section 1374 treatment*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT.* If property owned by a C corporation becomes the property of a RIC or REIT in a conversion transaction, then the RIC or REIT will be subject to tax on the net built-in gain in the converted property under the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder, as modified by this paragraph (b), as if the RIC or REIT were an S corporation. 


(ii) *Property subject to the rules of section 1374 owned by a RIC, REIT, or S corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT.* If property subject to the rules of section 1374 owned by a RIC, a REIT, or an S corporation (the predecessor) becomes the property of a RIC or REIT (the successor) in a continuation transaction, the rules of section 1374 apply to the successor to the same extent that the predecessor was subject to the rules of section 1374 with respect to such property, and the recognition period of the successor with respect to such property is reduced by the portion of the recognition period of the predecessor that expired before the date of the continuation transaction. For this purpose, a continuation transaction means the qualification of the predecessor as a RIC or REIT or the transfer of property from the predecessor to the successor in a transaction in which the successor's basis in the transferred property is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the predecessor's basis in that property. 


(2) *Modification of section 1374 treatment*—(i) *Net recognized built-in gain for REITs*—(A) *Prelimitation amount.* The prelimitation amount determined as provided in § 1.1374-2(a)(1) is reduced by the portion of such amount, if any, that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(4), (5), (6), or (7). For this purpose, the amount of a REIT's recognized built-in gain that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(5) is computed as follows: 


(*1*) Where the tax under section 857(b)(5) is computed by reference to section 857(b)(5)(A), the amount of a REIT's recognized built-in gain that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(5) is the tax imposed by section 857(b)(5) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of recognized built-in gain (without regard to recognized built-in loss and recognized built-in gain from prohibited transactions) that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2) and the denominator of which is the gross income (without regard to gross income from prohibited transactions) of the REIT that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2). 


(*2*) Where the tax under section 857(b)(5) is computed by reference to section 857(b)(5)(B), the amount of a REIT's recognized built-in gain that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(5) is the tax imposed by section 857(b)(5) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of recognized built-in gain (without regard to recognized built-in loss and recognized built-in gain from prohibited transactions) that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3) and the denominator of which is the gross income (without regard to gross income from prohibited transactions) of the REIT that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3). 


(B) *Taxable income limitation.* The taxable income limitation determined as provided in § 1.1374-2(a)(2) is reduced by an amount equal to the tax imposed under section 857(b)(5), (6), and (7). 


(ii) *Loss carryforwards, credits and credit carryforwards*—(A) *Loss carryforwards.* Consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards arising in taxable years for which the corporation that generated the loss was not subject to subchapter M of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code are allowed as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain to the extent allowed under section 1374 and the regulations thereunder. Such loss carryforwards must be used as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year to the greatest extent possible before such losses can be used to reduce other investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b) or other real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b) for that taxable year. 


(B) *Credits and credit carryforwards.* Consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, minimum tax credits and business credit carryforwards arising in taxable years for which the corporation that generated the credit was not subject to subchapter M of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code are allowed to reduce the tax imposed on net recognized built-in gain under this paragraph (b) to the extent allowed under section 1374 and the regulations thereunder. Such credits and credit carryforwards must be used to reduce the tax imposed under this paragraph (b) on net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year to the greatest extent possible before such credits and credit carryforwards can be used to reduce the tax, if any, on other investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b) or on other real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b) for that taxable year.


(iii) *Recognition period.* For purposes of applying the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder, as modified by paragraph (b) of this section, the term *recognition period* means the recognition period described in section 1374(d)(7), beginning—


(A) In the case of a conversion transaction that is a qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or a REIT, on the first day of the RIC's or the REIT's first taxable year; and


(B) In the case of other conversion transactions, on the day the RIC or the REIT acquires the property.


(3) *Coordination with subchapter M rules*—(i) *Recognized built-in gains and losses subject to subchapter M.* Recognized built-in gains and losses of a RIC or REIT are included in computing investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b)(2), real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b)(2), capital gains for purposes of sections 852(b)(3) and 857(b)(3), gross income derived from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States for purposes of section 853, and the dividends paid deduction for purposes of sections 852(b)(2)(D), 852(b)(3)(A), 857(b)(2)(B), and 857(b)(3)(A). In computing such income and deduction items, capital loss carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards that are used by the RIC or REIT to reduce recognized built-in gains are allowed as a deduction, but only to the extent that they are otherwise allowable as a deduction against such income under the Internal Revenue Code (including section 852(b)(2)(B)). 


(ii) *Treatment of tax imposed.* The amount of tax imposed under this paragraph (b) on net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year is treated as a loss sustained by the RIC or the REIT during such taxable year. The character of the loss is determined by allocating the tax proportionately (based on recognized built-in gain) among the items of recognized built-in gain included in net recognized built-in gain. With respect to RICs, the tax imposed under this paragraph (b) on net recognized built-in gain is treated as attributable to the portion of the RIC's taxable year occurring after October 31. 


(4) *Section 355 distribution following a conversion transaction*—(i) *In general.* If a REIT is described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the related section 355 distribution (as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section) follows a conversion transaction, then for the taxable year in which the related section 355 distribution occurs, § 1.1374-2(a)(1) and (2) (as modified by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) do not apply, and the REIT's net recognized built-in gain for such taxable year is the amount of its net unrealized built-in gain limitation (as defined in § 1.1374-2(a)(3)) for such taxable year.


(ii) *Basis adjustment*—(A) *In general.* If a REIT recognizes gain under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the aggregate basis of the converted property held by the REIT at the end of the taxable year in which the related section 355 distribution occurs shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount of gain so recognized, increased by the amount of the REIT's recognized built-in loss for such taxable year, and reduced by the amount of the REIT's recognized built-in gain and recognized built-in gain carryover for such taxable year.


(B) *Allocation of basis increase.* The aggregate increase in basis by reason of paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section shall be allocated among the converted property in proportion to their respective built-in gains on the date of the conversion transaction.


(5) *Example.* The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following example: 


(c) *Election of deemed sale treatment*—(1) *In general.* Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if the C corporation that qualifies as a RIC or a REIT or transfers property to a RIC or a REIT makes the election described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section or is treated as making such election under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, except to the extent permitted by paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. A C corporation that makes, or that is treated as making, such an election recognizes gain and loss as if it sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section). See paragraph (c)(4) of this section concerning limitations on the use of loss in computing gain. Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply if its application would result in the recognition of a net loss. For this purpose, net loss is the excess of aggregate losses over aggregate gains (including items of income), without regard to character.


(2) *Basis adjustment.* If a corporation recognizes a net gain under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then the converted property has a basis in the hands of the RIC or REIT equal to the fair market value of such property on the deemed sale date. 


(3) *Deemed sale date*—(i) *RIC or REIT qualifications.* If the conversion transaction is a qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT, then the deemed sale date is the end of the last day of the C corporation's last taxable year before the first taxable year in which it qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT. 


(ii) *Other conversion transactions.* If the conversion transaction is a transfer of property owned by a C corporation to a RIC or REIT, then the deemed sale date is the end of the day before the day of the transfer. 


(4) *Anti-stuffing rule.* A C corporation must disregard converted property in computing gain or loss recognized on the conversion transaction under this paragraph (c), if— 


(i) The converted property was acquired by the C corporation in a transaction to which section 351 applied or as a contribution to capital; 


(ii) Such converted property had an adjusted basis immediately after its acquisition by the C corporation in excess of its fair market value on the date of acquisition; and 


(iii) The acquisition of such converted property by the C corporation was part of a plan a principal purpose of which was to reduce gain recognized by the C corporation in connection with the conversion transaction. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), the principles of section 336(d)(2) apply. 


(5) *Making the deemed sale election.* A C corporation (or a partnership to which the principles of this section apply under paragraph (e) of this section) makes the deemed sale election with the following statement: “[Insert name and employer identification number of electing corporation or partnership] elects deemed sale treatment under § 1.337(d)-7(c) with respect to its property that was converted to property of, or transferred to, a RIC or REIT, [insert name and employer identification number of the RIC or REIT, if different from the name and employer identification number of the C corporation or partnership].” This statement must be attached to the Federal income tax return of the C corporation or partnership for the taxable year in which the deemed sale occurs. An election under this paragraph (c) is irrevocable. 


(6) *Conversion transaction following a section 355 distribution*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, a C corporation described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is treated as having made the election under paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to a conversion transaction if the conversion transaction occurs following the related section 355 distribution (as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section) and the C corporation has not made such an election.


(ii) *Limitation.* A C corporation treated as having made the election under paragraph (c)(5) of this section as a result of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section is not treated as having made the election with respect to property that the taxpayer establishes is not distribution property with respect to the related section 355 distribution. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii), any property with an adjusted basis in excess of its fair market value as of the date of the conversion transaction will not be treated as distribution property unless the taxpayer establishes that it owned such asset immediately after the related section 355 distribution. Paragraph (b) of this section will apply to property with respect to which the taxpayer is not treated as having made the election under paragraph (c)(5) of this section as a result of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii).


(7) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Exceptions*—(1) *Gain otherwise recognized.* Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to any conversion transaction to the extent that gain or loss otherwise is recognized on such conversion transaction by the C corporation that either qualifies as a RIC or a REIT or that transfers property to a RIC or REIT. See, for example, sections 311(b), 336(a), 351(b), 351(e), 356, 357(c), 367, 368(a)(2)(F), 1001, 1031(b), and 1033(a)(2).


(2) *Re-election of RIC or REIT status*—(i) *Generally.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to any corporation that— 


(A) Immediately prior to qualifying to be taxed as a RIC or REIT was subject to tax as a C corporation for a period not exceeding two taxable years; and 


(B) Immediately prior to being subject to tax as a C corporation was subject to tax as a RIC or REIT for a period of at least one taxable year. 


(ii) *Property acquired from another corporation while a C corporation.* The exception described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to property acquired by the corporation while it was subject to tax as a C corporation from any person in a transaction that results in the acquirer's basis in the property being determined by reference to a C corporation's basis in the property. 


(iii) *RICs and REITs previously subject to section 1374 treatment.* If the RIC or REIT had property subject to paragraph (b) of this section before the RIC or REIT became subject to tax as a C corporation as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, then paragraph (b) of this section applies to the RIC or REIT upon its requalification as a RIC or REIT, except that the recognition period with respect to such property is reduced by the portion of the recognition period that expired before the RIC or REIT became subject to tax as a C corporation and by the period of time that the corporation was subject to tax as a C corporation. 


(3) *Special rules for like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions*—(i) *In general.* Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to a conversion transaction to the extent that a C corporation transfers property with a built-in gain to a RIC or REIT, and the C corporation's gain is not recognized by reason of either section 1031 or 1033.


(ii) *Clarification regarding exchanged property previously subject to section 1374 treatment.* Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, if, in a transaction described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, a RIC or REIT surrenders property that was subject to section 1374 treatment immediately prior to the transaction, the rules of section 1374(d)(6) will apply to continue section 1374 treatment to the replacement property acquired by the RIC or REIT in the transaction.


(iii) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (d)(3) are illustrated by the following examples. In each of the examples, X is a REIT, Y is a C corporation, and X and Y are not related.


(4) *Special rule if C corporation is a tax-exempt entity.* Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to a conversion transaction in which the C corporation that owned the converted property is a tax-exempt entity described in § 1.337(d)-4(c)(2) to the extent that gain (if any) would not be subject to tax under Title 26 of the United States Code if a deemed sale election under paragraph (c)(5) of this section were made.


(e) *Special rule for partnerships*—(1) *In general.* The principles of this section apply to property transferred by a partnership to a RIC or REIT to the extent of any gain or loss in the converted property that would be allocated directly or indirectly, through one or more partnerships, to a C corporation if the partnership sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section). If the partnership were to elect deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section in lieu of section 1374 treatment under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to such transfer, then any net gain recognized by the partnership on the deemed sale must be allocated to the C corporation partner, but does not increase the capital account of any partner. Any adjustment to the partnership's basis in the RIC or REIT stock as a result of deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of that stock with respect to the C corporation partner only. The principles of section 743 apply to such basis adjustment.


(2) *Example; Transfer by partnership of property to REIT.* (i) *Facts.* PRS, a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, has three partners: TE, a C corporation (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that is also a tax-exempt entity (within the meaning of § 1.337(d)-4(c)(2)), owns 50 percent of the capital and profits of PRS; A, an individual, owns 30 percent of the capital and profits of PRS; and Y, a C corporation (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section), owns the remaining 20 percent. PRS owns a building that it leases for commercial use (Property 1). On January 1, Year 2, when PRS has an adjusted basis in Property 1 of $100 and Property 1 has a fair market value of $500, PRS transfers Property 1 to X, a REIT, in exchange for stock of X in an exchange described in section 351. PRS does not elect deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section. TE would not be subject to tax with respect to any gain that would be allocated to it if PRS had sold Property 1 to an unrelated party at fair market value.


(ii) *Analysis.* The transfer of Property 1 by PRS to X is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section to the extent of any gain or loss that would be allocated to any C corporation partner if PRS sold Property 1 at fair market value to an unrelated party on the deemed sale date. TE and Y are C corporations, but A is not a C corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Therefore, the transfer of Property 1 by PRS to X is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section to the extent of the gain in Property 1 that would be allocated to TE and Y. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent of the gain that would be allocated to TE if PRS had sold Property 1 to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date. If PRS were to sell Property 1 to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date, PRS would allocate $80 of built-in gain to Y. Thus, X is subject to section 1374 treatment on Property 1 with respect to $80 of built-in gain.


(f) *Conversion transaction preceding or following a section 355 distribution*—(1) *In general.* A C corporation or a REIT is described in this paragraph (f)(1) if—


(i) The C corporation or the REIT engages in a conversion transaction involving a REIT during the twenty-year period beginning on the date that is ten years before the date of a section 355 distribution (the *related section 355 distribution*); and


(ii) The C corporation or the REIT engaging in the related section 355 distribution is either—


(A) The distributing corporation or the controlled corporation, as those terms are defined in section 355(a)(1); or


(B) A member of the separate affiliated group (as defined in section 355(b)(3)(B)) of the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation.


(2) *Predecessors and successors.* For purposes of this paragraph (f), any reference to a controlled corporation, a distributing corporation, or a member of the separate affiliated group of a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation includes a reference to any predecessor or successor of such corporation. Successors include corporations which succeed to and take into account items described in section 381(c) of the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation. Predecessors include corporations having such items to which the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation succeeded and took into account.


(3) *Exclusion of certain conversion transactions.* A C corporation or a REIT is not described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section if—


(i) The distributing corporation and the controlled corporation are both REITs immediately after the related section 355 distribution (including by reason of elections under section 856(c)(1) made after the related section 355 distribution that are effective before the related section 355 distribution) and at all times during the two years thereafter;


(ii) Section 355(h)(1) does not apply to the related section 355 distribution by reason of section 355(h)(2)(B); or


(iii) The related section 355 distribution occurred before December 7, 2015, or is described in a ruling request referred to in section 311(c) of Division Q of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Public Law 114-113, 129 Stat. 2422.


(g) *Effective/Applicability date*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section applies to conversion transactions that occur on or after January 2, 2002. For conversion transactions that occurred on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002, see §§ 1.337(d)-5 and 1.337(d)-6.


(2) *Special rules*—(i) *Conversion transactions occurring on or after August 2, 2013 and certain prior conversion transactions.* Paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v), (d)(1), (d)(3), (d)(4), and (e) of this section apply to conversion transactions that occur on or after August 2, 2013. However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v), (d)(1), (d)(3), (d)(4), and (e) of this section to conversion transactions that occurred before August 2, 2013. For conversion transactions that occurred on or after January 2, 2002 and before August 2, 2013, see § 1.337(d)-7 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2013.


(ii) *Conversion transactions occurring on or after June 7, 2019, and certain prior conversion transactions.* Paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2)(vi), (vii), and (viii), (b)(4), (c)(1) and (6), and (f) of this section apply to conversion transactions occurring on or after June 7, 2019, and to conversion transactions and related section 355 distributions for which the conversion transaction occurs before, and the related section 355 distribution occurs on or after, June 7, 2019. For conversion transactions that occurred on or after June 7, 2016, and before June 7, 2019 (other than conversion transactions and related section 355 distributions for which the conversion transaction occurs before, and the related section 355 distribution occurs on or after, June 7, 2019), see §§ 1.337(d)-7 and 1.337(d)-7T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2019.


(iii) *Recognition period.* Paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section apply to conversion transactions that occur on or after August 8, 2016. Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section applies to conversion transactions that occur after February 17, 2017. For conversion transactions that occurred on or after August 8, 2016 and on or before February 17, 2017, see § 1.337(d)-7T(b)(2)(iii) in effect on August 8, 2016. However, taxpayers may apply paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section to conversion transactions that occurred on or after August 8, 2016 and on or before February 17, 2017. For conversion transactions that occurred on or after January 2, 2002 and before August 8, 2016, see § 1.337(d)-7 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2016.
