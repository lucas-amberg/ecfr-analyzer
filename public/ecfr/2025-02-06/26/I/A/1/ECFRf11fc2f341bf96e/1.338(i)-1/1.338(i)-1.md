# § 1.338(i)-1   Effective/applicability date.

(a) *In general.* The provisions of §§ 1.338-1 through 1.338-7, 1.338-10 and 1.338(h)(10)-1 apply to any qualified stock purchase occurring after March 15, 2001. For rules applicable to qualified stock purchases on or before March 15, 2001, see §§ 1.338-1T through 1.338-7T, 1.338-10T, 1.338(h)(10)-1T and 1.338(i)-1T in effect prior to March 16, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2000). 


(b) *Section 338(h)(10) elections for S corporation targets.* The requirements of §§ 1.338(h)(10)-1T(c)(2) and 1.338(h)(10)-1(c)(2) that S corporation shareholders who do not sell their stock must also consent to an election under section 338(h)(10) will not invalidate an otherwise valid election made on the September 1997 revision of Form 8023, “Elections Under Section 338 For Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases,” not signed by the nonselling shareholders, provided that the S corporation and all of its shareholders (including nonselling shareholders) report the tax consequences consistently with the results under section 338(h)(10).


(c) *Section 338 elections for insurance company targets*—(1) *In general.* The rules of § 1.338-11 apply to qualified stock purchases occurring on or after April 10, 2006.


(2) *New target election for retroactive application*—(i) *Availability of election.* New target may make an irrevocable election to apply the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 381(c)(22)-1, and 846) in whole, but not in part, to a qualified stock purchase occurring before April 10, 2006 for which a section 338 election is made, provided that new target's first taxable year and all subsequent affected taxable years are years for which an assessment of deficiency or a refund for overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of law. In the case of a section 338 election for which a section 338(h)(10) election is made (or a section 338 election for a foreign target), new target may make the election to apply the regulations retroactively without regard to whether old target makes the election. In the case of a section 338 election for a domestic target for which no section 338(h)(10) election is made, new target may make the election to apply the regulations retroactively only if old target also makes the election. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section prescribes the time and manner of the election for new target.


(ii) *Time and manner of making the election for new target.* New target may make an election described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section by attaching a statement to its original or amended income tax return for its first taxable year. The statement must be entitled “Election to Retroactively Apply the Rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846) in whole to a transaction completed before April 10, 2006” and must include the following information—


(A) The name and E.I.N. for new target; and


(B) The following declaration (or a substantially similar declaration): New target has amended its income tax returns for its first taxable year and for all affected subsequent years to reflect the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846). All other parties whose income tax liabilities are affected by new target's election have amended their income tax returns for all affected years to reflect the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846).


(3) *Old target election for retroactive application*—(i) *Availability of election.* Old target may make an irrevocable election to apply the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846) in whole, but not in part, to a qualified stock purchase occurring before April 10, 2006 for which a section 338 election is made, provided that old target's taxable year that includes the deemed sale tax consequences and all subsequent affected taxable years are years for which an assessment of deficiency or a refund for overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of law. In the case of a section 338 election for which a section 338(h)(10) election is made (or a section 338 election for a foreign target), old target may make the election to apply the regulations retroactively without regard to whether new target makes the election. In the case of a section 338 election for a domestic target for which no section 338(h)(10) election is made, old target may make the election to apply the regulations retroactively only if new target also makes the election. Paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section prescribes the time and manner of the election for old target.


(ii) *Time and manner of making the election for old target.* Old target may make an election described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section by attaching a statement to each affected party's original or amended income tax return for the taxable year that includes the deemed sale tax consequences. The statement must be entitled “Election to Retroactively Apply the Rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846) to a transaction completed before April 10, 2006” and must include the following information—


(A) The name and E.I.N. for old target; and


(B) The following declaration (or a substantially similar declaration): Old target has amended its income tax returns for the taxable year that includes the deemed sale tax consequences and for all affected subsequent years to reflect the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846). All other parties whose income tax liabilities are affected by old target's election have amended their income tax returns for all affected years to reflect the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1 and 846).
