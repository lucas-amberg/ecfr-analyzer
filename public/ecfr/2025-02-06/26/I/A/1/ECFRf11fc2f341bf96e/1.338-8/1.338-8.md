# § 1.338-8   Asset and stock consistency.

(a) *Introduction*—(1) *Overview.* This section implements the consistency rules of sections 338(e) and (f). Under this section, no election under section 338 is deemed made or required with respect to target or any target affiliate. Instead, the person acquiring an asset may have a carryover basis in the asset. 


(2) *General application.* The consistency rules generally apply if the purchasing corporation acquires an asset directly from target during the target consistency period and target is a subsidiary in a consolidated group. In such a case, gain from the sale of the asset is reflected under the investment adjustment provisions of the consolidated return regulations in the basis of target stock and may reduce gain from the sale of the stock. See § 1.1502-32 (investment adjustment provisions). Under the consistency rules, the purchasing corporation generally takes a carryover basis in the asset, unless a section 338 election is made for target. Similar rules apply if the purchasing corporation acquires an asset directly from a lower-tier target affiliate if gain from the sale is reflected under the investment adjustment provisions in the basis of target stock. 


(3) *Extensions of the general rules.* If an arrangement exists, paragraph (f) of this section generally extends the carryover basis rule to certain cases in which the purchasing corporation acquires assets indirectly from target (or a lower-tier target affiliate). To prevent avoidance of the consistency rules, paragraph (j) of this section also may extend the consistency period or the 12-month acquisition period and may disregard the presence of conduits. 


(4) *Application where certain dividends are paid.* Paragraph (g) of this section extends the carryover basis rule to certain cases in which dividends are paid to a corporation that is not a member of the same consolidated group as the distributing corporation. Generally, this rule applies where a 100 percent dividends received deduction is used in conjunction with asset dispositions to achieve an effect similar to that available under the investment adjustment provisions of the consolidated return regulations. 


(5) *Application to foreign target affiliates.* Paragraph (h) of this section extends the carryover basis rule to certain cases involving target affiliates that are controlled foreign corporations. 


(6) *Stock consistency.* This section limits the application of the stock consistency rules to cases in which the rules are necessary to prevent avoidance of the asset consistency rules. Following the general treatment of a section 338(h)(10) election, a sale of a corporation's stock is treated as a sale of the corporation's assets if a section 338(h)(10) election is made. Because gain from this asset sale may be reflected in the basis of the stock of a higher-tier target, the carryover basis rule may apply to the assets. 


(b) *Consistency for direct acquisitions*—(1) *General rule.* The basis rules of paragraph (d) of this section apply to an asset if—


(i) The asset is disposed of during the target consistency period; 


(ii) The basis of target stock, as of the target acquisition date, reflects gain from the disposition of the asset (see paragraph (c) of this section); and 


(iii) The asset is owned, immediately after its acquisition and on the target acquisition date, by a corporation that acquires stock of target in the qualified stock purchase (or by an affiliate of an acquiring corporation). 


(2) *Section 338(h)(10) elections.* For purposes of this section, if a section 338(h)(10) election is made for a corporation acquired in a qualified stock purchase—


(i) The acquisition is treated as an acquisition of the corporation's assets (see § 1.338(h)(10)-1); and 


(ii) The corporation is not treated as target. 


(c) *Gain from disposition reflected in basis of target stock.* For purposes of this section: 


(1) *General rule.* Gain from the disposition of an asset is reflected in the basis of a corporation's stock if the gain is taken into account under § 1.1502-32, directly or indirectly, in determining the basis of the stock, after applying section 1503(e) and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 


(2) *Gain not reflected if section 338 election made for target.* Gain from the disposition of an asset that is otherwise reflected in the basis of target stock as of the target acquisition date is not considered reflected in the basis of target stock if a section 338 election is made for target. 


(3) *Gain reflected by reason of distributions.* Gain from the disposition of an asset is not considered reflected in the basis of target stock merely by reason of the receipt of a distribution from a target affiliate that is not a member of the same consolidated group as the distributee. See paragraph (g) of this section for the treatment of dividends eligible for a 100 percent dividends received deduction. 


(4) *Controlled foreign corporations.* For a limitation applicable to gain of a target affiliate that is a controlled foreign corporation, see paragraph (h)(2) of this section. 


(5) *Gain recognized outside the consolidated group.* Gain from the disposition of an asset by a person other than target or a target affiliate is not reflected in the basis of a corporation's stock unless the person is a conduit, as defined in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. 


(d) *Basis of acquired assets*—(1) *Carryover basis rule.* If this paragraph (d) applies to an asset, the asset's basis immediately after its acquisition is, for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, its adjusted basis immediately before its disposition. 


(2) *Exceptions to carryover basis rule for certain assets.* The carryover basis rule of paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply to the following assets—


(i) Any asset disposed of in the ordinary course of a trade or business (see section 338(e)(2)(A)); 


(ii) Any asset the basis of which is determined wholly by reference to the adjusted basis of the asset in the hands of the person that disposed of the asset (see section 338(e)(2)(B)); 


(iii) Any debt or equity instrument issued by target or a target affiliate (*see* paragraph (h)(3) of this section for an exception relating to the stock of a target affiliate that is a controlled foreign corporation); 


(iv) Any asset the basis of which immediately after its acquisition would otherwise be less than its adjusted basis immediately before its disposition; and 


(v) Any asset identified by the Internal Revenue Service in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure. 


(3) *Exception to carryover basis rule for de minimis assets.* The carryover basis rules of this section do not apply to an asset if the asset is not disposed of as part of the same arrangement as the acquisition of target and the aggregate amount realized for all assets otherwise subject to the carryover basis rules of this section does not exceed $250,000. 


(4) *Mitigation rule*—(i) *General rule.* If the carryover basis rules of this section apply to an asset and the asset is transferred to a domestic corporation in a transaction to which section 351 applies or as a contribution to capital and no gain is recognized, the transferor's basis in the stock of the transferee (but not the transferee's basis in the asset) is determined without taking into account the carryover basis rules of this section. 


(ii) *Time for transfer.* This paragraph (d)(4) applies only if the asset is transferred before the due date (including extensions) for the transferor's income tax return for the year that includes the last date for which a section 338 election may be made for target. 


(e) *Examples*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, the basis of each asset is the same for determining earnings and profits and taxable income, the exceptions to paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply, the taxable year of all persons is the calendar year, and the following facts apply: S is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes T, T1, T2, and T3; S owns all of the stock of T and T3; and T owns all of the stock of T1, which owns all of the stock of T2. B is unrelated to the S group and owns all of the stock of P, which owns all of the stock of P1. Y and Y1 are partnerships that are unrelated to the S group but may be related to the P group. Z is a corporation that is not related to any of the other parties.


(2) *Direct acquisitions.* Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(f) *Extension of consistency to indirect acquisitions*—(1) *Introduction.* If an arrangement exists (see paragraph (j)(5) of this section), this paragraph (f) generally extends the consistency rules to indirect acquisitions that have the same effect as direct acquisitions. For example, this paragraph (f) applies if, pursuant to an arrangement, target sells an asset to an unrelated person who then sells the asset to the purchasing corporation. 


(2) *General rule.* This paragraph (f) applies to an asset if, pursuant to an arrangement—


(i) The asset is disposed of during the target consistency period; 


(ii) The basis of target stock as of, or at any time before, the target acquisition date reflects gain from the disposition of the asset; and 


(iii) The asset ownership requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section are not satisfied, but the asset is owned, at any time during the portion of the target consistency period following the target acquisition date, by—


(A) A corporation—


(*1*) The basis of whose stock, as of, or at any time before, the target acquisition date, reflects gain from the disposition of the asset; and 


(*2*) That is affiliated, at any time during the target consistency period, with a corporation that acquires stock of target in the qualified stock purchase; or 


(B) A corporation that at the time it owns the asset is affiliated with a corporation described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.


(3) *Basis of acquired assets.* If this paragraph (f) applies to an asset, the principles of the basis rules of paragraph (d) of this section apply to the asset as of the date, following the disposition with respect to which gain is reflected in the basis of target's stock, that the asset is first owned by a corporation described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section. If the principles of the carryover basis rule of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply to an asset, the asset's basis also is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any reduction in its basis occurring after the disposition with respect to which gain is reflected in the basis of target's stock. 


(4) *Examples.* This paragraph (f) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(g) *Extension of consistency if dividends qualifying for 100 percent dividends received deduction are paid*—(1) *General rule for direct acquisitions from target.* Unless a section 338 election is made for target, the basis rules of paragraph (d) of this section apply to an asset if— 


(i) Target recognizes gain (whether or not deferred) on disposition of the asset during the portion of the target consistency period that ends on the target acquisition date; 


(ii) The asset is owned, immediately after the asset disposition and on the target acquisition date, by a corporation that acquires stock of target in the qualified stock purchase (or by an affiliate of an acquiring corporation); and 


(iii) During the portion of the target consistency period that ends on the target acquisition date, the aggregate amount of dividends paid by target, to which section 243(a)(3) applies, exceeds the greater of—


(A) $250,000; or 


(B) 125 percent of the yearly average amount of dividends paid by target, to which section 243(a)(3) applies, during the three calendar years immediately preceding the year in which the target consistency period begins (or, if shorter, the period target was in existence). 


(2) *Other direct acquisitions having same effect.* The basis rules of paragraph (d) of this section also apply to an asset if the effect of a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is achieved through any combination of disposition of assets and payment of dividends to which section 243(a)(3) applies (or any other dividends eligible for a 100 percent dividends received deduction). See paragraph (h)(4) of this section for additional rules relating to target affiliates that are controlled foreign corporations. 


(3) *Indirect acquisitions.* The principles of paragraph (f) of this section also apply for purposes of this paragraph (g). 


(4) *Examples.* This paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(h) *Consistency for target affiliates that are controlled foreign corporations*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (h) applies only if target is a domestic corporation. For additional rules that may apply with respect to controlled foreign corporations, see paragraph (g) of this section. The definitions and nomenclature of § 1.338-2(b) and (c) and paragraph (e) of this section apply for purposes of this section. 


(2) *Income or gain resulting from asset dispositions*—(i) *General rule.* Income or gain of a target affiliate that is a controlled foreign corporation from the disposition of an asset is not reflected in the basis of target stock under paragraph (c) of this section unless the income or gain results in an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A), 951(a)(1)(C), 1291 or 1293. 


(ii) *Basis of controlled foreign corporation stock.* If, by reason of paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, the carryover basis rules of this section apply to an asset, no increase in basis in the stock of a controlled foreign corporation under section 961(a) or 1293(d)(1), or under regulations issued pursuant to section 1297(b)(5), is allowed to target or a target affiliate to the extent the increase is attributable to income or gain described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section. A similar rule applies to the basis of any property by reason of which the stock of the controlled foreign corporation is considered owned under section 958(a)(2) or 1297(a). 


(iii) *Operating rule.* For purposes of this paragraph (h)(2)— 


(A) If there is an income inclusion under section 951 (a)(1)(A) or (C), the shareholder's income inclusion is first attributed to the income or gain of the controlled foreign corporation from the disposition of the asset to the extent of the shareholder's pro rata share of such income or gain; and 


(B) Any income or gain under section 1293 is first attributed to the income or gain from the disposition of the asset to the extent of the shareholder's pro rata share of the income or gain. 


(iv) *Increase in asset or stock basis*—(A) If the carryover basis rules under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section apply to an asset, and the purchasing corporation disposes of the asset to an unrelated party in a taxable transaction and recognizes and includes in its U.S. gross income or the U.S. gross income of its shareholders the greater of the income or gain from the disposition of the asset by the selling controlled foreign corporation that was reflected in the basis of the target stock under paragraph (c) of this section, or the gain recognized on the asset by the purchasing corporation on the disposition of the asset, then the purchasing corporation or the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, shall increase the basis of the selling controlled foreign corporation stock subject to paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, as of the date of the disposition of the asset by the purchasing corporation, by the amount of the basis increase that was denied under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent that the controlled foreign corporation stock is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by a member of the purchasing corporation's affiliated group. 


(B) If the carryover basis rules under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section apply to an asset, and the purchasing corporation or the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, disposes of the stock of the selling controlled foreign corporation to an unrelated party in a taxable transaction and recognizes and includes in its U.S. gross income or the U.S. gross income of its shareholders the greater of the gain equal to the basis increase that was denied under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, or the gain recognized in the stock by the purchasing corporation or by the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, on the disposition of the stock, then the purchasing corporation shall increase the basis of the asset, as of the date of the disposition of the stock of the selling controlled foreign corporation by the purchasing corporation or by the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, by the amount of the basis increase that was denied pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent that the asset is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by a member of the purchasing corporation's affiliated group.


(3) *Stock issued by target affiliate that is a controlled foreign corporation.* The exception to the carryover basis rules of this section provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section does not apply to stock issued by a target affiliate that is a controlled foreign corporation. After applying the carryover basis rules of this section to the stock, the basis in the stock is increased by the amount treated as a dividend under section 1248 on the disposition of the stock (or that would have been so treated but for section 1291), except to the extent the basis increase is attributable to the disposition of an asset in which a carryover basis is taken under this section. 


(4) *Certain distributions*—(i) *General rule.* In the case of a target affiliate that is a controlled foreign corporation, paragraph (g) of this section applies with respect to the target affiliate by treating any reference to a dividend to which section 243(a)(3) applies as a reference to any amount taken into account under § 1.1502-32 in determining the basis of target stock that is— 


(A) A dividend; 


(B) An amount treated as a dividend under section 1248 (or that would have been so treated but for section 1291); or 


(C) An amount included in income under section 951(a)(1)(B). 


(ii) *Basis of controlled foreign corporation stock.* If the carryover basis rules of this section apply to an asset, the basis in the stock of the controlled foreign corporation (or any property by reason of which the stock is considered owned under section 958(a)(2)) is reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of any amounts that are treated, solely by reason of the disposition of the asset, as a dividend, amount treated as a dividend under section 1248 (or that would have been so treated but for section 1291), or amount included in income under section 951(a)(1)(B). For this purpose, any dividend, amount treated as a dividend under section 1248 (or that would have been so treated but for section 1291), or amount included in income under section 951(a)(1)(B) is considered attributable first to earnings and profits resulting from the disposition of the asset. 


(iii) *Increase in asset or stock basis*—(A) If the carryover basis rules under paragraphs (g) and (h)(4)(i) of this section apply to an asset, and the purchasing corporation disposes of the asset to an unrelated party in a taxable transaction and recognizes and includes in its U.S. gross income or the U.S. gross income of its shareholders the greater of the gain equal to the basis increase denied in the asset pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h)(4)(i) of this section, or the gain recognized on the asset by the purchasing corporation on the disposition of the asset, then the purchasing corporation or the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, shall increase the basis of the selling controlled foreign corporation stock subject to paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, as of the date of the disposition of the asset by the purchasing corporation, by the amount of the basis reduction under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent that the controlled foreign corporation stock is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by a member of the purchasing corporation's affiliated group. 


(B) If the carryover basis rules under paragraphs (g) and (h)(4)(i) of this section apply to an asset, and the purchasing corporation or the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, disposes of the stock of the selling controlled foreign corporation to an unrelated party in a taxable transaction and recognizes and includes in its U.S. gross income or the U.S. gross income of its shareholders the greater of the amount of the basis reduction under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, or the gain recognized in the stock by the purchasing corporation or by the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, on the disposition of the stock, then the purchasing corporation shall increase the basis of the asset, as of the date of the disposition of the stock of the selling controlled foreign corporation by the purchasing corporation or by the target or a target affiliate, as appropriate, by the amount of the basis increase that was denied pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h)(4)(i) of this section. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent that the asset is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by a member of the purchasing corporation's affiliated group. 


(5) *Examples.* This paragraph (h) may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Anti-avoidance rules.* For purposes of this section—


(1) *Extension of consistency period.* The target consistency period is extended to include any continuous period that ends on, or begins on, any day of the consistency period during which a purchasing corporation, or any person related, within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1), to a purchasing corporation, has an arrangement— 


(i) To purchase stock of target; or 


(ii) To own an asset to which the carryover basis rules of this section apply, taking into account the extension. 


(2) *Qualified stock purchase and 12-month acquisition period.* The 12-month acquisition period is extended if, pursuant to an arrangement, a corporation acquires by purchase stock of another corporation satisfying the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) over a period of more than 12 months. 


(3) *Acquisitions by conduits*—(i) *Asset ownership*—(A) *General rule.* A corporation is treated as owning any portion of an asset attributed to the corporation from a conduit under section 318(a) (treating any asset as stock for this purpose), for purposes of—


(*1*) The asset ownership requirements of this section; and 


(*2*) Determining whether a controlled foreign corporation is a target affiliate for purposes of paragraph (h) of this section. 


(B) *Application of carryover basis rule.* If the basis rules of this section apply to the asset, the basis rules of this section apply to the entire asset (not just the portion for which ownership is attributed). 


(ii) *Stock acquisitions*—(A) *Purchase by conduit.* A corporation is treated as purchasing stock of another corporation attributed to the corporation from a conduit under section 318(a) on the day the stock is purchased by the conduit. The corporation is not treated as purchasing the stock, however, if the conduit purchased the stock more than two years before the date the stock is first attributed to the corporation. 


(B) *Purchase of conduit by corporation.* If a corporation purchases an interest in a conduit (treating the interest as stock for this purpose), the corporation is treated as purchasing on that date any stock owned by a conduit on that date and attributed to the corporation under section 318(a) with respect to the interest in the conduit that was purchased. 


(C) *Purchase of conduit by conduit.* If a conduit (the *first* conduit) purchases an interest in a second conduit (treating the interest as stock for this purpose), the first conduit is treated as purchasing on that date any stock owned by a conduit on that date and attributed to the first conduit under section 318(a) with respect to the interest in the second conduit that was purchased. 


(4) *Conduit.* A person (other than a corporation) is a conduit as to a corporation if—


(i) The corporation would be treated under section 318(a)(2)(A) and (B) (attribution from partnerships, estates, and trusts) as owning any stock owned by the person; and 


(ii) The corporation, together with its affiliates, would be treated as owning an aggregate of at least 50 percent of the stock owned by the person. 


(5) *Existence of arrangement.* The existence of an arrangement is determined under all the facts and circumstances. For an arrangement to exist, there need not be an enforceable, written, or unconditional agreement, and all the parties to the transaction need not have participated in each step of the transaction. One factor indicating the existence of an arrangement is the participation of a related party. For this purpose, persons are related if they are related within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1). 


(6) *Predecessor and successor*—(i) *Persons.* A reference to a person (including target, target affiliate, and purchasing corporation) includes, as the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or successor. For this purpose, a predecessor is a transferor or distributor of assets to a person (the successor) in a transaction—


(A) To which section 381(a) applies; or 


(B) In which the successor's basis for the assets is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the transferor or distributor. 


(ii) *Assets.* A reference to an asset (the first asset) includes, as the context may require, a reference to any asset the basis of which is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the first asset. 


(7) *Examples.* This paragraph (j) may be illustrated by the following examples:
