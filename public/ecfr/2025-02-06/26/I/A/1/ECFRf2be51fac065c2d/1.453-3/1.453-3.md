# § 1.453-3   Purchaser evidences of indebtedness payable on demand or readily tradable.

(a) *In general.* A bond or other evidence of indebtedness (hereinafter in this section referred to as an obligation) issued by any person and payable on demand shall not be treated as an evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser in applying section 453(b) to a sale or other disposition of real property or to a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property. In addition, an obligation issued by a corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof— 


(1) With interest coupons attached (whether or not the obligation is readily tradable in an established securities market), 


(2) In registered form (other than an obligation issued in registered form which the taxpayer establishes will not be readily tradable in an established securities market), or 


(3) In any other form designed to render such obligation readily tradable in an established securities market shall not be treated as an evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser in applying section 453(b) to a sale or other disposition of real property or to a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property. For purposes of this section, an obligation is to be considered in registered form if it is registered as to principal, interest, or both and if its transfer must be effected by the surrender of the old instrument and either the reissuance by the corporation of the old instrument to the new holder or the issuance by the corporation of a new instrument to the new holder. 


(b) *Treatment as payment.* If under section 453(b)(3) an obligation is not treated as an evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser, then— 


(1) For purposes of determining whether the payments received in the taxable year of the sale or disposition exceed 30 percent of the selling price, and 


(2) For purposes of returning income on the installment method during the taxable year of the sale or disposition or in a subsequent taxable year, the receipt by the seller of such obligation shall be treated as a payment. The rules stated in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(c) *Payable on demand.* Under section 453(b)(3), an obligation shall be treated as payable on demand only if the obligation is treated as payable on demand under applicable state or local law. 


(d) *Designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market*—(1) *In general.* Obligations issued by a corporation or government or political subdivision thereof will be deemed to be in a form designed to render such obligations readily tradable in an established securities market if— 


(i) Steps necessary to create a market for them are taken at the time of issuance (or later, if taken pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding which existed at the time of issuance), 


(ii) If they are treated as readily tradable in an established securities market under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, or 


(iii) If they are convertible obligations to which paragraph (e) of this section applies. 


(2) *Readily tradable in an established securities market.* An obligation will be treated as readily tradable in an established securities market if— 


(i) The obligation is part of an issue or series of issues which are readily tradable in an established securities market, or 


(ii) The corporation issuing the obligation has other obligations of a comparable character which are described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. 


(3) *Readily tradable.* For purposes of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, an obligation shall be treated as readily tradable if it is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in such obligation or is part of an issue a portion of which is in fact traded in an established securities market. 


(4) *Established securities market.* For purposes of this paragraph, the term established securities market includes (i) a national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f), (ii) an exchange which is exempted from registration under section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 78e) because of its limited volume of transactions, and (iii) any over-the-counter market. For purposes of this subparagraph, an over-the-counter market is reflected by the existence of an interdealer quotation system. An interdealer quotation system is any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers which regularly disseminates quotations of obligations by identified brokers or dealers, other than a quotation sheet prepared and distributed by a broker or dealer in the regular course of his business and containing only quotations of such broker or dealer. 


(5) *Examples.* The rules stated in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(e) *Special rule for convertible securities*—(1) *General rule.* For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if an obligation contains a right whereby the holder of such obligation may convert it directly or indirectly into another obligation which would be treated as a payment under paragraph (b) of this section or may convert it directly or indirectly into stock which would be treated as readily tradable or designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market under paragraph (d) of this section, the convertible obligation shall be considered to be in a form designed to render such obligation readily tradable in an established securities market unless such obligation is convertible only at a substantial discount. In determining whether the stock or obligation, into which an obligation is convertible, is readily tradable or designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market, the rules stated in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply, and for purposes of such paragraph (d) if such obligation is convertible into stock then the term “stock” shall be substituted for the term “obligation” wherever it appears in such paragraph (d). 


(2) *Substantial discount rule.* Whether an obligation is convertible at a substantial discount depends upon the particular facts and circumstances. A substantial discount shall be considered to exist if at the time the convertible obligation is issued, the fair market value of the stock or obligation into which the obligation is convertible is less than 80 percent of the fair market value of the obligation (determined by taking into account all relevant factors, including proper discount to reflect the fact that the convertible obligation is not readily tradable in an established securities market and any additional consideration required to be paid by the taxpayer). Also, if a privilege to convert an obligation into stock or an obligation which is readily tradable in an established securities market may not be exercised within a period of 1 year from the date the obligation is issued, a substantial discount shall be considered to exist. 


(f) *Effective date.* The provisions of this section shall apply to sales or other dispositions occurring after May 27, 1969, which are not made pursuant to a binding written contract entered into on or before such date. No inference shall be drawn from this section as to any question of law concerning the application of section 453 to sales or other dispositions occurring on or before May 27, 1969.
