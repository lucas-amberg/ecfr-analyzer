# § 1.454-1   Obligations issued at discount.

(a) *Certain non-interest-bearing obligations issued at discount*—(1) *Election to include increase in income currently.* If a taxpayer owns— 


(i) A non-interest-bearing obligation issued at a discount and redeemable for fixed amounts increasing at stated intervals (other than an obligation issued by a corporation after May 27, 1969, as to which ratable inclusion of original issue discount is required under section 1232(a)(3)), or 


(ii) An obligation of the United States, other than a current income obligation, in which he retains his investment in a matured series E U.S. savings bond, or 


(iii) A nontransferable obligation (whether or not a current income obligation) of the United States for which a series E U.S. savings bond was exchanged (whether or not at final maturity) in an exchange upon which gain is not recognized because of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037), 


(2) *Amount of increase in case of non-interest-bearing obligations.* In any case in which an election is made under section 454, the amount which accrues in any taxable year to which the election applies is measured by the actual increase in the redemption price occurring in that year. This amount does not accrue ratably between the dates on which the redemption price changes. For example, if two dates on which the redemption price increases (February 1 and August 1) fall within a taxable year and if the redemption price increases in the amount of 50 cents on each such date, the amount accruing in that year would be $1 ($0.50 on February 1 and $0.50 on August 1). If the taxpayer owns a non-interest-bearing obligation of the character described in subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph acquired prior to the first taxable year to which his election applies, he must also include in gross income for such first taxable year (i) the increase in the redemption price of such obligation occurring between the date of acquisition of the obligation and the first day of such first taxable year and (ii), in a case where a series E bond was exchanged for such obligation, the increase in the redemption price of such series E bond occurring between the date of acquisition of such series E bond and the date of the exchange. 


(3) *Amount of increase in case of current income obligations.* If an election is made under section 454 and the taxpayer owns, at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies, a current income obligation of the character described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph acquired prior to such taxable year, he must also include in gross income for such first taxable year the increase in the redemption price of the series E bond which was surrendered to the United States in exchange for such current income obligation; the amount of the increase is that occurring between the date of acquisition of the series E bond and the date of the exchange. 


(4) *Illustrations.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(b) *Short-term obligations issued on a discount basis.* In the case of obligations of the United States or any of its possessions, or of a State, or Territory, or any political subdivision thereof, or of the District of Columbia, issued on a discount basis and payable without interest at a fixed maturity date not exceeding one year from the date of issue, the amount of discount at which such obligation originally sold does not accrue until the date on which such obligation is redeemed, sold, or otherwise disposed of. This rule applies regardless of the method of accounting used by the taxpayer. For examples illustrating rules for computation of income from sale or other disposition of certain obligations of the type described in this paragraph, see section 1221 and the regulations thereunder. 


(c) *Matured U.S. savings bonds*—(1) *Inclusion of increase in income upon redemption or final maturity.* If a taxpayer (other than a corporation) holds— 


(i) A matured series E U.S. savings bond, 


(ii) An obligation of the United States, other than a current income obligation, in which he retains his investment in a matured series E U.S. savings bond, or 


(iii) A nontransferable obligation (whether or not a current income obligation) of the United States for which a series E U.S. savings bond was exchanged (whether or not at final maturity) in an exchange upon which gain is not recognized because of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)), 


(2) *Illustrations.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and the calendar year as his taxable year:
