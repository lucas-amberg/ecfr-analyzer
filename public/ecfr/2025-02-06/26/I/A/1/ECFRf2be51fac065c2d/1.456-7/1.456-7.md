# § 1.456-7   Transitional rule.

(a) Under section 456(d)(1), a taxpayer making an election under section 456 shall include in its gross income for the first taxable year to which the election applies and for each of the 2 succeeding taxable years not only that portion of prepaid dues income which is includible in gross income for each such taxable year under section 456(a), but also an additional amount equal to that portion of the total prepaid dues income received in each of the 3 taxable years preceding the first taxable year to which the election applies which would have been includible in gross income for such first taxable year and such 2 succeeding taxable years had the election under section 456 been effective during such 3 preceding taxable years. In computing such additional amounts— 


(1) In the case of taxpayers who did not include in gross income for the taxable year preceding the first taxable year for which the election is effective, that portion of the prepaid dues income received in such year attributable to a liability which is to end within 12 months after the date of receipt, no effect shall be given to a “within 12 months” election made under paragraph (c) of § 1.456-6, and 


(2) There shall be taken into account only prepaid dues income arising from a trade or business with respect to which an election is made under section 456 and § 1.456-6. 


(b) A taxpayer who makes an election with respect to prepaid dues income, and who includes in gross income for any taxable year to which the election applies an additional amount computed under section 456(d)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, shall be permitted under section 456(d)(2) to deduct for such taxable year and for each of the 4 succeeding taxable years an amount equal to one-fifth of such additional amount, but only to the extent that such additional amount was also included in the taxpayer's gross income for any of the 3 taxable years preceding the first taxable year to which such election applies. The taxpayer shall maintain books and records in sufficient detail to enable the district director to determine upon audit that the additional amounts were included in the taxpayer's gross income for any of the 3 taxable years preceding such first taxable year. If, however, the taxpayer ceases to exist, as described in paragraph (b) of § 1.456-4, and there is included in gross income, under such paragraph, of the year of cessation the entire portion of prepaid dues income not previously includible in gross income under section 456 for preceding taxable years (other than for amounts received prior to the first year for which an election was made), all the amounts not previously deducted under this paragraph shall be permitted as a deduction in the year of cessation of existence. 


(c) The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:
