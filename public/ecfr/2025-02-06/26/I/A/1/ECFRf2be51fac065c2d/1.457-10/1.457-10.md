# § 1.457-10   Miscellaneous provisions.

(a) *Plan terminations and frozen plans*—(1) *In general.* An eligible employer may amend its plan to eliminate future deferrals for existing participants or to limit participation to existing participants and employees. An eligible plan may also contain provisions that permit plan termination and permit amounts deferred to be distributed on termination. In order for a plan to be considered terminated, amounts deferred under an eligible plan must be distributed to all plan participants and beneficiaries as soon as administratively practicable after termination of the eligible plan. The mere provision for, and making of, distributions to participants or beneficiaries upon a plan termination will not cause an eligible plan to cease to satisfy the requirements of section 457(b) or the regulations. 


(2) *Employers that cease to be eligible employers*—(i) *Plan not terminated.* An eligible employer that ceases to be an eligible employer may no longer maintain an eligible plan. If the employer was a tax-exempt entity and the plan is not terminated as permitted under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the tax consequences to participants and beneficiaries in the previously eligible (unfunded) plan of an ineligible employer are determined in accordance with either section 451 if the employer becomes an entity other than a State or § 1.457-11 if the employer becomes a State. If the employer was a State and the plan is neither terminated as permitted under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section nor transferred to another eligible plan of that State as permitted under paragraph (b) of this section, the tax consequences to participants in the previously eligible governmental plan of an ineligible employer, the assets of which are held in trust pursuant to § 1.457-8(a), are determined in accordance with section 402(b) (section 403(c) in the case of an annuity contract) and the trust is no longer to be treated as a trust that is exempt from tax under section 501(a). 


(ii) *Plan termination.* As an alternative to determining the tax consequences to the plan and participants under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the employer may terminate the plan and distribute the amounts deferred (and all plan assets) to all plan participants as soon as administratively practicable in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such distribution may include eligible rollover distributions in the case of a plan that was an eligible governmental plan. In addition, if the employer is a State, another alternative to determining the tax consequences under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is to transfer the assets of the eligible governmental plan to an eligible governmental plan of another eligible employer within the same State under the plan-to-plan transfer rules of paragraph (b) of this section. 


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples: 


(b) *Plan-to-plan transfers*—(1) *General rule.* An eligible governmental plan may provide for the transfer of amounts deferred by a participant or beneficiary to another eligible governmental plan if the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), or (4) of this section are met. An eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity may provide for transfers of amounts deferred by a participant to another eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity if the conditions in paragraph (b)(5) of this section are met. In addition, an eligible governmental plan may accept transfers from another eligible governmental plan as described in the first sentence of this paragraph (b)(1), and an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity may accept transfers from another eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity as described in the preceding sentence. However, a State may not transfer the assets of its eligible governmental plan to a tax-exempt entity's eligible plan and the plan of a tax-exempt entity may not accept such a transfer. Similarly, a tax-exempt entity may not transfer the assets of its eligible plan to an eligible governmental plan and an eligible governmental plan may not accept such a transfer. In addition, if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relating to permissive past service credit and repayments under section 415) are met, an eligible governmental plan of a State may provide for the transfer of amounts deferred by a participant or beneficiary to a qualified plan (under section 401(a)) maintained by a State. However, a qualified plan may not transfer assets to an eligible governmental plan or to an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity, and an eligible governmental plan or the plan of a tax-exempt entity may not accept such a transfer. 


(2) *Requirements for post-severance plan-to-plan transfers among eligible governmental plans.* A transfer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible governmental plan is permitted if the following conditions are met—


(i) The transferor plan provides for transfers; 


(ii) The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers; 


(iii) The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are being transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the transfer at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that participant or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and 


(iv) In the case of a transfer for a participant, the participant has had a severance from employment with the transferring employer and is performing services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan. 


(3) *Requirements for plan-to-plan transfers of all plan assets of eligible governmental plan.* A transfer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible governmental plan is permitted if the following conditions are met— 


(i) The transfer is from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible governmental plan within the same State; 


(ii) All of the assets held by the transferor plan are transferred; 


(iii) The transferor plan provides for transfers; 


(iv) The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers; 


(v) The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are being transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the transfer at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that participant or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and 


(vi) The participants or beneficiaries whose deferred amounts are being transferred are not eligible for additional annual deferrals in the receiving plan unless they are performing services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan. 


(4) *Requirements for plan-to-plan transfers among eligible governmental plans of the same employer.* A transfer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible governmental plan is permitted if the following conditions are met— 


(i) The transfer is from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible governmental plan of the same employer (and, for this purpose, the employer is not treated as the same employer if the participant's compensation is paid by a different entity); 


(ii) The transferor plan provides for transfers; 


(iii) The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers; 


(iv) The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are being transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the transfer at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that participant or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and 


(v) The participant or beneficiary whose deferred amounts are being transferred is not eligible for additional annual deferrals in the receiving plan unless the participant or beneficiary is performing services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan. 


(5) *Requirements for post-severance plan-to-plan transfers among eligible plans of tax-exempt entities.* A transfer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from an eligible plan of a tax-exempt employer to another eligible plan of a tax-exempt employer is permitted if the following conditions are met— 


(i) The transferor plan provides for transfers; 


(ii) The receiving plan provides for the receipt of transfers; 


(iii) The participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred are being transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the transfer at least equal to the amount deferred with respect to that participant or beneficiary immediately before the transfer; and 


(iv) In the case of a transfer for a participant, the participant has had a severance from employment with the transferring employer and is performing services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan. 


(6) *Treatment of amount transferred following a plan-to-plan transfer between eligible plans.* Following a transfer of any amount between eligible plans under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section— 


(i) The transferred amount is subject to the restrictions of § 1.457-6 (relating to when distributions are permitted to be made to a participant under an eligible plan) in the receiving plan in the same manner as if the transferred amount had been originally been deferred under the receiving plan if the participant is performing services for the entity maintaining the receiving plan, and 


(ii) In the case of a transfer between eligible plans of tax-exempt entities, except as otherwise determined by the Commissioner, the transferred amount is subject to § 1.457-7(c)(2) (relating to when amounts are considered to be made available under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity) in the same manner as if the elections made by the participant or beneficiary under the transferor plan had been made under the receiving plan. 


(7) *Examples.* The provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section are illustrated by the following examples: 


(8) *Purchase of permissive service credit by plan-to-plan transfers from an eligible governmental plan to a qualified plan*—(i) *General rule.* An eligible governmental plan of a State may provide for the transfer of amounts deferred by a participant or beneficiary to a defined benefit governmental plan (as defined in section 414(d)), and no amount shall be includible in gross income by reason of the transfer, if the conditions in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section are met. A transfer under this paragraph (b)(8) is not treated as a distribution for purposes of § 1.457-6. Therefore, such a transfer may be made before severance from employment. 


(ii) *Conditions for plan-to-plan transfers from an eligible governmental plan to a qualified plan.* A transfer may be made under this paragraph (b)(8) only if the transfer is either— 


(A) For the purchase of permissive service credit (as defined in section 415(n)(3)(A)) under the receiving defined benefit governmental plan; or 


(B) A repayment to which section 415 does not apply by reason of section 415(k)(3). 


(iii) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph (b)(8) are illustrated by the following example: 


(c) *Qualified domestic relations orders under eligible plans*—(1) *General rule.* An eligible plan does not become an ineligible plan described in section 457(f) solely because its administrator or sponsor complies with a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p), including an order requiring the distribution of the benefits of a participant to an alternate payee in advance of the general rules for eligible plan distributions under § 1.457-6. If a distribution or payment is made from an eligible plan to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, rules similar to the rules of section 402(e)(1)(A) shall apply to the distribution or payment. 


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Death benefits and life insurance proceeds.* A death benefit plan under section 457(e)(11) is not an eligible plan. In addition, no amount paid or made available under an eligible plan as death benefits or life insurance proceeds is excludable from gross income under section 101. 


(e) *Rollovers to eligible governmental plans*—(1) *General rule.* An eligible governmental plan may accept contributions that are eligible rollover distributions (as defined in section 402(c)(4)) made from another eligible retirement plan (as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B)) if the conditions in paragraph (e)(2) of this section are met. Amounts contributed to an eligible governmental plan as eligible rollover distributions are not taken into account for purposes of the annual limit on annual deferrals by a participant in § 1.457-4(c) or § 1.457-5, but are otherwise treated in the same manner as amounts deferred under section 457 for purposes of §§ 1.457-3 through 1.457-9 and this section. 


(2) *Conditions for rollovers to an eligible governmental plan.* An eligible governmental plan that permits eligible rollover distributions made from another eligible retirement plan to be paid into the eligible governmental plan is required under this paragraph (e)(2) to provide that it will separately account for any eligible rollover distributions it receives. A plan does not fail to satisfy this requirement if it separately accounts for particular types of eligible rollover distributions (for example, if it maintains a separate account for eligible rollover distributions attributable to annual deferrals that were made under other eligible governmental plans and a separate account for amounts attributable to other eligible rollover distributions), but this requirement is not satisfied if any such separate account includes any amount that is not attributable to an eligible rollover distribution. 


(3) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following example: 


(f) *Deemed IRAs under eligible governmental plans.* See regulations under section 408(q) for guidance regarding the treatment of separate accounts or annuities as individual retirement plans (IRAs).
