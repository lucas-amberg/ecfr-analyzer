# § 1.665(a)-1   Undistributed net income.

(a) The term *undistributed net income* means for any taxable year the distributable net income of the trust for that year as determined under section 643(a), less: 


(1) The amount of income required to be distributed currently and any other amounts properly paid or credited or required to be distributed to beneficiaries in the taxable year as specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 661(a), and 


(2) The amount of taxes imposed on the trust, as defined in § 1.665(d)-1. 


The application of the rule in this paragraph to the first year of a trust in which income is accumulated may be illustrated by the following example:


(b) The undistributed net income of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person for any taxable year is the distributable net income of such trust (see § 1.643(a)-6 and the examples set forth in paragraph (b) thereof), less: 


(1) The amount of income required to be distributed currently and any other amounts properly paid or credited or required to be distributed to beneficiaries in the taxable year as specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 661(a), and 


(2) The amount of taxes imposed on such trust by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, which are attributable to items of income which are required to be included in such distributable net income. For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of taxes imposed on the trust (for any taxable year), by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is the amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of section 871 which is properly allocable to the undistributed portion of the distributable net income. See § 1.665(d)-1. The amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of section 871 is the difference between the total tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of that section on the foreign trust created by a U.S. person for the year and the amount which would have been imposed on such trust had all the distributable net income, as determined under section 643(a), been distributed. The application of the rule in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) However, the undistributed net income for any year to which an accumulation distribution for a later year may be thrown back may be reduced by accumulation distributions in intervening years and also by any taxes imposed on the trust which are deemed to be distributed under section 666 by reason of the accumulation distributions. On the other hand, undistributed net income for any year will not be reduced by any distributions in an intervening year which are excluded from the definition of an accumulation distribution under section 665(b), or which are excluded under section 663(a)(1), relating to gifts, bequests, etc. See paragraph (f)(5) of § 1.668(b)-2 for an illustration of the reduction of undistributed net income for any year by a subsequent accumulation distribution.
