# § 1.668(b)-2A   Special rules applicable to section 668.

(a) *Rule when beneficiary not in existence on the last day of a taxable year.* If a beneficiary was not in existence on the last day of a preceding taxable year of the trust with respect to which a distribution is deemed made under section 666(a), it shall be assumed, for purposes of the computations under paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.668(b)-1A, that the beneficiary: 


(1) Was in existence on such last day, 


(2) Was a calendar year taxpayer, 


(3) Had no gross income other than the amounts deemed distributed to him from such trust in his calendar year in which such last day occurred and from all other trusts from which amounts are deemed to have been distributed to him in such calendar year, 


(4) If an individual, was unmarried and had no dependents, 


(5) Had no deductions other than the standard deduction, if applicable, under section 141 for such calendar year, and 


(6) Was entitled to the personal exemption under section 151 or 642(b). 


(b) *Effect of other distributions.* The income of the beneficiary, for any of his prior taxable years for which a tax is being recomputed under § 1.668(b)-1A, shall include any amounts of prior accumulation distributions (including prior capital gain distributions) deemed distributed under sections 666 and 669 in such prior taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a “prior accumulation distribution” is a distribution from the same or another trust which was paid, credited, or required to be distributed in a prior taxable year of the beneficiary. The term “prior accumulation distribution” also includes accumulation distributions of other trusts which were paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the beneficiary in the same taxable year and which the beneficiary has determined under paragraph (c) of this section to treat as having been distributed before the accumulation distribution for which tax is being computed under § 1.668(b)-1A. Any capital gain distribution from the same trust paid, credited, or required to be distributed in the same taxable year of the beneficiary shall not be considered under this paragraph to be a “prior capital gain distribution.” 


(c) *Multiple distributions in the same taxable year.* For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, accumulation distributions made from more than one trust in the same taxable year of the beneficiary, regardless of when in the taxable year they were actually made, shall be treated as having been made consecutively, in whichever order the beneficiary may determine. However, the beneficiary must treat them as having been made in the same order for the purpose of computing the partial tax on the several accumulation distributions. The beneficiary shall indicate the order he has determined to deem the accumulation distributions to have been received by him on his return for the taxable year. A failure by him so to indicate, however, shall not affect his right to make such determination. The purpose of this rule is to assure that the tax resulting from the later (as so deemed under this paragraph) distribution is computed with the inclusion of the earlier distribution in the taxable base and that the tax resulting from the earlier (as so deemed under this paragraph) distribution is computed with the later distribution excluded from the taxable base. 


(d) *Examples.* The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
