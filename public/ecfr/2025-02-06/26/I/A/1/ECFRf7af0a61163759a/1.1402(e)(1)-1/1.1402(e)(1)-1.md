# § 1.1402(e)(1)-1   Election by ministers, members of religious orders, and Christian Science practitioners for self-employment coverage.

(a) *In general.* Any individual who is (1) a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church or a member of a religious order (other than a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order) or (2) a Christian Science practitioner may elect to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act extended to service performed by him in the exercise of his ministry or in the exercise of duties required by such order, or in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be. Such an election shall be made by filing a certificate on Form 2031 in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section and within the time specified in § 1.1402(e)(2)-1. If a minister or member to whom this section has application, or a Christian Science practitioner, makes an election by filing Form 2031 such individual shall, for each taxable year for which the election is effective (see § 1.1402(e)(3)-1), be considered as carrying on a trade or business with respect to the performance of service in his capacity as a minister or member, or as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be.


(b) *Waiver certificate.* The certificate on Form 2031 shall be filed in triplicate with the district director of internal revenue for the internal revenue district in which is located the legal residence or principal place of business of the individual who executes the certificate. If such individual has no legal residence or principal place of business in any internal revenue district, the certificate shall be filed with the Director of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20225, or at such other address as is designated in the instructions relating to the certificate. The certificate must be filed within the time prescribed in § 1.1402(e)(2)-1. If an individual to whom paragraph (a) of this section has application submits to a district director of internal revenue a dated and signed statement indicating that he desires to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act extended to his services, such statement will be treated as a waiver certificate, if filed within the time specified in § 1.1402(e)(2)-1, provided that without unnecessary delay such statement is supplemented by a properly executed Form 2031. An application for a social security account number filed on Form SS-5 or the filing of an income tax return showing an amount representing self-employment income or self-employment tax shall not be construed to constitute an election referred to in § 1.1402(e)(1)-1.
