# § 1.1402(e)(2)-1   Time limitation for filing waiver certificate.

(a) *General rule.* (1) Any individual referred to in § 1.1402(e)(1)-1 who desires to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act extended to his services must file the waiver certificate (Form 2031) prescribed by § 1.1402(e)(1)-1 on or before whichever of the following dates is later:


(i) The due date of the income tax return (see section 6072), including any extension thereof (see section 6081), for his second taxable year ending after 1963; or


(ii) The due date of the income tax return, including any extension thereof, for his second taxable year ending after 1954 for which he has net earnings from self-employment (computed as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section) of $400 or more, any part of which: 


(*a*) In the case of a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church, consists of remuneration for service performed in the exercise of his ministry,


(*b*) In the case of a member of a religious order who has not taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order, consists of remuneration for service performed in the exercise of duties required by such order, or


(*c*) In the case of a Christian Science practitioner, consists of remuneration for service performed in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner.


(2) If a minister, a member of a religious order, or a Christian Science practitioner derives gross income in a taxable year both from service performed in such capacity and from the conduct of another trade or business, and the deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code which are attributable to the gross income derived from service performed in such capacity equal or exceed the gross income derived from service performed in such capacity, no part of the net earnings from self-employment (computed as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section) for the taxable year shall be considered as derived from service performed in such capacity.


(3) The application of the rules set forth in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Effect of death.* Except as provided in §§ 1.1402(e)(5)-1, 1.1402(e) (5)-2, and 1.1402(e)(6)-1, the right of an individual to file a waiver certificate shall cease from his death. Thus, except as provided in such sections, the surviving spouse, administrator, or executor of a decedent shall not be permitted to file a waiver certificate for such decedent.


(c) *Computation of net earnings without regard to election.* For the purpose of this section net earnings from self-employment shall be determined without regard to the fact that, without an election under section 1402(e), the performance of services by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry, or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order, or the performance of service by an individual in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, does not constitute a trade or business for purposes of the tax on self-employment income.
