# ยง 1.1402(e)(4)-1   Treatment of certain remuneration paid in 1955 and 1956 as wages.

If in 1955 or 1956 an individual was paid remuneration for service described in section 3121(b)(8)(A) which was erroneously treated by the organization employing him (under a certificate filed by such organization pursuant to section 3121(k) or the corresponding section of prior law) as employment, within the meaning of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (Chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code), and if on or before August 30, 1957, the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111 were paid (in good faith and upon the assumption that the insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act had been extended to such service) with respect to any part of the remuneration paid to such individual for such service, then the remuneration with respect to which such taxes were paid, and with respect to which no credit or refund of such taxes (other than a credit or refund which would be allowable if such service had constituted employment) has been obtained either by the employer or the employee on or before August 30, 1957, shall be deemed, for purposes of the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954 and the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, to constitute remuneration paid for employment and not net earnings from self-employment. For regulations relating to section 3121(b)(8)(A) and (k), see ยง 31.3121(b)(8)-1 of subpart B of part 31 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
