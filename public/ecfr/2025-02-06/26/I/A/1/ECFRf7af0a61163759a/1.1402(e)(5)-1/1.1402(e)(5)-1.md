# ยง 1.1402(e)(5)-1   Optional provision for certain certificates filed before April 15, 1962.

(a) *Certificates.* (1) The optional provision contained in section 1402(e)(5)(A) may be applied to a certificate on Form 2031 filed within the period September 14, 1960, to April 16, 1962, inclusive, in the case of a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church, a member of a religious order (other than a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order), or a Christian Science practitioner, who has derived net earnings, in any taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960, from the performance of service in the exercise of his ministry, in the exercise of duties required by his religious order, or in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, respectively, and who has reported such earnings as self-employment income on a return filed before September 14, 1960, and on or before the date prescribed for filing such return (including any extension thereof). The certificate may be filed by such minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner or by a fiduciary acting for such individual or his estate, or by his survivor within the meaning of section 205(c)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act, and it must be filed after September 13, 1960, and on or before April 16, 1962. Subject to the conditions stated in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, such certificate may be effective at the election of the person filing it, for the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960 for which a return, as described in the first sentence of this subparagraph, was filed, and for all succeeding taxable years, rather than for the period prescribed in ยง 1.1402(e)(3)-1. The election for retroactive application of the certificate may be made by indicating on the certificate the first taxable year for which it is to be effective and that such year is the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960 for which the minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner filed an income tax return on which he reported net earnings for such year from the exercise of his ministry, the exercise of duties required by his religious order, or the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be, and by fulfilling the conditions prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.


(2) A certificate to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph relates may be effective for a taxable year prior to the taxable year immediately preceding the earliest taxable year for which, at the time the certificate is filed, the period for filing a return (including any extension thereof) has not expired, only if the following conditions are met:


(i) The tax under section 1401 is paid on or before April 16, 1962, in respect of all self-employment income (whether or not derived from the performance of service by the individual in the exercise of his ministry, in the exercise of duties required by his religious order, or in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be) for the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960 for which such individual has filed a return, as described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and for each succeeding taxable year ending before 1960; and


(ii) In any case where refund has been made of any such tax which (but for section 1402(e)(5)) is an overpayment, the amount refunded (including any interest paid under section 6611) is repaid on or before April 16, 1962. For regulations under section 6611 (relating to interest on overpayments), see ยง 301.6611-1 of part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).


(b) *Supplemental certificates.* (1) Subject to the conditions stated in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a certificate on Form 2031 filed on or before September 13, 1960, by a minister, member of a religious order, or a Christian Science practitioner described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and which (but for section 1402(e)(5)(B)) is ineffective for the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1959 for which such a return as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section was filed by such individual, shall be effective for such first taxable year and for all succeeding taxable years, provided a supplemental certificate is filed by such individual or by a fiduciary acting for him or his estate, or by his survivor (within the meaning of section 205(c)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act), after September 13, 1960 and on or before April 16, 1962.


(2) The filing of a supplemental certificate pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph will give retroactive effect to a certificate to which such subparagraph applies only if the following conditions are met:


(i) The tax under section 1401 is paid on or before April 16, 1962, in respect of all self-employment income (whether or not attributable to earnings as a minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner) for the first taxable year for which the certificate is retroactively effective and for each subsequent year ending before 1959; and


(ii) In any case where refund has been made of any such tax which (but for section 1402(d)(5)) is an overpayment, the amount refunded (including any interest paid under section 6611) is repaid on or before April 16, 1962.


(c) *Underpayment of tax.* For purposes of this section, any underpayment of the tax which is attributable to an error made in good faith will not invalidate an election which is otherwise valid.


(d) *Nonapplicability of section 6401.* Any payment or repayment described in paragraph (a)(2) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not constitute an overpayment within the meaning of section 6401 which relates to amounts treated as overpayments. For the provisions of section 6401 and the regulations thereunder, see section 6401 and ยง 301.6401-1 of part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
