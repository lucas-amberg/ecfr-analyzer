# ยง 1.1081-10   Nonapplication of other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

The effect of section 1081(g) is that an exchange, sale, or distribution which is within section 1081 shall, with respect to the nonrecognition of gain or loss and the determination of basis, be governed only by the provisions of part VI (section 1081 and following), subchapter O, chapter 1 of the Code, the purpose being to prevent overlapping of those provisions and other provisions of subtitle A of the Code. In other words, if by virtue of section 1081 any portion of a person's gain or loss on any particular exchange, sale, or distribution is not to be recognized, then the gain or loss of such person shall be nonrecognized only to the extent provided in section 1081, regardless of what the result might have been if part VI (section 1081 and following), subchapter O, chapter 1 of the Code, had not been enacted; and similarly, the basis in the hands of such person of the property received by him in such transaction shall be the basis provided by section 1082, regardless of what the basis of such property might have been under section 1011 if such part VI had not been enacted. On the other hand, if section 1081 does not provide for the nonrecognition of any portion of a person's gain or loss (whether or not such person is another party to the same transaction referred to above), then the gain or loss of such person shall be recognized or nonrecognized to the extent provided for by other provisions of subtitle A of the Code as if such part VI had not been enacted; and similarly, the basis in his hands of the property received by him in such transaction shall be the basis provided by other provisions of subtitle A of the Code as if such part VI had not been enacted.
