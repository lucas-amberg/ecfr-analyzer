(a) *In general.* If, without any surrender of his stock or securities as defined in section 1083(f), a shareholder in a corporation which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company receives stock or securities in such corporation or owned by such corporation, no gain to the shareholder will be recognized with respect to the stock or securities received by such shareholder which do not constitute nonexempt property, if the distribution to such shareholder is made by the distributing corporation in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission directed to such corporation. A distribution is not within the provisions of section 1081(c)(1) if it is within the provisions of section 1081(d), relating to transfers within a system group.

For further limitations, see section 1081(f).

(ii) Such distribution is in accordance with an arrangement forming a ground for an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued pursuant to section 3 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U. S. C. 79c) that the distributing corporation is exempt from any provision or provisions of such act, and


(iii) Before January 1, 1958, the distributing corporation disposes of all the common stock in the second corporation which it owns.
