# ยง 1.1081-6   Transfers within system group.

(a) The nonrecognition of gain or loss provided for in section 1081(d)(1) is applicable to an exchange of property for other property (including money and other nonexempt property) between corporations which are all members of the same system group. The term *system group* is defined in section 1083 (d).


(b) Section 1081 (d)(1) also provides for nonrecognition of gain to a corporation which is a member of a system group if property (including money or other nonexempt property) is distributed to such corporation as a shareholder in a corporation which is a member of the same system group, without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in the distributing corporation.


(c) As stated in ยง 1.1081-2, nonrecognition of gain or loss will not be accorded to a transaction not clearly provided for in part VI (section 1081 and following), subchapter O, chapter 1 of the Code, even though such transaction occurs simultaneously or in connection with an exchange, sale, or distribution to which nonrecognition is specifically accorded. Therefore, nonrecognition will not be accorded to any gain or loss realized from the discharge, or the removal of the burden, of the pecuniary obligations of a member of a system group, even though such obligations are acquired upon a transfer or distribution specifically described in section 1081 (d)(1); but the fact that the acquisition of such obligations was upon a transfer or distribution specifically described in section 1081 (d)(1) will, because of the basis provisions of section 1082 (d), affect the cost to the member of such discharge or its equivalent. Thus, section 1081 (d)(1) does not provide for the nonrecognition of any gain or loss realized from the discharge of the indebtedness of a member of a system group as the result of the acquisition in exchange, sale, or distribution of its own bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness which were acquired by another member of the same system group for a consideration less or more than the issuing price thereof (with proper adjustments for amortization of premiums or discounts).


(d) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:


(e) No exchange or distribution may be made without the recognition of gain or loss as provided for in section 1081 (d)(1), unless all the corporations which are parties to such exchange or distribution are acting in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission. If an exchange or distribution is within the provisions of section 1081 (d)(1) and also may be considered to be within some other provisions of section 1081, it shall be considered that only the provisions of section 1081 (d)(1) apply and that the nonrecognition of gain or loss upon such exchange or distribution is by virtue of that section.
