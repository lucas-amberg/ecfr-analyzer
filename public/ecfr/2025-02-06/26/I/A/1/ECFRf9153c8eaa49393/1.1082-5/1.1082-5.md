# ยง 1.1082-5   Basis of property acquired by shareholder upon tax-free distribution under section 1081(c) (1) or (2).

(a) *Stock or securities.* If there was distributed to a shareholder in a corporation which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company, stock or securities (other than stock or securities which are nonexempt property), and if by virtue of section 1081 (c)(1) no gain was recognized to the shareholder upon such distribution, then the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made must be apportioned between such stock and the stock or securities so distributed to the shareholder. The basis of the old shares and the stock or securities received upon the distribution shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:


(1) If the stock or securities received upon the distribution consist solely of stock in the distributing corporation and the stock received is all of substantially the same character and preference as the stock in respect of which the distribution is made, the basis of each share will be the quotient of the cost or other basis of the old shares of stock divided by the total number of the old and the new shares.


(2) If the stock or securities received upon the distribution are in whole or in part stock in a corporation other than the distributing corporation, or are in whole or in part stock of a character or preference materially different from the stock in respect of which the distribution is made, or if the distribution consists in whole or in part of securities other than stock, the cost or other basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution is made shall be apportioned between such stock and the stock or securities distributed in proportion, as nearly as may be, to the respective values of each class of stock or security, old and new, at the time of such distribution, and the basis of each share of stock or unit of security will be the quotient of the cost or other basis of the class of stock or security to which such share or unit belongs, divided by the number of shares or units in the class. Within the meaning of this subparagraph, stocks or securities in one corporation are different in class from stocks or securities in another corporation, and, in general, any material difference in character or preference or terms sufficient to distinguish one stock or security from another stock or security, so that different values may properly be assigned thereto, will constitute a difference in class.


(b) *Stock rights.* If there was distributed to a shareholder in a corporation rights to acquire common stock in a second corporation, and if by virtue of section 1081 (c)(2) no gain was recognized to the shareholder upon such distribution, then the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made must be apportioned between such stock and the stock rights so distributed to the shareholder. The basis of such stock and the stock rights received upon the distribution shall be determined in accordance with the following:


(1) The cost or other basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution is made shall be apportioned between such stock and the stock rights distributed, in proportion to the respective values thereof at the time the rights are issued.


(2) The basis for determining gain or loss from the sale of a right, or from the sale of a share of stock in respect of which the distribution is made, will be the quotient of the cost or other basis, properly adjusted, assigned to the rights or the stock, divided, as the case may be, by the number of rights acquired or by the number of shares of such stock held.


(c) *Cross reference.* As to the basis of stock or securities distributed by one member of a system group to another member of the same system group, see ยง 1.1082-6.
