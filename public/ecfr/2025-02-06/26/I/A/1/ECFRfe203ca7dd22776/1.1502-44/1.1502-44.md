# § 1.1502-44   Percentage depletion for independent producers and royalty owners.

(a) *In general.* The sum of the percentage depletion deductions for the taxable year for all oil or gas property owned by all members, plus any carryovers under section 613A(d)(1) or paragraph (d) of this section from a prior taxable year, may not exceed 65 percent of the group's adjusted consolidated taxable income (under paragraph (b) of this section) for the consolidated return year.


(b) *Adjusted consolidated taxable income.* For purposes of this section, adjusted consolidated taxable income is an amount (not less than zero) equal to the group's consolidated taxable income determined without—


(1) Any depletion with respect to an oil or gas property (other than a gas property with respect to which the depletion allowance for all production is determined pursuant to section 613A(b)) for which percentage depletion would exceed cost depletion in the absence of the depletable quantity limitations contained in section 613A(c)(1) and (6) and the consolidated taxable income limitation contained in paragraph (a) of this section;


(2) Any consolidated net operating loss carryback to the consolidated return year under § 1.1502-21; and


(3) Any consolidated net capital loss carryback to the consolidated return year under § 1.1502-22.




(c) *Allocation to oil and gas properties.* The maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 613A(c), after the application of paragraph (a) of this section, is allocated to properties held by members in accordance with the regulations under section 613A(d). Those regulations provide for an initial allocation and possible reallocation of the maximum allowable percentage depletion deduction among oil and gas properties. Thus, if, after the initial allocation, cost depletion exceeds the percentage depletion that would be allowable for a particular oil or gas property, cost depletion must be used for that property and the maximum amount of percentage depletion allowable as a deduction for the group is reallocated among only the remaining properties held by all members.


(d) *Carryover for disallowed amounts.* (1) If any amount is disallowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of section 613A(d)(1) or paragraph (a) of this section, the disallowed amount for each oil or gas property is treated as an amount allowed as a deduction under section 613A(c), for the following taxable year for the member that owned the property, in accordance with the regulations under section 613A and paragraphs (a) and (d)(2) of this section.


(2) Any amount that was disallowed as a deduction in a separate return limitation year of a member may be carried to a consolidated return year only to the extent that 65 percent of the excess determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section exceeds the sum of the otherwise allowable percentage depletion deductions for the member's oil and gas properties for the year.


(3) The excess determined in this subparagraph (3) for a member is the excess, if any, of adjusted consolidated taxable income for the year under paragraph (b) of this section over that income recomputed by excluding the items of income and deductions of the member.


(e) *Effective date.* This section applies to taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is after September 30, 1980.
