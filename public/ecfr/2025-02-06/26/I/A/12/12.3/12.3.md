# § 12.3   Investment credit, public utility property elections.

(a) *Elections*—(1) *In general.* Under section 46(e), three elections may be made on or before March 9, 1972, with respect to section 46(e) property (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). An election made under the provisions of section 46(e) shall be irrevocable.


(2) *Applicability of elections.* (i) Any election under section 46(e) shall be made with respect to all of the taxpayer's property eligible for the election whether or not the taxpayer is regulated by more than one regulatory body.


(ii)(*a*) Paragraph (1) of section 46(e) shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property in the absence of an election under paragraph (2) or (3) of section 46(e). If an election is made under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), paragraph (1) of such section shall not apply to any of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property.


(*b*) An election made under the last sentence of section 46(e)(1) shall apply to that portion of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which paragraph (1) of section 46(e) applies and which is short supply property within the meaning of § 1.46-5(b)(2) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) as set forth in a notice of proposed rule making published in 37 FR 3526 on February 17, 1971.


(iii) If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), and makes no election under paragraph (3) of such section, the election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e) shall apply to all of its section 46(e) property.


(iv) If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), such election shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies. Paragraph (1) or (2) of section 46(e) (as the case may be) shall apply to that portion of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property which is not property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), and also makes an election under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), paragraph (3) shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies and paragraph (2) shall apply to the remainder of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property.


(3) *Section 46(e) property.* “Section 46(e) property” is section 38 property which is both property described in section 50 and is—


(i) Public utility property within the meaning of section 46(c)(3)(B) (other than nonregulated communication property of the type described in the last sentence of section 46(c)(3)(B)), or


(ii) Property used predominantly in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of (*a*) steam through a local distribution system or (*b*) the transportation of gas or steam by pipeline, if the rates for such furnishing or sale are established or approved by a governmental unit, agency, instrumentality, or commission described in section 46(c)(3)(B).


(b) *Method of making elections.* A taxpayer may make the elections described in section 46(e) by filing a statement, on or before March 9, 1972, with the district director or director of the internal revenue service center with whom the taxpayer ordinarily files its income tax return. For rules in the case of taxpayers filing consolidated returns, see § 1.1502-77(a) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). Such statement shall contain the following information:


(1) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer,


(2) The paragraph (or paragraphs) of section 46(e) under which the taxpayer is making the election,


(3) If an election is made under the last sentence of section 46(e)(1), the name and address of all regulatory bodies which have jurisdiction over the taxpayer with respect to the section 46(e) property covered by such election and a statement setting forth the type of the public utility activity described in section 46(e)(5)(B) in which the taxpayer engages, and


(4) If an election is made under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), a statement indicating whether an election has been made by the taxpayer under section 167(l)(4)(A).
