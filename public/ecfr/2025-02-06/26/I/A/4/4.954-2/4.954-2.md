# § 4.954-2   Foreign personal holding company income; taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.

(a) *Computation of foreign personal holding company income*—(1) *In general.* Foreign personal holding company income consists of the following categories of income:


(i) Dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and annuities as defined in paragraph (b) of this section;


(ii) Gain from certain property transactions as defined in paragraph (e) of this section;


(iii) Gain from commodities transactions as defined in paragraph (f) of this section;


(iv) Foreign currency gain as defined in paragraph (g) of this section; and


(v) Income equivalent to interest as defined in paragraph (h) of this section.


(2) *Coordination of overlapping definitions.* If a particular portion of income from a transaction in substance falls within more than one of the definitional rules of section 954(c) and this section, its character is determined under the rules of subdivision (i) through (iii) of this paragraph (a)(2). The character of loss from a transaction must be similarly determined under the rules of this paragraph (a)(2).


(i) If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of income equivalent to interest under paragraph (h) of this section and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales), or foreign currency gain under paragraph (g) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction), that portion of income is treated as income equivalent to interest for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.


(ii) If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of foreign currency gain under paragraph (g) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction) and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, or gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales), that portion of income is treated as foreign currency gain for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.


(iii) If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales) and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, that portion of income is treated as gain from a commodities transaction for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.


(3) *Changes in the use or purpose with which property is held*—(i) *In general.* Under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, transactions in certain property give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income if the controlled foreign corporation holds that property for a particular use or purpose. For purposes of this section, in determining the purpose or use for which property is held, the period shortly before disposition is the most significant period. However, if a controlled foreign corporation held property with a purpose that would have caused its disposition to give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this section, and prior to disposition the controlled foreign corporation changed the purpose or use for which it held the property to one that would cause its disposition to give rise to gain or loss excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income, then the later purpose or use shall be ignored unless it was continuously present for a predominant portion of the period during which the controlled foreign corporation held the property. Under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, a currency hedging transaction may be treated as two or more separate hedging transactions, such that each portion is separately considered in applying this paragraph (a)(3).


(ii) *Illustrations.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(3).


(4) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of computing foreign personal holding company income under this section.


(i) *Interest.* The term “interest” includes amounts that are treated as ordinary income, original issue discount or interest income (including original issue discount and interest on a tax-exempt obligation) by reason of sections 482, 483, 864(d), 1273, 1274, 1276, 1281, 1286, 1288, 7872 and the regulations thereunder, or as interest or original issue discount income by reason of any other provision of law. For special rules concerning interest exempt from U.S. tax pursuant to section 103, see paragraph (b)(6) of this section.


(ii) *Inventory and similar property.* The term “inventory and similar property” (or “inventory or similar property”) means property that is stock in trade of the controlled foreign corporation or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the controlled corporation if on hand at the close of the taxable year (were the controlled foreign corporation a domestic corporation), or property held by the controlled foreign corporation primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. Rights to property held in bona fide hedging transactions that reduce the risk of price changes in the cost of “inventory and similar property” are included in the definition of that term if they are an integral part of the system by which a controlled foreign corporation purchases such property, and they are so identified by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedging transaction is entered into.


(iii) *Regular dealer.* The term “regular dealer” means a merchant with an established place of business that—


(A) Regularly and actively engages as a merchant in purchasing property and selling it to customers in the ordinary course of business with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom, or


(B) Makes a market in derivative financial products of property (such as forward contracts to buy or sell property, option contracts to buy or sell property, interest rate and currency swap contracts or other national principal contracts) by regularly and actively offering to enter into positions in such products to the public in the ordinary course of business.


(iv) *Dealer property.* Property held by a controlled foreign corporation is “dealer property” if—


(A) The controlled foreign corporation is a regular dealer in property of such kind, and


(B) The property is held by the controlled foreign corporation in its capacity as a dealer.


(v) *Debt instrument.* The term “debt instrument” includes bonds, debentures, notes, certificates, accounts receivable, and other evidences of indebtedness.


(b) *Dividends, etc.*—(1) *In general.* Foreign personal holding company includes:


(i) Dividends, except certain dividends from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and distributions of previously taxed income under section 959(b) and the regulations thereunder;


(ii) Interest, except export financing interest as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and certain interest received from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;


(iii) Rents and royalties, except certain rents and royalties received from related persons as described in (b)(4) of this section and rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business as defined in paragraph (b)(5); and 


(iv) Annuities.


(2) *Exclusion of certain export financing*—(i) *In general.* Pursuant to section 954(c)(2)(B), foreign personal holding company income computed under section 954(c)(1)(A) and this paragraph (b) does not include interest that is export financing interest. For purposes of section 954(c)(2)(B) and this section, the term “export financing interest” means interest that is derived in the conduct of a banking business and is export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder. Pursuant to section 864(d)(5)(A)(iii), it does not include income from related party factoring that is treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or interest described in section 864(d)(6).


(ii) *Conduct of a banking business.* For purposes of this section, export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder is considered derived in the conduct of a banking business if, in connection with the financing from which the interest is derived, the corporation, through its own officers or staff of employees, engages in all the activities in which banks customarily engage in issuing and servicing a loan.


(iii) *Illustration.* The following example illustrates the application of this provision:


(3) *Exclusion of dividends and interest from related persons*—(i) *Excluded dividends and interest.* Foreign personal holding company income does not include dividends and interest if—


(A) The payor is a corporation that is a related person as defined in section 954(a)(3),


(B) The payor is created or organized (“incorporated”) under the laws of the same foreign country as the controlled foreign corporation, and


(C) A substantial part of the payor's assets are used in a trade or business in the payor's country of incorporation as determined under subdivision (iv) of this paragraph (b)(3).


(ii) *Interest paid out of adjusted foreign base company income or insurance income.* Interest may not be excluded from the foreign personal holding company income of the recipient under this paragraph (b)(3) to the extent that the deduction for the interest is allocated under § 1.954-1T(c) to the payor's adjusted gross foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(3)), adjusted gross insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or other categories of income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952(a), for purposes of computing the payor's net foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(4), net insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or income described in sections 952(a) (3), (4), and (5).


(iii) *Dividends paid out of prior years' earnings.* Dividends are excluded from foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (b)(3) only to the extent they are paid out of earnings and profits which were earned or accumulated during a period in which the requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (b)(3) were satisfied or, to the extent earned or accumulated during a taxable year of the related foreign corporation ending on or before December 31, 1962, during a period in which the payor was a related corporation as to be controlled foreign corporation and the other requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (b)(3) are substantially satisfied.


(iv) *Fifty percent substantial assets test.* A substantial part of the assets of the payor will be considered used in a trade or business located in its country of incorporation only if, for each quarter during such taxable year, the average value (as of the beginning and end of the quarter) of its assets which are used in the trade or business and are located in such country constitutes over 50 percent of the average value (as of the beginning and end of the quarter) of all the assets of the payor (including assets not used in a trade or business). For such purposes the value of assets shall be determined under subdivision (v) of this paragraph (b)(3), and the location of assets used in a trade or business of the payor shall be determined under subdivisions (vi) through (xi) of this paragraph (b)(3).


(v) *Value of assets.* For purposes of determining whether a substantial part of the assets of the payor are used in a trade or business in its country of incorporation, the value of assets shall be their actual value (not reduced by liabilities), which, in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, shall be deemed to be their adjusted basis.


(vi) *Location of tangible property used in a trade or business*—(A) *In general.* Tangible property (other than inventory and similar property) used in a trade or business is considered located in the country in which it is physically located.


(B) *Exception.* If tangible personal property used in a trade or business is intended for use in the payor's country of incorporation, but is temporarily located elsewhere, it will be considered located within payor's country of incorporation if the reason for its location elsewhere is for inspection or repair, and it is not currently in service in a country other than the payor's country of incorporation and is not to be placed in service in a country other than the payor's country of incorporation following the inspection or repair.


(vii) *Location of intangible property used in a trade or business*—(A) *In general.* The location of intangible property (other than inventory or similar property and debt instruments) used in a trade or business is determined based on the site of the activities conducted by the payor during the current year in connection with using or exploiting that property. An item of intangible property is located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the current taxable year if the activities connected with its use or exploitation are conducted during the entire current taxable year by the payor in its country of incorporation. For this purpose, the determination of the country in which services are performed shall be made under the principles of section 954(e) and § 1.954-4(c).


(B) *Property located in part in the payor's country of incorporation and in part in other countries.* If the activities connected with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are conducted during the current taxable year by the payor in the payor's country of incorporation and in other countries, then a percentage of the intangible (measured by the average value of the item as of the beginning and end of the quarter) is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of such activities that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of all such activities worldwide. Expenses incurred in connection with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are included in the computation provided by this paragraph (b)(3) if they are deductible under section 162 or includible in inventory costs or the costs of goods sold (were the payor a domestic corporation).


(viii) *Location of property held for sale to customers*—(A) *In general.* Inventory or similar property is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the taxable year if the activities of the payor in connection with the production and sale, or purchase and release, of such property and conducted in the payor's country of incorporation during the entire taxable year. If the payor conducts such activities through an independent contractor, then the location of such activities shall be the place in which they are conducted by the independent contractor.


(B) *Inventory located in part in the payor's country of incorporation and in part in other countries.* If the activities connected with the production and sales, or purchase and resale, of inventory or similar property are conducted by the payor in the payor's country of incorporation and other countries, then a percentage of the inventory or similar property (measured by the average value of the item as of the beginning and end of the quarter) is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation each quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the costs of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of such activities that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to all such costs incurred by reason of such activities worldwide. A cost incurred in connection with the production and sale or purchase and resale of inventory or similar property is included in this computation if it—


(*1*) Must be included in inventory costs or otherwise capitalized with respect to inventory or similar property under section 61, 263A, 471, or 472 and the regulations thereunder (whichever would be applicable were the payor a domestic corporation), or


(*2*) Would be deductible under section 162 (were the payor a domestic corporation) and is definitely related to gross income derived from such property (but not to all classes of gross income derived by the payor) under the principles of § 1.861-8.


(ix) *Location of debt instruments.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), debt instruments are considered to be used in a trade or business only if they arise from the sale of inventory or similar property by the payor or from the rendition of services by the payor in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the payor, but only until such time as interest is required to be charged under section 482 and the regulations thereunder. Debt instruments that arise from the sale of inventory or similar property are treated as having the same location, proportionately, as inventory or similar property that is held during the same calendar quarter. Debt instruments arising from the rendition of services in the ordinary course of a trade or business are considered located on a proportionate basis in the countries in which the services to which they relate are performed.


(x) *Treatment of certain stock interests.* For the purpose of determining the value of assets used in a trade or business in the country of incorporation, stock directly or indirectly owned by the payor within the meaning of section 958(a) in a controlled foreign corporation (“lower-tier corporation”), which is incorporated in the same country as the payor, shall be considered located in the country of incorporation and used in a trade or business of the payor in proportion to the value of the assets of the lower-tier corporation that are used in a trade or business in the country of incorporation. The location of assets used in a trade or business of the lower-tier corporation shall be determined under the rules of this paragraph (b)(3).


(xi) *Determination of period during which property is used in a trade or business.* Property purchased or produced for use in a trade or business shall not be considered used in a trade or business until it is placed in service, and shall cease to be considered used in a trade or business when it is retired from service. The dates during which depreciable property is determined to be in use must be consistent with the determination of depreciation under sections 167 and 168 and the regulations thereunder.


(xii) *Treatment of banks and insurance companies.* [Reserved]


(4) *Exclusion of rents and royalties derived from related persons*—(i) *In general.* Foreign personal holding company income does not include rents or royalties if—


(A) The payor is a corporation that is a related person as defined in section 954(d)(3), and


(B) The rents or royalties are for the use of, or the privilege of using, property within the country under the laws of which the recipient of the payments is created or organized.


(ii) *Rents or royalties paid out of adjusted foreign base company income or insurance income.* Rents or royalties may not be excluded from the foreign personal holding company income of the recipient under this paragraph (b)(4) to the extent that deductions for the payments are allocated under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.954-1T(a)(4) to the payor's adjusted gross foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(3)), adjusted gross insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6), or other categories of income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952(a), for purposes of computing the payor's net foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(4)), net insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or income described in section 952(a) (3), (4), or (5).


(5) *Exclusion of rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business.* Foreign personal holding company income shall not include rents or royalties which are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and which are received from a person other than a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3). Whether or not rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case; but see paragraph (c) or (d) of this section for specific cases in which rents or royalties will be considered for purposes of this paragraph to be derived in the active conduct of a trade or business. The frequency with which a foreign corporation enters into transactions from which rents or royalties are derived will not of itself establish the fact that such rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business.


(6) *Treatment of tax exempt interest.* Foreign personal holding company income includes all interest income, including interest that is exempt from U.S. tax pursuant to section 103 (“tax-exempt interest”). However, that net foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation that is attributable to such tax-exempt interest shall be treated as tax-exempt interest in the hands of the U.S. shareholders of the foreign corporation. Accordingly, any net foreign base company income that is included in the subpart F income of a U.S. shareholder and that is attributable to such tax-exempt interest shall remain exempt from the regular income tax, but potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax, in the hands of the U.S. shareholder.


(c) *Excluded rents*—(1) *Trade or business cases.* Rents will be considered for purposes of paragraph (b)(5) of this section to be derived in the active conduct of a trade or business if such rents are derived by the controlled foreign corporation (“lessor”) from leasing—


(i) Property which the lessor has manufactured or produced, or has acquired and added substantial value to, but only if the lessor is regularly engaged in the manufacture or production of, or in the acquisition and addition of substantial value to, property of such kind,


(ii) Real property with respect to which the lessor, through its own officers or staff of employees, regularly performs active and substantial management and operational functions while the property is leased,


(iii) Personal property ordinarily used by the lessor in the active conduct of a trade or business, leased during a temporary period when the property would, but for such leasing, be idle, or


(iv) Property which is leased as a result of the performance of marketing functions by such lessor if the lessor, through its own officers or staff of employees located in a foreign country, maintains and operates an organization in such country which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing, or of marketing and servicing, the leased property and which is substantial in relation to the amount of rents derived from the leasing of such property.


(2) *Special rules*—(i) *Adding substantial value.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the performance of marketing functions will not be considered to add substantial value to property.


(ii) *Substantiality of foreign organization.* An organization in a foreign country will be considered substantial in relation to the amount of rents, for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, if active leasing expenses, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii), equal or exceed 25 percent of the adjusted leasing profit, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.


(iii) *Active leasing expenses* The term “active leasing expenses” means the deductions incurred by an organization of the lessor in a foreign country which are properly allocable to rental income and which would be allowable under section 162 to the lessor (were the lessor a domestic corporation) other than—


(A) Deductions for compensation for personal services rendered by shareholders of, or related persons with respect to, the lessor,


(B) Deductions for rents paid or accrued,


(C) Deductions which, although generally allowable under section 162, would be specifically allowable to the lessor (were the lessor a domestic corporation) under sections other than section 162 (such as sections 167 and 168), and


(D) Deductions for payments made to independent contractors with respect to the leased property.


(iv) *Adjusted leasing profit.* The term “adjusted leasing profit” means the gross income of the lessor from rents, reduced by the sum of—


(A) The rents paid or incurred by the controlled foreign corporation with respect to such gross rental income,


(B) The amounts which would be allowable to such lessor (were the lessor a domestic corporation) as deductions under section 167 or 168 with respect to such rental income, and


(C) The amounts paid to independent contractors with respect to such rental income.


(3) *Illustrations.* The application of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples.


(d) *Excluded royalties*—(1) *Trade or business cases.* Royalties will be considered for purposes of paragarph (b)(5) of this section to be derived in the active conduct of a trade or business if such royalties are derived by the controlled foreign corporation (“licensor”) from licensing—


(i) Property which the licensor has developed, created, or produced, or has acquired and added substantial value to, but only so long as the licensor is regularly engaged in the development, creation, or production of, or in the acquisition of and addition of substantial value to, property of such kind, or


(ii) Property which is licensed as a result of the performance of marketing functions by such licensor and the licensor, through its own staff of employees located in a foreign country, maintains and operates an organization in such country which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing, or of marketing and servicing, the licensed property and which is substantial in relation to the amount of royalties derived from the licensing of such property.


(2) *Special rules*—(i) *Adding substantial value.* For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i), the performance of marketing functions will not be considered to add substantial value to property.


(ii) *Substantiality of foreign organization.* An organization in a foreign country will be considered substantial in relation to the amount of royalties, for purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if the active licensing expenses, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, equal or exceed 25 percent of the adjusted licensing profit, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.


(iii) *Active licensing expenses.* The term “active licensing expenses” means the deductions incurred by an organization of the licensor which are properly allocable to royalty income and which would be allowable under section 162 to the licensor (were the licensor a domestic corporation) other than—


(A) Deductions for compensation for personal services rendered by shareholders of, or related persons with respect to, the licensor,


(B) Deductions for royalties paid or incurred,


(C) Deductions which, although generally allowable under section 162, would be specifically allowable to the licensor (were the controlled foreign corporation a domestic corporation) under sections other than section 162 (such as section 167), and


(D) Deductions for payments made to independent contractors with respect to the licensed property.


(iv) *Adjusted licensing profit.* The term “adjusted licensing profit” means the gross income of the licensor from royalties, reduced by the sum of—


(A) The royalties paid or incurred by the controlled foreign corporation with respect to such gross royalty income,


(B) The amounts which would be allowable to such licensor as deductions under section 167 (were the licensor a domestic corporation) with respect to such royalty income, and


(C) The amounts paid to independent contractors with respect to such royalty income.


(3) *Illustrations.* The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples.


(e) *Certain property transactions*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Inclusion in FPHC income.* Foreign personal holding company income includes the excess of gains over losses from the sale or exchange of—


(A) Property which gives rise to dividends, interest, rents, royalties or annuities as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and


(B) Property which does not give rise to income, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(ii) *Dual character property.* Property may only in part constitute property that gives rise to certain income as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section or property that does not give rise to any income as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. In such cases, the property must be treated as two separate properties for purposes of this paragraph (e). Accordingly, the sale or exchange of such dual character property will give rise to gain or loss that in part must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e), and in part is excluded from such computation. Gain or loss from the disposition of dual character property must be bifurcated for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(i) pursuant to the method that most reasonably reflects the relative uses of the property. Reasonable methods may include comparisons in terms of gross income generated or the physical division of the property. In the case of real property, the physical division of the property will in most cases be the most reasonable method available. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation owns an office building, uses 60 percent of the building in its business, and rents out the other 40 percent, then 40 percent of the gain recognized on the disposition of the property would reasonably be treated as gain which is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1). This paragraph (e)(1)(ii) addresses the contemporaneous use of property for dual purposes; for rules concerning changes in the use of property affecting its classification for purposes of this paragraph (e), see paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(2) *Property that gives rise to certain income*—(i) *In general.* Property the sale or exchange of which gives rise to foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(2) includes property that gives rise to dividends, interest, rents, royalties and annuities described in paragraph (b) of this section, except for rents and royalties derived from unrelated persons in the active conduct of a trade or business under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The property described by this paragraph (e)(2) includes property which gives rise to export financing interest described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and property which gives rise to income from related persons described in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.


(ii) *Exception.* Property described in this paragraph (e)(2) does not include—


(A) Dealer property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section), and


(B) Inventory and similar property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section) other than securities.


(3) *Property that does not give rise to income.* The term “property that does not give rise to income” for purposes of this section includes all rights and interests in property (whether or not a capital asset) except—


(i) Property that gives rise to dividends, interest, rents, royalties and annuities described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and property that gives rise to rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business under paragraph (b)(5) of this section;


(ii) Dealer property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section);


(iii) Inventory and similar property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)) other than securities;


(iv) Property (other than real property) used in the controlled foreign corporation's trade or business that is of a character which would be subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167 or 168 and the regulations thereunder (including tangible property described in § 1.167(a)-2 and intangibles described in § 1.167(a)-3);


(v) Real property that does not give rise to rental or similar income, to the extent used in the controlled foreign corporation's trade or business; and


(vi) Intangible property as defined in section 936(h)(3)(B) and goodwill that is not subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167 and the regulations thereunder to the extent used in the controlled foreign corporation's trade or business and disposed of in connection with the sale of a trade or business of the controlled foreign corporation. 


(4) *Classification of gain or loss from the disposition of a debt instrument or on a deferred payment sale*—(i) *Gain.* Gain from the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e) unless—


(A) It is treated as interest income (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section); or


(B) It is treated as income equivalent to interest under paragraph (h) of this section.


(ii) *Loss.* Loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e) unless—


(A) It is directly allocated to interest income (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) or income equivalent to interest (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section) under any provision of the Code or regulations thereunder;


(B) It is required to be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense under section 864(e) or any other provision of the Code or regulations thereunder; or


(C) The debt instrument was taken in consideration for the sale or exchange of property (or the provision of services) by the controlled foreign corporation and gain or loss from that sale or exchange (or income from the provision of services) is not includible in foreign base company income under this section.


(5) *Classification of options and other rights to acquire or transfer property.* Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraphs (e)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section (relating to certain dealer property and inventory property), rights to acquire or transfer property, including property that gives rise to income, are classified as property that does not give rise to income under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. These rights include options, warrants, futures contracts, options on a futures contract, forward contracts, and options on an index relating to stocks, securities or interest rates.


(6) *Classification of certain interests in pass through entities.* [Reserved]


(f) *Commodities transactions*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), foreign personal holding company income includes the excess of gains over losses from commodities transactions. If losses from commodities transactions exceed gains, the net loss is not within the definition of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (f), and may not be allocated to, or otherwise reduce, foreign personal holding company income under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.954-1T(a)(4). The terms “commodity” and “commodities transactions” are defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Gains and losses from qualified active sales and qualified hedging transactions are excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (f). The term “qualified active sales” is defined in paragraph (f)(3). The term “qualified hedging transaction” is defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. An election is provided under paragraph (g)(5) of this section to include all gains and losses from section 1256 foreign currency transactions, which would otherwise be commodities transactions, in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g) instead of this paragraph (f). A loss that is deferred or that otherwise may not be taken into account under any provision of the Code may not be taken into account for purposes of determining foreign personal holding company income under any provision of this paragraph (f).


(2) *Definitions*—(i) *Commodity.* For purposes of this section, the term “commodity” means:


(A) Tangible personal property of a kind which is actively traded or with respect to which contractual interests are actively traded, and


(B) Nonfunctional currency (as defined under section 988 and the regulations thereunder). 


(ii) *Commodities transaction.* A commodities transaction means the purchase or sale of a commodity for immediate (spot) delivery, or deferred (forward) delivery, or the right to purchase, sell, receive, or transfer a commodity, or any other right or obligation with respect to a commodity, accomplished through a cash or off-exchange market, an interbank market, an organized exchange or board of trade, an over-the-counter market, or in a transaction effected between private parties outside of any market. Commodities transactions include, but are not limited to:


(A) A futures or forward contract in a commodity,


(B) A leverage contract in a commodity purchased from leverage transaction merchants,


(C) An exchange of futures for physical transaction,


(D) A transaction in which the income or loss to the parties is measured by reference to the price of a commodity, a pool of commodities, or an index of commodities,


(E) The purchase or sale of an option or other right to acquire or transfer a commodity, a futures contract in a commodity, or an index of commodities, and


(F) The delivery of one commodity in exchange for the delivery of another commodity, the same commodity at another time, cash, or nonfunctional currency.


(3) *Definition of the term “qualified active sales”*—(i) *In general.* The term “qualified active sales” means the sale of commodities in the active conduct of a commodity business as a producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities if substantially all of the controlled foreign corporation's business is as an active producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities of like kind. The sale of commodities held by a controlled foreign corporation other than in its capacity as an active producer, processor, merchant or handler of commodities of like kind is not a qualified active sale.


(ii) *Sale of commodities.* The term “sale of commodities” means any transaction in which the controlled foreign corporation intends to deliver to a purchaser a commodity held by the controlled foreign corporation in physical form.


(iii) *Active conduct of a commodities business.* For purposes of this paragraph, a controlled foreign corporation is engaged in the active conduct of a commodities business as a producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities only if—


(A) It holds commodities as inventory or similar property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)); and


(B) It incurs substantial expenses in the ordinary course of a commodities business from engaging in one of the following activities directly, and not through an independent contractor:


(*1*) Substantial activities in the production of commodities, including planting, tending or harvesting crops, raising or slaughtering livestock, or extracting minerals.


(*2*) Substantial processing activities prior to the sale of commodities including concentrating, refining, mixing, crushing, aerating, or milling; or


(*3*) Significant activities relating to the physical movement, handling and storage of commodities including preparation of contracts and invoices; arranging freight, insurance and credit; arranging for receipt, transfer or negotiation of shipping documents; arranging storage or warehousing, and dealing with quality claims; owning and operating facilities for storage or warehousing or owning or chartering vessels or vehicles for the transportation of commodities.


(iv) *Substantially all.* Substantially all of the controlled foreign corporation's business is as an active producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities if the activities described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) give rise to 85 percent of the taxable income of the controlled foreign corporation (computed as though the corporation were a domestic corporation). For this purpose, gains or losses from qualified hedging transactions, as defined in paragraph (f)(4), are considered derived from the qualified active sales to which they relate or are expected to relate.


(4) *Definition of the term “qualified hedging transaction.”* The term “qualified hedging transaction” means a bona fide hedging transaction that:


(i) Is reasonably necessary to the conduct of business as a producer, processor, merchant or handler of a commodity in the manner in which such business is customarily and usually conducted by others;


(ii) Is entered into primarily to reduce the risk of price change (but not the risk of currency fluctuations) with respect to commodities sold or to be sold in qualified active sales described in paragraph (f)(3) of this paragraph; and


(iii) Is clearly identified on the controlled foreign corporation's records before the close of the fifth day after the day during which the hedging transaction is entered into and at a time when there is a reasonable risk of loss; however, if the controlled foreign corporation does not at such time specifically and properly identify the qualified active sales (or category of such sales) to which a hedging transaction relates, the district director in his sole discretion may determine which hedging transactions (if any) are related to qualified active sales.


(g) *Foreign currency gain*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2), foreign personal holding company income includes the excess of foreign currency gains over losses (as defined in section 988(b)) attributable to any section 988 transactions. If foreign currency losses exceed gains, the net loss is not within the definition of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g), and may not be allocated to, or otherwise reduce, foreign personal holding company income under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.954-1T(a)(4). To the extent the gain or loss from a transaction is treated as interest income or expense under sections 988(a)(2) or 988(d) and the regulations thereunder, it is not included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g). (For other rules concerning income described in more than one category of foreign personal holding company income, see § 1.954-2(a)(2).) A loss that is deferred or that otherwise may not be taken into account under any provision of the Code may not be taken into account for purposes of determining foreign personal holding company income under any provision of this paragraph (g).


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *Qualified business units using the dollar approximate separate transactions method.* Any DASTM gain or loss computed under § 1.985-3(d) must be allocated under the rules of § 1.985-3 (e)(2)(iv) or (e)(3).


(ii) *Tracing to exclude foreign currency gain or loss from qualified business and hedging transactions.* A foreign currency gain or loss is excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g) if it is clearly identified on the records of the controlled foreign corporation as being derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction. The term “qualified business transaction” is defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The term “qualified hedging transaction” is defined paragraph (g)(4) of this section. However, currency gain or loss of a qualified business unit included in the computation of currency gain or loss under subdivision (i) of this paragraph (g)(2) may not be excluded from foreign personal holding company income under the tracing rule of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii). Furthermore, the tracing rule of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) will not apply if a controlled foreign corporation makes the election provided by paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.


(iii) *Election out of tracing.* A controlled foreign corporation may elect a method of accounting under which all foreign currency gains or losses attributable to section 988 transactions are included in foreign personal holding company income. The scope and requirements for this election are provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. This election does not apply to foreign currency gains or losses of a qualified business unit included in the computation of gain or loss under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.


(3) *Definition of the term “qualified business transaction”*—(i) *In general.* The term “qualified business transaction” means a transaction (other than a “qualified hedging transaction” as described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) that:


(A) Does not have investment or speculation as a significant purpose;


(B) Is not attributable to property or an activity of the kind that gives rise to subpart F income (other than foreign currency gain under this paragraph (g)), or could reasonably be expected to give rise to subpart F income (including upon disposition); for example, the transaction may not be attributable to stock or debt of another corporation (including related corporations organized and operating in the same country), or property likely to give rise to foreign base company sales or services income; and


(C) Is attributable to business transactions described in subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (g)(3).


(ii) *Specific business transactions.* A transaction of a controlled foreign corporation must meet the requirements of any of subdivisions (A) through (F) of this paragraph (g)(3)(ii) to be a qualified business transaction under this paragraph (g)(3).


(A) *Acquisition of debt instruments.* If the transaction is the acquisition of a debt instrument described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(i) and the regulations thereunder, the debt must be derived from—


(*1*) The sale of inventory and similar property to customers by the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations, or


(*2*) The rendition of services by the corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations.


(B) *Becoming the obligor under debt instruments.* If the transaction is becoming the obligor under a debt instrument described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(i) and the regulations thereunder, the debt must be incurred for:


(*1*) Payment of expenses that are includible by the controlled foreign corporation in the cost of goods sold under § 1.61-3 for property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of regular business operations, are inventoriable costs under section 471 and the regulations thereunder, or are allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from inventory and similar property,


(*2*) Payment of expenses that are allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from services provided by the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations,


(*3*) Acquisition of an asset that does not give rise to subpart F income during the current taxable year (other than by application of section 952(c)) and is not reasonably expected to give rise to subpart F income in subsequent taxable years, or


(*4*) Acquisition of dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section.


(C) *Accrual of any item of gross income.* If the transaction is the accrual (or otherwise taking into account) of any item of gross income or receipts as described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) and the regulations thereunder, the item of gross income or receipts must be derived from:


(*1*) The sale of inventory and similar property in the ordinary course of regular business operations, or


(*2*) The provision of services by the controlled foreign corporation to customers in the ordinary course of regular business operations.


(D) *Accrual of any item of expense.* If the transaction is the accrual (or otherwise taking into account) of any item of expense as described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) and the regulations thereunder, the item of expense must be:


(*1*) An expense that is includible by the controlled foreign corporation in the cost of goods sold under § 1.61-3 for property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of regular business operations, is an inventoriable cost under section 471 and the regulations thereunder, or is allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from inventory and similar property, or


(*2*) An expense that is allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from services provided by the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations.


(E) *Entering into forward contracts, futures contracts, options and similar instruments.* If the transaction is entering into any forward contract, futures contract, option or similar financial instrument and if such contract or instrument is not marked to market at the close of the taxable year under section 1256, as described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(iii) and the regulations thereunder, then the contract or instrument must be property held as dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.


(F) *Disposition of nonfunctional currency.* If the transaction is the disposition of nonfunctional currency, as described in section 988(c)(1)(C) and the regulations thereunder, then the transaction must be for a purpose described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B), for the payment of taxes not attributable to subpart F income, or must be the disposition of property held as dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section.


(G) *Transactions in business assets.* The acquisition or disposition of an asset that is used or held for use in the active conduct of a trade or business.


(4) *Definition of the term “qualified hedging transaction”*—(i) *In general.* The term “qualified hedging transaction” means a bona fide hedging transaction meeting all the requirements of subdivisions (A) through (D) of this paragraph (g)(4)(i):


(A) The transaction must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of regular business operations in the manner in which such business operations are customarily and usually conducted by others.


(B) The transaction must be entered into primarily to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to property or services sold or to be sold or expenses incurred or to be incurred in transactions that are qualified business transactions under paragraph (g)(3) of this section.


(C) The hedging transaction and the property or expense (or category of property or expense) to which it relates must be clearly identified on the records of the controlled foreign corporation before the close of the fifth day after the day during which the hedging transaction is entered into and at a time during which there is a reasonable risk of currency loss.


(D) The amount of foreign currency gain or loss that is attributable to a specific hedging transaction must be clearly identifiable on the records of the controlled foreign corporation or its controlling shareholder (as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5)).


(ii) *Change in purpose of hedging transaction.* If a hedging transaction is entered into for one purpose, and the purpose for that transaction subsequently changes, the transaction may be treated as two separate hedging transactions for purposes of this paragraph (g)(4). In such a case, the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction is considered a qualified hedging transaction if it separately meets all the other requirements of this paragraph (g)(4) for treatment as a qualified hedging transaction. For purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C), the foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedge becomes so related (*i.e.,* either the day on which the hedge is first entered into or on the day on which it first relates to a qualified business transaction due to a change in its purpose). The foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that does not relate to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the purpose for the hedging transaction changes.


(5) *Election out of tracing*—(i) *In general.* A controlled foreign corporation may elect to account for currency gains and losses under section 988 and gains and losses from section 1256 currency contracts by including in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g) all foreign currency gains or losses attributable to section 988 transactions, and all gains or losses from section 1256 foreign currency contracts. Separate elections for section 1256 foreign currency contracts and section 988 transactions are not permitted. If a controlled foreign corporation makes the election described in this paragraph (g)(5)(i), the election is effective for all related persons as defined in section 954(d)(3) and the regulations thereunder.


(ii) *Exception.* The election provided by this paragraph (g)(5) does not apply to foreign currency gain or loss of a qualified business unit determined under § 1.985-3T(d)(2). It does, however, apply to other foreign currency gains or losses of a qualified business unit that elects (or is deemed to elect) the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.


(iii) *Procedure*—(A) *In general.* The election provided by this paragraph (g)(5) shall be made in the manner prescribed in this paragraph and in subsequent administrative pronouncements.


(B) *Time and manner.* The controlled foreign corporation may make the election by filing a statement with its original or amended information return for the taxable year for which the election is made. The controlling United States shareholders, as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5), may make the election on behalf of the controlled foreign corporation and related corporations by filing a statement to such effect with their original or amended income tax returns for the taxable year during which the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation for which the election is made ends. The election is effective for the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation for which the election is made, for the taxable years of all related controlled foreign corporations ending within such taxable year, and for all subsequent years of such corporations. The statement shall include the following information:


(*1*) The name, address, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of each United States shareholder;


(*2*) The name, address, and taxable year of each controlled foreign corporation for which the election is effective; and


(*3*) Any additional information to be required by the Secretary by administrative pronouncement.


(C) *Termination.* The election provided by this paragraph (g)(5) may be terminated only with the consent of the Commissioner: Attn.: CC:INTL.


(h) *Income equivalent to interest*—(1) *In general.* Foreign personal holding company income includes income that is equivalent to interest. Income equivalent to interest includes, but is not limited to, income derived from the following categories of transactions:


(i) An investment, or series of integrated transactions which include an investment, in which the payments, net payments, cash flows, or return predominantly reflect the time value of money, and


(ii) Transactions in which the payments or a predominant portion thereof are in substance for the use or forebearance of money, but are not generally treated as interest.


(2) *Illustrations.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h):


(3) *Income equivalent to interest from factoring*—(i) *General rule.* Income equivalent to interest includes factoring income. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, the term “factoring income” includes any income (including any discount income or service fee, but excluding any stated interest) derived from the acquisition and collection or disposition of a factored receivable. The rules of this paragraph (h)(3) apply only with respect to the tax treatment of factoring income derived from the acquisition and collection or disposition of a factored receivable and shall not affect the characterization of an expense or loss of either the person whose goods or services gave rise to a factored receivable or the obligor under a receivable. The amount of income equivalent to interest realized with respect to a factored receivable is the difference (if a positive number) between the amount paid for the receivable by the foreign corporation and the amount that it collects on the receivable (or realizes upon its sale of the receivable).


(ii) *Exceptions.* Factoring income shall not include—


(A) Income treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or (6) and the regulations thereunder (relating to income derived from trade or service receivables of related persons), even if such income is not treated as described in section 864(d)(1) by reason of the same-country exception of section 864(d)(7);


(B) Income derived from a factored receivable if payment for the acquisition of the receivable is made on or after the date on which stated interest begins to accrue, but only if the rate of stated interest equals or exceeds 120 percent of the Federal short term rate (as defined under section 1274) (or the equivalent rate for a currency other than the dollar) as of the date on which the receivable is acquired by the foreign corporation; or


(C) Income derived from a factored receivable if payment for the acquisition of the receivable by the foreign corporation is made only on or after the anticipated date of payment of all principal by the obligor (or the anticipated weighted average date of payment of a pool of purchased receivables).


(iii) *Factored receivable.* For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), the term “factored receivable” includes any account receivable or other evidence of indebtedness, whether or not issued at a discount and whether or not bearing stated interest, arising out of the disposition of property or the performance of services by any person, if such account receivable or evidence of indebtedness is acquired by a person other than the person who disposed of the property or provided the services that gave rise to the account receivable or evidence of indebtedness. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), it is immaterial whether the person providing the property or services agrees to transfer the receivable at the time of sale (as by accepting a third-party charge or credit card) or at a later time.


(iv) *Illustrations.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h)(3).


(4) *Determination of sales income.* Income equivalent to interest for purposes of this paragraph (h) does not include income from the sale of property unless the sale is part of an integrated transaction that gives rise to interest or income equivalent to interest. Income derived by a controlled foreign corporation will be treated as arising from the sale of property only if the corporation in substance carries out sales activities. Accordingly, an arrangement that is designed to lend the form of a sales transaction to a transaction that in substance constitutes and advance of funds will be disregarded. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation acquires property on 30-day payment terms from one person and sells that property to another person on 90 day payment terms and at prearranged prices and terms such that the foreign corporation bears no substantial economic risk with respect to the purchase and sale other than the risk of non-payment, the foreign corporation has not in substance derived income from the sale of property.


(5) *Receivables arising from performance of services.* If payment for services performed by a controlled foreign corporation is not made until more than 120 days after the date on which such services are performed, then the income derived by the foreign corporation constitutes income equivalent to interest to the extent that interest income would be imputed under the principles of section 483 or the original issue discount provisions (section 1271 *et seq.*), if—


(A) Such provisions applied to contracts for the performance of services,


(B) The time period referred to in sections 483(c)(1) and 1274(c)(1)(B) were 120 days rather than six months, and


(C) The time period referred to in section 483(c)(1)(A) were 120 days rather than one year.
