# ยง 25.6011-1   General requirement of return, statement, or list.

(a) *General rule.* Every person made liable for any tax imposed by Chapter 12 of the Code shall make such returns or statements as are required by the regulations in this part. The return or statement shall include therein the information required by the applicable regulations or forms.


(b) *Use of prescribed forms.* Copies of the forms prescribed by paragraph (b) of ยง 25.6001-1 and ยง 25.6019-1 may be obtained from district directors and directors of service centers. The fact that a person required to file a form has not been furnished with copies of a form will not excuse him from the making of a gift tax return, or from the furnishing of the evidence for which the forms are to be used. Application for a form should be made to the district director or director of a service center in ample time to enable the person whose duty it is to file the form to have the form prepared, verified, and filed on or before the date prescribed for the filing thereof.
