# § 26.2642-7   Relief under section 2642(g)(1).

(a) *In general.* Under section 2642(g)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate (Secretary) has the authority to issue regulations describing the circumstances in which a transferor, as defined in section 2652(a) of the Code, or the executor of a transferor's estate, as defined in section 2203 of the Code, will be granted an extension of time to allocate generation-skipping transfer (GST) exemption as described in section 2642(b)(1) and (2). The Secretary also has the authority to issue regulations describing the circumstances under which a transferor or the executor of a transferor's estate will be granted an extension of time to make the elections described in section 2632(b)(3) and (c)(5) of the Code. Section 2632(b)(3) provides that an election may be made by or on behalf of a transferor not to have the transferor's GST exemption automatically allocated under section 2632(b)(1) to a direct skip, as defined in section 2612(c), made by the transferor during life. Section 2632(c)(5)(A)(i) provides that an election may be made by or on behalf of a transferor not to have the transferor's GST exemption automatically allocated under section 2632(c)(1) to an indirect skip, as defined in section 2632(c)(3)(A), or to any or all transfers made by such transferor to a particular trust. Section 2632(c)(5)(A)(ii) provides that an election may be made by or on behalf of a transferor to treat any trust as a GST trust, as defined in section 2632(c)(3)(B), for purposes of section 2632(c) with respect to any or all transfers made by that transferor to the trust. This section generally describes the factors that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will consider when an extension of time is sought by or on behalf of a transferor to timely allocate GST exemption or to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5). If the time period for an automatic six-month extension under paragraph (i)(1) of this section has passed, relief provided under this section can be requested through the IRS private letter ruling program. See paragraph (i) of this section.


(b) *Effect of relief*—(1) *In general.* If an extension of time to allocate GST exemption is granted under this section, the allocation of GST exemption, once made, will be considered effective as of the date of the transfer. Further, the amount of the transferor's GST exemption required to be allocated in order to produce a zero inclusion ratio solely with regard to that transfer will be the value of the property transferred for purposes of chapter 11 or chapter 12 of the Code as of the date of the transfer. If an extension of time to elect out of the automatic allocation of GST exemption under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5)(A)(i) is granted under this section, the election, once made, will be considered effective as of the date of and immediately prior to the transfer. If an extension of time to elect to treat any trust as a GST trust under section 2632(c)(5)(A)(ii) is granted under this section, the election, once made, will be considered effective as of the date of and immediately prior to the first (or each) transfer covered by that election. See paragraph (h) of this section with regard to preserving a taxpayer's eligibility for a refund generated by a grant of relief, if applicable.


(2) [Reserved]


(3) *Effect on other transfers.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, an allocation of exemption or an election made pursuant to a grant of relief under this section does not reduce or eliminate any affirmative allocation or void any election made with respect to any other transfer occurring contemporaneously with or subsequent to the transfer or transfers for which relief has been granted.


(c) *Limitation on relief.* The amount of GST exemption that may be allocated to a transfer as the result of relief granted under this section in no event may exceed the amount of the transferor's unused GST exemption under section 2631(c) of the Code as of the date of the transfer. Thus, if, by the time of the making of the allocation or election pursuant to relief granted under this section, the GST exemption amount under section 2631(c) has increased to an amount in excess of the amount in effect for the date of the transfer, no portion of the increased amount may be applied to that earlier transfer by reason of the relief granted under this section.


(d) *Basis for determination*—(1) *In general.* Requests for relief under this section will be granted when and to the extent that the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate provides evidence (including the affidavits described in paragraph (i) of this section) establishing to the satisfaction of the IRS that the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate acted reasonably and in good faith, and that the grant of relief will not prejudice the interests of the government. Paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section set forth nonexclusive lists of factors the IRS will consider in determining whether this standard of reasonableness, good faith, and lack of prejudice to the interests of the government has been met so that such relief will be granted. In making this determination, the IRS will consider those factors set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, as well as all other facts and circumstances not specifically set forth herein that are relevant to the particular situation. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth some situations in which this standard is not met and, as a result, in which relief under this section will not be granted.


(2) *Reasonableness and good faith.* The following is a nonexclusive list of factors that will be considered in determining whether the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate acted reasonably and in good faith for purposes of this section. Not all of these factors may be relevant in a particular situation (and those that are not relevant are not required to be addressed in the request for relief made in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section). Further, it is possible that the evidence relating to any one of these factors, in the context of all of the facts and circumstances of the particular situation, may be sufficient to persuade the IRS that the grant of relief under section 2642(g)(1) would be appropriate. However, as a general rule, no single factor (whether listed or not) will be determinative in all cases. The factors are as follows:


(i) *Intent.* The intent of the transferor to timely allocate GST exemption to a transfer or to timely make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), as evidenced in the trust instrument, the instrument of transfer, or other relevant documents contemporaneous with the transfer, such as Federal gift and estate tax returns and correspondence. This may include evidence of the intended GST tax status of the transfer or the trust (for example, exempt, non-exempt, or partially exempt), or more explicit evidence of intent with regard to the allocation of GST exemption or the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5).


(ii) *Intervening events.* Intervening events beyond the control of the transferor or of the executor of the transferor's estate that caused the failure to allocate GST exemption to a transfer or the failure to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5).


(iii) *Lack of awareness.* Lack of awareness, despite the exercise of reasonable diligence, by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate of the need to allocate GST exemption to the transfer, taking into account the experience of the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate and the complexity of the GST tax issue, as the cause of the failure to allocate GST exemption to a transfer or to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5).


(iv) *Consistency.* Consistency by the transferor with regard to the allocation of the transferor's GST exemption to one or more trusts or skip persons. For example, the transferor's consistent pattern of allocation of GST exemption to transfers (whether or not made in consecutive years) to skip persons or to a particular trust, or the transferor's consistent pattern of electing not to have the automatic allocation of GST exemption apply to transfers (whether or not made in consecutive years), will be taken into consideration. Evidence of consistency may be less relevant if there has been a change of circumstances or a change of trust beneficiaries that otherwise would explain a deviation from prior GST exemption allocation decisions. Relief under this section will not be denied merely because a pattern of allocation or election does not exist or because the existing pattern changed at some point, whether in response to the enactment of section 2642(g) or to some other factor unrelated to either a lack of reasonableness or good faith or prejudice to the interests of the government.


(v) *Qualified tax professional.* Reasonable reliance by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate on the advice of a qualified tax professional retained or employed by one or both of them and either the failure of the tax professional, or, in reliance on or consistent with (or in the absence of) that tax professional's advice, the failure of the transferor or the executor, to allocate GST exemption to the transfer or to make an election described in section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5). Reliance on a qualified tax professional will not be considered to have been reasonable if the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate knew or should have known that the professional either—


(A) Was not competent to render advice on the GST exemption; or


(B) Was not aware of all relevant facts.


(3) *Prejudice to the interests of the government.* The following is a nonexclusive list of factors that will be considered to determine whether the interests of the government would be prejudiced for purposes of this section:


(i) *Hindsight.* An attempt to benefit from hindsight will be deemed to prejudice the interests of the government. A factor relevant to this determination is whether the grant of the requested relief would permit an economic advantage or other benefit that would not have been available if the allocation or election had been timely made. For example, there may be prejudice if a grant of the requested relief would permit an economic advantage or other benefit that results from the selection of one out of a number of alternatives (other than whether or not to make an allocation or election) that were available at the time the allocation or election could have been timely made, if hindsight makes the selected alternative more beneficial than the other alternatives. Prejudice also would exist if the transferor failed to make the allocation or election in order to wait to see (thus, with the benefit of hindsight) whether making an allocation of exemption or election would be more beneficial than not making the allocation or election. For instance, assume that a transferor funds several trusts with different property interests on the same date, and does not allocate GST exemption to any trust. Several years later, the transferor seeks relief to allocate GST exemption to the trust that enjoyed the greatest asset appreciation and thus constitutes the most effective use of the transferor's GST exemption. Relief will not be granted because the transferor attempted to benefit from hindsight and thereby acquire an economic advantage.


(ii) *Timing of the request for relief.* The timing of the request for relief will be considered in determining whether the interests of the government would be prejudiced by granting relief under this section. The interests of the government would be prejudiced if delay by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate in the filing of the request for relief was intended to deprive the IRS of a sufficient period of time in which to challenge any element of the transfer that is the subject of the request for relief, such as the value of the transferred property for Federal gift or estate tax purposes, the claimed identity of the transferor of the transferred property, or any other aspect of the transfer that is relevant for Federal gift or estate tax purposes. For this purpose, such intent will be presumed, but may be rebutted by evidence persuasive to the IRS of the existence of other reasons for or circumstances causing the delay.


(iii) *Intervening taxable events.* The occurrence and effect of an intervening taxable termination or taxable distribution will be considered in determining whether and to what extent the interests of the government would be prejudiced by a grant of relief under this section. The interests of the government may be prejudiced if a taxable termination or a taxable distribution occurred between the time for making a timely allocation of GST exemption or a timely election described in section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5) and the time at which the request for relief under this section was filed. The impact of a grant of relief on (and the difficulty of adjusting) the GST tax consequences of that intervening termination or distribution will be considered in determining whether the occurrence of a taxable termination or taxable distribution constitutes prejudice.


(iv) *Closed years.* Subject to the considerations described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the expiration of any period of limitations on the assessment or collection of transfer taxes prior to the filing of a request for relief under this section generally is not relevant to the determination of whether the requirements for a grant of relief under this section have been met. If that period has expired, however, and if the IRS concludes that the value of the transferred asset or assets as reported on a Federal gift or estate tax return by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate is likely to have satisfied the definition of a gross valuation misstatement as defined in section 6662(h)(2)(C) of the Code, the IRS will consider the purported undervaluation in determining whether a grant of relief will prejudice the interests of the government.


(e) *Situations in which the standard of reasonableness, good faith, and lack of prejudice to the interests of the government has not been met*—(1) *In general.* Relief under this section will not be granted if the IRS determines that the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate has not acted reasonably and in good faith, or that the grant of relief would prejudice the interests of the government. The following situations illustrate some circumstances in which the standard of reasonableness, good faith, and lack of prejudice to the interests of the government has not been met, and as a result, in which relief under this section will not be granted.


(2) *Affirmative allocations*—(i) In general, relief will not be granted under this section to the extent that it would decrease or revoke an affirmative (but not automatic) allocation of GST exemption under section 2632(a) or 2642(b) that was made on a Federal gift or estate tax return, regardless of whether the transfer or the allocation of exemption was made during the transferor's life or upon the transferor's death.


(ii) There are three exceptions to this general rule, as follows. No request for relief is required for either of the first two exceptions:


(A) An allocation of GST exemption is void to the extent the amount allocated exceeds the amount necessary to obtain an inclusion ratio of zero with respect to the property transferred or to the trust. This provision does not apply to charitable lead annuity trusts, nor does it apply to an allocation made to a trust subject to an estate tax inclusion period before the termination of that period. *See* § 26.2632-1(b)(4)(i).


(B) An allocation is void if the allocation is made with respect to a trust that, at the time of the allocation, has no GST potential with respect to the transferor making the allocation. For this purpose, a trust has GST potential even if the possibility of a GST is so remote as to be negligible. *See* § 26.2632-1(b)(4)(i).


(C) A late allocation of GST exemption, as described in section 2642(b)(3), to a transfer or to a trust will be deemed void upon the grant of relief under this section if—


(*1*) Prior to December 31, 2000, a transfer is made that is subject to GST tax or to a trust that has GST potential with respect to the transferor;


(*2*) A timely allocation of GST exemption was not made to the transfer or the trust, and this missed allocation was not eligible for relief prior to the enactment of section 2642(g)(1);


(*3*) Prior to December 31, 2000, a late allocation of GST exemption was made to the transfer or the trust;


(*4*) The late allocation is disclosed as part of the request for relief or during the IRS's consideration of that request; and


(*5*) Relief under this section is granted to make a timely allocation to the transfer or the trust described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section.


(3) *Timing.* Relief will not be granted with regard to a transfer reported on the transferor's gift tax return in the situation in which the transferor filed the request for relief shortly after the expiration of the period during which an assessment of gift tax could be made with respect to that transfer, the IRS reasonably concludes that the transferor intentionally delayed that filing for the purpose of preventing an IRS examination of the reported value of the property subject to that transfer or the claimed identity of the transferor or other fact relevant for transfer tax purposes, and the transferor is unable to produce evidence sufficient to convince the IRS that the filing delay was attributable to some other reason or purpose.


(4) *Failure after being accurately informed.* Relief will not be granted under this section if the decision made by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate (who had been accurately informed in all material respects by a qualified tax professional retained or employed by either (or both) of them with regard to the allocation of GST exemption or an election described in section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5)) was reflected or implemented by the action or inaction that is the subject of the request for relief.


(5) *Hindsight.* Relief under this section will not be granted if the IRS determines that the requested relief is an attempt to benefit from hindsight by waiting to see which of multiple transfers, made at substantially the same time but consisting of different property interests, enjoyed the greatest appreciation and thus would constitute the most effective use of the transferor's GST exemption.


(f) [Reserved]


(g) *Period of limitations under section 6501.* A request for relief under this section does not reopen, suspend, or extend the period of limitations on assessment or collection of any estate, gift, or GST tax under section 6501 of the Code. The IRS may request that the transferor or the transferor's executor consent, under section 6501(c)(4) and prior to the expiration of that period of limitations, to an extension of the period of limitations on assessment or collection of any or all gift and GST taxes for the transfer or transfers that are the subject of the requested relief. The transferor or the transferor's executor has the right to refuse to extend the period of limitations, or to limit any such extension to particular issues or to a particular period of time. *See* section 6501(c)(4)(B). Because a consent to an extension (whether or not limited) may eliminate prejudice to the interests of the government described in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (e)(3) of this section, a refusal to consent to an extension is a factor that may adversely impact the availability of the requested relief.


(h) *Refunds.* The filing of a request for relief under section 2642(g)(1) with the IRS does not constitute a claim for refund or credit of an overpayment and no implied right to refund will arise from the filing of such a request for relief. Similarly, the filing of such a request for relief does not extend the period of limitations under section 6511 of the Code for filing a claim for refund or credit of an overpayment. If the grant of relief under section 2642(g)(1) results in the decrease of a trust's inclusion ratio or a reduction in the amount of a direct skip, and thus in a potential claim for refund or credit of an overpayment of tax, no such refund or credit will be allowed to the taxpayer or to the taxpayer's estate if the period of limitations under section 6511 for filing a claim for a refund or credit of the Federal gift, estate, or GST tax that was reduced by the granted relief has expired, unless a claim for refund or credit was filed before the expiration of that period. The taxpayer or the taxpayer's estate is responsible for preserving any potential claim for refund or credit.


(i) *Procedural requirements*—(1) *Automatic 6-month extension.* An automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of the gift or estate tax return, or of the Form 8939, *Allocation of Increase in Basis for Property Acquired From a Decedent,* of a decedent dying in calendar year 2010, (in each case, excluding extensions) is granted to file a supplemental return or Form 8939 on which the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate may allocate GST exemption or make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5). This extension, however, is available only if the transferor (or the executor of a transferor's estate) both timely filed the gift or estate tax return or the Form 8939 on which the GST exemption should have been allocated or the election should have been made, and, within that 6-month extension period, files a supplemental return or other supplementary filing. On the supplemental return or other filing, the taxpayer must comply with all of the requirements for allocating GST exemption under section 2632 or for making the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5) for the year the allocation or election should have been made to make a valid allocation or election. Any supplemental return filed pursuant to this paragraph must say *FILED PURSUANT TO § 26.2642-7(i)(1)* on the front page of the return or the Form 8939, and must be sent to the same address that a timely return or Form 8939 on which the allocation or election should have been made would have been sent, subject to address changes in future forms or instructions or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. *See* § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter. No request for a private letter ruling is required and, as a result, no user fee is required to be paid.


(2) *Private letter ruling program.* Except for the automatic 6-month extension provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the relief described in this section is provided through the IRS's private letter ruling program. Requests for relief may be submitted in accordance with the applicable procedures for requests for a private letter ruling.


(3) *Affidavit and declaration of transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate.* (i) The transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led to the failure to timely allocate GST exemption to a transfer or the failure to timely elect under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), and the events that led to the discovery of the failure. In situations described in paragraph (i)(4)(vi) of this section, this affidavit also must include the additional information and statements described in that paragraph. If the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate relied on a tax professional for advice with respect to the allocation or election, the affidavit also must describe—


(A) The scope of the engagement;


(B) The responsibilities the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate believed the professional had assumed; and


(C) The extent to which the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate relied on the professional.


(ii) Attached to each affidavit must be copies of any writings (including, without limitation, notes and emails) and other contemporaneous documents within the possession or control of the affiant relevant to the determination of the transferor's intent with regard to the application of GST tax to the transaction for which relief under this section is requested.


(iii) The affidavit must be accompanied by a dated declaration, signed by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate, that states:


Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this affidavit, including any attachments thereto, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, this affidavit, including any attachments thereto, is true, correct, and complete. In addition, under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined all the documents included as part of this request for relief, and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, these documents collectively contain all the relevant facts relating to the request for relief and such facts are true, correct, and complete.


(4) *Affidavits and declarations from other parties.* (i) The transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate must submit detailed affidavits from the individuals specified in paragraphs (i)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section and other individuals who have knowledge or information about the events that led to the failure to allocate GST exemption or to elect under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or to the discovery of the failure. These individuals may include individuals whose knowledge or information is not within the personal knowledge of the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate. The individuals described in this paragraph must include—


(A) Each agent or legal representative of the transferor who participated in the consideration of, or the decision with regard to, the allocation of GST exemption or the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or the preparation of the return for which relief is being requested;


(B) The preparer of the relevant Federal estate or gift tax return or returns;


(C) Each individual (including an employee of the transferor or of the executor of the transferor's estate) who provided information or advice with regard to, or otherwise made a significant contribution to, the decision concerning the allocation of GST exemption, the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or the preparation of the relevant Federal estate and/or gift tax return or returns; and


(D) Each tax professional who advised or was consulted by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate with regard to the allocation of GST exemption, the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or the preparation of the relevant Federal estate or gift tax return or returns.


(ii) Each affidavit must describe the scope of the engagement and the responsibilities of the individual as well as the advice or service the individual provided to the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate.


(iii) Attached to each affidavit must be a copy of each writing (including, without limitation, notes and emails) and other contemporaneous documents within the possession of the affiant relevant to the transferor's intent or the affiant's advice with regard to the application of GST tax to the transaction for which relief under this section is requested. The documents that the affiant discovers by conducting in good faith a reasonably diligent search of records in the possession of or accessible to the affiant, or subject to the affiant's control, will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (i)(4)(iii). A reasonably diligent search generally would include, without limitation, a review of the records in the possession or control of the affiant or the firm at which the affiant is employed or associated relating to the transaction or tax return at issue.


(iv) The IRS may require additional affidavits from persons not set forth in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section as well as additional documents when additional information or documents with respect to a transfer is believed by the IRS to be required or helpful in making its determination as to whether relief under this section should be granted.


(v) Each affidavit also must include the name and current address of the affiant, and must be accompanied by a dated declaration signed by the affiant that states:


Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have personal knowledge of the information set forth in this affidavit, including any attachments thereto. In addition, under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this affidavit, including any attachments thereto, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the affidavit contains all the relevant facts and the attachments include copies of all relevant writings or other documents resulting from a reasonably diligent search, conducted in good faith, of all records within my possession, accessible to me, or subject to my control, relating to the allocation of GST exemption, the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), and the preparation of the tax return at issue in the request for relief filed by or on behalf of [*transferor or executor of transferor's estate*], and such facts and attached documents are true, correct, and complete.


(vi) If an individual who would be required to provide an affidavit under paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section has died or is unwilling or otherwise unable to provide the required affidavit, the affidavit required under paragraph (i)(3) of this section must include a statement to that effect, as well as a statement describing the relationship between that individual and the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate; the information or knowledge the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate believes that individual had about the events that led to the failure to make the allocation or the election or to the discovery of that failure; and, in cases other than the death of the individual, a detailed description of the efforts made to obtain the affidavit from the individual. The unwillingness of certain affiants to provide an affidavit, however, may be considered by the IRS in determining whether to grant the requested relief. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4)(vi), the term *unwilling* refers to a person who is apparently able but refuses or otherwise fails, despite the best efforts, made in good faith, of the transferor or the transferor's executor, to provide the required affidavit. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph, the term *unable* refers to a permanent or potentially long-term condition such as physical or mental incapacity that prevents the person from providing the required affidavit, but not a temporary condition such as a temporary physical or mental incapacity or a person's inability due to a leave of absence, travel, or a contractual requirement such as a confidentiality agreement.


(5) *Additional rules regarding relief.* For purposes of relief under paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section, the grant of relief in the form of an extension of time is not a determination that the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make the election. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, an extension of time will not be granted under this section if alternative relief is provided by a statute, a regulation published in the _Federal Register,_ or a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).


(j) *Applicability date.* This section applies to requests for relief to which section 2642(g)(1) applies that are filed on or after May 6, 2024, regardless of the date of the transfer.
