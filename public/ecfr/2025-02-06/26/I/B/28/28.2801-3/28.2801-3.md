# § 28.2801-3   Rules and exceptions applicable to covered gifts and covered bequests.

(a) *Covered gift.* Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the term *gift* as used in the definition of *covered gift* in § 28.2801-2(g) has the same meaning as in chapter 12 of subtitle B, but without regard to the exceptions in section 2501(a)(2), (4), and (5) of the Code, the per-donee exclusion under section 2503(b) of the Code for certain transfers of a present interest, the exclusion under section 2503(e) for certain educational or medical expenses, and the waiver of certain pension rights under section 2503(f).


(b) *Covered bequest.* Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, property acquired *by reason of the death of a covered expatriate* (one of the types of transfers defined as a covered bequest in § 28.2801-2(f)) includes any property that would have been includible in the gross estate of the covered expatriate under chapter 11 of subtitle B if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of death. Therefore, property acquired by reason of a covered expatriate's death includes, without limitation, property or an interest in property acquired by reason of a covered expatriate's death—


(1) By bequest, devise, trust provision, beneficiary designation, or other contractual arrangement, or by operation of law, to the extent the property would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death;


(2) That was transferred by the covered expatriate during life, either before or after expatriation, and that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2036, 2037, or 2038 of the Code had the covered expatriate been a U.S. citizen at death;


(3) That was received for the benefit of a covered expatriate from such covered expatriate's spouse, or predeceased spouse, for which a valid qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) election was made on such spouse's, or predeceased spouse's, Form 709, *United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,* Form 709-NA, *United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return of Nonresident Not a Citizen of the United States,* Form 706, *United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,* or Form 706-NA, *United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, Estate of nonresident not a citizen of the United States,* which would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2044 of the Code if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death; or


(4) That otherwise passed from the covered expatriate by reason of his or her death, such as—


(i) Property held by the covered expatriate and another person as joint tenants with right of survivorship or as tenants by the entirety, but only to the extent such property would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2040 of the Code if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death;


(ii) Any annuity or other payment that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death;


(iii) Property subject to a general power of appointment held by the covered expatriate at death that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2041 if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death; or


(iv) Life insurance proceeds payable upon the covered expatriate's death that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2042 of the Code if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death.


(c) *Exceptions to covered gift and covered bequest.* Notwithstanding the definitions of *covered gift* and *covered bequest* in § 28.2801-2(f) and (g), respectively, as further described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the terms *covered gift* and *covered bequest* do not include property described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.


(1) *Reported taxable gifts.* Property transferred as a taxable gift under section 2503(a) that is reported on the donor's timely filed Form 709 or Form 709-NA is not a covered gift. However, property excluded from the definition of a taxable gift, such as a present interest not in excess of the annual exclusion amount under section 2503(b), is not excluded from the definition of a covered gift under this paragraph (c)(1) even if reported on the donor's Form 709 or Form 709-NA.


(2) *Property reported as subject to estate tax.* Property that is includible in the gross estate of the covered expatriate and is reported on a timely filed Form 706, Form 706-NA, or Form 706-QDT, *U.S. Estate Tax Return for Qualified Domestic Trusts,* or any successor form, is not a covered bequest. Thus, if the covered expatriate's gross estate is not of sufficient value to require the filing of a Form 706-NA, for example, and no Form 706-NA is timely filed, the property passing from that covered expatriate is not excluded from the definition of a covered bequest under the rule of this paragraph (c)(2). Further, this exclusion does not apply to the property not reported on such a form, whether or not subject to United States estate tax (that is, non-U.S. situs property that passes to U.S. citizens or residents).


(3) *Covered bequest previously subject to section 2801 tax as a covered gift.* If a covered bequest from a covered expatriate previously constituted a covered gift from that covered expatriate (for example, because of a retained power or right described in section 2036), the property is a covered bequest only to the extent that the value of the covered bequest exceeds the value of the covered gift that was subject to section 2801.


(4) *Transfers to charity.* A gift to a donee described in section 2522(b) of the Code or a bequest to a beneficiary described in section 2055(a) of the Code is not a covered gift or covered bequest to the extent a charitable deduction under section 2522 or 2055 would have been allowed if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the transfer.


(5) *Transfers to spouse.* Property transferred from a covered expatriate to the covered expatriate's spouse generally is not a covered gift or covered bequest to the extent a marital deduction under section 2523 or 2056 of the Code would have been allowed if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the transfer. To the extent that a gift or bequest of property to a trust (or to a separate share of the trust) would qualify for the marital deduction, the property transferred in the gift or bequest is not a covered gift or covered bequest. To the extent the gift or bequest of property to the trust (or to a separate share of the trust) would not qualify for the marital deduction, the property transferred in the gift or bequest is a covered gift or covered bequest to the trust, and in the case of a non-electing foreign trust, distributions attributable to such gift or bequest will subject the U.S. citizen or resident spouse receiving such distributions to the section 2801 tax. *See* §§ 28.2801-4(a)(3) and 28.2801-5(a). For qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) described in section 2056(b)(7) and for property in a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) described in section 2056A of the Code, a valid QTIP and/or QDOT election must be made by the covered expatriate or covered expatriate's estate in order for the gift or bequest of such property to qualify for the marital exclusion under section 2801(e)(3), and, thus not be a covered gift or covered bequest under this paragraph (c)(5). Such an election can be made only with respect to the transfer of property subject to gift or estate tax under section 2511(a) or 2103 of the Code. Furthermore, to exclude from covered bequests property in a QDOT for the benefit of a covered expatriate, funded pursuant to a bequest by the covered expatriate's predeceased spouse who also was a covered expatriate, a valid QDOT election must have been made in the predeceased covered expatriate's estate.


(6) *Qualified disclaimers.* Property transferred pursuant to a covered expatriate's qualified disclaimer, as defined in section 2518(b) of the Code, is not a covered gift or covered bequest from that covered expatriate.


(d) *Covered gifts and covered bequests made in trust.* For transfers of property to a trust that are covered gifts or covered bequests as described in §§ 28.2801-2 and 28.2801-3, the property is treated as a covered gift or covered bequest to the trust without regard to the beneficial interests in the trust or whether any person has a general power of appointment or a power of withdrawal over trust property. Accordingly, the rules in section 2801(e)(4) and § 28.2801-4(a) apply to determine liability for payment of the section 2801 tax. The U.S. recipient of a covered gift or a covered bequest made to a domestic trust or to an electing foreign trust is the domestic or electing foreign trust, and the U.S. recipient of a covered gift or a covered bequest made to a non-electing foreign trust is each U.S. citizen or resident receiving a distribution from the non-electing foreign trust (without regard to whether that distribution is or is not pursuant to the exercise or release of a general power of appointment). *See* § 28.2801-2(e) for the definition of a U.S. recipient.


(e) *Powers of appointment*—(1) *Covered expatriate as holder of power.* The exercise or release of a general power of appointment held by a covered expatriate over property, whether or not in trust (even if that covered expatriate was a U.S. citizen or resident when the general power of appointment was granted), for the benefit of a U.S. citizen or resident is a covered gift or covered bequest. For this purpose, the lapse of a general power of appointment held by a covered expatriate is treated as a release to the extent provided in sections 2041(b)(2) and 2514(e) of the Code. Furthermore, the exercise of a power of appointment by a covered expatriate that creates another power of appointment as described in section 2041(a)(3) or 2514(d) for the benefit of a U.S. citizen or resident is a covered gift or a covered bequest.


(2) *Covered expatriate as grantor of power.* The grant by a covered expatriate to an individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident of a general power of appointment over property not held in trust is a covered gift or covered bequest to the powerholder. For the rule applying to the grant by a covered expatriate of a general power of appointment over property in trust, see paragraph (d) of this section.


(f) *Examples.* The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:


(1) *Example 1: Transfer to spouse.* In Year 1, CE, a covered expatriate domiciled in Country F, a foreign country with which the United States does not have a gift tax treaty, gives $300,000 cash to his wife, W, a U.S. resident and citizen of Country F. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the $100,000 exclusion for a noncitizen spouse, as indexed for inflation in Year 1, is excluded from the definition of a covered gift under section 2801 because only that amount of the transfer would have qualified for the gift tax marital deduction if CE had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the gift. *See* sections 2801(e)(3), 2523(i), and 2503(b). The remaining amount ($300,000, less the $100,000 exclusion for a noncitizen spouse, as indexed for inflation) is a covered gift from CE to W. W must timely file Form 708, *United States Return of Tax for Gifts and Bequests Received from Covered Expatriates,* and timely pay the tax. See §§ 28.6011-1(a), 28.6071-1(a), and 28.6151-1(a). W also must report the transfer on Form 3520, *Annual Return to Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts,* and any other required form. *See* § 28.2801-6(c)(1).


(2) *Example 2: Reporting property as subject to estate tax*—(i) *Year 1.* CE, a covered expatriate domiciled in Country F, a foreign country with which the United States does not have an estate tax treaty, owns a condominium in the United States with son, S, a U.S. citizen. CE and S each contributed their actuarial share of the purchase price when purchasing the condominium and own it as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. On December 14, Year 1, CE dies. At the time of CE's death, the fair market value of CE's share of the condominium, $250,000, is included in CE's gross estate under sections 2040 and 2103.


(ii) *Year 2.* On September 14 of the following calendar year, Year 2, the executor of CE's estate timely files a Form 4768, *Application for Extension of Time to File a Return and/or Pay U.S. Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Taxes,* requesting a 6-month extension of time to file Form 706-NA, and a 1-year extension of time to pay the estate tax. The Internal Revenue Service grants both extensions, but CE's executor fails to file the Form 706-NA until after March 14 of Year 3.


(iii) *Analysis.* S learns that the executor of CE's estate did not timely file Form 706-NA. CE's estate remains liable for estate tax on CE's interest in the condominium. In addition, because CE is a covered expatriate and CE's estate failed to timely file the tax return reporting the transaction, S received a covered bequest as defined in § 28.2801-2(f) and paragraph (b) of this section and must timely file Form 708 and pay the section 2801 tax. See §§ 28.6011-1(a), 28.6071-1(a), and 28.6151-1(a). S also must file Form 3520 to report a large gift or bequest from a foreign person and any other required form. *See* § 28.2801-6(c)(1).


(3) *Example 3: Covered gift in trust with grant of general power of appointment over trust property*—(i) *Facts.* On October 20, Year 1, CE, a covered expatriate domiciled in Country F, a foreign country with which the United States does not have a gift tax treaty, transfers $500,000 in cash from an account in Country F to an irrevocable foreign trust created on that same date. The foreign trust does not elect to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801. Under section 2511(a), no gift tax is imposed on the transfer and thus, CE is not required to file a U.S. gift tax return. Under the terms of the foreign trust, A, CE's child and a U.S. resident, and Q, A's child and a U.S. citizen, may receive discretionary distributions of income and principal during life. At A's death, the assets remaining in the foreign trust will be distributed to B, CE's other U.S. resident child, or if B is not living at the time of A's death, then to CE's then-living issue, per stirpes. The terms of the foreign trust also allow A to appoint trust principal and/or income to A, A's estate, A's creditors, the creditors of A's estate, or A's issue at any time. On March 5, Year 2, A exercises this power to appoint and causes the trustee to distribute $100,000 to Q.


(ii) *Effects on Q.* On October 20, Year 1, the irrevocable, non-electing foreign trust receives a covered gift for purposes of section 2801, but no section 2801 tax is imposed at that time. On March 5, Year 2, when Q receives $100,000 from the irrevocable foreign trust pursuant to the exercise of A's power of appointment, Q receives a distribution attributable to a covered gift and section 2801 tax is imposed on Q. *See* § 28.2801-4(d)(5). Q must timely file Form 708 to report the covered gift from a foreign person (specifically, from CE). *See* section 6039F(a) and §§ 28.6011-1(a), 28.6071-1(a), and 28.6151-1(a). Furthermore, because the $100,000 is being distributed from a foreign trust, Q must report the gift on a Form 3520 as a distribution from a foreign trust. *See* § 28.2801-6(c)(2).


(iii) *Effects on A.* Although A has no section 2801 reporting requirement, under section 2501, A makes a taxable gift to Q of $100,000 when A exercises the general power of appointment for Q's benefit. *See* section 2514(b). Accordingly, A must report A's $100,000 gift to Q on a timely filed Form 709. *See* section 6019. Because A is considered the transferor of the $100,000 for gift and GST tax purposes, the distribution to Q is not a generation-skipping transfer under chapter 13. *See* § 26.2652-1(a)(1) of this chapter.


(4) *Example 4: Lapse of power of appointment held by covered expatriate.* A, a U.S. citizen, creates an irrevocable domestic trust for the benefit of A's issue, CE, and CE's children. CE is a covered expatriate, but CE's children are U.S. citizens. CE has the right to withdraw $5,000 in each year in which A makes a contribution to the trust, but the withdrawal right lapses 30 days after the date of the contribution. In Year 1, A funds the trust, but CE fails to exercise CE's right to withdraw $5,000 within 30 days of the contribution. The $5,000 lapse is not considered to be a release of the power by CE, so it is neither a gift for U.S. gift tax purposes, nor a covered gift for purposes of section 2801 under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(5) *Example 5: Property subject to section 2801 tax as a covered gift and as a covered bequest.* F, a CE, transfers an income interest in property to A, a U.S. citizen, while retaining the remainder interest. F was not required to, and did not, file a gift tax return. Upon F's death, A receives full title to the property. The initial transfer of the income interest was a covered gift valued at $1,000,000, upon which A paid the section 2801 tax. The value of the property at F's death is $4,500,000. Because the full value of the property would have been included in F's gross estate if F had died as a U.S. citizen, there is a covered bequest at F's death. The covered bequest is subject to section 2801 tax on the excess of the value of the covered bequest over the value of the covered gift ($4,500,000 minus $1,000,000), or $3,500,000.


(g) *Applicability date.* This section applies to covered gifts or covered bequests received on or after January 1, 2025.
