# ยง 31.3121(b)(10)-1   Services for remuneration of less than $50 for calendar quarter in the employ of certain organizations exempt from income tax.

(a) Services performed by an employee in a calendar quarter in the employ of an organization exempt from income tax under section 501(a) (other than an organization described in section 401(a)) or under section 521 are excepted from employment if the remuneration for the services is less than $50. The test relating to remuneration of $50 is based on the remuneration earned during a calendar quarter rather than on the remuneration paid in a calendar quarter. The exception applies separately with respect to each organization for which the employee renders services in a calendar quarter. The type of services performed by the employee and the place where the services are performed are immaterial; the statutory tests are the character of the organization in the employ of which the services are performed and the amount of the remuneration for services performed by the employee in the calendar quarter. For provisions relating to exemption from income tax under section 501(a) or 521, see Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).


(b) See ยง 31.3121(b)(8)-1, relating to services performed by a minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order; ยง 31.3121(b)(10)-2, relating to services performed by certain students in the employ of a school, college, or university or of a nonprofit organization auxiliary to a school, college, or university; and ยง 31.3121(b)(13)-1, relating to services performed by certain student nurses and hospital interns.
