# § 31.3121(b)(6)-1   Services in employ of United States or instrumentality thereof.

(a) *In general.* This section relates to services performed in the employ of the United States Government or in the employ of an instrumentality of the United States. Particular services which are not excepted from employment under one rule set forth in this section may nevertheless be excepted under another rule set forth in this section or under § 31.3121(b)(5)-1, relating to services in the employ of an instrumentality of the United States specifically exempted from the employer tax. Moreover, services performed in the employ of the United States or of any instrumentality thereof which are not excepted from employment under paragraph (5) or (6) of section 3121(b) may nevertheless be excepted under some other paragraph of such section. For provisions relating generally to the application of the taxes in the case of services performed in the employ of the United States or a wholly owned instrumentality thereof, see 3122. For provisions relating to the computation of remuneration for service performed by an individual as a member of a uniformed service or for service performed by an individual as a volunteer or volunteer leader within the meaning of the Peace Corps Act, see § 31.3121(i)-2 and § 31.3121(i)-3, respectively.


(b) *Services covered under a retirement system established by a law of the United States.* Services performed in the employ of the United States or in the employ of any instrumentality thereof are excepted from employment under section 3121(b)(6)(A) if such services are covered under a law enacted by the Congress of the United States which specifically provides for the establishment of a retirement system for employees of the United States or of such instrumentality. Determinations as to whether services are covered by a retirement system of the requisite character are to be made as of the time such services are performed. Services of an employee who has an option to have his services covered under a retirement system are not covered under such retirement system unless and until he exercises such option. The test is whether particular services performed by an employee are covered by a retirement system of the requisite character rather than whether the position in which such services are performed is covered by such retirement system.


(c) *Services performed for an instrumentality not subject to employer tax on December 31, 1950, and covered under a retirement system established by such instrumentality.* (1) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, services performed in the employ of an instrumentality of the United States are excepted from employment under section 3121(b)(6)(B) if—


(i) The particular instrumentality was not subject on December 31, 1950, to the employer tax imposed by section 1410 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and


(ii) The services are covered by a retirement system established by such instrumentality.


(2) If the particular instrumentality was not in existence on December 31, 1950, but is created thereafter under a law which was in effect on December 31, 1950, services performed in the employ of such instrumentality are excepted from employment (unless otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) if—


(i) The instrumentality had it been in existence on December 31, 1950, would not have been subject on that date to the employer tax imposed by section 1410 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and


(ii) The services are covered by a retirement system established by such instrumentality.


(3) Determinations as to whether services performed in the employ of an instrumentality referred to in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section are covered by a retirement system established by such instrumentality are to be made as of the time such services are performed. Services of an employee who has an option to have his services covered under a retirement system established by the instrumentality are not covered under such retirement system unless and until he exercises such option. The test is whether particular services performed by an employee are covered by a retirement system established by the instrumentality rather than whether the position in which such services are performed is covered by such retirement system.


(4) The exception from employment provided in section 3121(b)(6)(B) has no application with respect to any of the following classes of services:


(i) Services performed in the employ of a corporation which is wholly owned by the United States;


(ii) Services performed in the employ of a production credit association, a Federal Reserve Bank, or a Federal Credit Union; services performed before December 31, 1959, in the employ of a national farm loan association; services performed after December 30, 1959, in the employ of a Federal land bank association; services performed after December 31, 1959, in the employ of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives; services performed after December 31, 1972, in the employ of a Federal home loan bank; and services performed after December 31, 1966, and before January 1, 1973, in the employ of a Federal home loan bank, in the case of individuals who are in such employ on the latter date, provided that an amount equal to the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111 with respect to all such services performed by all such individuals are paid under the provisions of section 3122 by July 1, 1973;


(iii) Services performed in the employ of a State, county, or community committee under the Commodity Stabilization Service;


(iv) Services performed by a civilian employee, not compensated from funds appropriated by the Congress, in the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Army and Air Force Motion Picture Service, Navy Exchanges, Marine Corps Exchanges, or other activities, conducted by an instrumentality of the United States subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, at installations of the Department of Defense for the comfort, pleasure, contentment, and mental and physical improvement of personnel of such Department; or


(v) Services performed by a civilian employee, not compensated from funds appropriated by the Congress, in the Coast Guard Exchanges or other activities, conducted by an instrumentality of the United States subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury, at installations of the Coast Guard for the comfort, pleasure, contentment, and mental and physical improvement of personnel of the Coast Guard.


(d) *Special classes of services.* The following classes of services performed either in the employ of the United States or in the employ of any instrumentality thereof are excepted from employment under section 3121(b)(6)(C):


(1) Services performed as the President or Vice President of the United States or a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, of or to the Congress of the United States;


(2) Services performed in the legislative branch of the United States Government;

(ii) The provisions of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section have no application to services performed after 1965 by medical or dental interns or by medical or dental residents in training.


(5) Services performed by an individual as an employee serving on a temporary basis in case of fire, storm, earthquake, flood, or other similar emergency; and


(6) (i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section, services performed by an individual to whom subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code (civil service retirement) does not apply because he is, with respect to such services, subject to another retirement system, established either by a law of the United States or by the agency or instrumentality of the United States for which such services are performed.


(ii) The provisions of paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section have no application to service performed by an individual to whom subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code (civil service retirement) does not apply because such individual is subject to the retirement system of the Tennessee Valley Authority, if such service is subject to the plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on December 28, 1956, pursuant to section 104 (i)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1956 (70 Stat. 827). See section 201(m)(4) of such amendments for provisions relating to the timeliness of payment of tax with respect to remuneration paid before 1957 for such services, and barring the imposition of interest on the amount of any such tax due for any period before December 28, 1956.
