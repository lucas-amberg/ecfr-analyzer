# ยง 31.3121(i)-1   Computation to nearest dollar of cash remuneration for domestic service.

(a) An employer may, for purposes of the act, elect to compute to the nearest dollar any payment of cash remuneration for domestic service described in section 3121(a)(7)(B) (see ยง 31.3121(a)(7)-1) which is more or less than a whole-dollar amount. For the purpose of the computation to the nearest dollar, the payment of a fractional part of a dollar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half dollar or more, in which case it shall be increased to one dollar. For example, any amount actually paid between $4.50 and $5.49, inclusive, may be treated as $5 for purposes of the taxes imposed by the act. If an employer elects this method of computation with respect to any payment of cash remuneration made in a calendar year for domestic service in his private home, he must use the same method in computing each payment of cash remuneration of more or less than a whole-dollar amount made to each of his employees in such calendar year for domestic service in his private home. Moreover, if an employer elects this method of computation with respect to payments of the prescribed character made in any calendar year, the amount of each payment of cash remuneration so computed to the nearest dollar shall, in lieu of the amount actually paid, be deemed to constitute the amount of cash remuneration for purposes of the act. Thus, the amount of cash payments so computed to the nearest dollar shall be used for purposes of determining whether such payments constitute wages; for purposes of applying the employee and employer tax rates to the wage payments; for purposes of any required record keeping; and for purposes of reporting and paying the employee tax and employer tax with respect to such wage payments.


(b) The provisions of this section apply to any cash payment for domestic service in a private home of the employer made on or after January 1, 1994. For rules applicable to any cash payment for domestic service in a private home of the employer made prior to January 1, 1994, *see* ยง 31.3121(i)-1 in effect at such time (*see* 26 CFR part 31 contained in the edition of 26 CFR parts 30 to 39, revised as of April 1, 2006).
