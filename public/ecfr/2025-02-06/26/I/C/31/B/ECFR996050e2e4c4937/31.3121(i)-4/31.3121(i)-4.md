# § 31.3121(i)-4   Computation of remuneration for service performed by certain members of religious orders.

In any case where an individual is a member of a religious order (as defined in section 3121(r)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 31.3121(r)-1) performing service in the exercise of duties required by such order, and an election of coverage under section 3121(r) and § 31.3121(r)-1 is in effect with respect to such order or the autonomous subdivision thereof to which such member belongs, the term “wages” shall, subject to the provisions of section 3121(a)(1) (relating to definition of wages), include as such individual's remuneration for such service the fair market value of any board, lodging, clothing, and other perquisites furnished to such member by such order or subdivision or by any other person or organization pursuant to an agreement (whether written or oral) with such order or subdivision. Such other perquisites shall include any cash either paid by such order or subdivision or paid by another employer and not required by such order or subdivision to be remitted to it. For purposes of this section, perquisites shall be considered to be furnished over the period during which the member receives the benefit of them. (See example 4 of this section.) In no case shall the amount included as such individual's remuneration under this paragraph be less than $100 a month. All relevant facts and elements of value shall be considered in every case. Where the fair market value of any board, lodging, clothing, and other perquisites furnished to all members of an electing religious order or autonomous subdivision (or to all in a group of members) does not vary significantly, such order or subdivision may treat all of its members (or all in such group of members) as having a uniform wage. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples of the treatment of particular perquisites:
