# § 31.3211-2   Rates and computation of employee representative tax.

(a) *Rates*—(1)(i) *Tier 1 tax.* The Tier 1 employee representative tax rate equals the sum of the tax rates in effect under sections 3101(a) and 3111(a), relating to the employee and the employer tax for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance, and sections 3101(b) and 3111(b), relating to the employee and the employer tax for hospital insurance. The Tier 1 employee representative tax rate is applied to compensation up to the contribution base described in section 3231(e)(2)(B)(i). The contribution base is determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act, and is identical to the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance wage base and the hospital insurance wage base, respectively, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.


(ii) *Example.* The rule in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is illustrated by the following example.


(2) (i) *Tier 2 tax.* The Tier 2 employee representative tax rate equals the percentage set forth in section 3211(a)(2) of the Code. This rate is applied up to the contribution base described in section 3231(e)(2)(B)(ii).


(ii) *Example.* The rule in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is illustrated by the following example.


(3) *Supplemental Annuity Tax.* The supplemental annuity tax for each work-hour for which compensation is paid to an employee representative for services rendered as an employee representative is imposed at the same rate as the excise tax imposed on every employer under section 3221(c). See also § 31.3211-3.


(b) (1) *Computation.* The employee representative tax is computed by multiplying the amount of the employee representative's compensation with respect to which the employee representative tax is imposed by the rate applicable to such compensation, as determined under paragraph (a) of this section. The applicable rate is the rate in effect when the compensation is received by the employee representative. For rules relating to the time of receipt, see § 31.3121(a)-2 (a) and (b).


(2) *Example.* The rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is illustrated by the following example.


(c) (1) *Rule where compensation is received both as an employee representative and employee.* The following rule applies to an individual who renders service both as an employee representative and as an employee. The employee representative tax is imposed on compensation received as an employee representative under the rules described in § 31.3211-2. The employee tax is imposed on compensation received as an employee under the rules described in § 31.3201-2. However, if the total compensation received is greater than the applicable contribution base, the employee representative tax is imposed on the amount equal to the contribution base less the amount received for services rendered as an employee.


(2) *Example.* The rule in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is illustrated by the following example.
