# § 31.3302(c)-1   Limit on total credits.

(a) *In general.* Paragraph (b) of this section relates to the limitation on the aggregate of the credits allowable under section 3302 (a) and (b). Paragraph (c) of this section relates to reductions, under certain circumstances, of the total credits allowable after applying section 3302 (a), (b), and (c)(1). In paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, relate, respectively, to reductions of credits in respect of advances under title XII of the Social Security Act before September 13, 1960, advances under title XII of the Social Security Act after September 12, 1960, and payments under the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 1958. A reduction of credit under paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section applies separately from, and in addition to, a reduction under any other such subparagraph. See section 3302(d) and § 31.3302(d)-1 for definitions and special rules relating to section 3302(c), and for a provision that, in applying section 3302(c), the Federal tax shall be computed at the rate of 3 percent.


(b) *Limitation on aggregate credit.* The aggregate of the credit under section 3302(a) and the additional credit under section 3302(b) shall not exceed 90 percent of the tax against which credit is taken, computed as if the tax were imposed at the rate of 3 percent. Thus, the aggregate of the credit which is allowable to an employer for any taxable year shall not exceed 2.7 percent of the wages paid by the employer during the year.


(c) *Reductions of amount of credit otherwise allowable*—(1) *Advances before September 13, 1960, under title XII of Social Security Act*—(i) *Credit reductions for 1961 and 1962.* Pursuant to section 3302(c)(2), as applicable to credit allowable for any year ended before 1963, the total credits otherwise allowable under section 3302 to a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of the State of—


(*a*) Alaska shall be reduced for the taxable year 1961 by an amount equal to 0.15 percent of the wages paid by the taxpayer during 1961 which are attributable to Alaska, and shall be reduced for the taxable year 1962 by an amount equal to 0.3 percent of the wages paid by the taxpayer during 1962 which are attributable to Alaska; or


(*b*) Michigan shall be reduced for the taxable year 1962 by an amount equal to 0.15 percent of the wages paid by the taxpayer during 1962 which are attributable to Michigan.


(ii) *Credit reductions for 1963 and subsequent years.* If any balance of an advance or advances under title XII of the Social Security Act, made before September 13, 1960, to the unemployment account of a State, remains unpaid on January 1, 1963, or on January 1 of any succeeding taxable year, the total credits otherwise allowable under section 3302 to a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of the State shall be reduced for the taxable year unless—


(*a*) No balance of such advance or advances exists as of the beginning of November 10 of the taxable year, or


(*b*) The State pays into the Federal unemployment account, before November 10 of the taxable year, the amount certified by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to section 3302(c)(2), and designates such payment as being made for purposes of the last sentence of section 3302(c)(2).


(2) *Advances after September 12, 1960, under title XII of Social Security Act*—(i) *In general.* If any balance of an advance or advances under title XII of the Social Security Act, made after September 12, 1960, to the unemployment account of a State, remains unpaid on January 1 of two consecutive taxable years, the total credits otherwise allowable under section 3302 to a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of the State shall be reduced for the taxable year beginning with the second consecutive January 1, unless prior to November 10 of that taxable year the total amount of any such advance or advances made to the account of the State has been fully repaid. The reduction made pursuant to this subdivision in the total credits otherwise allowable for the taxable year beginning with the second consecutive January 1 shall be 0.3 percent of the wages paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year which are attributable to the State (that is, 10 percent of the Federal tax, computed as if imposed at the rate of 3 percent of the wages). In the case of any succeeding taxable year beginning with a consecutive January 1 on which there exists such a balance of an unreturned advance or advances made after September 12, 1960, the total credits otherwise allowable shall be further reduced unless prior to November 10 of that succeeding taxable year the total amount of any such advance or advances made to the account of the State has been fully repaid. The reduction for each such succeeding taxable year beginning with a consecutive January 1 on which such a balance exists shall be a percentage of the wages paid by the taxpayer during that succeeding taxable year which are attributable to the State. The percentage reduction for any such succeeding taxable year shall be the aggregate of (*a*) the percentage reduction (without regard to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section) for the immediately preceding taxable year, (*b*) 0.3 percent of the wages paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year which are attributable to the State, and (*c*) the percentage, if any, described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section.


(ii) *Additional reduction if a balance of advances exists after third or fourth consecutive January 1.* If the credit reduction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is made for the third or fourth consecutive taxable year, the total credits otherwise allowable under section 3302 to a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of the State shall be further reduced for the taxable year unless the average employer contribution rate (see section 3302(d)(4)) for such State for the calendar year preceding such taxable year is at least 2.7 percent. The percentage of reduction, if any, under this subdivision shall be the percentage referred to in section 3302(c)(3)(B) which is certified by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to section 3302(d)(7).


(iii) *Additional reduction if a balance of advances exists after fifth or any succeeding consecutive January 1.* If the credit reduction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is made for the fifth or any succeeding taxable year, the total credits otherwise allowable under section 3302 to a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of the State shall be further reduced for the taxable year unless the average employer contribution rate (see section 3302(d)(4)) for the State for the calendar year preceding such taxable year equals or exceeds the 5-year benefit cost rate (see section 3302(d)(5)) applicable to the State for the taxable year or 2.7 percent, whichever is higher. The percentage of reduction, if any, under this subdivision for a taxable year shall be the percentage referred to in section 3302(c)(3)(C) which is certified by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to section 3302(d)(7).


(3) *Payments under the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 1958.* If any amount of temporary unemployment compensation was paid in a State under the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 1958, the total credits otherwise allowable under section 3302 to a taxpayer with respect to wages attributable to the State for the taxable year beginning January 1, 1963, and for each taxable year thereafter, shall be reduced unless prior to November 10 of the taxable year— 


(i) There have been restored to the Treasury the amounts of temporary unemployment compensation paid in the State (except amounts paid to individuals who exhausted their unemployment compensation under title XV of the Social Security Act and title IV of the Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952 prior to their making their first claims under the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 1958), the amount of costs incurred in the administration of the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 1958); with respect to the State, and the amount estimated by the Secretary of Labor as the State's proportionate share of other costs incurred in the administration of such Act, or


(ii) The State restores to the general fund of the Treasury the amount certified by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to section 104 of the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 1958, and designates such restoration as being made for purposes of the last sentence of such section.


(4) *Example.* The cumulative effect of the credit reductions described in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:
