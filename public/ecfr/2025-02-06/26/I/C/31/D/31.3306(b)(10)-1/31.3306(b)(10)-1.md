(a) *In general.* The term “wages” does not include the amount of any payment or series of payments made after January 2, 1968, by an employer to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents under a plan established by the employer which makes provisions for his employees generally (or for his employees generally and their dependents) or for a class or classes of his employees (or for a class or classes of his employees and their dependents), which is paid or commences to be paid upon or within a reasonable time after the termination of an employee's employment relationship because of the employee's—


(1) Death,


(2) Retirement for disability, or


(3) Retirement after attaining an age specified in the plan established by the employer or in a pension plan of the employer as the age at which a person in the employee's circumstances is eligible for retirement.


(b) *Plan.* The plan or system established by an employer need not provide for payments because of termination of employment for all the reasons set out in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, but such plan or system may provide for payments because of termination for any one or more of such reasons. Payments because of termination of employment for any one or more of such reasons under a plan or system established by an employer solely for the dependents of his employees are not within this exclusion from wages.


(c) *Dependents.* Dependents of an employee include the employee's husband or wife, children, and any other members of the employee's immediate family.


(d) *Benefit payments.* It is immaterial for purposes of this exclusion whether the amount or possibility of such benefit payments is paid on account of services rendered or taken into consideration in fixing the amount of an employee's remuneration or whether such payments are required expressly or impliedly, by the contract of service.


(e) *Example.* The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:
