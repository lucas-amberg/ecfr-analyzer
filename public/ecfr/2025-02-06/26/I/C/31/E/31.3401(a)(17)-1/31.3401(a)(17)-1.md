# § 31.3401(a)(17)-1   Remuneration for services performed on a boat engaged in catching fish.

(a) Remuneration for services performed on or after December 31, 1954, by an individual on a boat engaged in catching fish or other forms of aquatic animal life (hereinafter “fish”) is excepted from wages and hence is not subject to withholding if—


(1) The individual receives a share of the boat's (or boats' for a fishing operation involved more than one boat) catch of fish or a share of the proceeds from the sale of the catch,


(2) The amount of the individual's share depends solely on the amount of the boat's (or boats' for a fishing operation involving more than one boat) catch of fish,


(3) The individual does not receive, and is not entitled to receive, any cash remuneration, other than remuneration that is described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and


(4) The crew of the boat (or of each boat from which the individual receives a share of the catch) normally is made up of fewer than 10 individuals.


(b) The requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not satisfied if there exists an agreement with the boat's (or boats') owner or operator by which the individual's remuneration is determined partially or fully by a factor not dependent on the size of the catch. For example, if a boat is operated under a remuneration arrangement, *e.g.,* a union contract, which specifies that crew members, in addition to receiving a share of the catch, are entitled to an hourly wage for repairing nets, regardless of whether this wage is actually paid, then all the crew members covered by the arrangement are entitled to receive cash remuneration other than as a share of the catch and are not excepted from employment by section 3121(b)(20).


(c) The operating crew of a boat includes all persons on the boat (including the captain) who receive any form of remuneration in exchange for services rendered while on a boat engaged in catching fish. See § 1.6050A-1 for reporting requirements for the operator of a boat engaged in catching fish with respect to individuals performing services described in this section.


(d) During the same return period, service performed by a crew member may be excepted from employment by section 3121(b)(20) and this section for one voyage and not so excepted on a subsequent voyage on the same or on a different boat.
