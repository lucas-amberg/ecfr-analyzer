# § 31.3402(k)-1   Special rule for tips.

(a) *Withholding of income tax in respect of tips*—(1) *In general.* Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an employer is required to deduct and withhold from each of his employees tax in respect of those tips received by the employee which constitute wages. (For provisions relating to the treatment of tips as wages, see §§ 3401(a)(16) and 3401(f).) The employer shall make the withholding by deducting or causing to be deducted the amount of the tax from wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer or other funds turned over by the employee to the employer (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section). For purposes of this section the terms “wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer” means, with respect to a payment of wages, an amount equal to wages as defined in section 3401(a) except that tips and noncash remuneration which are wages are not included, less the sum of—


(i) The tax under section 3101 required to be collected by the employer in respect of wages as defined in section 3121(a) (exclusive of tips);


(ii) The tax under section 3402 required to be collected by the employer in respect of wages as defined in section 3401(a) (exclusive of tips); and

(2) *Limitations.* An employer is required to deduct and withhold the tax on tips which constitute wages only in respect of those tips which are reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a). The employer is responsible for the collection of the tax on tips reported to him only to the extent that the emloyer can, during the period beginning at the time the written statement is submitted to him and ending at the close of the calendar year in which the statement was submitted, collect the tax by deducting it or causing it to be deducted as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.


(3) *Furnishing of funds to employer.* If the amount of the tax in respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) exceeds the wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer from which the employer is required to withhold the tax in respect of such tips, the employee may furnish to the employer, within the period specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an amount of money equal to the amount of such excess.


(b) *Less than $20 of tips.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if an employee furnishes to his employer a written statement—


(1) Covering a period of less than 1 month, and


(2) The statement is furnished to the employer prior to the close of the 10th day of the month following the month in which the tips were actually received by the employee, and


(3) The aggregate amount of tips reported in the statement and in all other statements previously furnished by the employee covering periods within the same month is less than $20, and such statements, collectively, do not cover the entire month,


(c) *Priority of tax collection*—(1) *In general.* In the case of a payment of wages (exclusive of tips), the employer shall deduct or cause to be deducted in the following order:


(i) The tax under section 3101 and the tax under section 3402 with respect to such payment of wages.


(ii) Any tax under section 3101 which, at the time of payment of the wages, the employer is required to collect—


(*a*) In respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a), or


(*b*) By reason of the employer's election to make collection of the tax under section 3101 in respect of tips on an estimated basis,


(iii) Any tax under section 3402 which, at the time of the payment of the wages, the employer is required to collect—


(*a*) In respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a), or
