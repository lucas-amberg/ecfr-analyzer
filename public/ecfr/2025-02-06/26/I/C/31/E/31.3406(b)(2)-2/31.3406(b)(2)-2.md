# § 31.3406(b)(2)-2   Original issue discount.

(a) *Original issue discount subject to backup withholding.* The amount of original issue discount, treated as interest, subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6049, but is limited to the amount of cash paid. In addition, if an original issue discount obligation, subject to reporting under section 6045, is sold prior to maturity and with respect to the seller a condition exists for imposing withholding under section 3406 on the gross proceeds, then withholding under § 31.3406(b)(3)-2 applies to the gross proceeds of the sale reportable under section 6045, and not to the amount of any original issue discount includible in the gross income of the seller for the calendar year of the sale. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.


(b) *Amount subject to backup withholding and time when backup withholding is imposed with respect to short-term obligations.* In the case of an obligation with a fixed maturity date not exceeding one year from the date of issue (a short-term obligation), withholding under section 3406 applies to any payment of original issue discount on the obligation includible in the gross income of the holder to the extent of the cash amount of the payment. See § 1.1273-1 of this chapter to determine the amount of original issue discount on a short-term obligation. See § 1.446-2(e)(1) of this chapter to determine the amount of a payment treated as original issue discount.


(c) *Transferred short-term obligations*—(1) *Subsequent holder may establish purchase price*—(i) *In general.* At maturity of a short-term obligation, a subsequent holder (i.e., any person who purchased or otherwise obtained the obligation after the obligation was issued to the original holder) may establish the price of the obligation. The price established by the subsequent holder must then be treated as the original issue price for purposes of computing the amount of the original issue discount subject to withholding under section 3406. The price of a short-term obligation may be established by confirmation receipt or other record of a similar type or, if the obligation is redeemed by or through the person from whom the obligation was purchased or otherwise obtained, by the records of the person from whom or through whom the obligation was purchased or otherwise obtained. The subsequent holder is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the price determined under this paragraph (c)(1)(i) is correct.


(ii) *Exception.* A payor may elect to disregard the price at which the subsequent holder purchased or otherwise obtained the obligation if the payor's computer or recordkeeping system on which the details of the obligation are stored is not able to accept that price without significant manual intervention.


(2) *Subsequent holder unable (or not permitted) to establish purchase price.* If a subsequent holder fails (or is unable, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) to establish the purchase price of the obligation, then the person redeeming the obligation must determine the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 as though the obligation had been purchased by the holder on the date of issue. If the person redeeming the obligation is the issuer of the obligation, then the issuer must determine the amount subject to withholding from its records. If a person other than the issuer of the obligation redeems the obligation and the obligation is listed in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212, List of Original Issue Discount Obligations, that person must determine the amount subject to withholding by using the issue price indicated in Publication 1212.


(3) *Transferred obligation.* If a short-term obligation is transferred, no part of the purchase price is considered a reportable interest payment under section 6049. Withholding under section 3406 applies, however, to the gross proceeds of the sale of the obligation if the transfer is subject to reporting under section 6045 and a condition exists for imposing withholding. For the rules regarding withholding for amounts subject to reporting under section 6045, see § 31.3406(b)(3)-2.


(d) *Amount subject to backup withholding and time when backup withholding is imposed with respect to long-term obligations*—(1) *No cash payments prior to maturity.* In the case of an obligation with a fixed maturity date that is more than one year from the date of issue (a long-term obligation) and with no cash payments prior to maturity, withholding under section 3406 applies at the maturity of the obligation to the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year in which the obligation matures. The amount required to be withheld must not exceed the amount of the cash payment.


(2) *Registered long-term obligations with cash payments prior to maturity.* In the case of a long-term obligation in registered form that provides for cash payments prior to maturity, withholding under section 3406 applies at the time cash payments are made to the sum of the amounts of qualified stated interest and original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year in which the cash payments are made. The amount required to be withheld at the time of any cash payment, however, must not exceed the amount of the cash payment. If more than one cash payment is made during a calendar year, the tax that is required to be withheld with respect to original issue discount must be allocated among all the expected cash payments in the ratio that each cash payment bears to the total of the expected cash payments.


(3) *Transferred registered long-term obligations with payments prior to maturity.* In the case of a long-term obligation that is transferred after its issuance from the original holder, the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a subsequent holder is the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of all holders during the calendar year (without regard to any amount paid by a subsequent holder at the time of transfer). If the person redeeming the obligation at maturity is the issuer of the obligation, the issuer must determine the amount subject to withholding through its records by treating the holder as if he were the original holder. If a person redeeming the obligation at maturity is a person other than the issuer of the obligation, and the obligation is listed in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212, List of Original Issue Discount Obligations, the person must determine the amount subject to withholding by using the issue price indicated in Publication 1212.


(e) *Bearer long-term obligations.* In the case of a bearer long-term obligation with cash payments prior to maturity—


(1) *Payments prior to maturity.* Withholding under section 3406 applies prior to maturity only to the payment of qualified stated interest (and not to any amount of original issue discount) includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year.


(2) *Payments at maturity.* At maturity of the obligation, withholding applies to the sum of any qualified stated interest payment made at maturity and the total amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder during the calendar year of maturity. The amount required to be withheld at the time of the cash payment, however, must not exceed the amount of the cash payment.
