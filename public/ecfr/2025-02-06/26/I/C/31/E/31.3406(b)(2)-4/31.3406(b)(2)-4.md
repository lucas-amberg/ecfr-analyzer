# § 31.3406(b)(2)-4   Reportable dividend payment.

(a) *Dividends subject to backup withholding.* A payment of a kind, and to a payee, that is required to be reported under section 6042 (relating to returns regarding payments of dividends and corporate earnings and profits) is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406. See paragraph (b) of this section for certain dividends not subject to withholding under section 3406. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.


(b) *Dividends not subject to backup withholding.* Except as provided in § 31.3406(b)(3)-2 (relating to transactions reportable under section 6045), withholding under section 3406 does not apply to—


(1) Any amount treated as a taxable dividend by reason of section 302 (relating to redemptions of stock), section 304 (relating to redemptions through the use of related corporations), section 306 (relating to disposition of certain stock), section 356 (relating to receipt of additional consideration in connection with certain reorganizations), or section 1081(e)(2) (relating to certain distributions pursuant to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission);


(2) Any exempt-interest dividend, as defined in section 852(b)(5)(A), paid by a regulated investment company; or


(3) Any amount paid or treated as paid during a year by a regulated investment company, provided that the payor reasonably estimates, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that 95 percent or more of all dividends paid or treated as paid during the year are exempt-interest dividends.


(c) *Amount subject to backup withholding*—(1) *In general.* The amount of a dividend subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6042, including any dividend that is reinvested pursuant to a plan under which a shareholder may elect to receive stock as a dividend instead of property. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), withholding applies to the entire amount of the distribution.


(2) *Reasonable estimate of amount of dividend subject to backup withholding.* Pursuant to section 6042(b)(3) and § 1.6042-3(c) of this chapter, if the payor is unable to determine the portion of a distribution that is a dividend, the entire amount of the distribution must be treated as a dividend for information reporting under section 6042. Hence, withholding applies to the entire amount of the distribution. If a payor is able reasonably to estimate under section 6042 and § 1.6042-3(c) of this chapter the portion of a distribution that is not a dividend, however, the payor must not withhold on that portion (which is not considered a dividend). A payor making a payment, all or a portion of which may not be a dividend, may use previous experience to estimate the portion of a distribution that is not a dividend. The payor's estimate is considered reasonable if—


(i) The estimate does not exceed the proportion of the distributions made by the payor during the most recent calendar year for which a Form 1099 was required to be filed that was not reported by the payor as a dividend; and 


(ii) The payor has no reasonable basis to expect that the proportion of the distribution that is not a dividend will be substantially different for the current year.


(3) *Reinvested dividends.* In the case of a dividend paid pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan, withholding under section 3406 applies, pursuant to § 31.3406(a)-4(a), at the time and to the amount made available to the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account. At the discretion of the payor, withholding under section 3406 need not be applied to any excess of the fair market value of the shares of stock received by the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account over the purchase price of the shares (including shares acquired by the shareholder at a discount in connection with the dividend distribution) or to any fee that is paid by the payor in the nature of a broker's fee for purchase of the stock or service charge for maintenance of the shareholder's account. The payor must, however, treat any excess amounts and fees on a consistent basis for each calendar year.
