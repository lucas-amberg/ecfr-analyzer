# § 31.3406(b)(4)-1   Exemption for certain minimal payments.

(a) *In general.* A payor of reportable interest or dividends (as described in section 3406(b)(2)) or of royalties (as described in section 3406(b)(3)(E)) may elect not to withhold from a payment that does not exceed $10 and that on an annualized basis does not exceed $10 (see paragraph (c) of this section). A broker or barter exchange may elect not to withhold on gross proceeds of $10 or less without regard to the annualization requirement. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.


(b) *Manner of making the election.* The election not to withhold from payments that do not exceed $10 can be made only for payments described in paragraph (a) of this section. The election may be made on a payment-by-payment basis.


(c) *How to annualize*—(1) *In general.* To annualize a reportable interest payment, dividend payment, or royalty payment, a payor must calculate what the amount of the payment would be if it were paid for a 1-year period (instead of the period for which it actually is paid). The annualized amount is determined by dividing the amount of the payment by the number of days in the period for which it is being paid and then multiplying that result by the number of days in the year. If the annualized amount is $10 or less, the payor may elect not to withhold on that payment regardless of whether more than $10 may be or has been paid to the payee in other reportable payments during the calendar year. Conversely, if the annualized amount is more than $10, withholding applies even if $10 or less is actually paid to the payee during the calendar year. For purposes of computing the annualized amount, the payor may assume that February always consists of 28 days and that the year always consists of 360 days. For amounts that are deposited with a payor in a new account or certificate between the dates on which the payor customarily pays or credits interest, the payor may assume that the period for which the interest is paid is the payor's customary period for paying or crediting interest.


(2) *Special aggregation rule for reportable interest and dividends.* If a payor maintains records that reflect multiple holdings of one payee and the payor makes an aggregate payment of reportable interest or dividends (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) with respect to those multiple holdings (such as a dividend check that reflects payment on all stock owned by the payee), the payor must annualize the aggregate payment.


(d) *Exception for window transactions and original issue discount.* A payor is not required to annualize payments made in window transactions (as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b)) or payments of original issue discount. With respect to a window transaction, however, the payor is required to aggregate all payments made in the same transaction (e.g., payments made with respect to coupons or obligations presented for payment at the same time as described in § 1.6049-4(e)(4) of this chapter).
