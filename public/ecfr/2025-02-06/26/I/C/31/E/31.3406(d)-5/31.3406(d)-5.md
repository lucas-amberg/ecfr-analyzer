# § 31.3406(d)-5   Backup withholding when the Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold because the payee's taxpayer identification number is incorrect.

(a) *Overview.* Backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B) applies to any reportable payment made with respect to an account of a payee if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies a payor under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section that the payee's name and taxpayer identification number combination (name/TIN combination) is incorrect and the payor is required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to identify that account as having the same name/TIN combination. After receiving a notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and identifying an account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, under paragraph (e) of this section, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made to such account after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the notice and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section. Under paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives 2 notices from the Internal Revenue Service or broker within 3 calendar years with respect to a payee's account, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) (rather than paragraph (d)) of this section. In addition, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made with respect to the account after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the second notice and on or before the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination for the account. Paragraph (h) of this section requires a payor to use a corrected name/TIN combination on subsequent information returns.


(b) *Definitions and special rules*—(1) *Definition of incorrect name/TIN combination.* An incorrect name/TIN combination is a combination of a name and taxpayer identification number provided on an information return with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determines that the taxpayer identification number provided is not assigned under section 6109 to the name provided.


(2) *Definition of account.* The term “account” means any account, instrument, or other relationship with the payor.


(3) *Definition of business day.* The term “business day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday (within the meaning of section 7503).


(4) *Certain exceptions*—(i) *In general.* This section does not apply with respect to any notice received under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to payments that—


(A) Were made to a fiduciary or nominee account; or


(B) Were not reportable payments (for example, because the payments were made to an exempt recipient).


(ii) *Definition of fiduciary or nominee account.* A fiduciary or nominee account is an account with respect to which at least one person named in the registration is identified as acting in the capacity as nominee or as administrator, conservator, custodian, receiver, tutor, curator, committee, executor, guardian, trustee, or other fiduciary capacity recognized under governing law.


(c) *Notice regarding an incorrect name/TIN combination*—(1) *In general.* If the Internal Revenue Service notifies a payor that a payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect and that the payor must commence backup withholding as required on reportable payments made with respect to accounts of the payee with the same name/TIN combination, the payor must—


(i) Identify under paragraph (c)(3) of this section any account or accounts of the payee having the same name/TIN combination;


(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, notify the payee and backup withhold on reportable payments made to the account or accounts under the rules of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.


(2) *Additional requirements for payors that are also brokers*—(i) *In general.* A broker must notify the payor of an instrument of the information required under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if—


(A) The broker (in its capacity as a payor) receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that a payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect and is required to identify an account of the payee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section as having the name/TIN combination; 


(B) The payee acquires through the same account with the broker a readily tradable instrument with respect to which the broker is not the payor; and


(C) The acquisition of such instrument occurs after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the broker receives that notice (or on any earlier date that the broker chooses to begin applying this paragraph (c)(2)).


(ii) *Required information.* The information required to be provided under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) is:


(A) The fact that the broker was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination;


(B) The incorrect name/TIN combination; and


(C) The fact that the named payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B).


(iii) *Termination of obligation to provide information.* The obligation of a broker to provide information to payors under this paragraph (c)(2) terminates simultaneously with the termination of the broker's obligation to backup withhold (in its capacity as payor) on reportable payments to the account.


(3) *Payor identification of the account or accounts of the payee that have the incorrect taxpayer identification number*—(i) *In general.* If an account number or designation is provided in the notice received under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor need only identify any account or accounts corresponding to that number or designation that has the same name/TIN combination provided in the notice. If no account number or designation is provided in the notice received under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor must identify, using reasonable care, all accounts of the payee having the same name/TIN combination provided in the notice. If a payor receives notice from a broker under paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to the acquisition of a readily tradable instrument, the payor is not required to identify any other account of the payee.


(ii) *Reasonable care where no account number or designation is provided.* A payor who satisfies the following two-part facts-and-circumstances test will be considered to have exercised reasonable care for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3).


(A) Part one of the test is satisfied if a payor searches for accounts of the payee on the computer or other recordkeeping system that the payor can reasonably associate with the information return that generated the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, a payor who maintains separate computer or recordkeeping systems for different product lines will have identified and used the appropriate system if the payor searches for accounts of the payee on the computer or recordkeeping system that contains the product line for the type of payments reported on the information return. A payor with the same product line on several nonintegrated computer or record systems will have identified and used the appropriate system if the payor searches for accounts of the payee on any computer or record system that the payor otherwise can reasonably associate with the information return.


(B) Part two of the test is satisfied if the payor inputs the name/TIN combination provided on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section into the system that is described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. If the system of a payor cannot utilize the name/TIN combination, the payor must input appropriate data or criteria, as determined by the capability of the payor's computer or recordkeeping system.


(iii) *No identification if error is caused by payor.* A payor may treat an account as not having the incorrect name/TIN combination if the error resulted because the name or taxpayer identification number on such account is not the name or taxpayer identification number that was provided to the payor. This may occur, for example, where a payor transposes numbers in the taxpayer identification number when incorporating it into the payor's business records.


(4) *Special rules for joint accounts*—(i) *In general.* In the case of a joint account, the relevant name/TIN combination for purposes of this section is the name/TIN combination used for information reporting purposes.


(ii) *Transitional rule.* With respect to notices received under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section prior to September 1, 1993, a payor may treat the name/TIN combination of the first person on a joint account as the relevant name/TIN combination, unless that person is an exempt foreign person and the account registration includes names of persons who are not foreign persons.


(iii) *Optional rule where names are switched.* A payor may backup withhold under this section on reportable payments made to a joint account if the order of the names (or taxpayer identification numbers) on the account is merely changed subsequent to receipt of a notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, provided that the name of the person to which the incorrect name/TIN combination originally applies remains on the account.


(5) *Date of receipt.* For purposes of this section, the date set forth on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or broker under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section is considered to be the date of receipt of the notice by the payor. However, if the payor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that the date of actual receipt of the notice is later than the date on the notice, the actual date of receipt is controlling.


(d) *Notice from payors of backup withholding due to an incorrect name/TIN combination*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and is required to identify an account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must send a copy of the notice (or an acceptable substitute notice) to the payee of the account in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(2) *Procedures*—(i) *In general.* The notice that a payor must send to a payee under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must comply with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery. A payor must send the notice to the payee within 15 business days after the date that the payor receives the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.


(ii) *Two or more notices for an account for the same year or received in the same year.* A payor who receives, under the same payor taxpayer identification number, two or more notices under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to the same payee's account for the same year, or in the same calendar year, need only send one notice to the payee under this section. 


(e) *Period during which backup withholding is required due to notification of an incorrect name/TIN combination*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives a notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and is required to identify an account as having the same name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must impose backup withholding on all reportable payments made with respect to the account after the close of the 30th business day after the date the payor receives that notice and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the day the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section.


(2) *Grace periods*—(i) *Starting backup withholding.* A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup withholding under this paragraph (e) at any time during the 30-business-day period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(ii) *Stopping backup withholding.* A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under this paragraph (e) at any time within 30 calendar days after the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section.


(3) *Dormant accounts.* The requirement that a payor backup withhold under this paragraph (e) on reportable payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—


(i) The date that the last reportable payment was made to that account; or


(ii) The date that the payor received the notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.


(f) *Manner required for payee to furnish certified taxpayer identification number.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, in order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting, or to stop it once it has begun, a payee with respect to whom the payor has been notified under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) that the payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect is required on Form W-9 (or an acceptable substitute form) to—


(i) Provide the payee's name and taxpayer identification number; and


(ii) Certify, under penalties of perjury, that the taxpayer identification number being provided is correct.


(2) The certification must be made even if the account is a pre-1984 account and even if the payment to the account is a reportable payment other than interest, dividends, patronage dividends, original issue discount, or proceeds of a sale of a security or commodity. In order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting or to stop it once it has begun, a payee is not required to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C). With respect to notices received under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section on or after September 1, 1993, the requirements of this paragraph (f) are not satisfied if a payee provides only an awaiting TIN certification. As a result, a payor must not fail to begin backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification, or stop it once it has begun solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification.


(g) *Receipt of two notices within a 3-year period*—(1) *In general.* If a payor receives notification under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section twice within 3 calendar years, and in each case the payor is required to identify the same account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination, the payor must—


(i) Disregard any future certifications (described in paragraph (f) of this section) furnished by the payee with respect to the account until the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section;


(ii) Send the notice described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section to the payee (and not the notice required under paragraph (d) of this section) within 15 business days after the date that the payor receives the second notice; and


(iii) Impose backup withholding on the account for the period described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.


(2) *Notice to payee who has provided two incorrect name/TIN combinations within 3 calendar years.* The notice to the payee required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section must comply with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery.


(3) *Period during which backup withholding is required due to a second notice of an incorrect name/taxpayer identification combination within 3 calendar years*—(i) *In general.* If paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made with respect to the account of the payee after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the second notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the account. However, a payor may choose not to commence backup withholding under this paragraph (g) until January 1, 1992.


(ii) *Grace periods*—(A) *Starting backup withholding.* A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup withholding under this paragraph (g) at any time during the 30-business-day period described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.


(B) *Stopping backup withholding.* A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under this paragraph (g) at any time within 30 calendar days after the date the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the account.


(iii) *Dormant accounts.* The requirement that a payor backup withhold under this paragraph (g) on reportable payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—


(A) The date that the last reportable payment was made to that account; or


(B) The date that the payor received the second notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.


(4) *Receipt of two notices for the same year or in the same calendar year.* A payor who receives, under the same payor taxpayer identification number, two or more notices under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to the same payee's account for the same year, or in the same calendar year, must treat such notices as one notice for purposes of this paragraph (g). 


(5) *Notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination.* The Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) will notify a payor after it validates a name/TIN combination that the payee provides for an account to which paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies. Notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (g)(5) only if it complies with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery. In order to obtain notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination for an account, a payee who receives notice from a payor under paragraph (g)(2) of this section should follow such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.


(h) *Payor must use newly provided certified number.* If a payor receives a certification under paragraph (f) of this section or a notification under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for an account, the payor must use the name/TIN combination provided on such certification or notification on information returns for the account for which the due date (without regard to extensions) is more than 30 calendar days after the date that the payor receives the certification or notification. A payor who uses that name/TIN combination on the first such information return satisfies the requirement of section 3406(h)(9) to provide this information to the Internal Revenue Service. If the payor is not required to file any information returns with respect to the account after the date that the payor receives the certification or notification, a payor is deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 3406(h)(9).


(i) *Effective date.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of this section are effective with respect to notices received on or after September 1, 1990, under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.


(j) *Examples.* The application of the provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
