# § 31.6011(a)-2   Returns under Railroad Retirement Tax Act.

(a) *Requirement*—(1) *Employers.* Every employer shall make a return for the first return period after 1954 within which compensation taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act is paid to his employee or employees for services rendered after 1954, and for each subsequent return period (whether or not taxable compensation is paid therein) until he has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. For calendar years after 1975, the return period shall be the calendar year; for calendar years prior to 1976, the return period shall be the calendar quarter. Form CT-1 is the form prescribed for making the return required under this paragraph. One original and a duplicate of each return on Form CT-1 shall be filed with the director of the service center.


(2) *Employee representatives.* Every employee representative shall make a return for the first calendar quarter after 1954 within which he is paid taxable compensation for services rendered after 1954 as an employee representative, and for each subsequent calendar quarter (whether or not he is paid taxable compensation therein) until he has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Form CT-2 is the form prescribed for making the return required under this subparagraph. One original and a duplicate of each return on Form CT-2 shall be filed with the director of the service center.


(b) *When to report compensation*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, compensation taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act shall be reported in the return required under this section for the period in which it is deemed, under paragraph (d) of § 31.3231(e)-1 to be paid, unless under such section the compensation may be deemed to be paid in more than one return period, in which case it shall be reported only in the return for the first return period in which it is deemed to be paid.


(2) *Pre-1976 returns of employers required by State law to pay compensation on weekly basis*—(i) *In general.* If any employer is required by the laws of any State to pay compensation weekly in any calendar year prior to 1976, the return of tax with respect to such compensation may, at the election of such employer, cover all payroll weeks which, or the major part of which, fall within the period for which a return of tax is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. This provision shall not apply, however, to any payroll week which falls in two calendar years. Any employer who elects to file a return as provided in this subparagraph shall notify the district director in writing of such election and shall include therein a statement setting forth the facts which entitle him to make the election. Such notice shall be in duplicate and shall be attached to the original and duplicate of the return for the first period to which such election applies. Any election so made shall be binding upon the employer with respect to all returns subsequently made by him until the director of the service center authorizes or directs the employer to make a return on a different basis. For the purpose of determining the time when compensation is deemed to be paid in accordance with paragraph (d) of § 31.3231(e)-1 and of determining the due date of a return in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 31.6071(a)-1, the calendar month following the period covered by the return of an employer making such election is the same calendar month which would be determinative for such purposes if the employer had not made the election.


(ii) *Prior elections.* An election made by an employer, pursuant to the provisions of 26 CFR (1939) 410.501(b) (Regulations 100) or of 26 CFR (1939) 411.601 (b) (Regulations 114), which is in force and effect at the time the employer makes his first return under this section shall satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section with respect to the making of an election and shall be binding upon the employer with respect to all returns made by him under this section until the director of the service center authorizes or directs the employer to make a return on a different basis.


(iii) *Example.* Employer X is required by State law to pay his employees within 6 days after the compensation is earned. In compliance with the State law, employer X, for services rendered to him for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, pays his employees on the last-named date. June 1955 is the last month of a period for which a return of tax is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Employer X may elect to include in the return required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the period April 1 to June 30, 1955, the compensation paid to his employees for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, inclusive, although the compensation for July 1 and 2 falls within another period for which a return is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If, in this example, the payroll week ended on July 5, 1955, the compensation paid for the payroll week of June 29 to July 5 would be included in the return period in which July falls although the compensation earned for June 29 and 30 fell in a prior return period under the general rule.


(c) *Time and place for filing returns.* For provisions relating to the time and place for filing returns, see §§ 31.6071 (a)-1 and 31.6091-1, respectively.


(d) *Returns by employees and employee representatives in respect of Additional Medicare Tax.* An employee or employee representative who is paid compensation, as defined in section 3231(e), subject to the tax under sections 3201(a) (as calculated under section 3101(b)(2)) or section 3211(a) (as calculated under section 3101(b)(2)) (Additional Medicare Tax), must make a return for the taxable year in respect of such tax. The return shall be made on Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.” The form to be used by residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands is Form 1040-SS, “U.S. Self-Employment Tax Return (Including Additional Child Tax Credit for Bona Fide Residents of Puerto Rico).” The form to be used by residents of Puerto Rico is either Form 1040-SS or Form 1040-PR, “Planilla para la Declaración de la Contribución Federal sobre el Trabajo por Cuenta Propia (Incluyendo el Crédito Tributario Adicional por Hijos para Residentes Bona Fide de Puerto Rico).”


(e) *Effective/applicability date.* Paragraph (d) of this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after November 29, 2013.
