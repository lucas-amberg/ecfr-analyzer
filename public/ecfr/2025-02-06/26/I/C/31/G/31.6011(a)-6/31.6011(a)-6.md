# § 31.6011(a)-6   Final returns.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Federal Insurance Contributions Act; income tax withheld from wages and nonpayroll payments.* An employer (or other person) who is required to make a return on a particular form pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-1, § 31.6011(a)-4, or § 31.6011(a)-5, and who in any return period ceases to pay wages or nonpayroll payments in respect of which he is required to make a return on that form, must make the return for the period as a final return. Each return made as a final return shall be marked “Final return” by the person filing the return. Every such person filing a final return (other than a final return on Form 942 or Form 943) must furnish information showing the date of the last payment of wages (as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401(a)), and, if appropriate, the date of the last payment of nonpayroll payments defined in § 31.6011(a)-4(b). An employer (other than an employer making returns on Form 942) who has only temporarily ceased to pay wages, because of seasonal activities or for other reasons, shall not make a final return but shall continue to file returns. If (i) for any return period an employer makes a final return on a particular form, and (ii) after the close of such period the employer pays wages, as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401(a), in respect of which the same or a different return form is prescribed, such employer shall make returns on the appropriate return form. For example, if an employer who has filed a final return on Form 941 pays wages only for domestic service in his private home not on a farm operated for profit, the employer is required to make returns on Form 942 in respect of such wages.


(2) *Railroad Retirement Tax Act*—(i) *Form CT-1.* An employer required to make returns on Form CT-1 who in any return period ceases to pay taxable compensation shall make the return on Form CT-1 for such period as a final return. Such return shall be marked “Final return” by the person filing the return, and such person shall furnish information showing the date of the last payment of taxable compensation. An employer who has only temporarily ceased to pay taxable compensation shall continue to file returns on Form CT-1.


(ii) *Form CT-2.* An employee representative required to make returns on Form CT-2 who in any calendar quarter ceases to be paid taxable compensation for services as an employee representative shall make the return on Form CT-2 for such quarter as a final return. Such return shall be marked “Final return” by the person filing the return, and such person shall furnish information showing the date of the last payment of taxable compensation. An employee representative who only temporarily ceases to be paid taxable compensation for services as an employee representative shall continue to file returns on Form CT-2. 


(3) *Federal Unemployment Tax Act.* An employer required to make a return on Form 940 for a calendar year in which he ceases to be an employer, as defined in § 31.3306(a)-1, because of the discontinuance, sale, or other transfer of his business, shall make such return as a final return. Such return shall be marked “Final return” by the person filing the return.


(b) *Statement to accompany final return.* There shall be executed as a part of each final return, except in the case of a final return on Form 942, a statement showing the address at which the records required by the regulations in this part will be kept, the name of the person keeping such records, and, if the business of an employer has been sold or otherwise transferred to another person, the name and address of such person and the date on which such sale or other transfer took place. If no such sale or transfer occurred or the employer does not know the name of the person to whom the business was sold or transferred, that fact should be included in the statement. Such statement shall include any information required by this section as to the date of the last payment of wages or compensation. If the statement is executed as a part of a final return on Form CT-1 or Form CT-2, such statement shall be furnished in duplicate.


(c) *Time and place for filing returns.* For provisions relating to the time and place for filing returns, see §§ 31.6071 (a)-1 and 31.6091-1, respectively.
