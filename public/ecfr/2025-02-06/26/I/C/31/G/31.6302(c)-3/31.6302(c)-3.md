# § 31.6302(c)-3   Deposit rules for taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.

(a) *Requirement*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, every person that, by reason of the provisions of section 6157, computes the tax imposed by section 3301 on a quarterly or other time period basis shall—


(i) If the person is described in section (a)(1) of section 6157, deposit the amount of such tax by the last day of the first calendar month following the close of each of the first three calendar quarters in the calendar year; or


(ii) If the person is other than a person described in section (a)(1) of section 6157, deposit the amount of such tax by the last day of the first calendar month following the close of—


(*a*) The period beginning with the first day of the calendar year and ending with the last day of the calendar quarter (excluding the last calendar quarter) in which such person becomes an employer (as defined in section 3306(a)), and


(*b*) The third calendar quarter of such year, if the period specified in (*a*) of this subdivision includes only the first two calendar quarters of the calendar year.


(2) *Special rule where accumulated amount does not exceed $500.* The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply with respect to any period described therein if the amount of the tax imposed by section 3301 for such period (as computed under section 6157) plus amounts not deposited for prior periods does not exceed $500 ($100 in the case of periods ending on or before December 31, 2004). Thus, an employer shall not be required to make a deposit for a period unless his tax for such period plus tax not deposited for prior periods exceeds $500.


(b) *Manner of deposit*—(1) *In general.* A deposit required to be made by an employer under this section shall be made separately from a deposit required by any other section. An employer may make one, or more than one, remittance of the amount required to be deposited. An employer that is not required to deposit an amount of tax by this section may nevertheless voluntarily make that deposit. For the requirement to deposit tax under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act by electronic funds transfer, see § 31.6302-1(h).


(2) *Time deemed paid.* For the time an amount deposited by electronic funds transfer is deemed paid, see § 31.6302-1(h)(9). For the time an amount remitted with a return is deemed paid, see § 31.6302-1(i)(3).


(c) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies to deposits and payments made after December 31, 2010.
