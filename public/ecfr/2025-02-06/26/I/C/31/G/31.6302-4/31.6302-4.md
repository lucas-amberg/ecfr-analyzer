# § 31.6302-4   Deposit rules for withheld income taxes attributable to nonpayroll payments.

(a) *General rule.* With respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes attributable to nonpayroll payments made after December 31, 1993, a taxpayer is either a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor based on an annual determination. Except as provided in this section, the rules of § 31.6302-1 shall apply to determine the time and manner of making deposits of nonpayroll withheld taxes as though they were employment taxes. Paragraph (b) of this section defines nonpayroll withheld taxes. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining whether a taxpayer is a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor.


(b) *Nonpayroll withheld taxes defined.* For purposes of this section, effective with respect to payments made after December 31, 1993, *nonpayroll withheld taxes* means—


(1) Amounts withheld under section 3402(q), relating to withholding on certain gambling winnings;


(2) Amounts withheld under section 3402 with respect to amounts paid as retirement pay for service in the Armed Forces of the United States;


(3) Amounts withheld under section 3402(o)(1)(B), relating to certain annuities;


(4) Annuities withheld under section 3405, relating to withholding on pensions, annuities, IRAs, and certain other deferred income; and


(5) Amounts withheld under section 3406, relating to backup withholding with respect to reportable payments.


(c) *Determination of deposit status*—(1) *Rules for calendar years 1994 and 1995.* On January 1, 1994, a taxpayer's depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the same as the taxpayer's status on January 1, 1994, for taxes reported on Form 941 under § 31.6302-1. A taxpayer generally retains that depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes for all of calendar years 1994 and 1995. However, a taxpayer that under this paragraph (c) is a monthly depositor for 1994 and 1995 will immediately lose that status and become a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes if the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) is triggered with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.


(2) *Rules for calendar years after 1995*—(i) *In general.* For calendar years after 1995, the determination of whether a taxpayer is a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year is based on an annual determination and generally depends on the aggregate amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes reported by the taxpayer for the lookback period as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.


(ii) *Monthly depositor.* A taxpayer is a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) is $50,000 or less. A taxpayer ceases to be a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes on the first day after the taxpayer is subject to the One-Day rule in § 31.6302-1(c)(3) with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. At that time, the taxpayer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the succeeding calendar year. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.


(iii) *Semi-weekly depositor.* A taxpayer is a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) exceeds $50,000.


(iv) *Lookback period.* For purposes of this section, the lookback period for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 1996 is calendar year 1994. A new taxpayer is treated as having nonpayroll withheld taxes of zero for any calendar year in which the taxpayer did not exist.


(d) *Special rules.* A taxpayer must treat nonpayroll withheld taxes, which are reported on Form 945, “Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax,” separately from taxes reportable on Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return” (or any other return, for example, Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees”). Taxes reported on Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941 are not combined for purposes of determining whether a deposit of either is due, whether the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) applies, or whether any safe harbor is applicable. In addition, taxes reported on Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941 must be deposited separately. (*See* paragraph (b) of § 31.6302-1 for rules for determining an employer's deposit status for taxes reported on Form 941.) Taxes reported on Form 945 for one calendar year must be deposited separately from taxes reported on Form 945 for another calendar year.


(e) *Effective/applicability date.* Section 31.6302-4(d) applies to deposits and payments made after December 31, 2010.
