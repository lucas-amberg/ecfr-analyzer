(a) *In general*—(1) *General rule.* A plan sponsor of an applicable self-insured health plan is liable for a fee imposed by section 4376 for plans with plan years ending on or after October 1, 2012, and before October 1, 2019. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the definitions that apply for purposes of section 4376 and this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides the requirements for calculating the fee imposed by section 4376. Paragraph (d) of this section provides the applicability date. For rules relating to filing the required return and paying the fee, see §§ 40.6011(a)-1 and 40.6071(a)-1.


(2) [Reserved]


(b) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of section 4376 and this section. See § 46.4377-1 for additional definitions.


(1) *Applicable self-insured health plan*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and § 46.4377-1, *applicable self-insured health plan* means a plan that provides for accident and health coverage (within the meaning of § 46.4377-1(a)) if any portion of the coverage is provided other than through an insurance policy and the plan is established or maintained—


(A) By one or more employers for the benefit of their employees or former employees;


(B) By one or more employee organizations for the benefit of their members or former members;


(C) Jointly by one or more employers and one or more employee organizations for the benefit of employees or former employees;


(D) By a voluntary employees' beneficiary association, as described in section 501(c)(9);


(E) By an organization described in section 501(c)(6); or


(F) By a multiple employer welfare arrangement (as defined in section 3(40) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)), a rural electric cooperative (as defined in section 3(40)(B)(iv) of ERISA), or a rural cooperative association (as defined in section 3(40)(B)(v) of ERISA).


(ii) *Exceptions.* The term *applicable self-insured health plan* does not include any of the following:


(A) A plan that provides benefits substantially all of which are excepted benefits, as defined in section 9832(c). For example, a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA) (as described in section 106(c)(2)) that satisfies the requirements to be treated as an excepted benefit under section 9832(c) and § 54.9831-1(c)(3)(v) of this chapter is not an applicable self-insured health plan. A health FSA that is not treated as an excepted benefit under section 9832(c) and § 54.9831-1(c)(3)(v) is an applicable self-insured health plan.


(B) An employee assistance program, disease management program, or wellness program if the program does not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment.


(C) A plan that, as demonstrated by the facts and circumstances surrounding the adoption and operation of the plan, was designed specifically to cover primarily employees who are working and residing outside the United States (as defined in § 46.4377-1(a)(3)).


(iii) *Multiple self-insured arrangements established or maintained by the same plan sponsor.* For purposes of section 4376, two or more arrangements established or maintained by the same plan sponsor that provide for accident and health coverage (within the meaning of § 46.4377-1(a)) other than through an insurance policy and that have the same plan year may be treated as a single applicable self-insured health plan for purposes of calculating the fee imposed by section 4376. For example, if a plan sponsor establishes or maintains a self-insured arrangement providing major medical benefits, and a separate self-insured arrangement with the same plan year providing prescription drug benefits, the two arrangements may be treated as one applicable self-insured health plan so that the same life covered under each arrangement would count as only one covered life under the plan for purposes of calculating the fee. Similarly, if a plan sponsor provides a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) and another applicable self-insured health plan that provides major medical coverage, the HRA and the major medical plan may be treated as one applicable self-insured health plan if the HRA and the self-insured plan have the same plan year.


(iv) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principle of this paragraph (b)(1):


(2) *Plan sponsor*—(i) *In general.* The term *plan sponsor* means—


(A) The employer, in the case of an applicable self-insured health plan established or maintained by a single employer;


(B) The employee organization, in the case of an applicable self-insured health plan established or maintained by an employee organization;


(C) The joint board of trustees, in the case of a multiemployer plan (as defined in section 414(f));


(D) The committee, in the case of a multiple employer welfare arrangement (as defined in section 3(40) of ERISA);


(E) The cooperative or association that establishes or maintains an applicable self-insured health plan established or maintained by a rural electric cooperative (as defined in section 3(40)(B)(iv) of ERISA) or rural cooperative association (as defined in section 3(40)(B)(v) of ERISA);


(F) The trustee, in the case of an applicable self-insured health plan established or maintained by a voluntary employees' beneficiary association (meaning that the voluntary employees' beneficiary association is not merely serving as a funding vehicle for a plan that is established or maintained by an employer or other person); or


(G) In the case of an applicable self-insured health plan the plan sponsor of which is not described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section, the person identified by the terms of the document under which the plan is operated as the plan sponsor, or the person designated by the terms of the document under which the plan is operated as the plan sponsor for section 4376 purposes, provided that designation is made in writing, and that person has consented to the designation in writing, by no later than the date by which the return paying the fee under section 4376 for that plan year is required to be filed, after which date that designation for that plan year may not be changed or revoked, and provided further that a person may be designated as the plan sponsor only if the person is one of the persons establishing or maintaining the plan (for example, one of the employers that establishes or maintains the plan with one or more other employers or employee organizations).


(H) In the case of an applicable self-insured health plan the sponsor of which is not described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section, and for which no identification or designation of a plan sponsor has been made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(G) of this section, each employer that establishes or maintains the plan (with respect to employees of that employer), each employee organization that establishes or maintains the plan (with respect to members of that employee organization), and each board of trustees, cooperative, or association that establishes or maintains the plan, meaning that each plan sponsor must file a separate Form 720, “Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,” reflecting its separate liability under section 4376.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (b)(2) of this section:


(c) *Calculation of fee*—(1) *In general.* The amount of the fee for a plan year is equal to the product of the average number of lives covered under the plan for the plan year (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and the applicable dollar amount (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section).


(2) *Determination of the average number of lives covered under the plan*—(i) *In general.* To determine the average number of lives covered under an applicable self-insured health plan during a plan year, a plan sponsor must use one of the following methods—


(A) The actual count method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section);


(B) The snapshot method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section); or


(C) The Form 5500 method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section).


(ii) *Consistency within plan year.* A plan sponsor must use the same method of calculating the average number of lives covered under the plan consistently for the duration of the plan year. However, a plan sponsor may use a different method from one plan year to the next.


(iii) *Actual count method*—(A) *In general.* A plan sponsor may determine the average number of lives covered under a plan for a plan year by adding the totals of lives covered for each day of the plan year and dividing that total by the number of days in the plan year.


(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates the principles of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section:


(iv) *Snapshot method*—(A) *In general.* A plan sponsor may determine the average number of lives covered under an applicable self-insured health plan for a plan year by adding the totals of lives covered on a date during the first, second, or third month of each quarter of the plan year (or more dates in each quarter if an equal number of dates is used in each quarter), and dividing that total by the number of dates on which a count was made. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), each date used for the second, third and fourth quarter must be within three days of the date in that quarter that corresponds to the date used for the first quarter, and all dates used must fall within the same plan year. If a plan sponsor uses multiple dates for the first quarter, the plan sponsor must use dates in the second, third, and fourth quarters that correspond to each of the dates used for the first quarter or are within three days of such corresponding dates, and all dates used must fall within the same plan year. The 30th and 31st day of a month are treated as the last day of the month for purposes of determining the corresponding date for any month that has fewer than 31 days (for example, if either March 30 or March 31 is used for a calendar year plan, June 30 is the corresponding date for the second quarter). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the number of lives covered on a designated date may be determined using either the snapshot factor method described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or the snapshot count method described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.


(B) *Snapshot factor method.* Under the snapshot factor method, the number of lives covered on a date is equal to the sum of—


(*i*) The number of participants with self-only coverage on that date; plus


(*ii)* The number of participants with coverage other than self-only coverage on the date multiplied by 2.35.


(C) *Snapshot count method.* Under the snapshot count method, the number of lives covered on a date equals the actual number of lives covered on the designated date.


(D) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)(iv) of this section:


(v) *Form 5500 method*—(A) *Calculation method.* A plan sponsor may determine the average number of lives covered under a plan for a plan year based on the number of participants reported on the Form 5500, “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan,” or the Form 5500-SF, “Short Form Annual Return/Report of Small Employee Benefit Plan,” that is filed for the applicable self-insured health plan for that plan year, provided that the Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF is filed no later than the due date for the fee imposed by section 4376 for that plan year. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v), the average number of lives covered under the plan for the plan year for a plan offering only self-only coverage equals the sum of the total participants covered at the beginning and the end of the plan year, as reported on the Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF for the applicable self-insured health plan, divided by 2. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v), the average number of lives covered under the plan for the plan year for a plan offering self-only coverage and coverage other than self-only coverage equals the sum of total participants covered at the beginning and the end of the plan year, as reported on the Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF filed for the applicable self-insured health plan.


(B) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section:


(vi) *Special rule for health FSAs and HRAs.* For purposes of this section, if a plan sponsor does not establish or maintain an applicable self-insured health plan other than a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA) (as described in section 106(c)(2)) or a health reimbursement arrangement (as described in Notice 2002-45 (2002-2 CB 93)) (HRA), the plan sponsor may treat each participant's health FSA or HRA as covering a single life (and therefore the plan sponsor is not required to include as lives covered any spouse, dependent, or other beneficiary of the individual participant in the health FSA or HRA, as applicable). If a health FSA or HRA that is an applicable self-insured health plan has the same plan sponsor and plan year as another applicable self-insured health plan other than a health FSA or HRA, the two arrangements may be treated as a single plan under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. However, the special counting rule in this paragraph applies only for purposes of the health FSA or HRA and, therefore, applies only for purposes of the participants in the health FSA or HRA that do not participate in the other applicable self-insured health plan. The participants in the health FSA or HRA that participate in the other applicable self-insured health plan will be counted in accordance with the method applied for counting lives covered under that other plan as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.


(vii) *Special rule for lives covered solely by the fully-insured options under an applicable self-insured health plan*—(A) *In general.* If an applicable self-insured health plan provides accident and health coverage through fully-insured options and self-insured options, the plan sponsor is permitted to disregard the lives that are covered solely under the fully-insured options in determining the lives covered taken into account for the actual count method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section), the snapshot method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section), and the Form 5500 method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section).


(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates the principles of paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section:


(viii) *Special rule for the first year the fee is in effect.* Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, for a plan year beginning before July 11, 2012, and ending on or after October 1, 2012, a plan sponsor may determine the average number of lives covered under the plan for the plan year using any reasonable method.


(3) *Applicable dollar amount.* For a plan year ending on or after October 1, 2012, and before October 1, 2013, the applicable dollar amount is $1. For a plan year ending on or after October 1, 2013, and before October 1, 2014, the applicable dollar amount is $2. For any plan year ending in any Federal fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 2014, the applicable dollar amount is equal to the sum of—


(i) The applicable dollar amount for the plan year ending in the previous Federal fiscal year; plus


(ii) The amount equal to the product of—


(A) The applicable dollar amount for the plan year ending in the previous Federal fiscal year; and


(B) The percentage increase in the projected per capita amount of the National Health Expenditures most recently released by the Department of Health and Human Services before the beginning of the Federal fiscal year.


(4) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principle of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(d) *Effective/Applicability date.* This section applies for plan years that end on or after October 1, 2012, and before October 1, 2019.
