# ยง 48.4061(a)-5   Sale of automobile truck bodies and chassis.

(a) *Sale of completed vehicle.* An automobile truck (as defined by ยง 48.4061(a)-3(a)) for purposes of the tax imposed by section 4061(a) consists of two parts, namely, a body and a chassis. Generally, the tax applies to the sale by the manufacturer of each. Thus, if the purchaser of a tax-paid chassis attaches to it a taxable body manufactured by him and sells the completed vehicle, he is liable for tax based on the sale price of the body only. However, in such a case, the tax attaches to the selling price of the entire vehicle unless adequate records are available to show the portion of the total selling price attributable to the body.


(b) *Cross references.* For special rules relating to the sale of a chassis or body to a purchaser who will use it in the manufacture or assembly of a nonhighway vehicle, see ยง 48.4061(a)-1(e). With respect to bodies sold to a chassis manufacturer, see also section 4063(b) and the regulations thereunder.
