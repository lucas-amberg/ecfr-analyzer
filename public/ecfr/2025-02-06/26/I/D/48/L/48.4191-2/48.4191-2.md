# § 48.4191-2   Taxable medical device.

(a) *Taxable medical device*—(1) *In general.* A taxable medical device is any device, as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), that is intended for humans. For purposes of this section, a device defined in section 201(h) of the FFDCA that is intended for humans means a device that is listed as a device with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under section 510(j) of the FFDCA and 21 CFR part 807, pursuant to FDA requirements.


(2) *Devices that should have been listed with the FDA.* If a device is not listed as a device with the FDA but the FDA determines that the device should have been listed as a device, the device will be deemed to be listed as a device with the FDA as of the date the FDA notifies the manufacturer or importer in writing that corrective action with respect to listing is required.


(b) *Exemptions*—(1) *Specific exemptions.* The term *taxable medical device* does not include eyeglasses, contact lenses, and hearing aids.


(2) *Retail exemption.* The term *taxable medical device* does not include any device of a type that is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use (the retail exemption). A device will be considered to be of a type that is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use if it is regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers who are not medical professionals, and if the design of the device demonstrates that it is not primarily intended for use in a medical institution or office or by a medical professional. Whether a device is of a type described in the preceding sentence is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Factors relevant to this evaluation are enumerated in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Further, there may be facts and circumstances that are relevant in evaluating whether a device is of a type generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use in addition to those described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The determination of whether a device is of a type that qualifies for the retail exemption is made based on the overall balance of factors relevant to the particular type of device. The fact that a device is of a type that requires a prescription is not a factor in the determination of whether or not the device falls under the retail exemption.


(i) *Regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers.* The following factors are relevant in determining whether a device is of a type that is regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers who are not medical professionals:


(A) Whether consumers who are not medical professionals can purchase the device in person, over the telephone, or over the Internet, through retail businesses such as drug stores, supermarkets, or medical supply stores and retailers that primarily sell devices (for example, specialty medical stores, durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) suppliers and similar vendors);


(B) Whether consumers who are not medical professionals can use the device safely and effectively for its intended medical purpose with minimal or no training from a medical professional; and


(C) Whether the device is classified by the FDA under Subpart D of 21 CFR part 890 (Physical Medicine Devices).


(ii) *Primarily for use in a medical institution or office or by a medical professional.* The following factors are relevant in determining whether a device is designed primarily for use in a medical institution or office or by a medical professional:


(A) Whether the device generally must be implanted, inserted, operated, or otherwise administered by a medical professional;


(B) Whether the cost to acquire, maintain, and/or use the device requires a large initial investment and/or ongoing expenditure that is not affordable for the average individual consumer;


(C) Whether the device is a Class III device under the FDA system of classification;


(D) Whether the device is classified by the FDA under—


(*1*) 21 CFR part 862 (Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices), 21 CFR part 864 (Hematology and Pathology Devices), 21 CFR part 866 (Immunology and Microbiology Devices), 21 CFR part 868 (Anesthesiology Devices), 21 CFR part 870 (Cardiovascular Devices), 21 CFR part 874 (Ear, Nose, and Throat Devices), 21 CFR part 876 (Gastroenterology—Urology Devices), 21 CFR part 878 (General and Plastic Surgery Devices), 21 CFR part 882 (Neurological Devices), 21 CFR part 886 (Ophthalmic Devices), 21 CFR part 888 (Orthopedic Devices), or 21 CFR part 892 (Radiology Devices);


(*2*) Subpart B, Subpart D, or Subpart E of 21 CFR part 872 (Dental Devices);


(*3*) Subpart B, Subpart C, Subpart D, Subpart E, or Subpart G of 21 CFR part 884 (Obstetrical and Gynecological Devices); or


(*4*) Subpart B of 21 CFR part 890 (Physical Medicine Devices); and


(E) Whether the device qualifies as durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies for which payment is available exclusively on a rental basis under the Medicare Part B payment rules, and is an “item requiring frequent and substantial servicing” as defined in 42 CFR 414.222.


(iii) *Safe Harbor.* The following devices will be considered to be of a type generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use:


(A) Devices that are included in the FDA's online IVD Home Use Lab Tests (Over-the-Counter Tests) database, available at *http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfIVD/Search.cfm.*

(B) Devices that are described as “OTC” or “over the counter” devices in the relevant FDA classification regulation heading.


(C) Devices that are described as “OTC” or “over the counter” devices in the FDA's product code name, the FDA's device classification name, or the “classification name” field in the FDA's device registration and listing database, available at *http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfrl/rl.cfm.*

(D) Devices that qualify as durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies, as described in Subpart C of 42 CFR part 414 (Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition) and Subpart D of 42 CFR part 414 (Durable Medical Equipment and Prosthetic and Orthotic Devices), for which payment is available on a purchase basis under Medicare Part B payment rules, and are—


(*1*) “Prosthetic and orthotic devices,” as defined in 42 CFR 414.202, that do not require implantation or insertion by a medical professional;


(*2*) “Parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies” as defined in 42 CFR 411.351 and described in 42 CFR 414.102(b);


(*3*) “Customized items,” as described in 42 CFR 414.224;


(*4*) “Therapeutic shoes,” as described in 42 CFR 414.228(c); or


(*5*) Supplies necessary for the effective use of durable medical equipment (DME), as described in section 110.3 of chapter 15 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Studies Publication 100-02).


(iv) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(2).


(c) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies to sales of taxable medical devices on and after January 1, 2013.
