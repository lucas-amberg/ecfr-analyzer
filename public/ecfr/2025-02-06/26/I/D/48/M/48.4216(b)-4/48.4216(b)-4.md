(a) *In general.* Sections 4216(b) (3), (4), and (5) establish procedures for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) for sales between corporations that are members of the same “affiliated group”, as that term is defined in section 1504(a).


(b) *Sales to which section 4216(b)(3) applies.* Section 4216(b)(3), which applies to articles sold after December 31, 1969, provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) in those instances where:


(1) A manufacturer, producer or importer regularly sells a taxable article (other than an article subject to a tax imposed by section 4061(a) (trucks, buses, etc.)) to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producer or importer, and


(2) The wholesale distributor regularly sells such article to one or more independent retailers, but does not regularly sell to wholesale distributors.


(c) *Sales to which section 4216(b)(4) applies.* Section 4216(b)(4), which applies to articles sold after December 31, 1969, provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) in those instances where:


(1) A manufacturer, producer, or importer regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) a taxable article only to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producer, or importer,


(2) The distributor regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) such article only to retail dealers, and


(3) The normal method of sales for such articles within the industry is to sell such articles in arm's-length transactions to wholesale distributors.


(i) The difference between the median price for which comparable articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers of producers thereof, and the median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers, is of


(ii) The median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers.


(d) *Application of section 4216(b)(4).* The application of section 4216(b)(4) and paragraph (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:


(e) *Sales to which section 4216(b)(5) applies.* Section 4216(b)(5), which applies to articles sold after December 31, 1970, provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) in those circumstances where:


(1) A manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article subject to a tax imposed by section 4061(a) (trucks, buses, etc.) regularly sells such article to a wholesale distributor that is a member of the same affiliated group of corporations as the manufacturer, producer, or importer, and


(2) Such distributor regularly sells such articles to independent retail dealers.


(f) *Determination of “lowest price”.* (1) In addition to other considerations, in determining a “lowest price” for purposes of section 4216(b) (1), (3), and (5) and § 48.4216(b)-4(b), and 48.4216(b)-4(e), such price shall be determined:


(i) Without requiring that a given percentage of sales be made at that price (provided that the volume of sales made at that price is great enough to indicate that those sales have not been engaged in primarily to establish a lower tax base), and


(ii) Without including any charge for a fixed amount that the purchaser has an unconditional right to recover on the basis of a contractual arrangement existing at the time of sale.


(2) For purposes of applying section 4216(b)(1) and § 48.4216(b)-2, section 4216(b)(6) and this paragraph apply to articles sold after June 30, 1962. For purposes of applying section 4216(b)(3) and paragraph (b) of this section, section 4216(b)(6) and this paragraph apply to articles sold after December 31, 1969. For purposes of applying section 4216(b)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section, section 4216(b)(6) and this paragraph apply to articles sold after December 31, 1970.


(g) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section and paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of section 4216(b), the term “regularly sells” has the same meaning as that accorded the term “regular sales” in subparagraph (3) of § 48.4216(b)-3(b), and the term “normal method of sales in the industry” has the same meaning as accorded that term in subparagraph (4) of § 48.4216(b)-3(b).
