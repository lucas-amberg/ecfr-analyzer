# ยง 48.4219-1   Sales of taxable articles by a person other than the manufacturer, producer, or importer.

(a) *General rule.* If the title to, or ownership of, an article taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code is transferred from the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, and, under the law, no tax attaches to such transfer, the subsequent sale, lease, or use of such article by the transferee is subject to tax to the same extent and in the same manner as if such transferee were the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the article. The following examples illustrate this rule:


(1) The surviving spouse, child or children, executors or administrators, or other legal representatives, as the case may be, of a deceased manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incur liability for tax on all such articles sold by them.


(2) A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy who under a court order conducts or liquidates the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by him, regardless of whether the articles were manufactured, produced, or imported before or after he took charge of the business.


(3) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs liability for tax with respect to all taxable articles sold by him as such assignee.


(4) If one or more members of a partnership withdraw, or if new partners are admitted, the new partnership so constituted incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by it regardless of when such articles were manufactured, produced, or imported.


(5) A person who acquires title to taxable articles as a result of default of the manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to an agreement under the terms of which the articles were pledged as collateral incurs liability for tax with respect to his sale of the articles so acquired.


(6) A person who succeeds to the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, such as:


(i) A corporation which results from a consolidation, merger, or reorganization;


(ii) A corporation which acquires the business of an individual or partnership; or


(iii) A stockholder in a corporation who, after its dissolution, continues the business;


(b) *Transfer of title to damaged articles.* If title to a damaged taxable article is transferred by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof to a carrier or insurance company in adjustment of a damage claim, such transfer is not considered a taxable sale of the article. If the article is usable, even though damaged, the carrier or insurance company incurs liability for tax on its sale, lease, or use of the article. Where the article has been damaged to the extent that its only value is as scrap, and it is not restored to usable condition, sale thereof by the carrier or insurance company is not subject to tax.
