# § 48.4221-7   Tax-free sales of tires and tubes.

(a) *In general.* A manufacturer of tires or inner tubes that are taxable under section 4071 may sell such articles tax free if the sale meets the conditions prescribed in section 4221(e)(2) and paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section. The following are conditions under which articles taxable under section 4071 may be sold tax free:


(1) The tire or tube is sold for use by the purchaser for sale on or in connection with the sale of another article manufactured or produced by the purchaser; and


(2) The other article is to be sold in a tax-free sale by the purchaser for export, for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, to a State or local government for its exclusive use, or to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use, or the other article is to be sold by the purchaser for any of such purposes in a sale which would be tax-free but for the fact that the other article is not subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code.


(b) *Registration requirements.* In order to effect a tax-free sale under section 4221(e)(2)(A), both the manufacturer and purchaser (except for purchasers who are exempt from the registration requirement under § 48.4222(b)-1) must be registered with the District Director of Internal Revenue as required in § 48.4222(a)-1. At the time of sale, the registration number assigned to the purchaser by the district director together with the purpose for which the article was purchased must be shown on (or attached to) the invoice, purchase order, or other document used for the sale.


(c) *Proof required in support of tax-free sales of tires and tubes*—(1) *Cessation of exemption.* The exemption allowed under section 4221(e)(2)(A) and this section on the sale of a tire or inner tube shall cease to apply unless, within the 6-month period which begins on the date of the tax-free sale by the manufacturer of such article (or, if earlier, on the date of shipment by such manufacturer), the manufacturer receives proof from the purchaser that such article has been used on or in connection with the sale of another article which has been sold for one of the tax-exempt purposes referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the manufacturer has not received the required information within such 6-month period, the temporary suspension of the liability for the payment of the tax ceases, and the manufacturer shall include the tax on the sale of the tire or inner tube in his return for the period in which the 6-month period expires. If the required information is received after the expiration of the 6-month period, the manufacturer may file a claim for credit or refund of tax so paid on his sale of the tire or inner tube.


(2) *Required information.* The information which the manufacturer must receive within the 6-month period, referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall be in substantially the following form:
