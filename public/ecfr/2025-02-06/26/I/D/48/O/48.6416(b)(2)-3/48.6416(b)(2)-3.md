(1) Showing the amount claimed in respect of each category of exportations, uses, sales, or resales on which the claim is based and which give rise to a right of credit or refund under section 6416(b)(2) and § 48.6416(b)(2)-1,


(2) Identifying the article, both as to nature and quantity, in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,

(5) In the case of any overpayment other than an overpayment determined under section 6416(b)(2)(E) and paragraph (f) of § 48.6416(b)(2)-2, indicating that the person claiming a credit or refund possesses evidence (as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that the article has been exported, or has been used, sold, or resold in a manner or for a purpose which gives rise to an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(2) and § 48.6416(b)(2)-2, or


(6) In the case of an overpayment determined under section 6416(b)(2)(E) and paragraph (f) of § 48.6416(b)(2)-2, relating to a tax-paid tire or inner tube sold on or in connection with, or with the sale of, a second article that has been manufactured, indicating that the person claiming credit or refund possesses (i) evidence (as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) that the second article has been exported, or has been used or sold as provided in § 48.6416(b)(2)-2(f), and (ii) a statement, executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the tire or inner tube, that the ultimate purchaser purchased the tire or inner tube from a person other than the person who paid the tax on the sale of the tire or inner tube.


(b) *Evidence required to be in possession of claimant*—(1) *Evidence required under paragraph (a)(5)*—(i) *In general.* The evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, must, in the case of an article exported, consist of proof of exportation in the form prescribed in the regulations under section 4221 or must, in the case of other articles sold tax-paid by that person, consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the article, in the form prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. However, if the article to which the claim relates has passed through a chain of sales from the person who paid the tax to the ultimate purchaser, the evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax may consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate vendor of the article, in the form provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, rather than the proof of exportation itself or the certificate of the ultimate purchaser.


(ii) *Certificate of ultimate purchaser.*

(A) The certificate executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the article to which the claim relates must identify the article, both as to nature and quantity; show the address of the ultimate purchaser of the article, and the name and address of the ultimate vendor of the article; and describe the use actually made of the article in sufficient detail to establish that credit or refund is due, except that the use to be made of the article must be described in lieu of actual use if the claim is made by reason of the sale or resale of an article for a specified use which gives rise to the overpayment.


(B) If the certificate sets forth the use to be made of any article, rather than its actual use, it must show that the ultimate purchaser has agreed to notify the claimant if the article is not in fact used as specified in the certificate.


(C) The certificate must also contain a statement that the ultimate purchaser understands that the ultimate purchaser and any other party may, for fraudulent use of the certificate, be subject under section 7201 to a fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.


(D) A purchase order will be acceptable in lieu of a separate certificate of the ultimate purchaser if it contains all the information required by this paragraph (b)(1)(ii).


(iii) *Certificate of ultimate vendor.* Any certificate executed and signed by an ultimate vendor as evidence to be retained by the person who paid the tax, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, may be executed with respect to any one or more overpayments by the person which arose under section 6416(b)(2) and §§ 48.6416(b)(2)-2 by reason of exportations, uses, sales or resales, occurring within any period of not more than 12 consecutive calendar quarters, the beginning and ending dates of which are specified in the certificate.


The certificate must be in substantially the following form:


(2) *Evidence required under paragraph (a)(6)*—(i) *In general—* The evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax, as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must, in the case of an exportation of the second article, consist of proof of exportation of the second article in the form prescribed in the regulations under section 4221 or must, in other cases, consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the second article, in the form prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. However, the evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax may consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate vendor of the second article, in the form provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, rather than the proof of exportation itself or the certificate of the ultimate purchaser.


(ii) *Certificate of ultimate purchaser—* The certificate of the ultimate purchaser of the second article must contain the same information as that required in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, except that the information must be furnished in respect of the second article, rather than the article to which the claims relates.


(iii) *Certificate of ultimate vendor—* Any certificate executed and signed by an ultimate vendor as evidence to be retained by the person who paid the tax, as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, may be executed with respect to any one of more overpayments by that person which arose under section 6416(b)(2)(E) and § 48.6416(b)(2)-2 (f) by reason of exportations, uses, sales, or resales of a second article occurring within any period of not more than 12 consecutive calendar quarters, the beginning and ending dates of which are specified in the certificate. The certificate must be in substantially the following form:


(3) *Repayment or consent of ultimate vendor.* If the person claiming credit or refund of an overpayment to which this section applies has repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the overpayment to the ultimate vendor or if the ultimate vendor consents to the allowance of the credit or refund, a statement to that effect, signed by the ultimate vendor, must be shown on, or made a part of, the evidence required under this section to be retained by the person claiming the credit or refund. In this regard, see § 48.6416(a)-3(b)(2).
