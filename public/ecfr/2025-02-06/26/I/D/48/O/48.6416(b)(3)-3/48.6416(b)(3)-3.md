(3) Identifying the article, both as to nature and quantity, in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,


(4) Showing the amount of tax paid in respect of the article by the manufacturer or producer of the article and the date of payment,


(5) Indicating that the article was used by the claimant as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the manufacturer or was sold on or in connection with, or with the sale of, a second article manufactured or produced by the manufacturer,

(7) In the case of an overpayment determined under section 6416(b)(3)(C) as it existed prior to January 1, 1984, and paragraph (d)(1) of § 48.6416(b)(3)-2 in respect of a tire or inner tube taxable under section 4071, indicating that the manufacturer has evidence available (as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section) that the second article is an automobile bus chassis or automobile bus body, or has been exported, used, or sold as provided in section 6416(b)(3)(C)(ii) and § 48.6416(b)(3)-2(d)(1)(ii).


(b) *Evidence required to be in possession of claimant*—(1) *In general.* The evidence required to be retained by the person claiming credit or refund, as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, must, in the case of an exportation of the second article, consist of proof of exportation of the second article in the form prescribed in the regulations under section 4221, or must, in other cases (except when the second article is an automobile bus chassis or automobile bus body), consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the second article, in the form prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, if the second article has passed through a chain of sales from the manufacturer of the second article to the ultimate purchaser of the second article, the evidence may consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate vendor of the second article, in the form provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, rather than the proof of exportation itself of the second article or the certificate of the ultimate purchaser of the second article.


(2) *Certificate of ultimate purchaser of second article.* The certificate executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the second article must contain the same information as that required in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of § 48.6416(b)(2)-3, except that the information must be furnished in respect of the second article, rather than the article to which the claim relates.


(3) *Certificate of ultimate vendor of second article.* Any certificate executed and signed by an ultimate vendor as evidence to be retained by the person claiming credit or refund must be executed in the same form and manner as that provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) and § 48.6416(b)(2)-3.


(4) *Repayment or consent of ultimate vendor.* If the person claiming credit or refund of an overpayment to which this section applies has repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the overpayment to the ultimate vendor or if the ultimate vendor consents to the allowance of the credit or refund, a statement to that effect, signed by the ultimate vendor, must be shown on, or made a part of, the evidence required to be retained by the person claiming the credit or refund. In this regard, see § 48.6416(a)-3(b)(2).
