# § 48.6416(b)(5)-1   Return of installment accounts causing overpayments of tax.

(a) *In general.* In the case of any payment of tax under section 4216(d)(1) in respect of the sale of any installment account that is determined to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(5) and paragraph (b) of this section upon return of the installment account, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which that person subsequently files. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund under this section, see § 301.6402-2 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) and paragraph (c) of this section. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) and § 48.6416(f)-1.


(b) *Overpayment of tax allocable to repaid consideration.* The payment of tax imposed by section 4216(d)(1) on the sale of an installment account by the manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(5) to the extent of the tax allocable to any consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser of the installment account upon the return of the account to the manufacturer pursuant to the agreement under which the account originally was sold, if the readjustment of the consideration occurs pursuant to the provisions of the agreement. The tax allocable to the repaid or credited consideration is the amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax paid under section 4216(d)(1) with respect to the installment account as the amount of consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser bears to the total consideration for which the account was sold. This paragraph (b) does not apply where an installment account is originally sold pursuant to the order of, or subject to the approval of, a court of competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.


(c) *Evidence to be submitted by claimant.* No claim for credit of refund of an overpayment, within the meaning of section 6416(b)(5) and paragraph (b) of this section, of tax under section 4216(d)(1) shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a statement supported by sufficient available evidence, indicating—


(1) The name and address of the person to whom the installment account was sold,


(2) The amount of tax due under section 4216(d)(1) by reason of the sale of the installment account, the amount of the tax paid under section 4216(d)(1) with respect to the sale, and the date of payment,


(3) The amount for which the installment account was sold,


(4) The amount which was repaid or credited to the purchaser of the account by reason of the return of the account to the person claiming the credit or refund, and


(5)(i) The fact that the amount repaid or credited to the purchaser of the account was so repaid or credited pursuant to the agreement under which the account was sold, and


(ii) The fact that the account was returned to the manufacturer pursuant to that agreement.
