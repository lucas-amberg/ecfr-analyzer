# § 48.6420-2   Time for filing claim for credit or payment.

(a) *In general.* A claim for credit or payment described in § 48.6420-1 with respect to gasoline used after June 30, 1965, on a farm for farming purposes, shall cover only gasoline used during the taxable year on a farm for farming purposes. Therefore, gasoline on hand at the end of a taxable year as, for example, in fuel supply tanks of farm machinery or in storage tanks or drums, must be excluded from a claim filed for that taxable year (but may be included in a claim filed for a later taxable year if used during that later year on a farm for farming purposes). Gasoline used during a taxable year may be covered by a claim filed for that taxable year although the gasoline was not paid for at the time the claim is filed. For purposes of applying this section, a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6420-1 (c) is considered to have as its taxable year, the calendar year or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books; see paragraph (h) of this section.


(b) *Time for filing.* (1) A claim for credit with respect to gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes shall not be allowed unless it is filed no later than the time prescribed by section 6511 and the regulations thereunder for filing a claim for credit or refund of income tax for the particular taxable year.


(2) A claim for payment of a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6420-1(c) must be filed no later than 3 years following the close of its taxable year. (See paragraph (h) of this section.)


(3) See § 301.7502-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) for provisions treating timely mailing as timely filing and § 301.7502-1 of this chapter for time for performance of an act where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday.


(c) *Limit of one claim per taxable year.* Not more than one claim may be filed under section 6420 by any person with respect to gasoline used during the same taxable year.


(d) *Form and content of claim*—(1) *Claim for credit.* (i) The claim for credit with respect to gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes must be made by attaching a Form 4136 to the income tax return of an individual or a corporation. Form 4136 must be executed in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. A partnership may not file Form 4136. When a partnership files Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of Income, it must include a statement showing how many gallons of gasoline are allocated to each partner and the use made of the gasoline.


(ii) If an individual dies during the taxable year, the claim for credit may be made only for that portion of the individual's taxable year ending with the date of death. If a sole proprietorship, a partnership or corporation is terminated or liquidated during the taxable year, the claim for credit may be made only for the portion of its year ending with the date of the termination or liquidation.


(2) *Claim for payment.* The claim for payment with respect to gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes by a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6420-1(c) must be made on Form 843 in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. The claim by such a unit or organization must be filed with the service center for the internal revenue region in which the principal place of business or principal office of the claimant is located.
