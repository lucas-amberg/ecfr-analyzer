Claims relating to kerosene sold for use on a farm for farming purposes and by a State are made by registered ultimate vendors under § 48.6427-9; claims relating to kerosene sold from a blocked pump for nontaxable uses are made by registered ultimate vendors (blocked pump) under § 48.6427-10; and other claims relating to kerosene used for nontaxable purposes are made by ultimate purchasers under § 48.6427-8. 


(b) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply to this section:
