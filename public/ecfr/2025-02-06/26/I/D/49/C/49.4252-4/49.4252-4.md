# § 49.4252-4   Provisions common to telephone and telegraph services.

(a) *In general.* The tax applies to all amounts paid for services rendered which are incidental to the transmission of a message or conversation. Where dispatches, messages, or conversations are transmitted by telephone, radio telephone, telegraph, cable, or radio free of any charge whatsoever, no tax attaches, but where the carrier in fact makes some charge for the transmission, either in money, service, or other valuable consideration, such charge is subject to the tax upon the basis of the amount of the charge computed in money or money's worth. The tax is payable by the person paying the transmission charge and is to be collected by the person receiving the payment. If a message, dispatch, or conversation is transmitted “collect”, the person who pays the charge therefor is liable for the tax. All telephone and telegraph transmission services when rendered for hire are subject to tax whether or not the agency furnishing such services is a common carrier. For provisions relating to the computation of tax with respect to charges for telephone and telegraph services, see section 4254 and §§ 49.4254-1 and 49.4254-2.


(b) *When transmission begins and ends.* Transmission begins when the message is delivered by the sender to the carrier, or its agent, and continues until receipt by the addressee or his agent. Thus, an amount paid to a telephone, telegraph, radio, or cable company for messenger service in bringing the recipient of a message to the telephone, or in delivering a dispatch or message, must be included in determining the total amount subject to tax. However, an amount paid for messenger service rendered by a hotel or similar establishment is not to be included in the total charge on which the tax is computed.


(c) *Services rendered under contract.* (1) Except as an exemption may otherwise be specifically provided for in this part, where, under the provisions of a contract, dispatches, messages, or conversations are transmitted by telephone, radio telephone, telegraph, cable, or radio in consideration of the payment of a lump sum of money or the performance of services, the amounts paid for such transmissions are subject to tax regardless of whether such dispatches, messages, or conversations relate to the operation of the business of a common carrier and whether they are “on line” or “off line”.


(2) Where a telegraph company agrees to transmit over its wires dispatches or messages relating to the business of a carrier free or at reduced rates in consideration of services to be performed by the carrier in transporting men or materials of the telegraph company, all such dispatches or messages are subject to tax.


(d) *Meaning of the term “United States”.* For purpose of section 4252 (b) and (c), the term “United States” includes the States and the District of Columbia. Such term also includes inland waters (such as rivers, lakes, bays, etc.) lying wholly within the United States, and, where an international boundary line divides inland waters, such parts of such inland waters as lie within the boundary of the United States, and also the waters known as a marine league from low tide on the coast line. Ships within these limits whether of foreign or domestic registry are considered to be within the United States.


(e) *Exemptions.* For exemptions from the taxes imposed on amounts paid for telephone and telegraph services, see sections 4253, 4292, 4293, and 4294, and the regulations thereunder contained in this part.
