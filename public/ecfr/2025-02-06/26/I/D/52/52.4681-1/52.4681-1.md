# § 52.4681-1   Taxes imposed with respect to ozone-depleting chemicals.

(a) *Taxes imposed.* Sections 4681 and 4682 impose the following taxes with respect to ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs):


(1) *Tax on ODCs.* Section 4681(a)(1) imposes a tax on ODCs that are sold or used by the manufacturer or importer thereof. Except as otherwise provided in § 52.4682-1 (relating to the tax on ODCs), the amount of the tax is equal to the product of—


(i) The weight (in pounds) of the ODC;


(ii) The base tax amount (determined under section 4681(b)(1) (B) or (C)) for the calendar year in which the sale or use occurs; and


(iii) The ozone-depletion factor (determined under section 4682(b)) for the ODC.


(2) *Tax on imported taxable products.* Section 4681(a)(2) imposes a tax on imported taxable products that are sold or used by the importer thereof. Except as otherwise provided in § 52.4682-3 (relating to the tax on imported taxable products), the tax is computed by reference to the weight of the ODCs used as materials in the manufacture of the product. The amount of tax is equal to the tax that would have been imposed on the ODCs under section 4681(a)(1) if the ODCs had been sold in the United States on the date of the sale or use of the imported product. The weight of such ODCs is determined under § 52.4682-3.


(3) *Floor stocks tax*—(i) *Imposition of tax.* Section 4682(h) imposes a floor stocks tax on ODCs that—


(A) Are held by any person other than the manufacturer or importer of the ODC on a date specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section; and


(B) Are held on such date for sale or for use in further manufacture.


(ii) Dates on which tax imposed. The floor stocks tax is imposed on January 1 of each calendar year after 1989.


(iii) *Amount of tax.* Except as otherwise provided in § 52.4682-4 (relating to the floor stocks tax), the amount of the floor stocks tax is equal to the excess of—


(A) The tax that would be imposed on the ODC under section 4681(a)(1) if a sale or use of the ODC by its manufacturer or importer occurred on the date the floor stocks tax is imposed (the tentative tax amount), over


(B) The sum of the taxes previously imposed (if any) on the ODC under sections 4681 and 4682.
