# § 52.4682-4   Floor stocks tax.

(a) *Overview.* This section provides rules for identifying ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs) that are subject to the floor stocks tax imposed by section 4682(h)(1), determining the person that is liable for the tax, and computing the amount of the tax. See § 52.4681-1(a)(3) and (c) for general rules and definitions relating to the floor stocks tax.


(b) *Identifying rules*—(1) *ODCs subject to floor stocks tax; ODCs held for sale or for use in further manufacture*—(i) *In general.* The floor stocks tax is imposed only on an ODC that is held for sale or for use in further manufacture on the date the tax is imposed. This paragraph (b)(1) provides rules for identifying ODCs held for sale or for use in further manufacture.


(ii) *Held for sale*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of determining whether an ODC is held for sale, the term *sale* shall have the meaning set forth in § 52.4681-1(c)(6). ODCs held for sale include ODCs that will be sold in connection with the provision of services or in connection with the sale of a manufactured article and, in such cases, include ODCs that will be sold without the statement of a separate charge for those ODCs.


(B) *ODCs held by a government.* An ODC that is held by a government for its own use is not held for sale even if the ODC will be transferred between agencies or other subdivisions that have or are required to have different employer identification numbers.


(iii) *Held for use in further manufacture.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, an ODC is held for use in further manufacture if—


(A) The ODC will be used as a material (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section) in the manufacture of an article; and


(B) Such article will be held for sale.


(iv) *Use as material*—(A) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, an ODC will be used as a material in the manufacture of an article if the ODC will be—


(*1*) Incorporated into the article; or


(*2*) Released into the atmosphere in the process of manufacturing the article.


(B) *ODCs used in equipment.* For purposes of the floor stocks tax, an ODC is not used as a material in the manufacture of an article if the ODC is (or will be) contained in equipment used in such manufacture and the ODC will be used for its intended purpose without being released from such equipment. Thus, ODCs that are (or will be) used as coolants in a factory's air-conditioning system are not used as materials in the manufacture of articles produced in the factory.


(v) *Storage containers.* The floor stocks tax is imposed on an ODC without regard to the type or size of the storage container in which the ODC is held. Thus, the tax may apply to an ODC whether it is in a 14-ounce can or a 30-pound tank.


(vi) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph (b)(1) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(2)(i) *Mixtures*—(A) *Tax imposed on January 1, 1990.* In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January l, 1990, the tax is not imposed on an ODC that has been mixed with any other ingredients.


(B) *Taxes imposed after 1990*—(*1*) *In general.* In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1 of a calendar year after 1990, the tax is not imposed on an ODC that has been mixed with any other ingredients, but only if it is established that such ingredients contribute to the accomplishment of the purpose for which the mixture will be used. A mixture is not exempt from tax under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B), however, if it contains only an ODC and an inert ingredient that does not contribute to the accomplishment of the purpose for which the mixture will be used.


(*2*) *Exception.* In the case of a floor stocks tax imposed on or after January 1, 1992, a mixture is not exempt from floor stocks tax under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) if it contains only ODCs and one or more stabilizers. For this purpose, the term *stabilizer* means an ingredient needed to maintain the chemical integrity of the ODC.


(C) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(ii) *Manufactured articles.* The floor stocks tax is not imposed on an ODC that is contained in a manufactured article in which the ODC will be used for its intended purpose without being released from such article. For example, the tax is not imposed on the ODCs contained in the cooling coils of a refrigerator even if the refrigerator is held for sale. However, the tax is imposed on a can of ODC used to recharge an air conditioning unit because the ODC must be expelled from the can in order to be used. Similarly, beginning in 1991, the tax is imposed on Halons contained in a fire extinguisher held for sale because such ODCs must be expelled from the fire extinguisher in order to be used.


(iii) *Recycled ODCs.* The floor stocks tax is not imposed on ODCs that have been reclaimed or recycled. For example, the tax is not imposed on an ODC that is held for use in further manufacture after being used as a solvent and recycled.


(iv) *ODCs held by the manufacturer or importer.* The floor stocks tax is not imposed on ODCs held by their manufacturer or importer.


(v) *ODCs used as a feedstock*—(A) *In general.* The floor stocks tax is not imposed on any ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for use as a feedstock (as defined in § 52.4682-1(c)).


(B) *Post-1989 ODCs sold before January 1, 1990; post-1990 ODCs sold before January 1, 1991.* A post-1989 ODC that was sold by its manufacturer or importer before January 1, 1990, or a post-1990 ODC that was sold by its manufacturer or importer before January 1, 1991, shall be treated, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(v), as an ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for purposes of § 52.4682-1(c) if the ODC will be used as a feedstock (within the meaning of § 52.4682-2(c)(3)).


(vi) *ODCs to be exported*—(A) *In general.* The floor stocks tax is not imposed on any ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for export (as defined in § 52.4682-5(d)(1)).


(B) *ODCs sold before January 1, 1993.* An ODC that was sold by its manufacturer or importer before January 1, 1993, is treated, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(vi), as an ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for export for purposes of § 52.4682-5(d)(1) if the ODC will be exported.


(vii) *ODCs used as propellants in metered-dose inhalers; years after 1992*—(A) *In general.* The floor stocks tax is not imposed on January 1 of calendar years after 1992 on any ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for use as a propellant in a metered-dose inhaler (as defined in § 52.4682-1(h)).


(B) *ODCs sold before January 1, 1993.* An ODC that was sold by its manufacturer or importer before January 1, 1993, is treated, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(vii), as an ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for purposes of § 52.4682-1(h) if the ODC will be used as a propellant in a metered-dose inhaler (within the meaning of § 52.4682-1(h)).


(viii) *ODCs used as medical sterilants; 1993.* The floor stocks tax is not imposed in 1993 on any ODC held for use as a medical sterilant (as defined in § 52.4682-1(g)).


(c) *Person liable for tax*—(1) *In general.* The person liable for the floor stocks tax on an ODC is the person that holds the ODC on a date on which the tax is imposed. The person who holds the ODC is the person who has title to the ODC (whether or not delivery to such person has been made) as of the first moment of such date. The person who has title at such time is determined under applicable local law.


(2) *Special rule.* Each business unit that has, or is required to have, its own employer identification number is treated as a separate person for purposes of the floor stocks tax. For example, a chain of automotive parts stores that has one employer identification number is one person for purposes of the floor stocks tax, and a parent corporation and subsidiary corporation that each have a different employer identification number are two persons for purposes of the floor stocks tax. 


(d) *Computation of tax; tentative tax amount*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Generally applicable rules.* This paragraph (d) provides rules for determining the tentative tax amount and the amount of the floor stocks tax. Section 52.4681-1(a)(3) provides that the amount of the floor stocks tax on an ODC is determined by reference to a tentative tax amount. The tentative tax amount is the amount of tax that would be imposed on the ODC under section 4681(a)(1) if a sale of the ODC by the manufacturer or importer had occurred on the date the floor stocks tax is imposed. The amount of the floor stocks tax imposed on the ODCs contained in a nonexempt mixture is computed on the basis of the weight of the ODCs in that mixture.


(ii) *Floor stocks tax imposed on post-1989 ODCs on January 1, 1990.* The floor stocks tax imposed on post-1989 ODCs (as defined in § 52.4681-1(c)(9)) on January 1, 1990, is equal to the tentative tax amount. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for rules relating to the floor stocks tax imposed on ODCs used in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation. See paragraph (d)(3) of this section for rules relating to the floor stocks tax imposed on Halons.


(iii) *Floor stocks tax imposed on post-1990 ODCs on January 1, 1991.* The floor stocks tax imposed on post-1990 ODCs (as defined in § 52.4681-1(c)(9)) on January 1, 1991, is equal to the tentative tax amount.


(iv) *Other floor stocks taxes*—(A) *In general.* The following rules apply for floor stocks taxes imposed on post-1989 ODCs after January 1, 1990, and on post-1990 ODCs after January 1, 1991:


(*1*) The tentative tax amount is determined, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, by reference to the rate of tax prescribed in section 4681(b)(1)(B) and the ozone-depletion factors prescribed in section 4682(b).


(*2*) The amount of the floor stocks tax on an ODC is equal to the amount by which the tentative tax amount exceeds the amount of taxes previously imposed on the ODC.


(B) *Example.* The application of this paragraph (d)(1)(iv) may be illustrated by the following example:


(2) *ODCs used in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation; 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993*—(i) *In general.* In the case of an ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for purposes of § 52.4682-1(d) (relating to use in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation) the tentative tax amount is determined under section 4682(g) for purposes of computing the floor stocks tax imposed on the ODC on January 1, 1990, 1991, 1992 or 1993. For purposes of computing the floor stocks tax imposed on the ODC on January 1, 1990, the tentative tax amount is zero. The floor stocks tax is not imposed on ODCs for use in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation in 1992 and 1993.


(ii) *Post-1989 ODCs sold before January 1, 1990; post-1990 ODCs sold before January 1, 1991.* A post-1989 ODC that was sold by its manufacturer or importer before January 1, 1990, or a post-1990 ODC that was sold by its manufacturer or importer before January 1, 1991, shall be treated, for purposes of paragraphs (d)(2) and (e) of this section, as an ODC that was sold in a qualifying sale for purposes of § 52.4682-1(d) if the ODC wi11 be used in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation (within the meaning of §§ 52.4682-1(d) (3) and (4)).


(3) *Halons; 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993.* In the case of Halon-1211, Halon-1301, or Halon-2402 (Halons), the tentative tax amount is determined under section 4682(g) for purposes of computing the floor stocks tax imposed on Halons on January 1, 1990, 1991, 1992, or 1993. For purposes of computing the floor stocks tax imposed on Halons on January 1, 1990, the tentative tax amount is zero. The floor stocks tax is not imposed on Halons in 1992 and 1993.


(4) *Methyl chloroform; 1993.* In the case of methyl chloroform, the tentative tax amount is determined under section 4682(g)(5) for purposes of computing the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1993.


(e) *De minimis exception*—(1) *1990 and 1992.* In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1990 or 1992, a person is liable for the tax only if, on the date the tax is imposed, the person holds at least 400 pounds of post-1989 ODCs that are not described in paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax.


(2) *1991.* In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1991, a person is liable for the tax only if, on such date, the person holds at least 400 pounds of ODCs subject to the 1991 floor stocks tax. For this purpose, ODCs subject to the 1991 floor stocks tax are—


(i) Post-1990 ODCs that are subject to tax; and


(ii) Post-1989 ODCs that are described in paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax.


(3) *1993.* In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1993, a person is liable for the tax only if, on such date, the person holds at least 400 pounds of ODCs that are not described in paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax.


(4) *1994.* In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1994, a person is liable for the tax only if, on such date, the person holds—


(i) At least 400 pounds of ODCs that are not described in paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax;


(ii) At least 200 pounds of ODCs that are described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax; or


(iii) At least 20 pounds of ODCs that are described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax.


(5) *Calendar years after 1994.* In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1 of 1995 and each following calendar year, a person is liable for the tax only if, on such date, the person holds—


(i) At least 400 pounds of ODCs that are not described in paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax;


(ii) At least 50 pounds of ODCs that are described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax; or


(iii) At least 1000 pounds of ODCs that are described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and are otherwise subject to tax.


(6) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(f) *Inventory*—(1) *In general.* If, on the date on which the floor stocks tax is imposed, a person holds ODCs for sale or for use in further manufacture and the ODCs were not manufactured or imported by such person, the following rules apply:


(i) The person shall prepare an inventory of all such ODCs that the person holds on the date on which the tax is imposed.


(ii) The inventory shall be taken as of the first moment of the date on which the tax is imposed, but work-back or work-forward inventories will be acceptable if supported by adequate commercial records of receipt, use, and disposition of ODCs held for sale or for use in further manufacture.


(iii) The person must maintain records of the inventory and make such records available for inspection and copying by internal revenue agents and officers. Records of the inventory are not to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service.


(2) *Circumstances in which an inventory is not required.* The inventory requirement of paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply to any person holding, on a date on which floor stocks tax is imposed, only ODCs that are not subject to tax by reason of a statutory exemption (e.g., use as a feedstock) or regulatory exclusion other than the *de minimis* exception provided by paragraph (e) of this section (e.g., mixtures). In addition, any person that holds ODCs subject to the floor stocks tax and also holds ODCs that are nontaxable under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is not required to inventory the nontaxable ODCs. However, any person that holds any ODCs that either are subject to the floor stocks tax or would be subject to the floor stocks tax but for the *de minimis* exception must inventory those ODCs.


(3) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (f) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(g) *Time for paying tax.* The floor stocks tax imposed under section 4682(h) shall be paid without assessment or notice. In the case of the floor stocks tax imposed on January 1, 1990, the tax shall be paid by April 1, 1990. In the case of floor stocks taxes imposed after January 1, 1990, the tax shall be paid by June 30 of the year in which the tax is imposed.
