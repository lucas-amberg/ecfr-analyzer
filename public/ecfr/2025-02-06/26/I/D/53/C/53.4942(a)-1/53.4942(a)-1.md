# § 53.4942(a)-1   Taxes for failure to distribute income.

(a) *Imposition of tax*—(1) *Initial tax.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, section 4942(a) imposes an excise tax of 15 percent on the undistributed income (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 53.4942(a)-2) of a private foundation for any taxable year which has not been distributed before the first day of the second (or any succeeding) taxable year following such taxable year (if such first day falls within the taxable period as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section). For purposes of section 4942 and this section, the term *distributed* means distributed as qualifying distributions under section 4942(g). See paragraph (d)(2) of § 53.4942(a)-3 with respect to correction of deficient distributions for prior taxable years.


(2) *Additional tax.* In any case in which an initial excise tax is imposed by section 4942(a) on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, section 4942(b) imposes an additional excise tax on any portion of such income remaining undistributed at the close of the correction period (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section). The tax imposed by section 4942(b) is equal to 100 percent of the amount remaining undistributed at the close of the taxable period.


(3) *Payment of tax.* Payment of the excise taxes imposed by section 4942 (a) or (b) is in addition to, and not in lieu of, making the distribution of such undistributed income as required by section 4942. See section 507(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Exceptions*—(1) *In general.* The initial excise tax imposed by section 4942(a) shall not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation:


(i) For any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation (as defined in section 4942(j)(3) and the regulations thereunder), or


(ii) To the extent that the foundation failed to distribute any amount solely because of incorrect valuation of assets under paragraph (c)(4) of § 53.4942(a)-2, if:


(*a*) The failure to value the assets properly was not willful and was due to reasonable cause,


(*b*) Such amount is distributed as qualifying distributions (within the meaning of paragraph (a) of § 53.4942 (a)-3) by the foundation during the allowable distribution period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section),


(*c*) The foundation notifies the Commissioner that such amount has been distributed (within the meaning of subdivision (ii)(*b*) of this subparagraph) to correct such failure, and


(*d*) Such distribution is treated under paragraph (d)(2) of § 53.4942(a)-3 as made out of the undistributed income for the taxable year for which a tax would (except for this subdivision) have been imposed by section 4942(a). 


(2) *Improper valuation.* For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, failure to value an asset properly shall be regarded as “not willful” and “due to reasonable cause” whenever, under all the facts and circumstances, the foundation can show that it has made all reasonable efforts in good faith to value such an asset in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of § 53.4942(a)-2. If a foundation, after full disclosure of the factual situation, obtains a bona fide appraisal of the fair market value of an asset by a person qualified to make such an appraisal (whether or not such a person is a disqualified person with respect to the foundation), and such foundation relies upon such appraisal, then failure to value the asset properly shall ordinarily be regarded as “not willful” and “due to reasonable cause”. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the failure to obtain such a bona fide appraisal shall not, by itself, give rise to any inference that a foundation's failure to value an asset properly was willful or not due to reasonable cause.


(3) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Certain periods.* For purposes of this section—


(1) *Taxable period.* (i) The term “taxable period” means, with respect to the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, the period beginning with the first day of the taxable year and ending on the earlier of:


(A) The date of mailing of a notice of deficiency under section 6212(a) with respect to the initial excise tax imposed under section 4942(a), or


(B) The date on which the initial excise tax imposed under section 4942(a) is assessed.


(ii) Where a notice of deficiency referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is not mailed because there is a waiver of the restrictions on assessment and collection of a deficiency, or because the deficiency is paid, the date of filing of the waiver or the date of such payment, respectively, shall be treated as the end of the taxable period.


(2) *Allowable distribution period.* (i) The term “allowable distribution period” means the period beginning with the first day of the first taxable year following the taxable year in which the incorrect valuation of foundation assets (described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) occurred and ending 90 days after the date of mailing of a notice of deficiency under section 6212(a) with respect to the initial excise tax imposed by section 4942(a). This period shall be extended by any period in which a deficiency cannot be assessed under section 6213(a), and any other period which the Commissioner determines is reasonable and necessary to permit a distribution of undistributed income under section 4942.


(ii) Where a notice of deficiency referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is not mailed because there is a waiver of the restrictions on assessment and collection of a deficiency, or because the deficiency is paid, the date of filing of the waiver or the date of such payment, respectively, shall be treated as the end of the allowable distribution period.


(3) *Cross reference.* For rules relating to taxable events that are corrected within the correction period, defined in section 4963(e), see section 4961 (a) and the regulations thereunder.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Effective date.* Except as otherwise specifically provided, section 4942 and the regulations thereunder shall only apply with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.
