# § 53.4958-3   Definition of disqualified person.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Scope of definition.* Section 4958(f)(1) defines *disqualified person,* with respect to any transaction, as any person who was in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of an applicable tax-exempt organization at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the transaction (the lookback period). Paragraph (b) of this section describes persons who are defined to be disqualified persons under the statute, including certain family members of an individual in a position to exercise substantial influence, and certain 35-percent controlled entities. Paragraph (c) of this section describes persons in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of an applicable tax-exempt organization by virtue of their powers and responsibilities or certain interests they hold. Paragraph (d) of this section describes persons deemed not to be in a position to exercise substantial influence. Whether any person who is not described in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section is a disqualified person with respect to a transaction for purposes of section 4958 is based on all relevant facts and circumstances, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section describes special rules for affiliated organizations. Examples in paragraph (g) of this section illustrate these categories of persons. 


(2) *Transition rule for lookback period.* In the case of any excess benefit transaction occurring before September 14, 2000, the lookback period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section begins on September 14, 1995, and ends on the date of the transaction. 


(b) *Statutory categories of disqualified persons*—(1) *Family members.* A person is a disqualified person with respect to any transaction with an applicable tax-exempt organization if the person is a member of the family of a person who is a disqualified person described in paragraph (a) of this section (other than as a result of this paragraph) with respect to any transaction with the same organization. For purposes of the following sentence, a legally adopted child of an individual is treated as a child of such individual by blood. A person's family is limited to— 


(i) Spouse; 


(ii) Brothers or sisters (by whole or half blood); 


(iii) Spouses of brothers or sisters (by whole or half blood); 


(iv) Ancestors; 


(v) Children; 


(vi) Grandchildren; 


(vii) Great grandchildren; and 


(viii) Spouses of children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. 


(2) *Thirty-five percent controlled entities*—(i) *In general.* A person is a disqualified person with respect to any transaction with an applicable tax-exempt organization if the person is a 35-percent controlled entity. A 35-percent controlled entity is— 


(A) A corporation in which persons described in this section (except in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section) own more than 35 percent of the combined voting power; 


(B) A partnership in which persons described in this section (except in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section) own more than 35 percent of the profits interest; or 


(C) A trust or estate in which persons described in this section (except in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section) own more than 35 percent of the beneficial interest. 


(ii) *Combined voting power.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), combined voting power includes voting power represented by holdings of voting stock, direct or indirect, but does not include voting rights held only as a director, trustee, or other fiduciary. 


(iii) *Constructive ownership rules*—(A) *Stockholdings.* For purposes of section 4958(f)(3) and this paragraph (b)(2), indirect stockholdings are taken into account as under section 267(c), except that in applying section 267(c)(4), the family of an individual shall include the members of the family specified in section 4958(f)(4) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 


(B) *Profits or beneficial interest.* For purposes of section 4958(f)(3) and this paragraph (b)(2), the ownership of profits or beneficial interests shall be determined in accordance with the rules for constructive ownership of stock provided in section 267(c) (other than section 267(c)(3)), except that in applying section 267(c)(4), the family of an individual shall include the members of the family specified in section 4958(f)(4) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 


(c) *Persons having substantial influence.* A person who holds any of the following powers, responsibilities, or interests is in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of an applicable tax-exempt organization: 


(1) *Voting members of the governing body.* This category includes any individual serving on the governing body of the organization who is entitled to vote on any matter over which the governing body has authority. 


(2) *Presidents, chief executive officers, or chief operating officers.* This category includes any person who, regardless of title, has ultimate responsibility for implementing the decisions of the governing body or for supervising the management, administration, or operation of the organization. A person who serves as president, chief executive officer, or chief operating officer has this ultimate responsibility unless the person demonstrates otherwise. If this ultimate responsibility resides with two or more individuals (e.g., co-presidents), who may exercise such responsibility in concert or individually, then each individual is in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the organization. 


(3) *Treasurers and chief financial officers.* This category includes any person who, regardless of title, has ultimate responsibility for managing the finances of the organization. A person who serves as treasurer or chief financial officer has this ultimate responsibility unless the person demonstrates otherwise. If this ultimate responsibility resides with two or more individuals who may exercise the responsibility in concert or individually, then each individual is in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the organization. 


(4) *Persons with a material financial interest in a provider-sponsored organization.* For purposes of section 4958, if a hospital that participates in a provider-sponsored organization (as defined in section 1855(e) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395w-25) is an applicable tax-exempt organization, then any person with a material financial interest (within the meaning of section 501(o)) in the provider-sponsored organization has substantial influence with respect to the hospital. 


(d) *Persons deemed not to have substantial influence.* A person is deemed not to be in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of an applicable tax-exempt organization if that person is described in one of the following categories: 


(1) *Tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3).* This category includes any organization described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). 


(2) *Certain section 501(c)(4) organizations.* Only with respect to an applicable tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(4) and § 53.4958-2(a)(4), this category includes any other organization so described. 


(3) *Employees receiving economic benefits of less than a specified amount in a taxable year.* This category includes, for the taxable year in which benefits are provided, any full- or part-time employee of the applicable tax-exempt organization who— 


(i) Receives economic benefits, directly or indirectly from the organization, of less than the amount referenced for a highly compensated employee in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i); 


(ii) Is not described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section with respect to the organization; and

(e) *Facts and circumstances govern in all other cases*—(1) *In general.* Whether a person who is not described in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section is a disqualified person depends upon all relevant facts and circumstances. 


(2) *Facts and circumstances tending to show substantial influence.* Facts and circumstances tending to show that a person has substantial influence over the affairs of an organization include, but are not limited to, the following— 


(i) The person founded the organization;

(iii) The person's compensation is primarily based on revenues derived from activities of the organization, or of a particular department or function of the organization, that the person controls; 


(iv) The person has or shares authority to control or determine a substantial portion of the organization's capital expenditures, operating budget, or compensation for employees; 


(v) The person manages a discrete segment or activity of the organization that represents a substantial portion of the activities, assets, income, or expenses of the organization, as compared to the organization as a whole; 


(vi) The person owns a controlling interest (measured by either vote or value) in a corporation, partnership, or trust that is a disqualified person; or 


(vii) The person is a non-stock organization controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more disqualified persons. 


(3) *Facts and circumstances tending to show no substantial influence.* Facts and circumstances tending to show that a person does not have substantial influence over the affairs of an organization include, but are not limited to, the following— 


(i) The person has taken a bona fide vow of poverty as an employee, agent, or on behalf, of a religious organization; 


(ii) The person is a contractor (such as an attorney, accountant, or investment manager or advisor) whose sole relationship to the organization is providing professional advice (without having decision-making authority) with respect to transactions from which the contractor will not economically benefit either directly or indirectly (aside from customary fees received for the professional advice rendered); 


(iii) The direct supervisor of the individual is not a disqualified person;

(f) *Affiliated organizations.* In the case of multiple organizations affiliated by common control or governing documents, the determination of whether a person does or does not have substantial influence shall be made separately for each applicable tax-exempt organization. A person may be a disqualified person with respect to transactions with more than one applicable tax-exempt organization. 


(g) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of this section. A finding that a person is a disqualified person in the following examples does not indicate that an excess benefit transaction has occurred. If a person is a disqualified person, the rules of section 4958(c) and § 53.4958-4 apply to determine whether an excess benefit transaction has occurred. The examples are as follows:
