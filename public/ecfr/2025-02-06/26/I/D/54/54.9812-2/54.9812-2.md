(2) *Identification and definition of the factors and evidentiary standards used to design or apply the nonquantitative treatment limitation.* The comparative analysis must include, with respect to every factor considered or relied upon to design the nonquantitative treatment limitation or apply the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits:


(i) Identification of every factor considered or relied upon, as well as the evidentiary standards considered or relied upon to design or apply each factor and the sources from which each evidentiary standard was derived, in determining which mental health or substance use disorder benefits and which medical/surgical benefits are subject to the nonquantitative treatment limitation; and


(ii) A definition of each factor, including:


(A) A detailed description of the factor;


(B) A description of each evidentiary standard used to design or apply each factor (and the source of each evidentiary standard) identified under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and


(C) A description of any steps the plan has taken to correct, cure, or supplement any information, evidence, sources, or standards that would otherwise have been considered biased or not objective under ยง 54.9812-1(c)(4)(i)(B)(*1*) in the absence of such steps.


(3) *Description of how factors are used in the design and application of the nonquantitative treatment limitation.* The comparative analysis must include a description of how each factor identified and defined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is used in the design or application of the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits in a classification, including:

(A) How all of the factors relate to each other;


(B) The order in which all the factors are applied, including when they are applied;


(C) Whether and how any factors are given more weight than others; and


(D) The reasons for the ordering or weighting of the factors; and


(v) Any deviations or variations from a factor, its applicability, or its definition (including the evidentiary standards used to define the factor and the information or sources from which each evidentiary standard was derived), such as how the factor is used differently to apply the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits as compared to medical/surgical benefits, and a description of how the plan establishes such deviations or variations.


(4) *Demonstration of comparability and stringency as written.* The comparative analysis must evaluate whether, in any classification, under the terms of the plan as written, any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in designing and applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in designing and applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation with respect to medical/surgical benefits. The comparative analysis must include, with respect to the nonquantitative treatment limitation and the factors used in designing and applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation:

(iv) An explanation of the reasons for any deviations or variations in the application of a factor used to apply the nonquantitative treatment limitation, or the application of the nonquantitative treatment limitation, to mental health or substance use disorder benefits as compared to medical/surgical benefits, and how the plan establishes such deviations or variations, including:


(A) In the definition of the factors, the evidentiary standards used to define the factors, and the sources from which the evidentiary standards were derived;


(B) In the design of the factors or evidentiary standards; or


(C) In the application or design of the nonquantitative treatment limitation.


(5) *Demonstration of comparability and stringency in operation.* The comparative analysis must evaluate whether, in any classification, in operation, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in designing and applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in designing and applying the limitation with respect to medical/surgical benefits. The comparative analysis must include, with respect to the nonquantitative treatment limitation and the factors used in designing and applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation:


(i) A comprehensive explanation of how the plan evaluates whether, in operation, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in designing and applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a classification are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in designing and applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation with respect to medical/surgical benefits, including:
