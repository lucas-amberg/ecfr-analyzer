# § 54.9822-1T   Choice of health care professional (temporary).

(a) *Choice of health care professional*—(1) *Designation of primary care provider*—(i) *In general.* If a group health plan, requires or provides for designation by a participant or beneficiary of a participating primary care provider, then the plan must permit each participant or beneficiary to designate any participating primary care provider who is available to accept the participant or beneficiary. In such a case, the plan must comply with the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section by informing each participant of the terms of the plan regarding designation of a primary care provider.


(ii) *Construction.* Nothing in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is to be construed to prohibit the application of reasonable and appropriate geographic limitations with respect to the selection of primary care providers, in accordance with the terms of the plan, the underlying provider contracts, and applicable State law.


(iii) *Example.* The rules of this paragraph (a)(1) are illustrated by the following example:


(A) *Facts.* A group health plan requires individuals covered under the plan to designate a primary care provider. The plan permits each individual to designate any primary care provider participating in the plan's network who is available to accept the individual as the individual's primary care provider. If an individual has not designated a primary care provider, the plan designates one until the individual has made a designation. The plan provides a notice that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section regarding the ability to designate a primary care provider.


(B) *Conclusion.* In this *Example,* the plan has satisfied the requirements of this paragraph (a).


(2) *Designation of pediatrician as primary care provider*—(i) *In general.* If a group health plan requires or provides for the designation of a participating primary care provider for a child by a participant or beneficiary, the plan must permit the participant or beneficiary to designate a physician (allopathic or osteopathic) who specializes in pediatrics (including pediatric subspecialties, based on the scope of that provider's license under applicable State law) as the child's primary care provider if the provider participates in the network of the plan and is available to accept the child. In such a case, the plan must comply with the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section by informing each participant of the terms of the plan regarding designation of a pediatrician as the child's primary care provider.


(ii) *Construction.* Nothing in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is to be construed to waive any exclusions of coverage under the terms and conditions of the plan with respect to coverage of pediatric care.


(iii) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1*—(*1*) *Facts.* A group health plan's HMO designates for each participant a physician who specializes in internal medicine to serve as the primary care provider for the participant and any beneficiaries. Participant *A* requests that Pediatrician *B* be designated as the primary care provider for *A'*s child. *B* is a participating provider in the HMO's network and is available to accept the child.


(*2*) *Conclusion.* In this *Example 1,* the HMO must permit *A'*s designation of *B* as the primary care provider for *A'*s child in order to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2).


(B) *Example 2*—(*1*) *Facts.* Same facts as *Example 1* (paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section), except that *A* takes *A'*s child to *B* for treatment of the child's severe shellfish allergies. *B* wishes to refer *A'*s child to an allergist for treatment. The HMO, however, does not provide coverage for treatment of food allergies, nor does it have an allergist participating in its network, and it therefore refuses to authorize the referral.


(*2*) *Conclusion.* In this *Example 2,* the HMO has not violated the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) because the exclusion of treatment for food allergies is in accordance with the terms of *A'*s coverage.


(3) *Patient access to obstetrical and gynecological care*—(i) *General rights*—(A) *Direct access.* A group health plan described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, may not require authorization or referral by the plan, or any person (including a primary care provider) in the case of a female participant or beneficiary who seeks coverage for obstetrical or gynecological care provided by a participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. In such a case, the plan must comply with the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section by informing each participant that the plan may not require authorization or referral for obstetrical or gynecological care by a participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The plan may require such a professional to agree to otherwise adhere to the plan's policies and procedures, including procedures regarding referrals and obtaining prior authorization and providing services pursuant to a treatment plan (if any) approved by the plan. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), a health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology is any individual (including a person other than a physician) who is authorized under applicable State law to provide obstetrical or gynecological care.


(B) *Obstetrical and gynecological care.* A group health plan described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section must treat the provision of obstetrical and gynecological care, and the ordering of related obstetrical and gynecological items and services, pursuant to the direct access described under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, by a participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology as the authorization of the primary care provider.


(ii) *Application of paragraph.* A group health plan is described in this paragraph (a)(3) if the plan—


(A) Provides coverage for obstetrical or gynecological care; and


(B) Requires the designation by a participant or beneficiary of a participating primary care provider.


(iii) *Construction.* Nothing in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is to be construed to—


(A) Waive any exclusions of coverage under the terms and conditions of the plan with respect to coverage of obstetrical or gynecological care; or


(B) Preclude the group health plan involved from requiring that the obstetrical or gynecological provider notify the primary care health care professional or the plan of treatment decisions.


(iv) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (a)(3) are illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1*—(*1*) *Facts.* A group health plan requires each participant to designate a physician to serve as the primary care provider for the participant and the participant's family. Participant *A,* a female, requests a gynecological exam with Physician *B,* an in-network physician specializing in gynecological care. The group health plan requires prior authorization from *A'*s designated primary care provider for the gynecological exam.


(*2*) *Conclusion.* In this *Example 1,* the group health plan has violated the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) because the plan requires prior authorization from *A'*s primary care provider prior to obtaining gynecological services.


(B) *Example 2*—(*1*) *Facts.* Same facts as *Example 1* (paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section) except that *A* seeks gynecological services from *C,* an out-of-network provider.


(*2*) *Conclusion.* In this *Example 2,* the group health plan has not violated the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) by requiring prior authorization because *C* is not a participating health care provider.


(C) *Example 3*—(*1*) *Facts.* Same facts as *Example 1* (paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section) except that the group health plan only requires *B* to inform *A'*s designated primary care physician of treatment decisions.


(*2*) *Conclusion.* In this *Example 3,* the group health plan has not violated the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) because *A* has direct access to *B* without prior authorization. The fact that the group health plan requires the designated primary care physician to be notified of treatment decisions does not violate this paragraph (a)(3).


(D) *Example 4*—(*1*) *Facts.* A group health plan requires each participant to designate a physician to serve as the primary care provider for the participant and the participant's family. The group health plan requires prior authorization before providing benefits for uterine fibroid embolization.


(*2*) *Conclusion.* In this *Example 4,* the plan requirement for prior authorization before providing benefits for uterine fibroid embolization does not violate the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) because, though the prior authorization requirement applies to obstetrical services, it does not restrict access to any providers specializing in obstetrics or gynecology.


(4) *Notice of right to designate a primary care provider*—(i) *In general.* If a group health plan requires the designation by a participant or beneficiary of a primary care provider, the plan must provide a notice informing each participant of the terms of the plan regarding designation of a primary care provider and of the rights—


(A) Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, that any participating primary care provider who is available to accept the participant or beneficiary can be designated;


(B) Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, with respect to a child, that any participating physician who specializes in pediatrics can be designated as the primary care provider; and


(C) Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, that the plan may not require authorization or referral for obstetrical or gynecological care by a participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology.


(ii) *Timing.* In the case of a group health plan, the notice described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section must be included whenever the plan provides a participant with a summary plan description or other similar description of benefits under the plan.


(iii) *Model language.* The following model language can be used to satisfy the notice requirement described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section:


(A) For plans that require or allow for the designation of primary care providers by participants or beneficiaries, insert:


(B) For plans that require or allow for the designation of a primary care provider for a child, add:


For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.


(C) For plans that provide coverage for obstetric or gynecological care and require the designation by a participant or beneficiary of a primary care provider, add:


(b) *Applicability date.* The provisions of this section are applicable with respect to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
