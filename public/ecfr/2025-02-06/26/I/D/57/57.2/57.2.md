This exclusion does not apply to a MEWA.

Thus, for example, if an entity used the 2014 data year as its test year for the 2015 fee year, that entity must use the data year as its test year for each subsequent fee year.


(iii) *Special rule for fee year as test year.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any entity that uses the fee year as its test year but ultimately does not qualify for an exclusion described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section for that entire fee year must use the data year as its test year for each subsequent fee year.


(4) *State.* Solely for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term *State* means any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or any of the possessions of the United States, including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

(ii) A person is treated as being a member of the controlled group if it is a member of the group at the end of the day on December 31st of the data year. However, a person's net premiums written are included in net premiums written for the controlled group only if the person would qualify as a covered entity in the fee year if the person were not a member of the controlled group.


(d) *Data year.* The term *data year* means the calendar year immediately before the fee year. Thus, for example, 2013 is the data year for fee year 2014.


(e) *Designated entity*—(1) *In general.* The term *designated entity* means the person within a controlled group that is designated to act on behalf of the controlled group regarding the fee with respect to—

(iii) *Failure to select a designated entity.* Excepted as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, if a controlled group fails to select a designated entity as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, then the IRS will select a member of the controlled group to be the designated entity. If the IRS selects the designated entity, then all members of the controlled group that provide health insurance for a United States health risk will be deemed to have consented to the IRS's selection of the designated entity.


(f) *Fee.* The term *fee* means the fee imposed by section 9010 on each covered entity engaged in the business of providing health insurance.
