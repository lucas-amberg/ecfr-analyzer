# § 57.7   Notification and fee payment.

(a) *Content of notice.* Each fee year, the IRS will make a final calculation of the fee for each covered entity as described in § 57.4. The IRS will base its final fee calculation on each covered entity's original or corrected Form 8963, “Report of Health Insurance Provider Information,” as adjusted by other sources of information described in § 57.4(b)(1). The notification to a covered entity of its final fee calculation will include—


(1) The covered entity's allocated fee;


(2) The covered entity's net premiums written for health insurance of United States health risks;


(3) The covered entity's net premiums written for health insurance of United States health risks taken into account after the application of § 57.4(a)(4);


(4) The aggregate net premiums written for health insurance of United States health risks taken into account for all covered entities; and


(5) The final determination on the covered entity's corrected Form 8963, “Report of Health Insurance Provider Information,” if any.


(b) *Timing of notice.* The IRS will send each covered entity a notice of its final fee calculation by August 31st of the fee year.


(c) *Differences in preliminary fee calculation and final calculation.* A covered entity's final fee calculation may differ from the covered entity's preliminary fee calculation because of changes made pursuant to the error correction process described in § 57.6 or because the IRS discovered additional information relevant to the fee calculation through other information sources as described in § 57.4(b)(1). Even if a covered entity did not file a corrected Form 8963 described in § 57.6, a covered entity's final fee may differ from a covered entity's preliminary fee because of information discovered about that covered entity through other information sources. In addition, a change in aggregate net premiums written for health insurance of United States health risks can affect every covered entity's fee because each covered entity's fee is equal to a fraction of the aggregate fee collected from all covered entities.


(d) *Payment of final fee.* Each covered entity must pay its final fee by September 30th of the fee year. For a controlled group, the payment must be made using the designated entity's Employer Identification Number as reported on Form 8963. The fee must be paid by electronic funds transfer as required by § 57.6302-1. There is no tax return to be filed with the payment of the fee.


(e) *Controlled groups.* In the case of a controlled group that is liable for the fee, all members of the controlled group are jointly and severally liable for the fee. Accordingly, if a controlled group's fee is not paid, the IRS may separately assess each member of the controlled group for the full amount of the controlled group's fee.
