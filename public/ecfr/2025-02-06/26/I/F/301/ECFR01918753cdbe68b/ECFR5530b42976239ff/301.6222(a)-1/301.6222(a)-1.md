# ยง 301.6222(a)-1   Consistent treatment of partnership items.

(a) *In general.* The treatment of a partnership item on the partner's return must be consistent with the treatment of that item by the partnership on the partnership return in all respects including the amount, timing, and characterization of the item. 


(b) *Treatment must be consistent with partnership return.* The treatment of a partnership item on the partner's return must be consistent with the treatment of that item on the partnership return. Thus, a partner who treats an item consistently with a schedule or other information furnished to the partner by the partnership has not satisfied the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section if the treatment of that item is inconsistent with the treatment of the item on the partnership return actually filed. For rules relating to the election to be treated as having reported the inconsistency where the partner treats an item consistently with an incorrect schedule, see ยง 301.6222(b)-3. 


(c) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of this section: 


(d) *Effective date.* This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. 


For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see ยง 301.6222(a)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
