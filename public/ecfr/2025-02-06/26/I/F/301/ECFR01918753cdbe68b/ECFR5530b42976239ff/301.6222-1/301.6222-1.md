# § 301.6222-1   Partner's return must be consistent with partnership return.

(a) *Consistent treatment of partnership-related items*—(1) *In general.* The treatment of partnership-related items (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) on a partner's return must be consistent with the treatment of such items on the partnership return in all respects, including the amount, timing, and characterization of such items. A partner has not satisfied the requirement of this paragraph (a) if the treatment of the partnership-related item on the partner's return is consistent with how such item was treated on a schedule or other information furnished to the partner by the partnership but inconsistent with the treatment of the item on the partnership return actually filed. For rules relating to the election to be treated as having reported the inconsistency where the partner treats a partnership-related item consistently with an incorrect schedule or other information furnished by the partnership, see paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term *partner's return* includes any return, statement, schedule, or list, and any amendment or supplement thereto, filed by the partner with respect to any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (Code).


(2) *Partner that is a partnership with an election in effect under section 6221(b).* The rules of this section apply to all partners, including a partnership-partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(7)) that has an election in effect under section 6221(b) for any taxable year. Accordingly, unless the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are satisfied, a partnership-partner must treat partnership-related items of a partnership in which it is a partner consistent with the treatment of such items on the partnership return filed by the partnership in which it is a partner.


(3) *Partnership does not file a return.* A partner's treatment of a partnership-related item attributable to a partnership that does not file a return is per se inconsistent.


(4) *Treatment of items on a partnership return.* For purposes of this section, the treatment of a partnership-related item on a partnership return includes—


(i) The treatment of such item on the partnership's return of partnership income filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under section 6031, and any amendment or supplement thereto, including an administrative adjustment request (AAR) filed pursuant to section 6227; and


(ii) The treatment of such item on any statement, schedule or list, and any amendment or supplement thereto, filed by the partnership with the IRS, including any statements filed pursuant to section 6226.


(5) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). For purposes of these examples, each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code (subchapter C of chapter 63), and each partnership and its partners are calendar year taxpayers, unless otherwise stated.




(i) *Example 1.* A is a partner in Partnership during 2018 and 2019. In December 2018, Partnership receives an advance payment for services to be performed in 2019 and reports this amount as income on its partnership return for 2018. A includes its distributive share of income from the advance payment on A's income tax return for 2019 and not on A's income tax return for 2018. A has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because A's treatment of the income attributable to Partnership is inconsistent with the treatment of that item by Partnership on its partnership return.


(ii) *Example 2.* B is a partner in Partnership during 2018. Partnership incurred start-up costs before it was actively engaged in its business. Partnership capitalized these costs on its 2018 partnership return. B deducted his distributive share of the start-up costs on B's 2018 income tax return. B has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because B's treatment of the start-up costs is inconsistent with the treatment of that item by Partnership on its partnership return.


(iii) *Example 3.* C is a partner in Partnership during 2018. Partnership reports a loss of $100,000 on its partnership return for 2018. On the 2018 Schedule K-1 attached to the partnership return, Partnership reports $5,000 as C's distributive share of that loss. On the 2018 Schedule K-1 furnished to C, however, Partnership reports $15,000 as C's distributive share of the loss. C reports the $15,000 loss on C's 2018 income tax return. C has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because C reported C's distributive share of the loss in a manner that is inconsistent with how C's distributive share of the loss was reported on the 2018 partnership return actually filed. See, however, paragraph (d) of this section for the election to be treated as having reported the inconsistency where the partner treats an item consistently with an incorrect schedule.


(iv) *Example 4.* D was a partner in Partnership during 2018. Partnership reports a loss of $100,000 on its partnership return for 2018. In 2020, Partnership files an AAR under section 6227 reporting that the amount of the loss on its 2018 partnership return is $90,000, rather than $100,000 as originally reported. Pursuant to section 6227, Partnership elects to have its partners take the adjustment into account, and furnishes D a statement showing D's share of the reduced loss for 2018. D fails to take his share of the reduced loss for 2018 into account in accordance with section 6227. D has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because D has not taken into account his share of the loss in a manner consistent with how Partnership treated such items on the partnership return actually filed.


(v) *Example 5.* E was a partner in Partnership during 2018. In 2021, Partnership receives a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) in an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. The FPA reflects an imputed underpayment. Partnership properly elects the application of section 6226 with respect to the imputed underpayment and files with the IRS and furnishes to E a statement of E's share of adjustments with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. E fails to take his share of the adjustments into account in accordance with section 6226. E has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because E has not taken into account his share of adjustments with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year in a manner consistent with how Partnership treated such items on the section 6226 statement filed with the IRS.


(vi) *Example 6.* F was a partner in Partnership during 2018. F has a valid election under section 6221(b) in effect with respect to F's 2018 partnership taxable year. Notwithstanding F's election under section 6221(b) for its 2018 taxable year, F is subject to section 6222 for taxable year 2018. F must treat, on its 2018 partnership return, any items attributable to F's interest in Partnership in a manner that is consistent with the treatment of those items on the 2018 partnership return actually filed by Partnership.


(vii) *Example 7.* G was a partner in Partnership during 2018. G's taxable year ends on the same day as Partnership's 2018 taxable year. Partnership did not file a partnership return for its 2018 taxable year. G files an income tax return for its 2018 taxable year and reports G's share of a loss attributable to G's interest in Partnership. Because Partnership failed to file a partnership return, G's treatment of such loss is per se inconsistent pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.




(b) *Effect of inconsistent treatment*—(1) *Determination of underpayment of tax resulting from inconsistent treatment.* If a partner fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, unless the partner provides notice in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the IRS may adjust the inconsistently reported partnership-related item on the partner's return to make it consistent with the treatment of such item on the partnership return (or where no partnership return was filed, remove any treatment of such items from the partner's return) and determine any underpayment of tax that results from that adjustment. For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the underpayment of tax is the amount by which the correct tax, as determined by making the partner's return consistent with the partnership return, exceeds the tax shown on the partner's return.


(2) *Assessment and collection of tax.* The IRS may assess and collect any underpayment of tax resulting from an adjustment described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the same manner as if the underpayment of tax were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the partner's return, except that the procedures under section 6213(b)(2) for requesting abatement of an assessment do not apply.


(3) *Effect when partner is a partnership.* For the effect of a failure to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section where the partner is itself a partnership (a partnership-partner), see section 6232(d)(1)(B) and § 301.6232-1(d).


(4) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b). For purposes of these examples, each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63, and each partnership and its partners are calendar year taxpayers, unless otherwise stated.




(i) *Example 1.* H, an individual, is a partner in Partnership. On its partnership return for taxable year 2018, Partnership reports $100,000 in ordinary income. On the Schedule K-1 attached to the partnership return, as well as on the Schedule K-1 furnished to H, Partnership reports $15,000 as H's distributive share of the $100,000 in ordinary income. H reports only $5,000 of the $15,000 of ordinary income on his 2018 income tax return. The IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the ordinary income attributable to H's interest in Partnership reported on H's 2018 income tax return from $5,000 to $15,000 and assess that resulting underpayment in tax as if it were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on H's return. H may not request an abatement of that assessment under section 6213(b).


(ii) *Example 2.* J was a partner in Partnership during 2018. In 2021, Partnership receives an FPA in an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. The FPA reflects an imputed underpayment. Partnership properly elects the application of section 6226 with respect to the imputed underpayment and files with the IRS and furnishes to J a statement of J's share of adjustments with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year. J fails to report one adjustment reflected on the statement, J's share of a decrease in the amount of losses for 2018, on J's return as required by section 6226. The IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the decrease in the amount of losses on J's return to be consistent with the amount included on the section 6226 statement filed with the IRS and may assess the resulting underpayment in tax as if it were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on J's return. J may not request an abatement of that assessment under section 6213(b).


(c) *Notification to the IRS when items attributable to a partnership are treated inconsistently*—(1) *In general.* Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section (regarding the consistent treatment of partnership-related items and the effect of inconsistent treatment) do not apply to partnership-related items identified as inconsistent (or that may be inconsistent) in a statement that the partner provides to the IRS according to the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. Instead, the procedures in paragraph (c)(3) of this section apply. A statement does not identify an inconsistency for purposes of this paragraph (c) unless it is attached to the partner's return on which the partnership-related item is treated inconsistently.


(2) *Coordination with section 6223.* Paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not applicable to a partnership-related item the treatment of which is binding on the partner because of actions taken by the partnership under subchapter C of chapter 63 or because of a final decision in a proceeding with respect to the partnership under subchapter C of chapter 63. For instance, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply with respect to the partner's treatment of a partnership-related item reflected on a statement described in § 301.6226-2 filed by the partnership with the IRS. See § 301.6226-1(e) (regarding the binding nature of statements described in § 301.6226-2). Any underpayment resulting from the inconsistent treatment of an item described in this paragraph (c)(2) may be assessed and collected in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(3) *Partner protected only to extent of notification.* A partner who reports the inconsistent treatment of a partnership-related item is not subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section only with respect to those items identified in the statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Thus, if a partner notifying the IRS with respect to one partnership-related item does not report the inconsistent treatment of another partnership-related item, the IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the unidentified, inconsistently reported item on the partner's return to make it consistent with the treatment of such item on the partnership return and assess the resulting underpayment of tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(4) *Adjustment after notification*—(i) *In general.* If a partner notifies the IRS of the inconsistent treatment of a partnership-related item in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the IRS disagrees with the inconsistent treatment, the IRS may adjust the identified, inconsistently reported item in a proceeding with respect to the partner. Nothing in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) precludes the IRS from also conducting a proceeding with respect to the partnership. If the IRS conducts a proceeding with respect to the partnership regarding the identified, inconsistently reported item, each partner of the partnership, including any partner that notified the IRS of inconsistent treatment in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, is bound by actions taken by the partnership and by any final decision in the proceeding with respect to the partnership. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(ii) *Adjustments in partner proceeding.* In a proceeding with respect to a partner described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the IRS may adjust any identified, inconsistently reported partnership-related item to make the item consistent with the treatment of that item on the partnership return or determine that the correct treatment of such item differs from the treatment on the partnership return and instead adjust the item to reflect the correct treatment, notwithstanding the treatment of that item on the partnership return. The IRS may also adjust any item on the partner's return, including items that are not partnership-related items. Any final decision with respect to an inconsistent position in a proceeding to which the partnership is not a party is not binding on the partnership.


(5) *Limitation on treating partnership-related items inconsistently after notice of administrative proceeding.* After a notice of administrative proceeding with respect to a partnership taxable year has been mailed by the IRS under section 6231, a partner may not notify the IRS the partner is treating a partnership-related item on the partner's return inconsistently with how such item was treated on the partnership return for such taxable year, except as provided in § 301.6225-2.


(6) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c). For purposes of these examples, each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63, and each partnership and partner is a calendar year taxpayer, unless otherwise stated.


(i) *Example 1.* K is a partner in Partnership during 2018. K treats a deduction and a capital gain attributable to Partnership on K's 2018 income tax return in a manner that is inconsistent with the treatment of those items by Partnership on its 2018 partnership return. K reports the inconsistent treatment of the deduction in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but not the inconsistent treatment of the gain. Because K did not notify the IRS of the inconsistent treatment of the gain in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the gain reported on K's 2018 income tax return in order to make the treatment of that gain consistent with how the gain was treated on Partnership's partnership return. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the IRS may assess and collect the underpayment of tax resulting from the adjustment to the gain as if it were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on K's return.


(ii) *Example 2.* L is a partner in Partnership during 2018. On its 2018 partnership return, Partnership treats partner L's distributive share of ordinary loss attributable to Partnership as $8,000. L, however, claims an ordinary loss of $9,000 as attributable to Partnership on its 2018 income tax return and notifies the IRS of the inconsistent treatment in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. As a result of the notice of inconsistent treatment, the IRS conducts a separate proceeding under subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to L's 2018 income tax return, a proceeding to which Partnership is not a party. During the proceeding, the IRS determines that the proper amount of L's distributive share of the ordinary loss from Partnership is $3,000. During the same proceeding, the IRS also determines that L overstated a charitable contribution deduction in the amount of $2,500 on its 2018 income tax return. The determination of the adjustment of L's share of ordinary loss is not binding on Partnership. The charitable contribution deduction is not attributable to Partnership or to another partnership subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63. The IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the $9,000 ordinary loss deduction to $3,000 and from adjusting the charitable contribution deduction. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the IRS is not limited to only adjusting the ordinary loss of $9,000, as originally reported on L's partner return, to $8,000, as originally reported by Partnership on its partnership return, nor is the IRS prohibited from adjusting the charitable contribution deduction in the proceeding with respect to L.




(d) *Partner receiving incorrect information*—(1) *In general.* A partner is treated as having complied with section 6222(c)(1)(B) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to a partnership-related item if the partner—


(i) Demonstrates that the treatment of such item on the partner's return is consistent with the treatment of that item on the statement, schedule, or other form prescribed by the IRS and furnished to the partner by the partnership; and


(ii) The partner makes an election in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(2) *Time and manner of making election*—(i) *In general.* An election under paragraph (d) of this section must be filed in writing with the IRS office set forth in the notice that notified the partner of the inconsistency no later than 60 days after the date of such notice.


(ii) *Contents of election.* The election described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section must be—


(A) Clearly identified as an election under section 6222(c)(2)(B);


(B) Signed by the partner making the election;


(C) Accompanied by a copy of the statement, schedule, or other form furnished to the partner by the partnership and a copy of the IRS notice that notified the partner of the inconsistency; and


(D) Include any other information required in forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS.


(iii) *Treatment of partnership-related item is unclear.* Generally, the requirement described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section will be satisfied by attaching a copy of the statement, schedule, or other form furnished to the partner by the partnership to the election (in addition to a copy of the IRS notice that notified the partner of the inconsistency). However, if it is not clear from the statement, schedule, or other form furnished by the partnership that the partner's treatment of the partnership-related item on the partner's return is consistent, the election must also include an explanation of how the treatment of such item on the statement, schedule, or other form furnished by the partnership is consistent with the treatment of the item on the partner's return, including with respect to the characterization, timing, and amount of such item.


(3) *Example.* M is a partner in Partnership for 2018. Partnership is subject to subchapter C of chapter 63, and both Partnership and M are calendar year taxpayers. On its 2018 partnership return, Partnership reports that M's distributive share of ordinary income attributable to Partnership is $1,000. Partnership furnishes to M a Schedule K-1 for 2018 showing $500 as M's distributive share of ordinary income. M reports $500 of ordinary income attributable to Partnership on its 2018 income tax return consistent with the Schedule K-1 furnished to M. The IRS notifies M that M's treatment of the ordinary income attributable to Partnership on its 2018 income tax return is inconsistent with how Partnership treated the ordinary income allocated to M on its 2018 partnership return. Within 60 days of receiving the notice from the IRS of the inconsistency, M files an election with the IRS in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Because M made a valid election under section 6222(c)(2)(B) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, M is treated as having notified the IRS of the inconsistency with respect to the ordinary income attributable to Partnership under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(e) *Applicability date*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending after August 12, 2018.


(2) *Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.* This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22 is in effect.
