# § 301.6227-3   Adjustments requested in an administrative adjustment request taken into account by reviewed year partners.

(a) *In general.* Each reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) is required to take into account its share of adjustments requested in an administrative adjustment request (AAR) that either do not result in an imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)(1)) or are associated with an imputed underpayment for which the partnership makes an election under § 301.6227-2(c). Each reviewed year partner receiving a statement furnished in accordance with § 301.6227-1(d) must take into account adjustments reflected in the statement in the reviewed year partner's taxable year that includes the date the statement is furnished (reporting year) in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Adjustments taken into account by the reviewed year partner in the reporting year*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a reviewed year partner that is furnished a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section must treat the statement as if it were issued under section 6226(a)(2) and, on or before the due date for the reporting year must report and pay the additional reporting year tax (as defined in § 301.6226-3(a)), if any, determined after taking into account that partner's share of the adjustments requested in the AAR in accordance with § 301.6226-3. A reviewed year partner may, in accordance with § 301.6226-3(a), reduce chapter 1 tax for the reporting year where the additional reporting year tax is less than zero. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the rule under § 301.6226-3(c)(3) (regarding the increased rate of interest) does not apply. Nothing in this section entitles any partner to a refund of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (chapter 1 tax) to which such partner is not entitled. For instance, a partnership-partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(7)) may not claim a refund with respect to its share of any adjustment.


(2) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.




(i) *Example 1.* In 2022, partner A, an individual, received a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section from Partnership with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Both A and Partnership are calendar year taxpayers and A is not claiming any refundable tax credit in 2020. The only adjustment shown on the statement is an increase in ordinary loss. Taking into account the adjustment, A determines that his additional reporting year tax for 2022 (the reporting year) is -$100 (that is, a reduction of $100.) A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 (without regard to any additional reporting year tax) is $150. Applying the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 is reduced to $50 ($150 chapter 1 tax without regard to the additional reporting year tax plus -$100 additional reporting year tax).


(ii) *Example 2.* The facts are the same as in *Example 1* in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, except A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 (without regard to any additional reporting year tax) is $75. Applying the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 is reduced by the -$100 of additional reporting year tax. Accordingly, A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 is -$25 ($75 chapter 1 tax without regard to any additional reporting year tax plus -$100 of additional reporting year tax), A owes no chapter 1 tax for 2022, and A may make a claim for refund with respect to any overpayment.


(c) *Reviewed year partners that are pass-through partners*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section (including a statement described in this paragraph (c)(1)) is furnished to a reviewed year partner that is a pass-through partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(5)), the pass-through partner must take into account the adjustments reflected on that statement in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e) by treating the partnership that filed the AAR as the partnership that made an election under § 301.6226-1. A pass-through partner that furnishes statements in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(3) must provide the information described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section in lieu of the information described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(iii) on the statements the pass-through partner furnishes to its partners. A pass-through partner that computes and pays an imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(4)(iii) may not apply any modifications to the amount of imputed underpayment. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the statement furnished to the pass-through partner by the partnership filing the AAR is treated as if it were a statement issued under section 6226(a)(2) and described in § 301.6226-2.


(2) *Adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.* If adjustments on a statement received by the pass-through partner under paragraph (a) or (c)(1) of this section do not result in an imputed underpayment for the pass-through partner (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)(1)), the pass-through partner must take the adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment into account in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(3). The pass-through partner must take such adjustments into account under this paragraph (c)(2) even in situations where the pass-through partner pays an imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(4)(iii). The pass-through partner must provide the information described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section in lieu of the information described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(iii) on the statements the pass-through partner furnishes to its affected partners (as defined in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(i)).


(3) *Contents of statements.* Each statement described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section must include the following correct information—


(i) The name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the partnership that filed the AAR with respect to the adjustments reflected on the statements described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;


(ii) The adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) of the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section;


(iii) The extended due date for the return for the adjustment year of the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (as described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(ii));


(iv) The date on which the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section furnished its statements required under § 301.6227-1(d);


(v) The name and TIN of the partnership that furnished the statement to the pass-through partner if different from the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section;


(vi) The name and TIN of the pass-through partner;


(vii) The pass-through partner's taxable year to which the adjustments set forth in the statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section relate;


(viii) The name and TIN of the affected partner to whom the statement is being furnished;


(ix) The current or last address of the affected partner that is known to the pass-through partner;


(x) The affected partner's share of items as originally reported to such partner under section 6031(b) and, if applicable, section 6227, for the taxable year to which the adjustments reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner relate;


(xi) The affected partner's share of partnership adjustments determined under § 301.6227-1(e)(2) as if the affected partner were the reviewed year partner and the partnership were the pass-through partner;


(xii) Any other information required by forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS.


(4) *Affected partners must take into account the adjustments.* A statement furnished to an affected partner in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section is to be treated by the affected partner as if it were a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section. The affected partner must take into account its share of the adjustments reflected on such a statement in accordance with this section by treating references to “reviewed year partner” as “affected partner.” When taking into account the adjustments as described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(iv), the rules under § 301.6226-3(c)(3) (regarding the increased rate of interest) do not apply.


(d) *Applicability date*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending after August 12, 2018.


(2) *Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.* This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22 is in effect.
