# § 301.6231(a)(5)-1   Definition of affected item.

(a) *In general.* The term *affected item* means any item to the extent such item is affected by a partnership item. It includes items unrelated to the items reflected on the partnership return (for example, an item, such as the threshold for the medical expense deduction under section 213, that varies if there is a change in an individual partner's adjusted gross income). 


(b) *Basis in a partner's partnership interest.* The basis of a partner's partnership interest is an affected item to the extent it is not a partnership item. 


(c) *At-risk limitation.* The application of the at-risk limitation under section 465 to a partner with respect to a loss incurred by a partnership is an affected item to the extent it is not a partnership item. 


(d) *Passive losses.* The application of the passive loss rules under section 469 to a partner with respect to a loss incurred by a partnership is an affected item to the extent it is not a partnership item. 


(e) *Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount*—(1) *In general.* The term *affected item* includes any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount provided by subchapter A of chapter 68 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to the extent provided in this paragraph (e). 


(2) *Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount without floor.* If a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that does not contain a floor (that is, a threshold amount of underpayment or understatement necessary before the imposition of the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount) is imposed on a partner as the result of an adjustment to a partnership item, the term *affected item* shall include the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the partnership item adjustment(s) to which the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount applies. 


(3) *Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount containing floor*—(i) *Floor exceeded prior to adjustment.* If a partner would have been subject to a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that contains a floor in the absence of an adjustment to a partnership item (that is, the partner's understatement or underpayment exceeded the floor even without an adjustment to a partnership item) the term *affected item* shall include only the portion of the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the partnership item (or affected item) adjustments. 


(ii) *Floor not exceeded prior to adjustment.* In the case of a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that contains a floor, if the taxpayer's understatement or underpayment does not exceed the floor prior to an adjustment to a partnership item but does so after such adjustment, the term *affected item* shall include the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the entire underpayment or understatement to which the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount applies. 


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(f) *Effective date.* This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(a)(5)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
