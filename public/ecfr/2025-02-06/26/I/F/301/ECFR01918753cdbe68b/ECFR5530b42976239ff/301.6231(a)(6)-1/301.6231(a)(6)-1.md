# § 301.6231(a)(6)-1   Computational adjustments.

(a) *Changes in a partner's tax liability*—(1) *In general.* A change in the tax liability of a partner to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code is made through a computational adjustment. A computational adjustment includes a change in tax liability that reflects a change in an affected item where that change is necessary to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item, or any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, if a change in a partner's tax liability cannot be made without making one or more partner-level determinations, that portion of the change in tax liability attributable to the partner-level determinations shall be made under the deficiency procedures (as described in subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code), except for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. 


(2) *Affected items that do not require partner-level determinations.* Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that do not require partner-level determinations (such as the threshold amount of medical deductions under section 213 that changes as the result of determinations made at the partnership level) are computational adjustments that are directly assessed. When making computational adjustments, the Internal Revenue Service may assume that amounts the partner reported on the partner's individual return include all amounts reported to the partner by the partnership (on the Schedule K-1s attached to the partnership's original return), absent contrary notice to the Internal Revenue Service (for example, a “Notice of Inconsistent Treatment” pursuant to § 301.6222(a)-2(c)). Such an assumption by the Internal Revenue Service does not constitute a partner-level determination. Moreover, substituting redetermined partnership items for the partner's previously reported partnership items (including partnership items included in carryover amounts) does not constitute a partner-level determination where the Internal Revenue Service otherwise accepts, for the sole purpose of determining the computational adjustment, all nonpartnership items (including, for example, nonpartnership item components of carryover amounts) as reported. 


(3) *Affected items that require partner-level determinations.* Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that require partner-level determinations (such as a partner's at-risk amount to the extent it depends upon the source from which the partner obtained the funds that the partner contributed to the partnership) are computational adjustments that are subject to the deficiency procedures. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item is not subject to the deficiency procedures, but rather may be directly assessed as part of the computational adjustment that is made following the partnership proceeding, based on determinations in that proceeding, regardless of whether any partner-level determinations may be required. 


(b) *Interest.* A computational adjustment includes any interest due with respect to any underpayment or overpayment of tax attributable to adjustments to reflect properly the treatment of partnership items. 


(c) *Effective date.* This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(a)(6)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
