# ยง 301.6231(e)-1   Effect of a determination with respect to a nonpartnership item on the determination of a partnership item.

(a) *In general.* The determination of an item after it has become a nonpartnership item with respect to a partner is not controlling in the determination of that item with respect to other partners. Thus, for example, the determination by a court in a separate proceeding relating to a partner that a certain partnership expenditure was deductible does not bind either the Internal Revenue Service or the other partners in a later partnership or other proceeding. 


(b) *Effective date.* This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see ยง 301.6231(e)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
