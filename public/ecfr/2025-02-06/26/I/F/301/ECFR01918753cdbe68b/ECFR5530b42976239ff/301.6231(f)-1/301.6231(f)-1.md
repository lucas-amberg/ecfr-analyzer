# § 301.6231(f)-1   Disallowance of losses and credits in certain cases.

(a) *Application of section.* This section applies if— 


(1) A partnership, whether domestic or foreign, that is required to file a return under section 6031 for a taxable year fails to file the return within the time prescribed; and 


(2) At any time after the close of that taxable year, either— 


(i) The tax matters partner of that partnership resides outside the United States; or 


(ii) The books and records of that partnership are maintained outside the United States. 


(b) *Computational adjustment permitted if return is not filed after mailing of notice.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if— 


(1) This section applies with respect to a partnership for a partnership taxable year; 


(2) The Internal Revenue Service mails notice to a partner that the losses and credits arising from that partnership for that year will be disallowed to that partner unless the partnership files a return for that year within 60 days after the date on which the notice is mailed; and 


(3) The partnership fails to file a return for that year within that 60-day period, the Internal Revenue Service may, without conducting a partnership-level proceeding, mail a notice of computational adjustment to that partner to reflect the disallowance of any loss (including a capital loss) or credit arising from that partnership for that year. 


(c) *Restriction on notices under paragraph (b) of this section.* Neither the notice referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section nor the notice of computational adjustment referred to in paragraph (b) of this section may be mailed on a day on which— 


(1) The tax matters partner of the partnership resides within the United States; and 


(2) The books and records of the partnership are maintained within the United States. Thus, if this section applies with respect to a partnership for a taxable year solely because the tax matters partner of that partnership resided outside the United States for a period after the close of that taxable year and the tax matters partner later takes up residence within the United States, no notice may be mailed under paragraph (b) of this section while the tax matters partner resides within the United States. 


(d) *No disallowance in certain circumstances.* If the person to whom the notice referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is mailed establishes to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service— 


(1) That the losses and credits arising from the partnership for the year are proper; and 


(2) That the partner has made a good faith effort to have the partnership file the required return; the Internal Revenue Service may allow the losses and credits in whole or in part. 


(e) *Effective date.* This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(f)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
