# § 301.6059-1   Periodic report of actuary.

(a) *In general.* The actuarial report described in this section must be filed on behalf on a defined benefit plan to which the minimum funding standards of section 412 apply. The actuarial report must be filed by the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g)) on Schedule B as an attachment to the annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan (Form 5500 series). The instructions accompanying the Form 5500 series prescribe the place and date for filing Schedule B.


(b) *Plan years for which report required.* In the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, Schedule B must be filed for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1975, for which the minimum funding standards apply to the plan, and for each plan year thereafter for which the Schedule must be filed under the instructions accompanying the Schedule and the Form 5500 series. In the case of a plan not in existence on January 1, 1974, Schedule B must be filed for the first plan year beginning after September 2, 1974, for which the minimum funding standards apply to the plan, and for each plan year thereafter for which the Schedule must be filed under the instructions accompanying the Schedule and the Form 5500 series. For rules relating to when a plan is considered to be in existence, see § 1.410(a)-2(c). For purposes of this section, “plan year” means the plan year as determined for purposes of the minimum funding standards.


(c) *Contents of report.* The actuarial report of a plan filed on Schedule B must contain—


(1) The date of the actuarial valuation applicable to the plan year for which the report is filed (see section 412(c)(9) for rules relating to the frequency with which an actuarial valuation of the plan is required to be made),


(2) A description of the funding method and actuarial assumptions used to determine costs under the plan,


(3) A certification of the contribution necessary to reduce the accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section 412(a)) to zero,


(4) A statement by the enrolled actuary signing the report that to the best of the actuary's knowledge the report is complete and accurate,


(5) A statement by the enrolled actuary signing the report that in the actuary's opinion the actuarial assumptions used are in the aggregate (i) reasonably related to the experience of the plan and to reasonable expectations, and (ii) represent the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan,


(6) Such other information as may be necessary to fully and fairly disclose the actuarial position of the plan, and


(7) Such other information as may be required by Schedule B or the instructions accompanying the Schedule and the Form 5500 series.


(d) *Certification by enrolled actuary.* The actuarial report filed on Schedule B must be signed by an enrolled actuary (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(35)) or there may be attached to the report a statement signed by the actuary that contains the statements described in paragraph (c) (4) and (5) of this section.


(1) A statement that the report is based in part on information provided to the actuary by another person, that such information would customarily not be verified by the actuary, and that the actuary has no reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of the information (taking into account the facts and circumstances that are known or reasonably should be known to the actuary, including the contents of any other actuarial report prepared by the actuary for the plan),


(2) A statement that the report is based in part on information provided by another person, that the actuary believes such information is or may be inaccurate or incomplete, but that the inaccuracies or omissions are not material, the inaccuracies or omissions are not so numerous or flagrant as to suggest that there may be material inaccuracies, and that therefore the actuarial report is substantially accurate and complete and fairly discloses the actuarial position of the plan,


(3) A statement that the report reflects the requirement of a regulation or ruling, and that any statement regarding the actuarial position of the plan is made only in light of such requirement,


(4) A statement that the report reflects an interpretation of a statute, regulation or ruling, that the actuary has no reason to doubt the validity of that interpretation, and that any statement regarding the actuarial position of the plan is made only in light of such interpretation,


(5) A statement that in the opinion of the actuary the report fully reflects the requirements of an applicable statute, but does not conform to the requirements of a regulation or ruling promulgated under the statute that the actuary believes is contrary to the statute, or


(6) A statement furnished to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section.


(e) *Relief from filing.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's discretion, relieve a plan administrator from filing Schedule B or from reporting information required by Schedule B or paragraph (c) of this section.


(f) *Penalty.* For the penalty imposed in the case of a failure to file the actuarial report required by this section, see section 6692 and § 301.6692-1.
