# § 301.6104(a)-6   Procedural rules for inspection.

(a) *Place of inspection; tax exempt organizations and pension and other plans.* Material relating either to tax exempt organizations or to pension and other plans that is open to public inspection under section 6104(a)(1) and § 301.6104(a)-1 through § 301.6104(a)-3 will be made available for inspection at the Freedom of Information Reading Room, National Office, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20224, and in the office of any district director of internal revenue.


(b) *Request for inspection*—(1) *Tax exempt organizations and pension and other plans; public inspection.* Material relating to either tax exempt organizations or pension and other plans that is open to public inspection under section 6104(a)(1) and §§ 301.6104(a)-1 through § 301.6104(a)-3 will be available for inspection only upon request. If inspection at the National Office is desired, a request should be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: Freedom of Information Reading Room, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20224. Requests for inspection in the office of a district director should be made in writing to the district director's office. The request must describe the material to be inspected in reasonably sufficient detail so that Internal Revenue Service personnel can locate the material. If a tax-exempt organization has more than one application for tax exemption open to public inspection, or if a pension or other plan has more than one application for a determination letter open to public inspection, only the most recent application and related material will be made available for inspection unless the request states otherwise. Further, in the case of a pension or other plan, only Internal Revenue Service documents issued or delivered after the date of the filing of the most recent application for a determination letter will be made available for inspection, unless the request states otherwise.


(2) *Pension and other plans; inspection by plan participant or authorized representative.* As described in § 301.6104(a)-4, material relating to plans having fewer than 26 participants is only open to inspection by a plan participant or authorized representative. In the case of such a plan, the rules described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph apply. The request for inspection must include satisfactory evidence that the person requesting inspection is a plan participant (see § 301.6104(a)-4(c)) or an authorized representative of such a plan participant within the meaning of § 301.6104(a)-4(d).


(c) *Time and extent of inspection.* A person requesting inspection will be notified when the material will be made available for inspection. The material will be made available for inspection at times that will not interfere with its use by the Internal Revenue Service or exclude other persons from inspecting it. In addition, the Commissioner or district director may limit the number of applications for tax exemption, applications for a determination letter, supporting documents, or letters and documents issued by the Internal Revenue Service that will be made available to any person for inspection on a given date. Inspection will be allowed only in the presence of an Internal Revenue Service employee and only during regular business hours.


(d) *Copies.* Notes may be taken of the material open for inspection. Copies may be made manually or, if a person provides the equipment, photographically at the place of inspection. Photographic copying is subject to reasonable supervision with regard to the facilities and equipment used. Any fees the Internal Revenue Service may charge for furnishing copies under this section shall be no more than under the fee schedule promulgated pursuant to section (a)(4)(A)(i) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, by the Commissioner from time to time. Copies will be certified upon request.
