# § 301.9100-16T   Election to accrue vacation pay.

(a) *In general.* Section 463 provides that taxpayers whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting may elect without the consent of the Commissioner, to deduct certain amounts with respect to vacation pay which, because of contingencies, would not otherwise be deductible. Such election must apply to the liability for all vacation pay accounts maintained by the taxpayer within a single trade or business if the liability is contingent when vacation pay is earned.


(b) *Time for making election.* (1) In the case of a taxpayer who established or maintained a vacation pay account pursuant to I.T. 3956 and who continued to maintain such account pursuant to section 97 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, as amended, for its last taxable year ending before January 1, 1973, the election must be made for each trade or business for which such account was maintained on or before the later of (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extensions of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973. The election pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective with respect to an account described in this paragraph (b)(1) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1972. Failure to file such election shall constitute a change in the method of accounting for vacation pay for the first taxable year ending after December 31, 1972. Such change in accounting method will be considered a change initiated by the taxpayer.


(2) In the case of a trade or business of a taxpayer to which paragraph (b)(1) does not apply, the election provided for in this section may be made for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973, by making the election not later than (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extensions of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the first taxable year for which the election is made.


(3) A taxpayer who elects under section 463 to treat vacation pay as provided in this section and who wishes to revoke such election may only do so with the consent of the Commissioner. Such revocation shall constitute a change in the method of accounting.


(c) *Manner of making election.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the election provided for in this section must be made by means of a statement attached to a timely filed income tax return. The statement shall indicate that the taxpayer is electing to apply the provisions of section 463, and shall contain the following information:


(i) The taxpayer's name and a description of each vacation pay plan to which the election is to apply.


(ii) A schedule with appropriate explanations showing—


(A) In the case of a vacation pay account established or maintained pursuant to I.T. 3956 and section 97 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, as amended, 


(*1*) The balance of each such vacation pay account maintained by the taxpayer, and


(*2*) The amount, determined as if the taxpayer had maintained a vacation pay account for the last taxable year ending before January 1, 1973, representing the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by employees, before the close of the taxable year and payable during such taxable year or within 12 months following the close of such taxable year.


(B) In the case of other vacation pay accounts, the amount of the closing balances the taxpayer would have had for the taxpayer's 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year for which the election was made, had the taxpayer maintained an account representing the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by the employees before the close of the taxable year and payable during the taxable year or within 12 months following the close of the taxable year throughout the 3 immediately preceding taxable years.


(iii) The amounts accrued and deducted for prior years for vacation pay but not paid at the close of the taxable year preceding the year for which the election is made.


(2) Where a taxpayer has filed its return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973 prior to July 21, 1975, and has not made the election pursuant to this section, the election may be made by filing an amended return (showing adjustments, in any) for such year and attaching the statement required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section on or before July 21, 1975.


(d) The time for making the election may be illustrated by the following examples:
