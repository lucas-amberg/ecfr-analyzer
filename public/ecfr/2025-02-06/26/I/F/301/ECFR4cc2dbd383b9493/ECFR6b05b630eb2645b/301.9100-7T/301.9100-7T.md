The election is available to taxpayers engaged in the business of farming, including producers of agricultural crops, livestock, nursery stock, sod, trees bearing fruit, nuts or other crops, and ornamental trees (for purposes of section 263A, an evergreen tree that is more than 6 years old at the time it is severed from the roots shall not be treated as an ornamental tree). The election is not available to a corporation, partnership, or tax shelter that is required to use the accrual method of accounting under section 447 or section 448(a)(3), or farming syndicates (as defined in section 464(c)), or with respect to the planting, cultivation, maintenance or development of pistachio trees. In addition, the election does not apply with respect to costs incurred for the planting, cultivation, maintenance or development of any citrus or almond grove incurred during the 4-taxable-year period beginning with the taxable year in which such grove was planted. If a citrus or almond grove is planted in more than one taxable year, the portion of the grove planted in one taxable year is treated as a separate grove for this purpose.

In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the election must be made at the partner or shareholder level. 


(3) *Election treated as if made if certain requirements satisfied.* A taxpayer eligible to make the election under section 263A(d)(3) shall be treated as having made the election if such taxpayer reports income and expense, in accordance with the rules under the election on a timely filed income tax return.

(5) *Special rules for treatment of expenses.* If the election is made, the plant or animal produced is treated as section 1245 property and gain is recaptured (treated as ordinary income) in the amount of deductions which, but for the election, would have been required to be capitalized with respect to the plant or animal. If the taxpayer or a related person makes the election, a non-accelerated method of depreciation (as defined in section 168(g)(2)) shall be applied to all property used predominantly in any farming business of the taxpayer or related person and placed in service in any taxable year during which the election is in effect.

Net income for the short taxable year resulting from a required change in accounting period under the provisions of section 806 of the Act which is to be included ratably in the partners' and S corporation shareholders' income for the first four taxable years (including the short taxable year) beginning after December 31, 1986, or included entirely in income for the short taxable year at the election of the partner or shareholder, shall be taken into account in accordance with section 702 (with respect to partners) and section 1366 (with respect to S corporation shareholders). 


(e) *Election with respect to reducing partnership or S corporation income for the short taxable year resulting from a required change in accounting period under section 806 of the Act by an unamortized adjustment amount existing as of October 22, 1986*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph applies to the election described in H.R. Rep. No. 99-841 at II-320. 


(2) *Partnerships or S corporations that make the election to reduce income for the short taxable year by an unamortized adjustment amount existing as of October 22, 1986.* Where a partnership or S corporation elects to reduce its income for the short taxable year required under the provisions of section 806 of the Act by the unamortized adjustment amount existing as of October 22, 1986, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the income for the short taxable year (reduced by the unamortized adjustment amount) may then be subject to the election, under section 806(e)(2)(C) of the Act, by partners and S corporation shareholders to include all the net income for the short taxable year entirely in income for the partners' or shareholders' taxable year with or within which the short taxable year ends. 


(3) *Partnerships or S corporations that do not make the election to reduce income for the short taxable year by an unamortized adjustment amount existing as of October 22, 1986.* Where a partnership or S corporation does not elect to reduce its income for the short taxable year created by the provisions of section 806 of the Act by the unamortized adjustment amount existing as of October 22, 1986, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the short taxable year required under the provisions of section 806 of the Act shall be considered one taxable year for purposes of amortizing the adjustment amount under the requirements of Rev. Proc. 72-51, 1972-2 C.B. 832, or Rev. Proc. 83-25, 1983-1 C.B. 689. The net income of the partnership or S corporation after reduction by the adjustment amount for the short taxable year may then be subject to the election under section 806(e)(2)(C) of the Act by partners or S corporation shareholders to include all the net income for the short taxable year entirely in income for the partners' or shareholders' taxable year with or within which the short taxable year of the partnership or S corporation ends.

See paragraph (i)(4) of this section for the effective date of revocations made under this paragraph (i).
