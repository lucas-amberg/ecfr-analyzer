(iii) *Freely revocable elections.* The election described in this section that is made under section 6011 of the Act is revocable without the consent of the Commissioner. (See section 121(c) of the Code and § 1.121-4 of the regulations.)

The election under section 42(j)(5)(B) of the Code must be made by the later of the due date of the certification or January 22, 1990. The election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii) must be made in accordance with the requirements of Notice 89-1, 1989-2 I.R.B. 10. 


(c) *Election to treat certain carryovers of disallowed investment interest expense as passive activity deductions.* The requirements of paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section do not apply to an election under section 1005(c)(11) of the Act. Instead, the election must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed in Notice 89-36, 1989-13 I.R.B. 6. Thus, the election must be made before the filing deadline specified in Notice 89-36 by amending previously filed returns to reflect any change in the computation of tax liability that results from the election. 


(d) *Election with respect to the treatment of reasonably estimated losses in an insolvent or bankrupt financial institution*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (d) applies to an election under section 905(a) of the 1986 Act, and to an election under section 1009(d) of the Act, both relating to section 165(l) of the Code. If— 


(i) As of the close of the taxable year, it can reasonably be estimated that there is a loss on a deposit (within the meaning of section 165(l)(4)) of a qualified individual (as defined in section 165(l)(2)) in a qualified financial institution (as defined in section 165(l)(3)), and 


(ii) Such loss is on account of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such institution, then the qualified individual may elect under either section 165(l)(1) or (5) (but not both), to treat the amount (subject to the applicable limitations if under section 165(l)(5)) so estimated for that taxable year as a loss described in either section 165(c)(3), relating to casualty losses, or section 165(c)(2), relating to transactions entered into for profit, and incurred during the taxable year.


This paragraph (d) includes the procedural and the principal substantive rules first issued in Notice 89-28. For specific rules relating to an election under section 165(1)(5), see paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 


(2) *Specific rules relating to the section 165(1)(5) election*—(i) *Applicability.* An election under section 165(1)(5) of the Code may be made only if no part of the taxpayer's deposits in the financial institution is federally insured. Generally, this requirement will be met only in cases in which none of the deposits in the financial institution are federally insured. 


(ii) *Dollar limitations.* An election under section 165(1)(5) of the Code is limited to $20,000 ($10,000 in the case of a separate return by a married individual) in aggregate losses on deposits in any one financial institution. The applicable dollar limit must be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds that can reasonably be expected to be received under any state law. 


(3) *Time and manner of determining loss and making the election*—(i) *Year of election and determination of loss.* A qualified individual may make an election under section 165(1) of the Code either for the first taxable year in which a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made or for a later taxable year that is prior to the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. The amount of the loss is determined by the difference between a taxpayer's basis in the deposits and the amount that is reasonably estimated to be recovered, taking into account all facts and circumstances reasonably available to the taxpayer as of the date the election is made. A reasonable estimate might be based, for example, on the percentage of total deposits likely to be recovered by the depositors according to a determination made by the regulatory authority or trustee having responsibility over the institution. In addition, the taxpayer's basis in the deposits must be reduced to the extent that a loss is claimed. 


(ii) *Time and manner of making election.* A qualified individual may make an election under section 165(1) of the Code on— 


(A) The income tax return for the taxable year with respect to which the taxpayer made a reasonable estimate of the loss; 


(B) An amended income tax return for a taxable year described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, if the period prescribed for filing a claim for refund or credit for that taxable year has not yet expired; or, if applicable, 


(C) An amended income tax return for a taxable year (beginning after December 31, 1981) described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, whether or not the claim for refund or credit is barred by another provision of law, but only if the amended return is properly filed on or before November 9, 1989. 


(iii) *Information to include with election.* The election should include any information requested in the applicable forms and instructions (e.g., Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts). If the applicable form(s) and instructions do not make reference to or request information concerning this election, the taxpayer should, on an appropriate line or space clearly indicate the name of the financial institution, include the following language: “Insolvent Financial Institution Election,” and include the calculation of the reasonably estimated loss claimed. 


(4) *Revocability of the election*—(i) *In general.* If a taxpayer desires to revoke an election under section 165(l) of the Code, the taxpayer must request, in writing, the consent of the Secretary setting forth the pertinent facts surrounding the election and the reasons for requesting a revocation. 


(ii) *Exception.* With respect to an election made under section 165(l)(1) of the Code prior to November 9, 1989, a qualified individual may revoke such election without securing the prior consent of the Secretary but only if the taxpayer makes an election under section 165(l)(5) by November 9, 1989, in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(5) *Effective date.* Paragraph (d) of this section is generally effective for elections made under section 165(1) of the Code on or after November 10, 1988. However, an election filed prior to February 24, 1989, that is made in any reasonable manner will be effective. 


(e) *Election to treat a survivor annuity payable to a surviving spouse as a nondeductible terminable interest.* Where the time for making the election under section 2056(b)(7)(C)(ii) of the Code to treat the survivor annuity as nondeductible otherwise expires before November 11, 1990, the election may be made before November 11, 1990, by filing with the Service Center where the original return was filed supplemental information under § 20.6081-1(c) of the Estate Tax Regulations containing: 


(1) A statement that the election under section 2056(b)(7)(C)(ii) of the Code is being made; 


(2) The applicable revised schedules; 


(3) A recomputation of the tax due; and 


(4) Payment of any additional tax due. 


(f) *Election to treat a joint and survivor annuity in which the donee spouse has a survivor interest as a nondeductible terminable interest.* Where the time for making the election under section 2523(f)(6)(B) of the Code to treat the interest as nondeductible otherwise expires before November 11, 1990, the election may be made before November 11, 1990, by filing with the appropriate Service Center an original return (or an amended return if an original return was filed) containing: 


(1) A statement that the election under section 2523(f)(6)(B) is being made;

The issuer must retain a copy of the election until 6 years after the date the last bond that is part of the issue is retired.
