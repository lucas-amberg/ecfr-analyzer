# § 301.7701-13   Pre-1970 domestic building and loan association.

(a) *In general.* For taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, and before July 12, 1969, the term “domestic building and loan association” means a domestic building and loan association, a domestic savings and loan association, a Federal savings and loan association, and any other savings institution chartered and supervised as a savings and loan or similar association under Federal or State law which meets supervisory test (described in paragraph (b) of this section), the business operations test (described in paragraph (c) of this section), and each of the various assets tests (described in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this section). For the definition of the term “domestic building and loan association”, for taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, see § 301.7701-13A.


(b) *Supervisory test.* A domestic building and loan association must be either (1) an insured institution within the meaning of section 401(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724 (a)) or (2) subject by law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority having supervision over such associations. An “insured institution” is one the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.


(c) *Business operations test*—(1) *In general.* An association must utilize its assets so that substantially all of its business consists of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the loans described in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section. The requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the prescribed loans includes ancillary or incidental activities which are directly and primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as advertising for savings, appraising property on which loans are to be made by the association, and inspecting the progress of construction in connection with construction loans. Even though an association meets the supervisory test in paragraph (b) and all the assets tests described in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, it will nevertheless not qualify as a domestic building and loan association if any substantial part of its business consists of activities which are not directly and primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as brokering mortgage paper, selling insurance, or subdividing real estate. However, an association will meet the business operations test for a taxable year if it meets the requirements of both subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (c), relating respectively to acquiring the savings of the public, and investing in loans.


(2) *Acquiring the savings of the public.* The requirement that substantially all of an association's business (other than investing in loans) must consist of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily will be considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material respects in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory authority. In addition, such requirement will be considered to be met if more than 85 percent of the dollar amount of the total deposits and withdrawable shares of the association are held during the taxable year by the general public as opposed to amounts deposited by family or related business groups or persons who are officers or directors of the association. The percentage specified in this subparagraph shall be computed as of the close of the taxable year, or at the option of the taxpayer, on the basis of the average of the amounts of deposits held during the year. Such average shall be determined by computing the percentage specified either as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained.


(3) *Investing in loans*—(i) *In general.* The requirement that substantially all of an association's business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) must consist of investing in the loans described in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section ordinarily will be considered to be met for a taxable year if the association meets both the gross income test described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, and the sales activity test described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. However, if an association does not meet the requirements of both subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, it will nevertheless meet the investing in loans requirement if it is able to demonstrate that substantially all its business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) consisted of investing in the prescribed loans. Transactions which are necessitated by exceptional circumstances and which are not undertaken as recurring business activities for profit will not be considered a substantial part of an association's business. Thus, for example, an association would meet the investing in loans requirement if it can establish that it failed to meet the gross income test because of receipt of a non-recurring item of income due to exceptional circumstances, or it failed to meet the sales activity test because of sales made to achieve necessary liquidity to meet abnormal withdrawals from savings accounts. For the purposes of this subparagraph, however, the acquisition of loans in anticipation of their sale to other financial institutions does not constitute “investing” in loans, even though such acquisition and sale resulted from an excess of demand for loans over savings capital in the association's area.


(ii) *Gross income test.* The gross income test is met if more than 85 percent of the gross income of an association consists of:


(*a*) Interest or dividends on assets defined in subparagraph (2), (3), or (4) of paragraph (d) of this section,


(*b*) Interest on loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section,


(*c*) Income attributable to the portion of property used in the association's business as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section,


(*d*) Premiums, discounts, commissions, or fees (including late charges and penalties) on loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section which have at some time been held by the association, or for which firm commitments have been issued,


(*e*) Gain or loss on the sale of governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or


(*f*) Income, gain, or loss attributable to foreclosed property (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section), but not including such income, gain, or loss which, pursuant to section 595 and the regulations thereunder, is not included in gross income.


(iii) *Sales activity test: in general.* The sales activity test is met for a taxable year if the association meets both the sales of whole loans test described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, and the sales of whole loans and participations test described in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph. For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions (iv), (v), and (vi) of this subparagraph:


(*a*) The term *loan* means loan as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, other than foreclosed property defined in such paragraph and governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(*b*) The amount of a loan shall be determined in accordance with the rules contained in paragraph (l) (1) and (2)(ii) of this section.


(*c*) The term *loans acquired for investment during the taxable year* means the amount of loans outstanding as of the close of the taxable year, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of loans outstanding as of the beginning of such year, and increased by the lesser of (*1*) the amount of repayments made on loans during the taxable year or (*2*) an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of loans outstanding as of the beginning of the taxable year. For this purpose, repayments do not include repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by the association.


(*d*) The term *sales of participations* means sales by an association of interests in loans, which sales meet the requirements of the regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board relating to sales of participations, or which meet substantially equivalent requirements of State law or regulations relating to sales of participations.


(*e*) The term *sales of whole loans* means sales of loans other than sales of participations as defined in subdivision (*d*) of this subdivision, but in determining the amount of sales of whole loans, the following sales shall be disregarded: Sales of loans made to other financial institutions pursuant to an arrangement whereunder the association simultaneously enters in a bona fide agreement to repurchase such loans within a period of 18 months from the time of sale if such arrangement conforms to the rules and regulations of applicable supervisory authorities; sales made to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or to a corporation defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section (relating to deposit insurance company securities); and sales made in the course of liquidation of the association pursuant to Federal or State law.


(iv) *Sales of whole loans test.* The sales of whole loans test is met for a taxable year if the amount of sales of whole loans during the taxable year does not exceed the greater of (*a*) 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment during the taxable year, or (*b*) 20 percent of the amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year. However, the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in subdivision (*b*) of the previous sentence shall be reduced by the number of percentage points (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a percentage point) which is equal to the sum of the 2 percentages obtained by dividing, for each of the 2 preceding taxable years, the amount of sales of whole loans during each such taxable year by the amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of such taxable year. For example, if the amounts of sales of whole loans made by a calendar year association in 1965 and 1966 were 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, of loans outstanding at the beginning of each such year, the amount of sales of whole loans allowed under such subdivision (*b*) for 1967 would be an amount equal to 13 percent (20 percent minus 7 percentage points) of loans outstanding at the beginning of 1967. In computing the reduction to the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in such subdivision (*b),* sales of whole loans made before January 1, 1964, shall not be taken into account.


(v) *Sales of whole loans and participations test.* The sales of whole loans and participations test is met if the sum of the amount of sales of whole loans and the amount of sales of participations during the taxable year does not exceed 100 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment during the taxable year.


(vi) *Sales activity tests: special rules*—(*a*) *Carryover of sales.* The amount specified in subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph as the maximum amount of sales of whole loans shall be increased by the amount by which 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment by the association during the 2 preceding taxable years exceeds the amount of sales of whole loans made during such preceding taxable years; and the amount specified in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph as the maximum amount of sales of whole loans and participations shall be increased by the amount by which the amount of loans acquired for investment by the association during the 2 preceding taxable years exceeds the sum of the amount of sales of whole loans and participations made during such preceding taxable years. For example, if 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 and 1966 exceeded the amount of sales of whole loans during such years by $250,000, the amount of sales of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision (iv)(*a*) of this subparagraph would be increased by $250,000.


(*b*) *Use of preceding year's base.* If the amount of loans acquired for investment by the association during the preceding taxable year exceeds such amount for the current taxable year, the 15 percent limitation provided in subdivision (iv)(*a*) of this subparagraph and the 100 percent limitation provided in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph shall be based upon such preceding taxable year's amount. However, the maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under subdivision (iv)(*a*) and the maximum amount of sales of whole loans and participations permitted under subdivision (v) in any taxable year shall be reduced by the amount of the increase in such sales allowed for the preceding taxable year solely by reason of the application of the provisions of the previous sentence. For example, assuming no carryover of sales under subdivision (*a*) of this subdivision, if the amount of loans acquired for investment by a calendar year association was $1,000,000 in 1965, under subdivision (iv)(*a*) of this subparagraph the association could make sales of whole loans in 1966 of $150,000 (15 percent of $1,000,000) even though the amount of its loans acquired for investment during 1966 was only $800,000. However, the amount of sales of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision (iv)(*a*) of this subparagraph would be reduced to the extent that the amount of the sales of whole loans made by the association during 1966 exceeded $120,000 (15 percent of $800,000).


(vii) *Examples illustrating sales activity test.* The provisions of subdivisions (iii) through (vi) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that the association is a calendar year taxpayer which is operated in all material respects in conformity with applicable rules and regulations of Federal or State supervisory authorities.


(viii) *Reporting requirements.* In the case of income tax returns for taxable years ending after October 31, 1964, there shall be filed with the return a statement showing the amount of gross income for the taxable year in each of the categories described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph; and, for the taxable year and the two preceding taxable years, the amount of loans (described in subdivision (iii)(*a*) of this subparagraph) outstanding at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year, the amount of repayments on loans (not including repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by the association), the amount of sales of whole loans, and the amount of sales of participations.


(4) *Effective date.* The provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph (c), are applicable to taxable years ending after October 31, 1964. However, at the option of the taxpayer, for a taxable year beginning before November 1, 1964, and ending after October 31, 1964, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph (except the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in subdivision (iv)(*b*) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c)) shall apply only to the part year falling after October 31, 1964, as if such part year constituted a taxable year. In such case, the following rules shall apply:


(i) The amount of the “loans acquired for investment” for such part year shall be equal to the loans acquired for investment during the entire taxable year within which falls such part year, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such part year and the denominator of which is the number of days in such entire taxable year.


(ii) The increase in sales of whole loans and participations permitted by subdivision (vi) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c), (relating to carryover of sales and use of preceding year's base) shall be the amount of such increase computed under such subdivision, multiplied by the fraction specified in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.


(d) *90 percent of assets test*—(1) *In general.* At least 90 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association must consist of the assets defined in subparagraphs (2) through (10) of this paragraph (d). For purposes of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the association originated the loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this paragraph (d), or purchased or otherwise acquired them in whole or in part from another. See paragraph (j) of this section for definition of certain terms used in this paragraph, and paragraph (k) of this section for the determination of amount and character of loans.


(2) *Cash.* The term “cash” means cash on hand, and time or demand deposits with, or withdrawable accounts in, other financial institutions.


(3) *Governmental obligations.* The term “governmental obligations” means obligations of the United States, a State or political subdivision of a State, and stock or obligations of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United States, a State, or political subdivision of a State.


(4) *Deposit insurance company securities.* The term “deposit insurance company securities” means certificates of deposit in, or obligations of, a corporation organized under a State law which specifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share accounts of member associations.


(5) *Property used in the association's business*—(i) *In general.* The term “property used in the association's business” means land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold interests, leasehold improvements, and other assets used by the association in the conduct of its business of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this paragraph (d). Real property held for the purpose of being used primarily as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used in the association's business so long as it is reasonably anticipated that such property will be occupied for such use by the association, or that construction work preparatory to such occupancy will be commenced thereon, within 2 years after acquisition of the property. Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used in such business. Real property held by an association for investment or sale, even for the purpose of obtaining mortgage loans thereon, does not constitute property used in the association's business.


(ii) *Property rented to others.* Except as provided in the second sentence of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, property or a portion thereof rented by the association to others does not constitute property used in the association's business. However, if the fair rental value of the rented portion of a single piece of real property (including appurtenant parcels) used as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes less than 50 percent of the fair rental value of such piece of property, or if such property has an adjusted basis of not more than $150,000, the entire property shall be considered used in such business. If such rented portion constitutes 50 percent or more of the fair rental value of such piece of property, and such property has an adjusted basis of more than $150,000, an allocation of its adjusted basis is required. The portion of the total adjusted basis of such piece of property which is deemed to be property used in the association's business shall be equal to an amount which bears the same ratio to such total adjusted basis as the amount of the fair rental value of the portion used as the principal or branch office of the association bears to the total fair rental value of such property. In the case of all property other than real property used or to be used as the principal or branch office of the association, if the fair rental value of the rented portion thereof constitutes less than 15 percent of the fair rental value of such property, the entire property shall be considered used in the association's business. If such rented portion constitutes 15 percent or more of the fair rental value of such property, an allocation of its adjusted basis (in the same manner as required for real property used as the principal or branch office) is required.


(6) *Passbook loan.* The term “passbook loan” means a loan to the extent secured by a deposit, withdrawable share, or savings account in the association, or share of a member of the association, with respect to which a distribution is allowable as a deduction under section 591.


(7) *Home loan.* The term “home loan” means a loan secured by an interest in—


(i) Improved residential real property consisting of a structure or structures containing, in the aggregate, no more than 4 family units.


(ii) An individually owned family unit in a multiple-unit structure, the owner of which unit owns an undivided interest in the underlying real estate and the common elements of such structure (so-called condominium type).


(8) *Church loan.* The term “church loan” means a loan secured by an interest in real property which is used primarily for church purposes, or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term “church purposes” means the ministration of sacerdotal functions, the conduct of religious worship and closely associated activities designed primarily to provide fellowship among members of the congregation, or the instruction of religion. Thus, a parish hall would normally qualify as property used primarily for church purposes, whereas a building used primarily to furnish education, other than the instruction of religion, would not.


(9) *Multifamily loan.* The term “multifamily loan” means a loan, other than one defined in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph (d), (relating to a home loan), secured by an interest in improved residential real property or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property.


(10) *Nonresidential real property loan.* The term “nonresidential real property loan” means a loan, other than one defined in subparagraph (7), (8), or (9) of this paragraph (d), (relating respectively to a home loan, church loan, and multifamily loan) secured by an interest in real property, or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property.


(e) *18 percent of assets test.* Not more than 18 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (9) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, the sum of the amounts of the nonresidential real property loans and the assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 18 percent of total assets.


(f) *36 or 41 percent of assets test*—(1) *36 percent test.* Unless subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), applies, not more than 36 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, unless subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), applies, the sum of the amounts of multifamily loans, nonresidential real property loans, and assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 36 percent of total assets.


(2) *41 percent test.* If this subparagraph applies, not more than 41 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, if this subparagraph applies, the sum of the amounts of multifamily loans, nonresidential real property loans, and assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 41 percent of total assets. See section 593(b)(5) and the regulations thereunder for the effect of application of this subparagraph on the allowable addition to the reserves for bad debts.


(g) *Taxable years for which 41 percent of assets test applies*—(1) *First taxable year.* For an association's first taxable year beginning after October 16, 1962, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies.


(2) *Second taxable year.* For an association's second taxable year beginning after October 16, 1962, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies if such association met all the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (h), and either subparagraph (1) or (2) of paragraph (f) for its first taxable year.


(3) *Years other than first and second taxable years.* For any taxable year of an association beginning after October 16, 1962, other than its first and second taxable years beginning after such date, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies if such association met either—


(i) The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h) of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, or


(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(2), and (h) of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, and the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h) of this section for the second preceding taxable year.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of paragraph (f) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that the association at all times meets all the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) and (h) of this section and files its returns on a calendar year basis.


(h) *3 percent of assets test.* Not more than 3 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of stock of any corporation, unless such stock is property which is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The stock which constitutes property defined in such paragraph (d) is:


(1) Stock representing a withdrawable account in another financial institution;


(2) Stock of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United States or of a State or political subdivision thereof;


(3) Stock which was security for a loan and which, by reason of having been bid in at foreclosure or otherwise having been reduced to ownership or possession of the association, is a loan within the definition of such term in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and


(4) Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the principal or branch office of the association.


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Definition of certain terms.* For purposes of this section—


(1) *Loan.* The term “loan” means debt, as the term “debt” is used in section 166 and the regulations thereunder. The term “loan” also includes a redeemable ground rent (as defined in section 1055(c)) which is owned by the taxpayer, and any property (referred to in this section as “foreclosed property”) which was security for the payment of any indebtedness and which has been bid in at foreclosure, or otherwise been reduced to ownership or possession of the association by agreement or process of law, whether or not such property was acquired subsequent to December 31, 1962.


(2) *Secured.* A loan will be considered as “secured” only if the loan is on the security of any instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or land contract) which makes the interest of the debtor in the property described therein specific security for the payment of the loan, provided that such instrument is of such a nature that, in the event of default, the interest of the debtor in such property could be subjected to the satisfaction of the loan with the same priority as a mortgage or deed of trust in the jurisdiction in which the property is situated.


(3) *Interest.* The word “interest” means an interest in real property which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property is situated, constitutes either (i) an interest in fee in such property, (ii) a leasehold interest in such property extending or renewable automatically for a period of at least 30 years, or at least 10 years beyond the date scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an interest in such property, (iii) a leasehold interest in property described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section (relating to certain home loans) extending for a period of at least 2 years beyond the date scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an interest in such property or (iv) a leasehold interest in such property held subject to a redeemable ground rent defined in section 1055(c).


(4) *Real property.* The term “real property” means any property which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property is situated, constitutes real property.


(5) *Improved real property.* The term “improved real property” means—


(i) Land on which is located any building of a permanent nature (such as a house, apartment house, office building, hospital, shopping center, warehouse, garage, or other similar permanent structure), provided that the value of such building is substantial in relation to the value of such land;


(ii) Any building lot or site which, by reason of installations and improvements that have been completed in keeping with applicable governmental requirements and with general practice in the community, is a building lot or site ready for the construction of any building of a permanent nature within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph; or


(iii) Real property which, because of its state of improvement, produces sufficient income to maintain such real property and retire the loan in accordance with the terms thereof.


(6) *Construction loan.* The term “construction loan” means a loan, the proceeds of which are to be disbursed to the borrower (either by the association or a third party) as construction work progresses on real property which is security for the loan, which property is, or from the proceeds of such loan will become, improved real property.


(7) *Improvement loan.* The term “improvement loan” means a loan which, by its terms and conditions, requires that the proceeds of the loan be used for altering, repairing, or improving real property. If more than 85 percent of the proceeds of a single loan are to be used for such purposes, the entire loan will qualify. If 85 percent or less of the proceeds of a loan are to be used for such purposes, an allocation of its adjusted basis is required. Examples of loans which constitute improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of painting a house, adding a new room to a house, remodeling the lobby of an apartment building, and purchasing and installing storm windows, storm doors, and awnings. Examples of loans which do not constitute improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of purchasing draperies, and removable appliances, such as refrigerators, ranges, and washing machines. It is not necessary that a loan be secured by the real property which is altered, repaired, or improved.


(8) *Residential real property.* The term “residential real property” means real property which consists of one or more family units. A family unit is a building or portion thereof which contains complete living facilities which are to be used on other than a transient basis by only one family consisting of one or more persons. Thus, an apartment which is to be used on other than a transient basis by one family, which contains complete facilities for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation constitutes a family unit. Hotels, motels, dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, rooming houses, hospitals, sanitariums, rest homes, and parks and courts for mobile homes do not normally constitute residential real property.


(k) *Amount and character of loans*—(1) *Treatment at time of determination*—(i) *In general.* The amount of a loan, as of the time the determination required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (k), is made, shall be treated for the purposes of this section as being secured:


(*a*) First by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph (6), (7), or (8) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value thereof;


(*b*) Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph (9) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value thereof; and


(*c*) Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph (10) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value thereof.


(ii) *Loans of $40,000 or less.* Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, in the case of loans amounting to $40,000 or less as of the time of a determination, made on the security of property which is a combination of two or more categories or property defined in subparagraph (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section, all such loans for any taxable year may, at the option of the association, be treated for the purposes of this section as being secured by the category of property the loan value of which constitutes the largest percentage of the total loan value of the property except to the extent that the loan is treated as property not defined in paragraph (d) of this section.


(iii) *Home loans of $20,000 or less.* Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, if a loan amounting to $20,000 or less as of the time of a determination, is secured partly by property of a category described in subparagraph (7) of paragraph (d) of this section (relating to a home loan), the amount of the loan shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a loan described in such subparagraph except to the extent that the loan is treated as property not defined in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) *Treatment subsequent to time of determination.* The amount of a loan outstanding as of any time subsequent to the time of a determination shall be treated, for the purposes of this section, as being secured by each of the categories of property in the same ratio that the amount which was treated as being secured by each category bore to the total amount of the loan at the time as of which the determination was last made with respect to such loan.


(3) *Time of determination*—(i) *In general.* The determination of the amount of a loan which is treated as being secured by each of the categories of property shall be made:


(*a*) As of the time a loan is made;


(*b*) As of the time a loan is increased;


(*c*) As of the time any portion of the property which was security for the loan is released; and


(*d*) As of any time required by applicable Federal or State regulatory authorities for reappraisal or reanalysis of such loans.


(ii) *Special rule.* In the case of loans outstanding with respect to which no event described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph has occurred in a taxable year beginning on or after October 17, 1962, the determination of the amounts of such loans which are treated as being secured by each of the categories of property may be made, at the option of the association, as of the close of the first taxable year beginning on or after such date, providing the determinations with respect to all such loans are made as of such date.


(4) *Loan value.* The loan value of property which is security for a loan is the maximum amount at the time as of which the determination is made which the association is permitted to lend on such property under the rules and regulations of applicable Federal and State regulatory authorities. Such loan value shall not exceed the fair market value of such property at such time as determined under such rules and regulations. However, in the case of loans made incidentally with and as a part of a bona fide salvage operation, the loan value of the security property shall be considered to be the face amount of the loan where the loan can be shown by the association to have been made for the primary purpose of recovering the investment of the association, and where such salvage operation is in conformity with rules and regulations of applicable Federal or State regulatory authorities.


(5) *Examples.* The following examples, in each of which it is assumed that X Savings and Loan Association files its return on a calendar year basis, illustrate the application of the rules in this paragraph:


(l) *Computation of percentages*—(1) *In general.* The percentages specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section shall, except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l), be computed by comparing the amount of the assets described in each paragraph as of the close of the taxable year with the total amount of assets as of the close of the taxable year. The amount of the assets in any category and the total amount of assets shall be determined with reference to their adjusted basis under § 1.1011-1, or by such other method as is in accordance with sound accounting principles, provided such method is used in valuing all the assets in a taxable year.


(2) *Treatment of certain assets and reserves.* For purposes of this paragraph (l):


(i) Reserves for bad debts established pursuant to section 593, or corresponding provisions of prior law, and the regulations thereunder shall not constitute a reduction of total assets, but shall be treated as a surplus or net worth item.


(ii) The adjusted basis of a “loan in process” does not include the unadvanced portion of such loan.


(iii) Advances made by the association for taxes, insurance, etc., on loans shall be treated as being in the same category as the loan with respect to which the advances are made (irrespective of whether the advances are secured by the property securing the loan).


(iv) Interest receivable included in gross income shall be treated as being in the same category as the loan or asset with respect to which it is earned.


(v) The unamortized portion of premiums paid on mortgage loans acquired by the association shall be considered part of the acquisition cost of such loans.


(vi) Prepaid Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation premiums shall be treated as being governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(vii) Accounts receivable (other than accrued interest receivable), and prepaid expenses and deferred charges other than those referred to in subdivision (v) or (vi) of this subparagraph, shall be disregarded both as separate categories and in the computation of total assets.


(viii) Foreclosed property (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) shall be treated as having the same character as the loan for which it was given as security.


(3) *Alternative method.* At the option of the taxpayer, the percentages specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section may be computed on the basis of the average assets outstanding during the taxable year. Such average shall be determined by making the computation provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (l), either as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained for each category. The method selected must be applied uniformly for the taxable year to all categories of assets, but the method may be changed from year to year.


(4) *Acquisition of certain assets.* For the purpose of the annual computation of percentages under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (l)—


(i) Assets which, within a 60-day period beginning in one taxable year of the taxpayer and ending in the next year, are acquired directly or indirectly through borrowing and then repaid or disposed of within such period, shall be considered assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section, unless both the acquisition and disposition are established to the satisfaction of the district director to have been for bona fide purposes; and


(ii) The amount of cash shall not include amounts received directly or indirectly from another financial institution (other than a Federal Home Loan Bank or a similar institution organized under State law) to the extent of the amount of cash which an association has on deposit or holds as a withdrawable account in such other financial institution.


(5) *Reporting requirements.* In the case of income tax returns for taxable years ending after October 31, 1964, there shall be filed with the return a statement showing the amount of assets as of the close of the taxable year in each of the categories defined in paragraph (d), and in the category described in paragraph (h) of this section, and a brief description and amount of all other assets. If the alternative method of computing percentages under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l) is selected, such statement shall show such information as of the end of each month, each quarter, or semiannually and the manner of calculating the averages. With respect to taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, and ending before November 1, 1964, taxpayers shall maintain adequate records to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that it meets the various assets tests specified in this section.


(6) *Example.* The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example in which a description of the assets, the subparagraph of paragraph (d) in which the assets are defined, the amount of the assets, and the percentage of the total assets included in the calculation are set forth.


(m) *Taxable years beginning before October 17, 1962.* For taxable years beginning before October 17, 1962, the term “domestic building and loan association” means a domestic building and loan association, a domestic savings and loan association, and a Federal savings and loan association substantially all the business of which is confined to making loans to members.
