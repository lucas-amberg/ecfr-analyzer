# § 301.7701-2   Business entities; definitions.

(a) *Business entities.* For purposes of this section and § 301.7701-3, a *business entity* is any entity recognized for federal tax purposes (including an entity with a single owner that may be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3) that is not properly classified as a trust under § 301.7701-4 or otherwise subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. A business entity with two or more members is classified for federal tax purposes as either a corporation or a partnership. A business entity with only one owner is classified as a corporation or is disregarded; if the entity is disregarded, its activities are treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, branch, or division of the owner. But see paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) through (vii) of this section for special rules that apply to an eligible entity that is otherwise disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.


(b) *Corporations.* For federal tax purposes, the term *corporation* means—


(1) A business entity organized under a Federal or State statute, or under a statute of a federally recognized Indian tribe, if the statute describes or refers to the entity as incorporated or as a corporation, body corporate, or body politic;


(2) An association (as determined under § 301.7701-3);


(3) A business entity organized under a State statute, if the statute describes or refers to the entity as a joint-stock company or joint-stock association;


(4) An insurance company;


(5) A State-chartered business entity conducting banking activities, if any of its deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1811 *et seq.,* or a similar federal statute;


(6) A business entity wholly owned by a State or any political subdivision thereof, or a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government or any other entity described in § 1.892-2T; 


(7) A business entity that is taxable as a corporation under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 7701(a)(3); and


(8) *Certain foreign entities*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8)(ii) and (d) of this section, the following business entities formed in the following jurisdictions:


(ii) *Clarification of list of corporations in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section*—(A) *Exceptions in certain cases.* The following entities will not be treated as corporations under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section:


(*1*) With regard to Canada, a Nova Scotia Unlimited Liability Company (or any other company or corporation all of whose owners have unlimited liability pursuant to federal or provincial law).


(*2*) With regard to India, a company deemed to be a public limited company solely by operation of section 43A(1) (relating to corporate ownership of the company), section 43A(1A) (relating to annual average turnover), or section 43A(1B) (relating to ownership interests in other companies) of the Companies Act, 1956 (or any combination of these), provided that the organizational documents of such deemed public limited company continue to meet the requirements of section 3(1)(iii) of the Companies Act, 1956.


(*3*) With regard to Malaysia, a Sendirian Berhad.


(B) *Inclusions in certain cases.* With regard to Mexico, the term Sociedad Anonima includes a Sociedad Anonima that chooses to apply the variable capital provision of Mexican corporate law (Sociedad Anonima de Capital Variable).


(iii) *Public companies.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, with regard to Cyprus, Hong Kong, and Jamaica, the term Public Limited Company includes any Limited Company that is not defined as a private company under the corporate laws of those jurisdictions. In all other cases, where the term Public Limited Company is not defined, that term shall include any Limited Company defined as a public company under the corporate laws of the relevant jurisdiction.


(iv) *Limited companies.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(8), any reference to a Limited Company includes, as the case may be, companies limited by shares and companies limited by guarantee.


(v) *Multilingual countries.* Different linguistic renderings of the name of an entity listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section shall be disregarded. For example, an entity formed under the laws of Switzerland as a Societe Anonyme will be a corporation and treated in the same manner as an Aktiengesellschaft.


(b)(9) *Business entities with multiple charters.* (i) An entity created or organized under the laws of more than one jurisdiction if the rules of this section would treat it as a corporation with reference to any one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Such an entity may elect its classification under § 301.7701-3, subject to the limitations of those provisions, only if it is created or organized in each jurisdiction in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in § 301.7701-3(a). The determination of a business entity's corporate or non-corporate classification is made independently from the determination of whether the entity is domestic or foreign. See § 301.7701-5 for the rules that determine whether a business entity is domestic or foreign.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rule of this paragraph (b)(9):


(c) *Other business entities.* For federal tax purposes—


(1) The term *partnership* means a business entity that is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section and that has at least two members.


(2) *Wholly owned entities*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.


(ii) *Special rule for certain business entities.* If the single owner of a business entity is a bank (as defined in section 581, or, in the case of a foreign bank, as defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) without regard to the second sentence thereof), then the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code will continue to apply to the single owner as if the wholly owned entity were a separate entity. For this purpose, the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code do not include the rules under sections 864(c), 882(c), and 884. 


(iii) *Tax liabilities of certain disregarded entities*—(A) *In general.* An entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of—


(*1*) Federal tax liabilities of the entity with respect to any taxable period for which the entity was not disregarded;


(*2*) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the entity is liable; and


(*3*) Refunds or credits of Federal tax.


(B) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section:


(iv) *Special rule for employment tax purposes*— 


(A) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (relating to certain wholly owned entities) does not apply to taxes imposed under Subtitle C—Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24, and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code).


(B) *Treatment of entity.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as a corporation with respect to taxes imposed under Subtitle C—Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24, and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code). For special rules regarding the application of certain employment tax exceptions, see §§ 31.3121(b)(3)-1(d), 31.3127-1(b), and 31.3306(c)(5)-1(d) of this chapter.






(C) *Special rules.* (*1*) Paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section do not apply to withholding requirements imposed by section 3406 (backup withholding). Thus, in the case of an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section, the owner is subject to the withholding requirements imposed by section 3406 (backup withholding).




(*2*) Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to taxes imposed under subtitle A of the Code, including Chapter 2—Tax on Self-Employment Income. Thus, an entity that is treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship under paragraph (a) of this section is not treated as a corporation for purposes of employing its owner; instead, the entity is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for this purpose and is not the employer of its owner. The owner will be subject to self-employment tax on self-employment income with respect to the entity's activities. Also, if a partnership is the owner of an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section, the entity is not treated as a corporation for purposes of employing a partner of the partnership that owns the entity; instead, the entity is disregarded as an entity separate from the partnership for this purpose and is not the employer of any partner of the partnership that owns the entity. A partner of a partnership that owns an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is subject to the same self-employment tax rules as a partner of a partnership that does not own an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section.








(D) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section:


(v) *Special rule for certain excise tax purposes*—(A) *In general.* Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (relating to certain wholly owned entities) does not apply for purposes of—


(*1*) Federal tax liabilities imposed by Chapters 31, 32 (other than section 4181), 33, 34, 35, 36 (other than section 4461), 38, and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any floor stocks tax imposed on articles subject to any of these taxes;


(*2*) Collection of tax imposed by Chapters 33 and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code;


(*3*) Registration under sections 4101, 4222, 4412;


(*4*) Claims of a credit (other than a credit under section 34), refund, or payment related to a tax described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(*1*) of this section or under section 6426 or 6427; and 


(*5*) Assessment and collection of an assessable payment imposed by section 4980H and reporting required by section 6056.


(B) *Treatment of entity.* An entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as a corporation with respect to items described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section.


(C) *Example.* The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2)(v):


(vi) *Special rule for reporting under section 6038A*—(A) *In general.* An entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as an entity separate from its owner and classified as a corporation for purposes of section 6038A if—


(*1*) The entity is a domestic entity; and


(*2*) One foreign person has direct or indirect sole ownership of the entity.


(B) *Definitions*—(*1*) *Indirect sole ownership.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(A)(*2*) of this section, indirect sole ownership means ownership by one person entirely through one or more other entities disregarded as entities separate from their owners or through one or more grantor trusts, regardless of whether any such disregarded entity or grantor trust is domestic or foreign.


(*2*) *Entity disregarded as separate from its owner.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(B)(*1*) of this section, an entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is an entity described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(*3*) *Grantor trust.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(B)(*1*) of this section, a grantor trust is any portion of a trust that is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under subpart E of subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code.


(C) *Taxable year.* The taxable year of an entity classified as a corporation for section 6038A purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is—


(*1*) The same as the taxable year of the foreign person described in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(A)(*2*) of this section, if that foreign person has a U.S. income tax or information return filing obligation for its taxable year; or


(*2*) The calendar year, if paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(C)(*1*) of this section does not apply, unless otherwise provided in forms, instructions, or published guidance.


(vii) *Special rules for certain disregarded payments*—(A) *Disregarded payment loss rules.* To the extent provided in § 1.1503(d)-1(d) of this chapter, certain payments involving a business entity that, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is otherwise disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, are in effect taken into account as if the entity were regarded and the deduction was denied, and therefore give rise to an income inclusion, and corresponding suspended deduction, to the entity's owner.


(B) *Non-application of the sixty-month limitation.* If an eligible entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner would become a disregarded payment entity (within the meaning of § 1.1503(d)-1(d)(5)(i)(A) of this chapter) when this paragraph (c)(2)(vii) applies, the sixty-month limitation under § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv) does not apply with respect to an election by such eligible entity to change its classification to an association effective before January 1, 2026 (such that it would not become a disregarded payment entity).












(d) *Special rule for certain foreign business entities*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a foreign business entity described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section will not be treated as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section if—


(i) The entity was in existence on May 8, 1996;


(ii) The entity's classification was relevant (as defined in § 301.7701-3(d)) on May 8, 1996;


(iii) No person (including the entity) for whom the entity's classification was relevant on May 8, 1996, treats the entity as a corporation for purposes of filing such person's federal income tax returns, information returns, and withholding documents for the taxable year including May 8, 1996;


(iv) Any change in the entity's claimed classification within the sixty months prior to May 8, 1996, occurred solely as a result of a change in the organizational documents of the entity, and the entity and all members of the entity recognized the federal tax consequences of any change in the entity's classification within the sixty months prior to May 8, 1996;


(v) A reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) existed on May 8, 1996, for treating the entity as other than a corporation; and


(vi) Neither the entity nor any member was notified in writing on or before May 8, 1996, that the classification of the entity was under examination (in which case the entity's classification will be determined in the examination).


(2) *Binding contract rule.* If a foreign business entity described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section is formed after May 8, 1996, pursuant to a written binding contract (including an accepted bid to develop a project) in effect on May 8, 1996, and all times thereafter, in which the parties agreed to engage (directly or indirectly) in an active and substantial business operation in the jurisdiction in which the entity is formed, paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be applied to that entity by substituting the date of the entity's formation for May 8, 1996.


(3) *Termination of grandfather status*—(i) *In general.* An entity that is not treated as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section by reason of paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section will be treated permanently as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section from the earliest of:


(A) The effective date of an election to be treated as an association under § 301.7701-3;


(B) A termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) (regarding sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the total interest in an entity's capital or profits within a twelve month period);


(C) A division of the partnership under section 708(b)(2)(B); or


(D) The date any person or persons, who were not owners of the entity as of November 29, 1999, own in the aggregate a 50 percent or greater interest in the entity.


(ii) *Special rule for certain entities.* For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section shall not apply if the sale or exchange of interests in the entity is to a related person (within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)) and occurs no later than twelve months after the date of the formation of the entity.






(e) *Effective/applicability date.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the rules of this section apply as of January 1, 1997, except that paragraph (b)(6) of this section applies on or after January 14, 2002, to a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government regardless of any prior entity classification, and paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after January 12, 2001.
