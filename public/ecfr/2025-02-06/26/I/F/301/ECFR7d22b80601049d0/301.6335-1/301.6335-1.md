# § 301.6335-1   Sale of seized property.

(a) *In general.* Section 6335 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and this section provide the rules under which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) conducts sales of property seized by levy.


(b) *Notice of seizure*—(1) *Issuance and delivery.* As soon as practicable after seizure of property, the IRS must give written notice to the property's owner (or, in the case of personal property, to the property's possessor). The written notice must be delivered to the owner (or to the possessor, in the case of personal property) or left at the owner's usual place of abode or business if there is such within the internal revenue district in which the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to the owner's last known address. For purposes of this section, the term *internal revenue district* means an internal revenue district within the meaning of section 7621 of the Code and includes an IRS field collection territory or other successor IRS subdivision or office.


(2) *Contents.* The notice of seizure must specify the sum demanded and contain, in the case of personal property, a list sufficient to identify the property seized and, in the case of real property, a description with reasonable certainty of the property seized.






(c) *Notice of sale.* 

(1) *In general.* As soon as practicable after seizure of the property, the IRS must give notice of sale in writing to the owner. Such notice will be delivered to the owner or left at the owner's usual place of abode or business if located within the internal revenue district in which the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to the owner's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, *see* § 301.6212-2. The notice must specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof, and must expressly state that only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to such property is to be offered for sale. The notice will also be published in some newspaper published in the county wherein the seizure is made or in a newspaper generally circulated in that county. For example, if a newspaper of general circulation in a county but not published in that county will reach more potential bidders for the property to be sold than a newspaper published within the county, or if there is a newspaper of general circulation within the county but no newspaper published within the county, the IRS may publish the notice of sale in the newspaper of general circulation within the county. If there is no newspaper published or generally circulated in the county, the notice will be posted at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, to the extent authorized under law, and in not less than two other public places.


(2) *Alternative methods.* The IRS may use other methods of giving notice of sale and of advertising seized property, in addition to those referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the IRS believes that the nature of the seized property to be sold is such that a wider or more specialized advertising coverage will enhance the possibility of obtaining a higher price for the seized property.








(3) *Exception.* Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a) (relating to cases in which collection is in jeopardy), a public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to perishable goods) is applicable.


(d) *Time, place, manner, and conditions of sale.* The time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale of property seized by levy shall be as follows:




(1) *Time and place of sale.* The sale will be held at the time and place stated in the notice of sale. The time of sale will not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under section 6335(b) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section. The place of an in-person sale will be within the county in which the property is seized, except such sale may be held at a place outside that county if the IRS determines, by special order of a delegated official, that substantially higher bids may be obtained for the property by holding the sale in such other county. The place of an online sale will generally be the county in which the property is seized. If, based on the facts and circumstances, the IRS determines that the place of an online sale is not within the county in which the property is seized, the sale may be conducted online by special order when doing so would be more efficient or would likely result in more competitive bids.


(2) *Adjournment of sale.* When it appears that an adjournment of the sale will best serve the interest of the United States or that of the taxpayer, the IRS may adjourn the sale from time to time, but the date of the sale will not be later than one month after the date fixed in the original notice of sale.












(3) *Determinations relating to minimum price*—(i) *Minimum price.* Before the sale of property seized by levy, the IRS will determine a minimum price, taking into account the expenses of levy and sale, for which the property must be sold. The IRS will either announce the minimum price before the sale begins or defer announcement of the minimum price until after the receipt of the highest bid, in which case, if the highest bid is greater than the minimum price, no announcement of the minimum price will be made.


(ii) *Purchase by the United States.* Before the sale of seized property, the IRS will determine whether the purchase of the property by the United States at the minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States. In determining whether the purchase of the property would be in the best interest of the United States, the IRS may consider all relevant facts and circumstances including, for example—


(A) Marketability of property;


(B) Cost of maintaining the property;


(C) Cost of repairing or restoring the property;


(D) Cost of transporting the property;


(E) Cost of safeguarding the property;


(F) Cost of potential toxic waste cleanup; and


(G) Other factors pertinent to the type of property.




(4) *Disposition of property at sale*—(i) *Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price.* If one or more persons offer to buy the property for at least the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be sold to the highest bidder.


(ii) *Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price.* If no one offers at least the amount of the minimum price for the property and the Secretary has determined that it would be in the best interest of the United States to purchase the property for the minimum price, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States for the minimum price.




(iii) *Release to owner.* If the property is not declared to be sold under paragraph (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, the property will be released to the owner of the property and the expense of the levy and sale will be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the United States made the levy. Any property released under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii) will remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C of chapter 64 of subtitle F of the Code.




(5) *Offering of property*—(i) *Sale of indivisible property.* If any property levied upon is not divisible, so as to enable the IRS by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses of levy and sale, the whole of such property will be sold. For application of surplus proceeds of sale, *see* section 6342(b) of the Code.


(ii) *Separately, in groups, or in the aggregate.* The IRS, in selecting how seized property will be offered for sale, will consider which method is likely to produce the highest total sales price as well as which method is most feasible. The seized property may be offered for sale—


(A) As separate items,


(B) As groups of items,


(C) In the aggregate, or


(D) Both as separate items (or in groups) and in the aggregate, in which case, the property will be sold under the method that produces the highest aggregate amount.










(iii) *Condition of title and of property.* Only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to the property seized shall be offered for sale, and such interest shall be offered subject to any prior outstanding mortgages, encumbrances, or other liens in favor of third parties which are valid as against the delinquent taxpayer and are superior to the lien of the United States. All seized property shall be offered for sale “as is” and “where is” and without recourse against the United States. No guaranty or warranty, express or implied, shall be made by the internal revenue officer offering the property for sale, as to the validity of the title, quality, quantity, weight, size, or condition of any of the property, or its fitness for any use or purpose. No claim shall be considered for allowance or adjustment or for rescission of the sale based upon failure of the property to conform with any representation, express or implied.


(iv) *Terms of payment.* The property will be offered for sale in accordance with whichever of the following terms is fixed by the IRS in the public notice of sale:


(A) Payment in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, or


(B) An initial payment upon acceptance of the highest bid if the payment is in the amount (either the dollar amount or the percentage of the purchase price) specified in the notice of sale and followed by payment of the balance (including all costs incurred for the protection or preservation of the property subsequent to the sale and prior to final payment) within a specified period, not to exceed one month from the date of the sale.


(6) *Method of sale and sale procedures.* The IRS will sell the property either at a public auction (at which open competitive bids will be received) or at a public sale under sealed bids.


(i) *Invitation to bidders.* Bids will be solicited through a public notice of sale.


(ii) *Form for use by bidders.* A bid must be submitted in the manner specified by the IRS in the notice of sale or in instructions referenced by that notice.


(iii) *Remittance with bid.* The notice of sale, or instructions referenced in the notice, will specify the initial payment amount, acceptable forms of the remittance (such as check, credit or debit card, electronic payment, or other means), and the address (physical or online) at which the bid and remittance must be submitted.


(iv) *Time for receiving bids.* A bid will not be considered unless it is received in the manner and before the time specified in the notice of sale, instructions referenced in the notice, or in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.


(v) *Consideration of bids.* The public notice of sale will specify whether the property is to be sold separately, by groups, or in the aggregate, or by a combination of these methods, as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section. If the notice, or instructions referenced in the notice, specifies an alternative method, bidders may submit bids under one or more of the alternatives. In case of error in computing the total price of a group of property in any bid, the unit price of each piece of property will control. The IRS has the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. A technical defect in a bid is deemed waived if the IRS treats it as the winning bid. In the event two or more highest bids are equal in amount, the IRS will reopen the bidding until a high bid is submitted without any ties. After the opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the IRS will announce the amount of the highest bid or bids and the name of the successful bidder or bidders. Any remittance submitted in connection with an unsuccessful bid will be returned at the conclusion of the sale.


(vi) *Withdrawal of bids.* A bid may be withdrawn only in the manner specified in the notice of sale or in instructions referenced in the notice. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the bidder for the withdrawal of the bid after it has been opened or accepted.


(7) *Payment of bid price.* All payments for property sold under this section must be made in the form and manner (whether by check, credit or debit card, electronic payment, or other means) specified by the IRS in the public notice of sale or in instructions referenced in the notice. If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the highest bid, the payment must be made at the time and in accordance with the terms specified in the notice of sale. If deferred payment is permitted, the initial payment must be made upon acceptance of the bid at the time and in accordance with the terms specified in the notice of sale, and the balance must be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof. Any remittance submitted with a successful bid will be applied toward the purchase price.
























(8) *Delivery and removal of personal property.* Responsibility of the United States for the protection or preservation of seized personal property shall cease immediately upon acceptance of the highest bid. The risk of loss is on the purchaser of personal property upon acceptance of his bid. Possession of any personal property shall not be delivered to the purchaser until the purchase price has been paid in full. If payment of part of the purchase price for personal property is deferred, the United States will retain possession of such property as security for the payment of the balance of the purchase price and, as agent for the purchaser, will cause the property to be cared for until the purchase price has been paid in full or the sale is declared null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price. In such case, all charges and expenses incurred in caring for the property after the acceptance of the bid shall be borne by the purchaser.


(9) *Default in payment.* If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the bid and is not paid when due, the IRS will proceed again to sell the property in the manner provided in section 6335(e) of the Code and this section. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of six percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the IRS, the sale may be declared null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in section 6335(b), (c), and (e) of the Code and this section. In the event of such readvertisement and sale, any new purchaser will receive such property or rights to property free and clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any nature whatsoever, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such defaulting purchaser will be forfeited to the United States.










(10) *Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision.* For restrictions on sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision, see section 6863(b)(3) and § 301.6863-2.


(11) *Participation in sale by revenue officers.* No revenue officer who seized the property to be sold at a sale conducted under section 6335 of the Code and this section may participate in the sale of that seized property. This restriction does not apply to sales of perishable goods conducted under section 6336 of the Code.








(e) *Right to request the sale of seized property*—(1) *In general.* The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the IRS sell such property within 60 days after such request, or within any longer period specified by the owner. The IRS must comply with such a request unless it determines that compliance with the request is not in its best interests. If the IRS decides not to comply with the request, it must notify the owner of the determination within the 60-day period, or any longer period specified by the owner.




(2) *Procedures to request the sale of seized property*—(i) *Manner.* A request for the sale of seized property shall be made in writing to the group manager of the revenue officer whose signature is on Levy Form 668-B. If the owner does not know the group manager's name or address, the owner may send the request to the revenue officer, marked for the attention of his or her group manager.


(ii) *Form.* The request for sale of seized property within 60 days, or such longer period specified by the owner, shall include:


(A) The name, current address, current home and work telephone numbers and any convenient times to be contacted, and taxpayer identification number of the owner making the request;


(B) A description of the seized property that is the subject of the request;


(C) A copy of the notice of seizure, if available;


(D) The period within which the owner is requesting that the property be sold; and


(E) The signature of the owner or duly authorized representative. For purposes of these regulations, a duly authorized representative is any attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled actuary, or any other person permitted to represent the owner before the Internal Revenue Service who is not disbarred or suspended from practice before the Internal Revenue Service and who has written power of attorney executed by the owner.


(3) *Notification to owner.* The IRS will respond in writing to a request for sale of seized property as soon as practicable after receipt of such request and in no event later than 60 days after receipt of the request, or, if later, the date specified by the owner for the sale.


(f) *Applicability date.* The rules of this section apply to sales of property seized on or after November 5, 2024.
