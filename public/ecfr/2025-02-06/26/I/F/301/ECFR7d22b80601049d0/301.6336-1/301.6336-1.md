# § 301.6336-1   Sale of perishable goods.

(a) *Appraisal of certain seized property.* If the district director determines that any property seized by levy is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or that such property cannot be kept without great expense, he shall appraise the value of such property and return it to the owner if the owner complies with the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section or, if the owner does not comply with such conditions, dispose of the property in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Return to owner.* If the owner of the property can be readily found, the district director shall give him written notice of his determination of the appraised value of the property. However, if the district director determines that the circumstances require immediate action, he may give the owner an oral notice of his determination of the appraised value of the property, which notice shall be confirmed in writing prior to sale. The property shall be returned to the owner if, within the time specified in the notice, the owner—


(1) Pays to the district director an amount equal to the appraised value, or


(2) Gives an acceptable bond as prescribed by section 7101 and § 301.7101-1. Such bond shall be in an amount not less than the appraised value of the property and shall be conditioned upon the payment of such amount at such time as the district director determines to be appropriate in the circumstances.


(c) *Immediate sale.* If the owner does not pay the amount of the appraised value of the seized property within the time specified in the notice, or furnish bond as provided in paragraph (b) of this section within such time, the district director shall as soon as practicable make public sale of the property in accordance with the following terms and conditions—


(1) *Notice of sale.* If the owner can readily be found, a notice shall be given to him. A notice of sale also shall be posted in two public places in the county in which the property is to be sold. The notice shall specify the time and place of sale, the property to be sold, and the manner and conditions of sale. The district director may give such other notice and in such other manner as he deems advisable under the circumstances.


(2) *Sale.* The property shall be sold at public auction to the highest bidder.


(3) *Terms.* The purchase price shall be paid in full upon acceptance of the highest bid. The payment shall be made in cash, or by a certified, cashier's or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.
