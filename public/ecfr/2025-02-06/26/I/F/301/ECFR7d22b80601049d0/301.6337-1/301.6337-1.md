# § 301.6337-1   Redemption of property.

(a) *Before sale.* Any person whose property has been levied upon shall have the right to pay the amount due, together with costs and expenses of the proceeding, if any, to the district director at any time prior to the sale of the property. Upon such payment the district director shall restore such property to the owner and all further proceedings in connection with the levy on such property shall cease from the time of such payment.


(b) *Redemption of real estate after sale*—(1) *Period.* The owner of any real estate sold as provided in section 6335, his heirs, executors, or administrators, or any person having any interest therein, or a lien thereon, or any person in their behalf, shall be permitted to redeem the property sold, or any particular tract of such property, at any time within 120 days after the sale thereof.


(2) *Price.* Such property or tract of property may be redeemed upon payment to the purchaser, or in case he cannot be found in the county in which the property to be redeemed is situated, then to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the property is situated, for the use of the purchaser, his heirs, or assigns, the amount paid by such purchaser and interest thereon at the rate of 20 percent per annum. In case real and personal property (or several tracts of real property) are purchased in the aggregate, the redemption price of the real property (or of each of the several tracts) shall be determined on the basis of the ratio, as of the time of sale, of the value of the real property (or tract) to the value of the total property purchased. For this purpose the minimum price or the highest bid price, whichever is higher, offered for the property separately or in groups shall be treated as the value.


(c) *Record.* When any real property is redeemed, the district director shall cause entry of the fact to be made upon the record of sale kept in accordance with section 6340, and such entry shall be evidence of such redemption. The party who redeems the property shall notify the district director of the internal revenue district in which the property is situated of the date of such redemption and of the transfer of the certificate of sale, the amount of the redemption price, and the name of the party to whom such redemption price was paid.
