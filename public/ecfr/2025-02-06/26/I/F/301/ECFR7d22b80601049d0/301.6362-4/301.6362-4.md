# § 301.6362-4   Rules for adjustments relating to qualified resident taxes.

(a) *Net State income tax deduction.* For purposes of section 6362 (b)(1)(B) and (c)(3)(B), and §§ 301.6362-2 and 301.6362-3, the “net State income tax deduction” shall be the excess (if any) of (1) the amount deducted from income under section 164(a)(3) as taxes paid to a State or to a political subdivision thereof, over (2) the amounts included in income as recoveries of prior income taxes which were paid to a State or to a political subdivision thereof and which had been deducted under section 164(a)(3).


(b) *Net tax-exempt income.* For purposes of section 6362 (b)(1)(C) and (c)(3)(A) and §§ 301.6362-2 and 301.6362-3, the “net tax-exempt income” shall be the excess (if any) of:


(1) The sum of (i) the interest on obligations described in section 103 (a)(1) other than obligations of the State imposing the tax and the political subdivisions thereof, and (ii) the interest on obligations described in such section of such State and the political subdivisions thereof which under the law of the State is subject to the tax; over


(2) The sum of (i) the amount of deductions allocable to the interest described in subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (b), which is disallowed pursuant to section 265 and the regulations thereunder, and (ii) the amount of the adjustment to basis allocable to such obligations which is required to be made for the taxable year under section 1016(a) (5) or (6).


(c) *Credits for taxes of other jurisdictions*—(1) *In general.* A State tax law that provides for a credit, pursuant to section 6362(b)(2) (B) or (C) or section 6362(c)(4), and paragraph (b)(1) of § 301.6362-2 or paragraph (b)(2) of § 301.6362-3, for income tax of another State or a political subdivision thereof shall provide that, in the case of each taxpayer, the amount of the credit shall equal the amount of his liability with respect to such other jurisdiction's tax for the taxable year which runs concurrently with, or which ends in, the taxable year used by the taxpayer for purposes of the State tax which provides for the credit. Such a credit may be allowed with respect to every income tax (whether or not qualified) imposed on the taxpayer by another State or a political subdivision thereof, or only with respect to certain of such taxes. However, for purposes of this paragraph, the amount which is treated as being the amount of the taxpayer's liability with respect to any such tax imposed by another jurisdiction shall not exceed the amount of liability for such tax which is both—


(A) Reported to the taxing authorities responsible for collecting such other jurisdiction's tax, and


(B) Substantiated pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of § 301.6361-1.


(2) *Limitation.* The amount of any credit allowed for the taxable year pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the product of the amount of the resident tax against which the credit is allowed, as computed without subtracting any such credit, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by both the State imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed and the other jurisdiction whose tax is being credited, and the denominator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by the State imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, “income subject to tax” means the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income which is taken into account for purposes of computing tax liability; in the case of a qualified resident tax, an appropriate modification shall be made to take into account any adjustments which are made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) and (3) of § 301.6362-2, or pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(1)(ii) of § 301.6362-3.


(3) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
