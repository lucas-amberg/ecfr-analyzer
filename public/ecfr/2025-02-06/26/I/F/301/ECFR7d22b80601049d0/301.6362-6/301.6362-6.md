# § 301.6362-6   Requirements relating to residence.

(a) *In general.* A tax imposed by a State meets the requirements of section 6362(e) and this section if in effect it provides that:


(1) The State of residence of an individual, estate, or trust is determined according to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) respectively, of section 6362(e), and according to paragraph (b), (c), or (d), respectively, of this section.


(2) The liability for a resident tax imposed by such State upon an individual or trust which changes residence to another State in the taxable year is determined according to section 6362(e)(4) and paragraph (e) of this section.


(3) The rules relating to current collection of tax apply as provided in section 6362(e)(5) and paragraph (f) of this section.


(b) *Residence of an individual*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph (b), an individual is treated as a resident of a State with respect to a taxable year only if:


(i) His principal place of residence (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)) is within such State for a period of at least 135 consecutive days, at least 30 days of which are in such taxable year; or


(ii) In the case of a citizen or resident of the United States who is not a resident of any State (determined as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) with respect to such taxable year, his domicile (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b)) is in such State for at least 30 days during such taxable year.


(2) *Principal place of residence*—(i) *Definition.* For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the term “principal place of residence” shall mean the place which is an individual's primary home. An individual's temporary absence from his primary home shall not effect a change with respect thereto. On the other hand, if an individual moves to another State, other than as a mere transient or sojourner, he shall be treated as having changed the location of his primary home.


(ii) *Examples.* The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Domicile defined.* For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the term “domicile” shall mean an individual's fixed or permanent home. An individual acquires a domicile in a place by living there; even for a brief period of time, with no definite present intention of later removing therefrom. Residence without the requisite intention to remain indefinitely will not suffice to change domicile, nor will intention to change domicile effect such a change until accompanied by actual removal. A domicile, once acquired, is maintained until a new domicile is acquired.


(4) *Period of residence*—(i) *General rule.* An individual who becomes a resident of a State pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), or who is at the beginning of a taxable year a resident of a State pursuant to such provision, shall be treated as continuing to be a resident of such State through the end of the taxable year, unless, prior thereto, such individual becomes a resident, under the principles of subparagraph (1), of another State or a possession or foreign country. In the event that the individual becomes a resident of such another jurisdiction prior to the end of the taxable year, his residence in such State shall be treated as ending on the day prior to the day on which he becomes a resident of such other jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (1).


(ii) *Examples.* The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(5) *Special rules.* (i) No provision of subchapter E or the regulations thereunder shall be construed to require or authorize the treatment of a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner as a resident of a State other than the State which he represents in Congress.


(ii) For special rules relating to members of the Armed Forces, see paragraph (h) of § 301.6362-7.


(6) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Residence of an estate.* An estate of an individual is treated as a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, prior to his death. However, the estate of an individual who was not a resident of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and who was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date of his death, is not treated as a resident of any State. For purposes of determining the decedent's last State of residence, the rules of paragraph (b) shall be applied irrespective of whether subchapter E was in effect at the time the period of 135 consecutive days of residence began, or whether the decedent's last State of residence is a State electing to enter into an agreement pursuant to subchapter E. The determination of the State of residence of an estate pursuant to this paragraph shall not be governed by any determination under State law as to which State is treated as the residence or domicile of the decedent for purposes other than its individual income tax (such as liability for State inheritance tax or jurisdiction of probate proceedings).


(d) *Residence of a trust*—(1) *In general.* (i) The State of residence of a trust shall be determined by reference to the circumstances of the individual who, by either an inter-vivos transfer or a testamentary transfer, is deemed to be the “principal contributor” to the trust under the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.


(ii) If only one individual has ever contributed assets to the trust, including the assets which were transferred to the trust at its inception, then such individual is the principal contributor to the trust. However, if on any day subsequent to the initial creation of the trust, such trust receives assets having a value greater than the aggregate value of all assets theretofore contributed to it, then the trust shall be deemed (for the limited purpose of determining the State of residence) to have been “created” anew, and the individual who on the day of such creation contributed more (in value) than any other individual contributed on that day shall become the principal contributor to the trust. When a trust is created anew, all references in this paragraph to the creation of the trust shall be construed as referring to the most recent creation. For purposes of this paragraph, the value of any asset shall be its fair market value on the day that it was contributed to the trust; any subsequent appreciation or depreciation in the value of the asset shall be disregarded.


(2) *Testamentary trust.* A trust with respect to which a deceased individual is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on his death is treated as a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, before his death. However, if such deceased individual was not a resident of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date of his death, then a testamentary trust of which he is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on his death is not treated as a resident of any State. All property passing on the transferor's death is treated for this purpose as a contribution made to the trust on the date of death, regardless of when the property is actually paid over to the trust.


(3) *Nontestamentary trust.* A trust which is not a trust described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), is treated as a resident of the State in which the principal contributor to the trust, during the 3-year period ending on the date of the creation of the trust, had his principal place of residence for an aggregate number of days longer than the aggregate number of days he had his principal place of residence in any other State. However, if the principal contributor to such a trust was not a resident of any State at any time during such 3-year period, then the trust is not treated as a resident of any State.


(4) *Special rules.* If the application of the provisions of the foregoing subparagraphs of this paragraph results in a determination of more than one State of residence for a trust, or does not provide a rule by which the residence or nonresidence of the trust can be determined, then the determination of the State of residence of such trust shall be made according to the rules of the applicable subdivision of this subparagraph.


(i) If, at the time of creation of the trust, 50 percent or more in value of the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust shall be treated as a resident of the State in which more of the real property (in value) which was in the trust at such time was located than any other State.


(ii) If, at the time of creation of the trust, less than 50 percent in value of the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust shall be treated as a resident of the State in which, at such time, the trustee, if an individual, had his principal place of residence, or, if a corporation, had its principal place of business. If there were two or more trustees, then the foregoing sentence shall be applied by reference to the principal places of residence, or of business, of the majority of trustees who had authority to make investment and other management decisions for the trust.


(iii) If, after application of the provisions of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, the State of residence of the trust still cannot be ascertained, then the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall determine the State of residence of such trust for purposes of qualified taxes. Such determination shall be made by reference to the number of significant contacts each State had with the trust at the time of its creation. Significant contacts shall include the principal place of residence of the principal contributor or contributors to the trust, the principal place of residence or business of the trustee (or trustees), the situs of the assets of which the trust corpus was composed, and the location from which management decisions emanated with respect to the business and investment interests of the trusts.


(5) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(e) *Liability for tax on change of residence during taxable year*—(1) *In general.* If, under the principles contained in paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, an individual or trust becomes a resident, or ceases to be a resident, of a State, and is also a resident of another jurisdiction outside of such State during the same taxable year, the liability of such individual or trust for the resident tax of such State shall be determined by multiplying the amount which would be his or its liability for tax (computed after allowing the nonrefundable credits (*i.e.*, credits not corresponding to the credits referred to in section 6401(b) available against the tax)) if he or it had been a resident of such State for the entire taxable year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days he or it was a resident of such State during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable year. The preceding sentence shall not apply by reason of the fact that an individual is born or dies during the taxable year, or by reason of the fact that a trust comes into existence or ceases to exist during the taxable year.


(2) *Residence determined by domicile.* When an individual is treated as a resident of a State by reason of being domiciled in such State, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, then the numerator of the fraction provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e), shall be the number of days the individual was domiciled in the State during the taxable year.


(3) *Example.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(f) *Current collection of tax.* The State tax laws shall contain provisions for methods of current collection with respect to individuals which correspond to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 with respect to such current collection, including chapter 24 (relating to the collection of income tax at source on wages) and sections 6015, 6073, 6153, and other provisions of the Code relating to declarations (and amendments thereto) and payments of estimated income tax. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statute (see paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of § 301.6362-7), in applying such provisions of the State tax laws:


(1) In the case of a resident tax, an individual shall be subject to the current collection provisions if either—


(i) He is a resident of the State within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, or


(ii) He has his principal place of residence (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within the State,


(2) In the case of a nonresident tax, an individual shall be subject to the current collection provisions if he does not meet either description relating to an individual in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f), if he is not exempt from liability for the tax by reason for a reciprocal agreement between the State of which he is a resident and the State imposing the tax, and if it is reasonable to expect him to receive wage or other business income derived from sources within the State imposing the tax (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 301.6362-5) for services performed on 30 days or more of the taxable year.
