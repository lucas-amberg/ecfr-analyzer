# § 301.6363-4   Judicial review.

(a) *General rule.* If the Secretary or his delegate determines pursuant to paragraph (c) of § 301.6363-1 that a State did not file a valid notice of election or does not have a tax which would meet the requirements for qualification specified in section 6362 and the regulations thereunder if a State agreement were in effect with respect thereto, or if he determines pursuant to paragraph (b) of § 301.6363-2 that a participating State has enacted a law as a result of which the State no longer has a qualified tax, such State may, within 60 days after its Governor has received notification of such determination, file a petition for the review of such determination with either the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the State is located or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If a State files such a petition, the clerk of the court shall forthwith transmit a copy of the petition to the Secretary or his delegate, who in turn shall thereupon file in the court the record of proceedings on which the determination adverse to the State was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code.


(b) *Court of Appeals' jurisdiction.* The court of Appeals may affirm or set aside, in whole or in part, the action of the Secretary or his delegate; and (subject to the rules delaying the effectiveness of the change in State law provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6363-2) the court may issue such other orders as may be appropriate with respect to taxable years which include any part of the period of litigation.


(c) *Review of Court of Appeals' judgment.* The judgment of the Court of Appeals shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification sought by either party as provided in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.


(d) *Effect of final judgment.* If a final judgment, rendered with respect to litigation involving a State's petition to review a determination of the Secretary or his delegate to the effect that the State's individual income tax laws included in its notice of election would not meet the requirements for qualification specified in section 6362 and the regulations thereunder if a State agreement were in effect with respect thereto, includes a determination that the State's tax would in fact meet such requirements, then the provisions of subchapter E shall apply to the State with respect to taxable years beginning on or after the first January 1 which is more than 6 months after the date of such final judgment. If a final judgment, rendered with respect to litigation involving a State's petition to review a determination of the Secretary or his delegate to the effect that the State's previously-qualified tax ceases to qualify because of a change in the State's law, includes a determination that the State's tax does in fact cease to qualify, then the provisions of subchapter E (other than section 6363) shall cease to apply to the State with respect to taxable years beginning on or after the first January 1 which is more than 6 months after the date of such final judgment. See paragraph (b) of § 301.6365-2 for special rules with respect to withholding in the case of fiscal-year taxpayers.


(e) *Expeditious treatment of judicial proceedings.* Under section 6363(d)(4), any judicial proceedings to which a State and the United States are parties, and which are brought pursuant to section 6363, are entitled to receive a preference, and to be heard and determined as expeditiously as possible, upon request of the Secretary or the State.
