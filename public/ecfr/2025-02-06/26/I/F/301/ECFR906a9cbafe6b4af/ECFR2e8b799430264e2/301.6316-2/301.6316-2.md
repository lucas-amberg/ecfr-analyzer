# § 301.6316-2   Definitions.

For purposes of §§ 301.6316-1 to 301.6316-9, inclusive:


(a) The term *tax,* as used in §§ 301.6316-1, 301.6316-3, 301.6316-4, 301.6316-5, and 301.6316-6 means the income tax imposed for the taxable year by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and as used in § 301.6316-7 means the Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes imposed by chapter 21 of the Code (or by the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). The term “tax”, as used in §§ 301.6316-3 and 301.6316-9 shall relate to either of such taxes, whichever is appropriate.


(b) The term *nonconvertible foreign currency* means currency of the government of a foreign country which, owing to (1) monetary, exchange, or other restrictions imposed by the foreign country, (2) an agreement entered into with the United States of America, or (3) the terms and conditions of the U.S. Government grant, is not convertible into U.S. dollars or into other money which is convertible into U.S. dollars. The term shall not, however, include currency which, notwithstanding such restrictions, agreement, terms, or conditions, is in fact converted into U.S. dollars or into property which is readily disposable for U.S. dollars.


(c) If the taxpayer computes taxable income under the accrual method, then the term *received* shall be construed to mean “accrued.”
