# § 301.6692-1   Failure to file actuarial report.

(a) *Penalty.* In each case in which the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g)) of a defined benefit plan to which the minimum funding standards of section 412 apply fails to file the actuarial report described in section 6059 and § 301.6059-1 within the time prescribed, the plan administrator shall pay a penalty of $1,000. A failure to provide a material item of information called for in the actuarial report is considered a failure to file the report. For this purpose, the signature of an enrolled actuary (see § 301.6059-1(d)) is considered a material item of information.


Further, for any report filed for a plan year ending after January 25, 1982, if the actuary seeks to materially qualify a statement required by § 301.6059-1(c) (4) or (5) there is a failure to provide a material item of information called for in the report. For rules relating to statements not considered as materially qualifying the required statements, see § 301.6059-1(d).


(b) *Failure to make actuarial valuation.* Section 412(c)(9) and the regulations thereunder prescribe the time for making an actuarial valuation of a defined benefit plan. For purposes of this section, the failure to base information called for in the actuarial report upon an actuarial valuation of the plan which is made within the time prescribed by section 412(c)(9) and the regulations thereunder is considered a failure to file the actuarial report.


(c) *Showing of reasonable cause.* The penalty imposed by this section does not apply if it is established to the satisfaction of the appropriate district director or the director of the Internal Revenue Service Center at which the actuarial report is required to be filed that the failure to file the report was due to reasonable cause. An affirmative showing of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written statement setting forth all the facts alleged as reasonable cause. The statement must contain a declaration by the appropriate individual that the statement is made under the penalties of perjury.


(d) *Joint liability.* If more than one person is responsible as a plan administrator for a failure to file the actuarial report, all such persons are jointly and severally liable with respect to the failure.


(e) *Manner of payment.* The penalty imposed for the failure to file an actuarial report shall be paid in the same manner as a tax upon the issuance of notice and demand therefor.


(f) *Effective dates.* In the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, this section is effective beginning with the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1975, for which the minimum funding standards of section 412 apply to the plan. In the case of a plan not in existence on January 1, 1974, this section is effective beginning with the first plan year beginning after September 2, 1974, for which the minimum funding standards apply to the plan.
