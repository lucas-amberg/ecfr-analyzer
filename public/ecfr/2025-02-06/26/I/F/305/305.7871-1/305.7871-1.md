(1) Chapter 31 of the Code (relating to tax on special fuels);


(2) Chapter 32 of the Code (relating to manufacturers excise taxes);


(3) Subchapter B of chapter 33 of the Code (relating to communications excise tax); and


(4) Subchapter D of chapter 36 of the Code (relating to tax on use of certain highway vehicles), if, in addition to satisfying all requirements applicable to a similar transaction involving a State (or political subdivision thereof) under the Code, the transaction involves the exercise of an essential governmental function of the Indian tribal government, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Special rule for tax-exempt bonds.* An Indian tribal government shall be treated as a State and a subdivision of an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for purposes of any obligation issued by such government or subdivision under section 103 (relating to interest on certain governmental obligations) if such obligation is part of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used in the exercise of an essential governmental function, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of section 7871 and this section, the “substantially all” test is the same as that provided in § 1.103-8(a)(1)(i). An Indian tribal government shall not be treated as a State and a subdivision of an Indian tribal government shall not be treated as a political subdivision of a State, however, for issues of the following private activity bonds—


(1) An industrial development bond (as defined in section 103(b)(2));


(2) An obligation described in section 103(l)(1)(A) (relating to scholarship bonds); or


(3) A mortgage subsidy bond (as defined in section 103A(b)(1), without regard to section 103A(b)(2)).


(d) *Essential governmental function.* For purposes of section 7871 and this section, an essential governmental function of an Indian tribal government (or portion thereof) is a function of a type which is—


(1) Eligible for funding under 25 U.S.C. 13 and the regulations thereunder;


(2) Eligible for grants or contracts under 25 U.S.C. 450 (f), (g), and (h) and the regulations thereunder; or


(3) An essential governmental function under section 115 and the regulations thereunder when conducted by a State or political subdivision thereof.


(e) *Treatment of subdivisions of Indian tribal governments as political subdivisions.* A subdivision of an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for purposes of section 7871 and this section if the Internal Revenue Service determines that the subdivision has been delegated the right to exercise one or more of the substantial governmental functions of the Indian tribal government. Designation of a subdivision of an Indian tribal government as a political subdivision of a State will be by revenue procedure. If a subdivision of an Indian tribal government is not currently designated by the applicable revenue procedure as a political subdivision of a State, and such subdivision believes that it qualifies for such designation, the subdivision may apply for a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. In order to qualify as a political subdivision of a State, for purposes of section 7871 and this section, such subdivision must receive a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. The request for a ruling shall be made in accordance with all applicable procedural rules set forth in the Statement of Procedural Rules (26 CFR part 601) and any applicable revenue procedures relating to submission of ruling requests. The request shall be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), Attention: CC:IND:S, Room 6545, 1111 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, D.C. 20224.
