# § 513.7   Release of excess tax withheld at source.

(a) *General.* (1) In order to bring the convention into force and effect at the earliest practicable date, 


(i) The reduced rate of tax of 15 percent to be withheld at the source from dividends, natural resource royalties, and real property rentals, and 


(ii) The exemption from tax otherwise withheld at the source from interest, patent royalties, copyright royalties, film rentals, and the like, 


(2) In the case of every such taxpayer whose address at the time of payment was in Ireland and who furnishes to the withholding agent the letter of notification prescribed in §§ 513.3(b), 513.4, or § 513.5, where United States tax at the rate of 30 percent has been withheld on or after January 1, 1952, there shall be released (except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section) by the withholding agent and paid over to the person from whom it was withheld: 


(i) In the case of natural resource royalties and real property rentals, an amount equal to 15 percent of such royalties and rentals, and 


(ii) In the case of interest (other than coupon bond interest), patent royalties, copyright royalties, film rentals, and the like, an amount equal to the tax so withheld. 


(3) In the case of every such taxpayer whose address at the time of payment was in Ireland and who furnishes to the withholding agent Form 1001-IR in duplicate, where United States tax at the rate of 28 percent or 30 percent, as the case may be, has been withheld from coupon bond interest on or after January 1, 1952, there shall be released (except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section) by the withholding agent and paid over to the person from whom it was withheld an amount equal to the tax so withheld, if such taxpayer also files in duplicate with the withholding agent as authorization for the release of such amount a Form 1001-IR clearly marked “Substitute”. One such substitute form shall be filed in duplicate with respect to each issue of bonds and will serve with respect to that issue to replace all Forms 1001 previously filed by such taxpayer in the calendar year in which the excess tax is released. The use of Form 1001-IR with each presentation of interest coupons for the purpose of obviating withholding of tax at source is set forth in § 513.3(b). 


(4) In the case of dividends derived from a United States corporation and paid to a nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien individual, fiduciary, and partnership) or to a foreign corporation, whose address at the time of payment was in Ireland, where United States tax at the rate of 30 percent has been withheld from such dividends on or after January 1, 1952, there shall be released (except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section) by the withholding agent and paid over to the person from whom it was withheld an amount equal to 15 percent of such dividends. 


(b) *Amounts withheld during 1951.* For provisions respecting the refund of excess tax withheld during the calendar year 1951, see § 513.11. 


(c) *Pensions and life annuities.* (1) In order to bring the convention into force and effect at the earliest practicable date the exemption from tax otherwise withheld at the source from life annuities and pensions, other than pensions paid by the Government of the United States to individuals in respect of services rendered thereto in the discharge of governmental functions, is hereby made effective beginning January 1, 1952, in any case in which such pensions and life annuities are derived from sources within the United States by a nonresident alien individual who is resident in Ireland for the purposes of Irish tax. 


(2) In the case of every such taxpayer whose address at the time of payment was in Ireland and who furnishes to the withholding agent the letter of notification prescribed in § 513.6, where United States tax at the rate of 30 percent has been withheld on or after January 1, 1952, from such pensions or life annuities, as the case may be, there shall be released by the withholding agent and paid over to the person from whom it was withheld an amount equal to the tax so withheld. 


(d) *Subsidiary's dividends.* (1) United States tax shall be withheld at the rate of 15 percent from any dividend derived from a United States corporation and paid on or after January 1, 1952, to a foreign corporation whose address is in Ireland unless, prior to the date of payment thereof, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue notifies the domestic corporation that such dividend falls within the scope of the proviso of Article VI(1) of the convention. 


(2) In the case of every domestic corporation receiving notification from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under the provisions of § 513.2(b) that dividends paid or to be paid by it fall within the scope of the proviso of Article VI(1) of the convention, where United States tax in excess of the applicable rate of 5 percent has been withheld on or after January 1, 1952, from dividends which come within the scope of such proviso, the withholding agent shall, if so authorized in such notification, release and pay over to the foreign corporation from which it was withheld the excess tax withheld with respect to such dividends. 


(e) *Interest paid where degree of stock ownership is determined.* In the case of every foreign corporation whose address at the time of payment was in Ireland and which (1) furnishes to the domestic corporation a copy of the Commissioner's authorization of release prescribed in § 513.3(c) and (2) files the letter of notification prescribed in § 513.3(b), or the substitute Form 1001-IR prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, whichever is applicable, where United States tax at the rate of 28 percent or 30 percent, as the case may be, has been withheld on or after January 1, 1952, the withholding agent shall release and pay over to the foreign corporation from which it was withheld an amount equal to the tax so withheld.
