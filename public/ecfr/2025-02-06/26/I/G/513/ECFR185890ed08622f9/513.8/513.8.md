# ยง 513.8   Addressee not actual owner.

(a) If any person with an address in Ireland who receives a dividend from a United States corporation with respect to which United States tax at the rate of only 15 percent has been withheld at source is a nominee or representative through whom such dividend flows to a person other than one described in ยง 513.2(a) as being entitled to such reduced rate of 15 percent, such recipient in Ireland will withhold an additional amount of United States tax equivalent to the difference between the United States tax which would have been withheld had the convention not been in effect (30 percent as of the date of approval of this subpart) and the 15 percent withheld at the source with respect to such dividend pursuant to ยง 513.2(d). 


(b) In any case in which a fiduciary or partnership with an address in Ireland receives, otherwise than as a nominee or representative, a dividend from a United States corporation with respect to which United States tax at the rate of only 15 percent has been withheld at source, if a beneficiary of such fiduciary or a partner in such partnership is not entitled to the reduced rate of tax provided in Article VI(1) of the convention, the fiduciary or partnership will withhold an additional amount of United States tax with respect to the portion of such dividend included in such beneficiary's share of the distributed or distributable income, or in such partner's distributive share of the income, of such fiduciary or partnership, as the case may be. The amount of the additional tax is to be calculated in the same manner as under paragraph (a) of this section. 


(c) If any amount of United States tax is released pursuant to ยง 513.7(a) by the withholding agent in the United States with respect to a dividend received by such a person with an address in Ireland, the latter will also withhold from such released amount any additional amount of United States tax, otherwise required to be withheld by the preceding provisions of this section in respect of such dividend, in the same manner as if at the time of payment of such dividend United States tax at the rate of only 15 percent had been withheld at source therefrom. 


(d) The amounts so withheld by such withholding agents in Ireland will be deposited, without converting such amounts into United States dollars, with the Irish Revenue Commissioners on or before the 15th day after the close of the calendar year quarter in which such withholding in Ireland occurs. Each withholding agent making such deposit will render therewith the appropriate Irish form as prescribed in regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners have arranged that the amounts so deposited will be remitted by draft in United States dollars to the District Director of Internal Revenue, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A., on or before the end of the calendar month in which the deposits are made, such draft to be accompanied by the Irish form rendered by the withholding agents in Ireland in connection with such deposits.
