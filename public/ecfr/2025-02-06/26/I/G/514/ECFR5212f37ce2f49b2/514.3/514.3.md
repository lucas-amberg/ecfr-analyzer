# § 514.3   Dividends received by addressee not actual owner.

(a) *Additional tax to be withheld*—(1) *Nominee or representative.* The recipient in France of any dividend, paid on or after January 1, 1957, from which United States tax at the reduced rate of 15 percent has been withheld at source pursuant to § 514.2(c)(1), who is a nominee or representative through whom the dividend is received by a person other than one described in § 514.2(a) as being entitled to the reduced rate, shall withhold an additional amount of United States tax equivalent to the United States tax which would have been withheld if the convention had not been in effect (30 percent as of the date of approval of §§ 514.1 to 514.10) minus the 15 percent which has been withheld at the source. 


(2) *Fiduciary or partnership.* A fiduciary or a partnership with an address in France which receives, otherwise than as a nominee or representative, a dividend from which United States tax at the reduced rate of 15 percent has been withheld at source pursuant to § 514.2 shall withhold an additional amount of United States tax from the portion of the dividend included in the gross income from sources within the United States of any beneficiary or partner, as the case may be, who is not entitled to the reduced rate of tax in accordance with § 514.2(c). The amount of the additional tax is to be calculated in the same manner as under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. 


(3) *Released amounts of tax.* If any amount of United States tax is released pursuant to § 514.8(a)(1) by the withholding agent in the United States with respect to a dividend paid to a nominee, representative, fiduciary, or partnership with an address in France, the latter shall withhold from such released amount any additional amount of United States tax, otherwise required to be withheld from the dividend by the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, in the same manner as if at the time of payment of the dividends United States tax at the rate of only 15 percent had been withheld at source therefrom. 


(b) *Returns filed by French withholding agents.* The amounts withheld pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by any withholding agent in France shall be deposited, without converting the amounts into United States dollars, with the Directeur General des Impots of France on or before the 15th day after the close of the quarter of the calendar year in which the withholding in France occurs. The withholding agent making the deposit shall render therewith such appropriate French form as may be prescribed by the Directeur General des Impots. The amounts so deposited should be remitted by the Directeur General des Impots by draft in the United States dollars to the Director, International Operations Division, Internal Revenue Service, Washington 25, D. C., U. S. A., on or before the end of the calendar month in which the deposit is made, and should be accompanied by such French form as may be required to be rendered by the withholding agent in France in connection with the deposit.
