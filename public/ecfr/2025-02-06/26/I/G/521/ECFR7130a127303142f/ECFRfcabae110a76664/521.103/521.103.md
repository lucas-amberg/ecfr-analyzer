# ยง 521.103   Scope of the convention.

(a) The primary purposes of the convention, to be accomplished on a reciprocal basis, are to avoid double taxation upon major items of income derived from sources in one country by persons resident in, or by corporations of, the other country, and to provide for administrative cooperation between the competent tax authorities of the two countries looking to the avoidance of double taxation and fiscal evasion. 


(b) The specific classes of income from sources within the United States exempt under the convention from United States tax for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 1948, are: 


(1) Industrial and commercial profits of a Danish enterprise having no permanent establishment in the United States (Article III); 


(2) Income derived by a nonresident alien who is a resident of Denmark, or by a Danish corporation, from the operation of ships or aircraft registered in Denmark (Article V); 


(3) Interest and royalties (including motion picture film rentals) derived by a nonresident alien who is a resident of Denmark or by a Danish corporation if such alien or corporation has no permanent establishment in the United States (Articles VII and VIII); 


(4) Compensation and pensions paid by Denmark to aliens for services rendered to Denmark (Article X(1)); 


(5) Private pensions and life annuities derived by nonresident alien individuals residing in Denmark (Article X(2)); 


(6) Compensation, subject to certain limitations, for personal services derived by a nonresident alien who is a resident of Denmark (Article XI); 


(7) Remittances from sources outside the United States received in the United States by a Danish citizen who is temporarily present in the United States for the purposes of study or for acquiring business experience, such remittances being for the purpose of his maintenance or studies (Article XIII); 


(8) Remuneration derived from teaching in the United States for a period of not more than two years by a professor or teacher who is a resident of Denmark but who is temporarily present in the United States (Article XIV). 


(c) The convention also reduces to 15 percent the rate of tax otherwise imposed upon dividends derived by a nonresident alien who is a resident of Denmark, or by a Danish corporation, if such alien or corporation has no permanent establishment in the United States (Article VI). 


(d) [Reserved] 


(e) The convention does not affect the liability to United States income taxation of citizens of Denmark who are residents of the United States except that such individuals are entitled to the benefits of Article XV (relating to credit for Danish income tax), and of Article XVI (relating to equality of taxation). Except as provided in Article XV, relating to the credit for income tax, the convention does not affect taxation by the United States of a citizen of the United States or of a domestic corporation, even though such citizen is resident in Denmark and such corporation is engaged in trade or business in Denmark.
