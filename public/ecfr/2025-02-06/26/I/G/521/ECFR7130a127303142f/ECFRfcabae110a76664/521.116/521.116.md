(a) *General.* (1) By Article XVII of the convention, the United States and Denmark adopt the principle of exchange of such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of the convention or for the prevention of fraud or for the detection of practices which are aimed at reduction of the revenues of either country, but not including information which would disclose a trade, business, industrial or professional secret or trade process. 


(2) The information and correspondence relative to exchange of information may be transmitted directly by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to the Chief of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance (Generaldirektoren for Skattevaesenet) of Denmark. 


(b) *Information to be furnished in due course.* (1) Pursuant to such principle, withholding agents shall, in the preparation of withholding returns, Form 1042, report on such returns, for the calendar year 1949 and each subsequent calendar year, in addition to the items of income upon which tax has been withheld at the source, those items of income paid to a nonresident alien individual resident in Denmark, or to a Danish corporation, upon which tax has not been withheld at the source. Such return shall show the same information with respect to such items of income upon which tax has not been withheld at the source as is shown with respect to items of income upon which the tax has been withheld at the source. 


(2) In accordance with the provisions of Article XVII of the convention, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue will transmit to the Chief of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance of Denmark, as soon as practicable after the close of the calendar year 1949, and of each calendar year thereafter during which the convention is in effect, the following information relating to such calendar year: The names and addresses of all persons whose addresses are in Denmark as disclosed on such withholding return, Form 1042, deriving from sources within the United States dividends interest (other than coupon bond interest), rents, royalties, salaries, wages, pensions, annuities and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical profits or income, and the amount of such income with respect to such persons as disclosed on such return, together with ownership certificate, Form 1001-D, filed in connection with coupon bond interest. Such transmission shall constitute compliance with Article XVII of the convention and of §§ 521.101 to 521.117. 


(c) *Information in specific cases.* Under the provisions and limitations of Article XVII of the convention, and subject to the provisions of Article XIX and Article XXII of the convention, and upon the request of the Chief of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance of Denmark, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall furnish to the Chief of the Taxation Department information available to or obtainable by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue relative to the tax liability of any person under the revenue laws of Denmark in any case in which such information is necessary to the administration of the provisions of the convention or for the prevention of fraud or the administration of statutory provisions against tax avoidance.
