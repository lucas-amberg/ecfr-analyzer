The performance measures that comprise the balanced measurement system will, to the maximum extent possible, be stated in objective, quantifiable, and measurable terms and will be used to measure the overall performance of various operational units within the IRS.

Thus, organizational measures of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and business results (including quality and quantity measures as described in ยง 801.6T) may be used to evaluate the performance of or to impose or suggest production goals for, any organizational unit.
