(b) The industry member obligates the trade buyer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.

For example, the industry member controls the trade buyer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the trade buyer's premises.


(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all trade buyers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.
