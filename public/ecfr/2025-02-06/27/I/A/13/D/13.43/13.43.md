# ยง 13.43   Decision after notice of proposed revocation.

(a) *Decision.* After considering any written arguments or evidence presented by the certificate holder, the appropriate TTB officer must issue a decision. If the decision is to revoke the certificate, a letter must be sent to the holder explaining the revocation of the certificate, and the specific laws or regulations relied upon in determining that the label or bottle was not in conformance with law or regulations. If the decision is to withdraw the proposed revocation, a letter of explanation must be sent.


(b) *Time limits for decision.* Within 90 days of receipt of written arguments or evidence from the certificate holder, the appropriate TTB officer shall notify the appellant of his or her decision. If a certificate holder requests an informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in ยง 13.71, the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once by an additional 90 days if he or she finds that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the issues presented by a proposed revocation. If the appropriate TTB officer extends the time period, he or she must notify the applicant by letter, along with a brief explanation of the issues under consideration.
