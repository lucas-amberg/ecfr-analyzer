# ยง 13.62   Third-party comment on certificates.

When a third party (such as foreign government, another Federal agency, a State agency, an industry association, a competitor of a certificate holder, a consumer or consumer group, or any other interested person) wishes to comment on an approved certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval, such comments should be submitted in writing to the appropriate TTB officer who will review the subject of the comment. If the comment raises an issue that is outside the scope of TTB's statutory or regulatory authority, or the appropriate TTB officer determines that the certificate is in compliance with applicable law and regulations, the commenter will be informed that no further action will be taken. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the commenter has raised a valid issue that TTB has authority to address, he or she will initiate appropriate action. The appropriate TTB officer may, in his or her discretion, notify the commenter as to the action being taken by TTB with respect to the certificate.
