# § 13.72   Effective dates of revocations.

(a) *Effective dates*—(1) *Revocation of specific certificates.* A written decision to revoke a certificate becomes effective 60 days after the date of the decision.


(2) *Revocation by operation of law or regulation.* If a certificate is revoked by operation of law or regulation, the revocation becomes effective on the effective date of the change in law or regulation with which the certificate does not comply, or if a separate label compliance date is given, on that date.


(b) *Use of certificate during period of appeal.* If a certificate holder files a timely appeal after receipt of a decision to revoke a certificate pursuant to § 13.44, the holder may continue to use the certificate at issue until the effective date of a final decision issued by the appropriate TTB officer. However, the effective date of a notice of revocation by operation of law or regulations, issued pursuant to § 13.52, is not stayed pending the appeal.
