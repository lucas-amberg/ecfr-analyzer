# ยง 17.122   Amended or revised formulas.

Except as provided in this section, amended or revised formulas are considered to be new formulas and shall be numbered accordingly. Minor changes may be made to a current formula on TTB Form 5154.1 with retention of the original formula number, if approval is obtained from the appropriate TTB officer. In order to obtain approval to make a minor formula change, the person holding the Form 5154.1 shall submit a letter of application to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating the formula change and requesting that the proposed change be considered a minor change. Each such application shall clearly identify the original formula by number, date of approval, and name of product. The application shall indicate whether the product is, has been, or will be used in alcoholic beverages, and shall specify whether the proposed change is intended as a substitution or merely as an alternative for the original formula. No changes may be made to current formulas without specific TTB approval in each case.
