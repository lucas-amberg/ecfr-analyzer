(1) The formula number of the product;


(2) The date of shipment;


(3) The quantity shipped; and


(4) The identity of the consignee.


(b) *Other disposition.* For other dispositions of nonbeverage products, the manufacturer shall record—

(3) The quantity of each product so disposed of.


(c) *Exception.* The manufacturer need not keep the records required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for any nonbeverage product which either contains less than 3 percent of distilled spirits by volume, or is sold by the producer directly to the consumer in retail quantities.
