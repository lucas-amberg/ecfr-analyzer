# ยง 19.28   Emergency variations from requirements.

(a) *Application.* A proprietor may request emergency approval of the use of a method or procedure relating to construction, equipment, and methods of operation that represents a variance from the requirements of this part. When a proprietor wishes to use an emergency method or procedure, the proprietor must submit a written letterhead application to the appropriate TTB officer for approval; the proprietor may send the application via regular mail, email, or facsimile transmission. The application must describe the proposed emergency method or procedure and the emergency situation it will address. For purposes of this section, an emergency is considered to exist only if it results from a weather or other natural event or from an accident or other event not involving an intentional act on the part of the proprietor.


(b) *Approval.* The appropriate TTB officer may approve in writing the use of an emergency method or procedure if the proprietor demonstrates that an emergency exists and the proposed method or procedure:


(1) Is not contrary to law;


(2) Is necessary to address the emergency situation;


(3) Will afford the same security and protection to the revenue as intended by the regulations; and


(4) Will not hinder the effective administration of this subpart.


(c) *Terms of emergency method or procedure approval and use.* (1) The proprietor may not use an emergency method or procedure until the application has been approved by TTB except when the emergency method or procedure requires immediate implementation to correct a situation that threatens life or property. In a situation involving a threat to life or property, the proprietor may implement the corrective action while concurrently notifying the appropriate TTB officer by telephone of the action and filing the required written application. Use of the emergency method or procedure must conform to any conditions specified in the approval.


(2) The proprietor must retain the emergency method or procedure approval as part of the proprietor's records and must make the approval available for examination by TTB officers upon request.


(3) The emergency method or procedure will automatically terminate when the situation that created the emergency no longer exists. TTB may withdraw the approval to use the emergency method or procedure if TTB finds that the revenue is jeopardized, that the emergency method or procedure hinders effective administration of the laws or regulations, or that the proprietor has failed to follow any of the conditions specified in the approval. When use of the emergency method or procedure terminates, the proprietor must revert to full compliance with all applicable regulations.
