# ยง 19.53   Continuity of plant premises.

As a general rule, the premises of a distilled spirits plant must be continuous except for separations by public waterways, roads, or carrier rights-of-way. However, the appropriate TTB officer may approve the registration of the plant where there are separations of the plant premises and all parts of the plant are in the same general location if:


(a) There is no jeopardy to revenue caused by the separation of premises; and


(b) The separation of premises does not create administrative problems for TTB.
