# ยง 19.156   Power of attorney for surety.

(a) *Requirement for power of attorney.* Every bond and every consent of surety filed with TTB in which an agent or officer executed the bond or consent on behalf of the surety must be supported by a power of attorney authorizing the agent or officer to execute the bond or consent of surety. The power of attorney assures TTB that the person who signed the bond on behalf of the surety has the legal authority to obligate the surety.


(b) *Form of power of attorney and endorsement.* A power of attorney will be prepared on the surety's own form, and must be executed under the surety's corporate seal. If the power of attorney submitted is other than a manually signed original, it must be accompanied by a certification from the surety that the power of attorney is valid.


(c) *Additional documentation.* The appropriate TTB officer authorized to approve and accept the bond may require additional evidence of the authenticity of signatures and the authority of persons signing on behalf of the surety to execute the bond or consent.
