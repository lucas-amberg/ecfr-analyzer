# ยง 19.187   Pipelines.

All pipelines, including flexible hoses, that are used to transfer spirits, denatured spirits, articles, and wines must be constructed, arranged, and secured so as to ensure protection of the revenue and permit ready examination. The appropriate TTB officer may approve pipelines that cannot be readily examined if they pose no jeopardy to the revenue.
