Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Distilled spirits transactions that appear in the records required by subpart V of this part will meet the proprietor's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the distilled spirits plant records, such as retail sales of wine or beer in a restaurant at the distilled spirits plant, or operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or beer, the proprietor must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.
