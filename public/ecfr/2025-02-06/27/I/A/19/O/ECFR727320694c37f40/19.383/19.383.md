# ยง 19.383   Gauging for denaturation.

(a) *General.* A proprietor must gauge spirits before denaturation and after denaturation and must record each gauge in the record of denaturation required by ยง 19.606(b). However, a proprietor is not required to gauge either spirits that are dumped from previously gauged containers or spirits that are transferred directly to mixing tanks from gauge tanks where they were gauged. Measurements of spirits and denaturants may be made by volume, weight, accurate mass flow meter, or by any other device that has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer.


(b) *Denaturation and article manufacture in a single process.* When a proprietor both denatures spirits and manufactures articles in a single, unified process, the proprietor may, in place of the procedure specified in paragraph (a) of this section, gauge the spirits before and after denaturation in the following manner:


(1) Gauge the spirits to be denatured by volume, weight, accurate mass flow meter, or other device or method approved by the appropriate TTB officer;


(2) Gauge the denaturants to be used by volume, weight, accurate mass flow meter, or other device approved by the appropriate TTB officer; and


(3) Compute the number of wine gallons of denatured spirits produced, and enter this figure in the record required by ยง 19.606(b). In calculating the amount of denatured spirits produced, the proprietor must not include in the calculation the amount of additional chemicals or denaturants used for article manufacture.
