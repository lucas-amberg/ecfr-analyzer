A proprietor may add trace amounts of acidic or caustic chemical compounds to adjust or neutralize the pH of denatured spirits. However, a proprietor may not adjust the pH with any substance that will counteract or reduce the effect of the denaturants. A proprietor who adjusts the pH of denatured spirits must keep a record of the adjustment with reference to the formula number of the treated denatured spirits. The record must include the kinds and quantities of chemical compounds used for each batch of denatured spirits treated.
