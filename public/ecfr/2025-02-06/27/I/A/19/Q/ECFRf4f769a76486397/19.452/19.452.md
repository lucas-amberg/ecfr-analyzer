# § 19.452   Return of taxpaid spirits to bonded premises for destruction, denaturation, redistillation, reconditioning, or rebottling.

(a) *Allowable returns.* A proprietor may return spirits to bonded premises if the spirits were taxpaid or tax determined by the proprietor, by another distilled spirits plant proprietor, or by an importer upon importation through U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However, consistent with section 5215(a) of the IRC the proprietor may return such spirits to bond only for one of the following reasons:


(1) Destruction, in accordance with § 19.459;


(2) Denaturation, in accordance with subpart O of this part;


(3) Redistillation, in accordance with subpart L of this part;


(4) Reconditioning; or


(5) Rebottling.


(b) *Dump and gauge of returned spirits.* The proprietor must immediately dump spirits returned to bonded premises under this section unless the spirits are returned in the sealed metal drums in which they were withdrawn. The proprietor must gauge spirits returned under this section upon their receipt. The proprietor may gauge spirits in bottles based upon the case markings and label information in accordance with § 19.286.


(c) *Claims for credit or refund of tax.* A proprietor may file a claim under § 19.264 for credit or refund of tax on spirits returned to bonded premises under this section. In addition to the information specified in § 19.264, a proprietor filing a claim for credit or refund of tax must have on file at the plant where spirits are returned to bond the following documentation for each lot of spirits returned:


(1) Documentation that establishes the amount of tax for which the claim for credit or refund is filed. If the spirits contain eligible wine or eligible flavors, the proprietor must have on file a copy of the record of tax determination as prescribed by § 19.611, or other documentation that establishes the rate of tax that was paid on the product. In lieu of establishing the actual effective tax rate of the product, the proprietor may claim a credit or refund based on the lowest effective tax rate applied to the product; and


(2) Credit memoranda or comparable financial records evidencing the return of each lot of spirits.


(d) *Applicability of Chapter 51 of the IRC.* All provisions of chapter 51 of the IRC and of this part that apply to spirits under TTB bond also apply to spirits when returned to bond under this section.
