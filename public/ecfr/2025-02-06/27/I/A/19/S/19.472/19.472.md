# § 19.472   Need to determine use of spirits—industrial or nonindustrial.

Many of the container and marking requirements set forth in this subpart are based on the intended use of the spirits, that is, whether they are for “industrial” or “nonindustrial” use. For purposes of this subpart, the terms “industrial” use and “nonindustrial” use refer to the uses specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(a) *Industrial use.* The word “industrial” when used with reference to the use of spirits has the same meaning as in §§ 1.60 and 1.62 of this chapter. Those uses are as follows:


(1) Free of tax by, and for the use of, the United States or any governmental agency thereof, any State, any political subdivision of a State, or the District of Columbia, for nonbeverage purposes;


(2) Free of tax for nonbeverage purposes and not for resale or use in the manufacture of any product for sale—


(i) For the use of any educational organization described in 26 U.S.C. 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) which is exempt from income tax under 26 U.S.C. 501(a), or for the use of any scientific university or college of learning;


(ii) For any laboratory for use exclusively in scientific research;


(iii) For use at any hospital, blood bank, or sanitarium (including use in making analysis or test at such hospital, blood bank, or sanitarium), or at any pathological laboratory exclusively engaged in making analyses, or tests, for hospitals or sanitariums; or


(iv) For the use of any clinic operated for charity and not for profit (including use in compounding of bona fide medicines for treatment outside of such clinics of patients thereof);


(3) Free of tax, after denaturation of such spirits in the manner prescribed by law for—


(i) Use in the manufacture of ether, chloroform, or other definite chemical substance where such distilled spirits are changed into some other chemical substance and do not appear in the finished product; or


(ii) Any other use in the arts and industries (except for uses prohibited by 26 U.S.C. 5273 (b) or (d)) and for fuel, light, and power; and


(4) The use of distilled spirits for experimental purposes and in the manufacture of—


(i) Medicinal, pharmaceutical, or antiseptic products, including prescriptions compounded by retail druggists;


(ii) Toilet preparations;


(iii) Flavoring extracts, syrups, or food products; or


(iv) Scientific, chemical, mechanical, or industrial products, provided such products are unfit for beverage use.


(b) *Nonindustrial use.* The word “nonindustrial” when used with reference to the use of spirits refers to any use not listed as an “industrial” use in paragraph (a) of this section. Nonindustrial uses include the following:


(1) For beverage purposes;


(2) In the manufacture, rectification, or blending of alcoholic beverages; or in the preparation of food or drink by a hotel, restaurant, tavern, or similar establishment; or as a medicine; and


(3) Distilled spirits in containers with a capacity of 1 wine gallon or less, other than anhydrous alcohol and alcohol that may be withdrawn from bond free of tax.
