# § 19.613   Average effective tax rate records.

(a) *Daily record.* For each distilled spirits product to be tax determined using an average effective tax rate in accordance with § 19.249, the proprietor must prepare a daily summary record showing:


(1) The serial number of the batch record of each batch of the product that will be bottled or packaged, in whole or in part, for domestic consumption;


(2) The proof gallons in each such batch derived from distilled spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors; and


(3) The tax liability of each such batch determined as follows—


(i) Proof gallons of all distilled spirits (exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), multiplied by the tax rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 5001;


(ii) Wine gallons of each eligible wine, multiplied by the tax rate which would be imposed on the wine under 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or (3) but for its removal to bonded premises; and


(iii) Proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors, to the extent that those distilled spirits exceed 2.5 percent of the proof gallons in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 5001.


(b) *Monthly records.* At the end of each month during which the product is manufactured, the proprietor must:


(1) Determine the total proof gallons and total tax liability for each summary record prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section;


(2) Add the sums derived under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the like sums determined for each of the preceding 5 months; and
