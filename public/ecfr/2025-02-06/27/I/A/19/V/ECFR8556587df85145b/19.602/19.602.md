# ยง 19.602   Redistillation records.

If a proprietor redistills spirits in the processing account (as in the production of gin or vodka by redistillation), the proprietor must prepare a record of the redistillation. The record must show the kind and quantity of the spirits entered into the distilling system and the kind and quantity of the spirits removed from the distilling system upon completion of the process.
