# ยง 19.572   Format of records.

As a general rule, the provisions of this subpart do not require proprietors to keep their records in any particular format or medium. For example, a proprietor may keep required records on paper, on microfilm or microfiche, or on a computer or other electronic medium, so long as the records are readily retrievable in hardcopy format for review by TTB officers as necessary. The required records may consist of documents created in the ordinary course of business, rather than documents created expressly to meet the requirements of this part, provided that those documents:


(a) Contain all of the relevant information required under this part;


(b) Are consistent with the general standards of clarity and accuracy; and


(c) Can be readily understood by TTB personnel.
