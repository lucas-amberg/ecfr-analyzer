# ยง 19.576   Preservation of records.

A proprietor must maintain required records in a manner that will ensure their readability and availability for inspection. Whenever the condition of any record will render it unsuitable for its intended or continued use, the proprietor must create an accurate and legible reproduction of the original record. TTB will treat the reproduced record as an original record, and all of the provisions of law that would apply to the original record also will apply to the reproduced record.
