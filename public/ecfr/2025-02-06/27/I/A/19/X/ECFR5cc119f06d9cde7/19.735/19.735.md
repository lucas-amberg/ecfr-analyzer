# § 19.735   Reconsignment while in transit.

A consignor may reconsign an in-bond shipment of spirits while the shipment is in transit or upon arrival at the premises of the consignee for any bona fide reason such as when the spirits transferred in bond are found to be unsuitable for the intended purpose or the spirits were shipped in error. The consignor may reconsign the shipment to itself or to another consignee that is qualified to receive the spirits. In either case, an Application for Transfer of Spirits and/or Denatured Spirits in Bond on form TTB F 5100.16 must have been previously approved for the new consignee and must be on file at the alcohol fuel plant. The bond of the new consignee of the spirits will cover the spirits while they are in transit after reconsignment. When reconsigning a shipment, the consignor must notify the original consignee that the transfer has been cancelled and must make a notation on the original invoice or shipping document that the shipment was reconsigned. The consignor must also prepare a new invoice or shipping document for the new consignee and must mark the new invoice or shipping document “reconsignment.”
