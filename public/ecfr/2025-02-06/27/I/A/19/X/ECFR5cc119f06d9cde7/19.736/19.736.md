# § 19.736   Consignee for in-bond shipments.

(a) *General.* A proprietor that receives spirits in bond from another alcohol fuel plant is the “consignee” of the shipment. When receiving spirits in bond, the consignee must:


(1) Examine each conveyance and notify the appropriate TTB officer immediately if any of the locks, seals, or other devices that secure each conveyance do not arrive at the premises intact;


(2) Determine the quantity of spirits received and record the quantity and date of receipt on the invoice or shipping document sent with the shipment; and


(3) Retain the invoice or shipping document as part of the records required by § 19.718.


(b) *Portable containers.* A consignee who receives spirits in barrels, drums, or other portable containers that are not secured by seals or other devices must verify the contents of each container. The consignee must record the quantity received in each container on a list and must attach the list to the invoice or shipping document received with the shipment.


(c) *Bulk conveyances or pipelines.* A consignee who receives spirits in bulk conveyances or by pipeline must gauge the spirits received and record the quantity determined on the invoice or shipping document received with the shipment. The appropriate TTB officer may waive the requirement for gauging spirits received by pipeline if requested in writing by the consignee and if there is no jeopardy to the revenue.
