# § 19.678   Criteria for issuance of permit.

As a general rule, the appropriate TTB officer will issue an alcohol fuel plant permit to any person who completes the required application for a permit and, when required, furnishes a bond. However, the appropriate TTB officer may begin proceedings to deny an application for a permit, in accordance with part 71 of this chapter, if the appropriate TTB officer determines that—


(a) The applicant (including, in the case of a corporation, any officer, director, or principal stockholder, and, in the case of a partnership, a partner) is, by reason of business experience, financial standing, or trade connections, not likely to maintain operations in compliance with 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, or the regulations issued thereunder;


(b) The applicant failed to disclose any material information required with the application, or has made any false statement as to any material fact in connection with the application; or


(c) The premises where the applicant proposes to conduct the operations are not adequate to protect the revenue.
