# ยง 19.715   Format of records.

(a) Proprietors of alcohol fuel plants are not required under this subpart to keep their records in any particular format or media. A proprietor may keep required records on paper, microfilm or microfiche, diskette, or other electronic medium. However, the records that a proprietor maintains must be readily retrievable in, or convertible to, hardcopy format for review by TTB officers as necessary.


(b) Required records may consist of commercial documents maintained in the ordinary course of business, rather than records prepared expressly to meet the requirements of this subpart, if those documents:


(1) Contain all of the information required by this subpart;


(2) Reflect general standards of clarity and accuracy; and


(3) Can be readily understood by TTB personnel.


(c) Where the format or arrangement of a record is such that the information is not readily understandable, the appropriate TTB officer may require the proprietor to present the information in a format or arrangement that will facilitate the review of the information.
