# ยง 20.28   Detention of containers.

(a) *Summary detention.* An appropriate TTB officer may detain any container containing, or supposed to contain, spirits (including denatured spirits and articles), when the appropriate TTB officer believes those spirits, denatured spirits, or articles were produced, withdrawn, sold, transported, or used in violation of law or this part. The appropriate TTB officer shall hold the container at a safe place until it is determined if the detained property is liable by law to forfeiture.


(b) *Limitations.* Summary detention may not exceed 72 hours without process of law or intervention of the appropriate TTB officer. The person possessing the container immediately before its detention may prepare a waiver of the 72 hours limitation to have the container kept on his or her premises during detention.
