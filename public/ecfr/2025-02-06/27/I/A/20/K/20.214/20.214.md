# § 20.214   Shipment for restoration or redenaturation.

Recovered denatured alcohol, recovered specially denatured rum, or recovered articles requiring restoration or redenaturation (or both, unless the restoration or redenaturation is to be done on the manufacturer's premises) shall be shipped to a distilled spirits plant or to a permittee. Packages shall be numbered with a package identification number or serial number in accordance with § 20.179 (b) or (c). Packages shall be labeled with the name, address, and permit number of the manufacturer, the quantity (in gallons) of spirits contained in the package, and the applicable words “Recovered denatured alcohol formula No. ____” or “Recovered specially denatured rum formula No. ____.” If the restoration or redenaturation is performed by a user or dealer permittee (not a distilled spirits plant), the permittee shall return the same materials to the same manufacturer and shall not intermingle them with materials received from other sources.
