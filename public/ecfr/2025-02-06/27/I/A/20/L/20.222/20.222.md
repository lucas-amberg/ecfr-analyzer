# § 20.222   Destruction.

(a) *Record of destruction.* A permittee who destroys specially denatured spirits or recovered alcohol, or who transfers such material to another entity for destruction, shall prepare a record of destruction, which shall be maintained by the permittee with the records required by subpart P of this part. The record shall identify—


(1) The reason for destruction,


(2) The date, time, location and manner of destruction,


(3) The quantity involved and, if applicable, identification of containers, and


(4) The name of the individual who accomplished or supervised the destruction.


(b) *Destruction by nonpermittees.* In general, the destruction of specially denatured spirits and recovered alcohol shall be performed by a permittee or a distilled spirits plant. However, a nonpermittee may destroy recovered alcoholic material if the material has been determined by the appropriate TTB officer to be equivalent to an article. If the material is not so determined, destruction may only occur on the premises of the manufacturer who recovered the material, a distilled spirits plant, or a dealer permittee.
