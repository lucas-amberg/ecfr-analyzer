# ยง 20.261   Records of completely denatured alcohol.

When requested by the appropriate TTB officer, any person who receives, packages, stores, disposes of, or uses completely denatured alcohol shall keep records of all transactions in completely denatured alcohol which will enable appropriate TTB officers to verify and trace receipt, packaging, storage, usage, and disposal of the spirits, and to determine whether there has been compliance with law and regulations. However, on sales in quantities of less than 5 gallons, only the total quantity disposed of daily need be recorded.
