# § 21.101   tert-Butyl alcohol.

(a) *Acidity (as acetic acid).* 0.003 percent by weight maximum.


(b) *Color.* Colorless.


(c) *Distillation range.* When 100 mL of tertiary butyl alcohol are distilled, none should distill below 78 °C. and none above 85 °C. More than 95 percent should distill between 81 °−83 °C.


(d) *Dryness at 20 °C.* Miscible without turbidity with 19 volumes of 60° Bé1. gasoline.


(e) *Freezing point (first needle).* Above 20 °C.


(f) *Identification test.* Place five drops of a solution containing approximately 0.1 percent tertiary butyl alcohol in ethyl alcohol in a test tube. Add 2 mL of Denige's reagent (dissolve 5 grams of red mercuric oxide in 20 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid; add this solution to 80 mL of distilled water, and filter when cool). Heat the mixture just to the boiling point and remove from the flame. A yellow precipitate forms within a few seconds.


(g) *Nonvolatile matter.* Less than 0.005 percent by weight.


(h) *Odor.* Characteristic odor.


(i) *Residual odor after evaporation.* None.


(j) *Specific gravity at 25 °/25 °C.* 0.780 to 0.786.
