# ยง 21.124   Quassin.

(a) Quassin is the bitter principle of quassia wood (occurring as a mixture of two isomeric forms). It shall be a good commercial grade of purified amorphous quassin, standardized as to bitterness.


(b) *Bitterness.* An aqueous solution of quassin shall be distinctly bitter at a 1 to 250,000 dilution. To test: Dissolve 0.1 gram of quassin in 100 mL of 95 percent alcohol, then dilute 4 mL of the solution to 1,000 mL with distilled water, mix well and taste.


(c) *Identification test.* Dissolve about 0.5 gram of quassin in 10 mL of 95 percent alcohol and filter. To 5 mL of the filtrate, add 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 mg of phloroglucinol and mix well. A red color develops.


(d) *Optical assay.* When 1 gram of quassin (in solution in a small amount of 95 percent alcohol) is dissolved in 10,000 mL of water, the absorbance of the solution in a 1 cm cell at a wavelength of 258 millimicrons shall not be less than 0.400.


(e) *Solubility.* When 0.5 gram of quassin is added to 25 mL of 190 proof alcohol, it shall dissolve completely.
