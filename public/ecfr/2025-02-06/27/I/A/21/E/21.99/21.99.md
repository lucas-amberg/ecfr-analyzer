# § 21.99   Brucine alkaloid.

(a) *Identification test.* Add a few drops of concentrated nitric acid to about 10 mg of brucine alkaloid. A vivid red color is produced. Dilute the red solution with a few drops of water and add a few drops of freshly made dilute stannous chloride solution. A reddish purple (violet) color is produced.


(b) *Melting point.* 178 °±1 °C. Dry the alkaloid in an oven for one hour at 100 °C., increase the temperature to 110° and dry to a constant weight before taking melting point.


(c) *Strychnine test.* Brucine alkaloid shall be free of strychnine when tested by the method listed under Brucine Sulfate, N.F. IX.


(d) *Sulfate test.* No white precipitate is formed that is not dissolved by hydrochloric acid when several drops of a 1 N barium chloride solution are added to 10 mL of a solution of the alkaloid.
