(a) The appropriate TTB officer may waive detailed application and supporting data requirements, other than the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of § 22.42, and of paragraph (a)(8) of that section as it relates to recovery, in the case of—


(1) All applications, Form 5150.22 filed by States or political subdivisions thereof or the District of Columbia, and


(2) Applications, Form 5150.22, filed by applicants, where the appropriate TTB officer has determined that the waiver of such requirements does not pose any jeopardy to the revenue or a hindrance of the effective administration of this part.
