# ยง 22.58   Automatic termination of permits.

(a) *Permit not transferable.* Permits issued under this part are not transferable. In the event of the lease, sale, or other transfer of such a permit, or of the operations authorized by the permit, the permit shall, except as provided for in this section, automatically terminate.


(b) *Corporations.* (1) If actual or legal control of any corporation holding a permit issued under this part changes, directly or indirectly, whether by reason of a change in stock ownership or control (in the permittee corporation or any other corporation), by operation of law, or in any other manner, the permittee shall within 10 days of the change, give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer. The written notice shall be accompanied by (or within 30 days of the change) an application and supporting documents on Form 5150.22 for a new permit. If an application on Form 5150.22 for a new permit is not filed within 30 days of the change, the outstanding permit will automatically terminate.


(2) If an application on Form 5150.22 for a new permit is filed within the 30-day period prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the outstanding permit will remain in effect until final action is taken on the application. When final action is taken, the outstanding permit will automatically terminate and the permittee shall forward it to the appropriate TTB officer for cancellation.


(c) *Proprietorships.* In the event of a change in proprietorship of a business of a permittee (as for instance, by reason of incorporation, the withdrawal or taking in of additional partners, or succession by any person who is not a fiduciary), the successor shall file written notice and make application on Form 5150.22 for a new permit under the same conditions provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.
