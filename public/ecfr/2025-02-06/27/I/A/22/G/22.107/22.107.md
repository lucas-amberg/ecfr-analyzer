(b) A pathological laboratory which uses tax-free alcohol for any other purpose, except as provided in this section, shall become liable for the tax on the alcohol.


(c) Except as provided in ยง 22.102, the use of tax-free alcohol and of products resulting from the use of tax-free alcohol shall be confined strictly to the permit premises.
