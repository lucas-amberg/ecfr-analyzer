# § 24.81   Filing of formulas.

The proprietor shall on each formula filed designate all ingredients and, if required, describe each process used to produce the wine. The addition or elimination of ingredients, changes in quantities used, and changes in the process of production, or any other change in an approved formula, will require the filing of a new TTB F 5120.29. After a change in formula is approved, the original formula must be surrendered to the appropriate TTB officer. The proprietor shall serially number each formula, commencing with “1” and continuing thereafter in numerical sequence. Nonbeverage wine formulas will be prefixed with the symbol “NB.” The appropriate TTB officer may at any time require the proprietor to file a statement of process in addition to that required by the TTB F 5120.29 or any other data to determine whether the formula should be approved or the approval continued.
