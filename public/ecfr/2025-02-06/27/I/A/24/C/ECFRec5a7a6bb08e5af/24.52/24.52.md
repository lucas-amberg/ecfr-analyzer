# ยง 24.52   Dealer registration.

Every proprietor who sells or offers for sale any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the proprietor's application to establish and operate a bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house filed under subpart D of this part, and approval of that application by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the proprietor's registration as a dealer at the approved bonded or taxpaid wine premises. Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this section will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see ยง 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of spirits, beer, or other proprietors' wine. As provided in ยง 31.52 of this chapter, the proprietor is subject to no additional registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. Otherwise, a proprietor who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
