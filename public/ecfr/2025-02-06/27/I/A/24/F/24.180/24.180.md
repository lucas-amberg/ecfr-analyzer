# ยง 24.180   Use of concentrated and unconcentrated fruit juice.

Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to its original density, or to 22 degrees Brix, or to any degree of Brix between its original density and 22 degrees Brix, and unconcentrated fruit juice reduced with water to not less than 22 degrees Brix, is considered juice for the purpose of standard wine production. Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to any degree of Brix greater than 22 degrees Brix may be further reduced with water to any degree of Brix between its original density and 22 degrees Brix. The proprietor, prior to using concentrated fruit juice in wine production, shall obtain a statement in which the producer certifies the kind of fruit from which it was produced and the total solids content of the juice before and after concentration. Concentrated or unconcentrated fruit juice may be used in juice or wine made from the same kind of fruit for the purposes of chaptalizing or sweetening, as provided in this part. Concentrated fruit juice, or juice which has been concentrated and reconstituted, may not be used in standard wine production if at any time it was concentrated to more than 80 degrees Brix.
