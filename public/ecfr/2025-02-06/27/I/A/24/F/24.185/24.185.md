# § 24.185   Use of wood to treat natural wine.

(a) *Treatment by contact.* Natural wine may be treated with any wood that is consistent with the food additive requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The wood may be in the form of barrels, staves, chips, particles, or storage tanks that were used for the addition of wine spirits if the tanks are used for the baking of wine. The wood may be toasted (that is, heated to low, medium, or high, temperature without undergoing combustion), or charred and the wood must not be otherwise treated. If wine is treated with charred wood, the wood may not remove color from the wine.


(b) *Use of wood essences and extracts.* A proprietor may make or purchase for blending purposes wine that has been heavily treated with wood; however, wood preparations made with an alcohol solution stronger than 24 percent alcohol by volume are essences and must be used in accordance with § 24.85. Wood essences and extracts must be consistent with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act for that purpose and may be used only in “other wine” in accordance with § 24.218. This paragraph (b) applies to liquid extracts and essences and to the extracts and essences in powder form or dissolved in water after the solvent has been evaporated.


(c) *Use of wooden storage tanks.* Wooden storage tanks used for the addition of spirits may be used for the baking of wine.
