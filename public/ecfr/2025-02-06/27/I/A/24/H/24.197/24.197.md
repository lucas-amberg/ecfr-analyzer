Spirits may not be added to special natural wine with the exception of spirits contained in the natural wine used as a base or in authorized essences made on bonded wine premises as provided in ยง 24.86 or in approved essences made elsewhere. Upon removal of the wine from fermenters, the volume of liquid will be determined accurately and recorded as wine produced.
