# ยง 24.218   Other wine.

(a) *General.* Other than standard wine not included in other sections in this subpart are considered other wine. Those wines considered to be other wine include:


(1) Wine made with sugar, water, or sugar and water beyond the limitations prescribed for standard wine.


(2) Wine made by blending wines produced from different kinds of fruit.


(3) Wine made with sugar other than pure dry sugar, liquid pure sugar, and invert sugar syrup.


(4) Wine made with materials not authorized for use in standard wine.


(b) *Production of other wine.* Other wine may be made on bonded wine premises but will remain segregated from standard wine. Other wine will have a basic character derived from the primary winemaking material. If sugar is used to make other wine, the aggregate weight of the sugar used before and during fermentation will be less than the weight of the primary wine producing material. Wine spirits may be added to other wine. Upon removal, other wine will be marked or labeled with a designation which will adequately disclose the nature and composition of the wine.
