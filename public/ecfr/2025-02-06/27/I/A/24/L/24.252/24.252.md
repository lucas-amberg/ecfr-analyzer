In approving any request under this section, the appropriate TTB officer may require the proprietor to take steps to prevent future accidental additions of water to wine. In evaluating any request under this section, the appropriate TTB officer may consider as a factor whether the proprietor has demonstrated good commercial practices, taking into account the proprietor's prior history of accidental addition of water to wine and of compliance with other regulations in this part.


(c) *Records.* The proprietor must, with respect to removals of water from wine and addition of concentrate authorized under this section, maintain records that document the accidental addition of water, the use of any treatment or process to remove the water from the wine, and the fact that only the amount of water that was accidentally added to the wine was removed as a result of the treatment or process or that only an amount of concentrate sufficient to make up for the amount of water accidentally added is used.
