Wine may be removed for transfer in bond, from one bonded wine premises to another bonded wine premises or to a distilled spirits plant. For bulk wine transferred in bond between adjacent or contiguous bonded wine premises or to an adjacent or contiguous distilled spirits plant, an accurately calibrated tank for measuring the wine is required on at least one of the premises. The volume of wine transferred will be recorded to the nearest whole gallon, five-tenths gallon being converted to the next full gallon.
