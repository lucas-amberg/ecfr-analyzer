# § 24.283   Reconsignment.

Prior to or on arrival at the premises of a consignee, wine transferred in bond may be reconsigned by the consignor. The proprietor to whom the wine is reconsigned will be liable for the tax on the wine while it is in transit after reconsignment. Notice of cancellation of the shipment will be made to the other proprietors involved by the proprietor who reconsigned the wine. Where reconsignment is to other than the shipping proprietor, a new transfer record prominently marked “Reconsignment” will be prepared and processed as provided by § 24.281.
