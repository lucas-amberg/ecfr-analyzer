# § 24.300   General.

(a) *Records and reports.* A proprietor who conducts wine operations shall maintain wine transaction records and submit reports as required by this part. Transaction records may be recorded in wine gallons or in liters. However, required reports will show wine volumes in wine gallons. The equivalent wine gallons of wine bottled or packed and labeled according to metric measure will be determined using the following conversion factors:


(1) *Per case.* Equivalent gallonage may be determined using the following conversion factors for cases of metric bottles:


(2) *Per liter.* Equivalent gallonage may be determined by multiplying total liters by a conversion factor of 0.26417 gallons per liter.


(b) *Time of making entries.* Any operation or transaction is to be entered in records or commercial papers at the time the operation or transaction occurs, except that where records are posted from source records or from supplemental auxiliary records prepared at the time the operation or transaction occurs, entries in another record may be deferred to not later than the close of business of the third business day succeeding the day on which the operation or transaction occurs. The proprietor shall retain all source records and all supplemental or auxiliary records which support entries in other records or commercial papers in order to facilitate verification of operations by appropriate TTB officers. Source records and supplemental or auxiliary records may be used as a record of an operation or transaction and to prepare the TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations, provided the record will readily allow for verification of an operation or transaction by appropriate TTB officers.


(c) *Prescribed forms.* All reports required by this part must be submitted on forms prescribed by § 24.20. Entries will be made as indicated by the headings of the columns and lines, and as required by the instructions for the form. Report forms are furnished free of cost.


(d) *Period of retention.* All prescribed returns, reports and records (including source records) will be retained by the proprietor for a period of not less than three years from the record date or the date of the last entry required to be made in the record, whichever is later. However, the appropriate TTB officer may require records to be kept an additional period not exceeding three years in any case where retention is determined to be necessary.


(e) *Data processing.* (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, data maintained on data processing equipment may be kept at a location other than the wine premises if the original operation or transaction source records required by this subpart are kept available for inspection at the wine premises.


(2) Data which has been accumulated on cards, tapes, discs, or other accepted recording media will be retrievable within five business days.


(3) The applicable data processing program will be made available for examination if requested by an appropriate TTB officer.


(f) *Photographic copies of records.* The proprietor may record, copy, or reproduce records required by this part and may use any process which accurately reproduces the original record and which forms a durable medium for reproducing and preserving the original record. Whenever records are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records will be preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provisions will be made for examining, viewing and using the reproduced record the same as if it were the original record, and it will be treated and considered for all purposes as though it were the original record. All provisions of law and regulations applicable to the original are applicable to the reproduced record. As used in this paragraph, “original record” means the record required to be maintained or preserved by the proprietor, even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the document.


(g) *TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations.* A proprietor who conducts bonded wine premises operations must complete and submit TTB F 5120.17 in accordance with the instructions on the form.


(1) *Monthly report.* The proprietor must submit TTB F 5120.17 on a monthly basis, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section.


(2) *Quarterly or annual report.* (i) *General.* A proprietor may file a completed TTB F 5120.17 on a quarterly or annual basis if the proprietor meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (g)(2)(iii) of this section. To begin the quarterly or annual filing of a report of bonded wine premises operations, a proprietor must state the intent to do so in the “Remarks” section when filing the prior month's TTB F 5120.17. A proprietor who is commencing operations during a calendar year and expects to meet these criteria may use a letter notice to the appropriate TTB officer and file TTB F 5120.17 quarterly or annually for the remaining portion of the calendar year. If a proprietor becomes ineligible for quarterly or annual filing by exceeding the applicable tax liability or activity limit, the proprietor must file TTB F 5120.17 for that month and for all subsequent months of the calendar year. If there is jeopardy to the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may at any time require any proprietor otherwise eligible for quarterly or annual filing of a report of bonded wine premises operations to file such report monthly.


(ii) *Eligibility for quarterly report filing.* In order to be eligible to file TTB F 5120.17 on a quarterly basis, the proprietor must be filing quarterly tax returns under § 24.271(b)(1)(iii), and the proprietor must not expect the sum of the bulk and bottled wine to be accounted for in all tax classes to exceed 60,000 gallons for any one quarter during the calendar year when adding up the bulk and bottled wine on hand at the beginning of the month, bulk wine produced by fermentation, sweetening, blending, amelioration or addition of wine spirits, bulk wine bottled, bulk and bottled wine received in bond, taxpaid wine returned to bond, bottled wine dumped to bulk, inventory gains, and any activity written in the untitled lines of the report form which increases the amount of wine to be accounted for.


(iii) *Eligibility for annual report filing.* In order to be eligible to file TTB F 5120.17 on an annual basis, the proprietor must be filing annual tax returns under § 24.271(b)(1)(ii), and the proprietor must not expect the sum of the bulk and bottled wine to be accounted for in all tax classes to exceed 20,000 gallons for any one month during the calendar year when adding up the bulk and bottled wine on hand at the beginning of the month, bulk wine produced by fermentation, sweetening, blending, amelioration or addition of wine spirits, bulk wine bottled, bulk and bottled wine received in bond, taxpaid wine returned to bond, bottled wine dumped to bulk, inventory gains, and any activity written in the untitled lines of the report form which increases the amount of wine to be accounted for.


(3) *No reportable activity.* A proprietor who files a monthly TTB F 5120.17 and does not expect an inventory change or any reportable operations to be conducted in a subsequent month or months may attach to the filed TTB F 5120.17 a statement that, until a change in the inventory or a reportable operation occurs, a TTB F 5120.17 will not be filed.
