# ยง 25.51   Right of Entry and Examination.

An appropriate TTB officer may enter, during normal business hours, a brewery or other place where beer is stored and may, when the premises are open at other times, enter those premises in the performance of official duties. Appropriate TTB officers may make inspections as the appropriate TTB officer deems necessary to determine that operations are conducted in compliance with the law and this part. The owner of any building or place where beer is produced, made, or kept, or person having charge over such premises, who refuses to admit an appropriate TTB officer acting under 26 U.S.C. 7606, or who refuses to permit an appropriate TTB officer to examine beer must, for each refusal, forfeit $500.
