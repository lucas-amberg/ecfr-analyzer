(3) For formulas that include the use of flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol, you must explicitly indicate:


(i) The volume and alcohol content of the beer base;


(ii) The maximum volumes of the flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol to be used;


(iii) The alcoholic strength of the flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol;


(iv) The overall alcohol contribution to the finished product provided by the addition of any flavors or other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.

(v) The final volume and alcohol content of the finished product.


(b) *Process information.* For each formula you must describe in detail each process used to produce a fermented beverage.

(d) *Beer base formulas.* You must refer in your formula to any approved formula number that covers the production of any beer base used in producing the formula product. If the beer base was produced by another brewery of the same ownership, you must also provide the name and address or name and registry number of that brewery.
