(a) *Bond coverage.* Bonds required by this part will be given with corporate surety or collateral security.


(b) *Corporate surety.* Surety bonds may be given only with surety companies holding certificates of authority from the Secretary as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds, subject to the limitations set forth in the current revision of Treasury Department Circular 570, Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies. 


(c) *Availability of Circular 570.* Treasury Department Circular 570 is published in the _Federal Register_ annually on the first business day in July, and supplemental changes are published periodically thereafter (see *https://www.federalregister.gov*). The most recent circular and any supplemental changes to it may be viewed on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service website (see *https://fiscal.treasury.gov*).


(d) *More than one corporate surety.* A bond may be executed by two or more corporate sureties. Each corporate surety may limit its liability in terms on the face of the bond in a specified amount. This amount may not exceed the limitations set forth for corporate security by the Secretary which are set forth in the current revision of Treasury Department Circular 570. The sum of the liabilities for the sureties will equal the required penal sum of the bond.


(e) *Deposit of collateral securities in lieu of corporate surety.* Bonds or notes of the United States, or other obligations which are unconditionally guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the United States, may be pledged and deposited by principals as collateral security in lieu of corporate surety in accordance with 31 CFR part 225.


(f) *Bond guaranteed by deposit of cash or cash equivalent.* As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under paragraph (b) of this section, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by submitting cash or its equivalent (including a money order, cashier's check, or personal check). Cash or its equivalent must be no less than the penal sums of the required bonds. Bonds described in this paragraph will be released if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated. Cash equivalents must be payable to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
