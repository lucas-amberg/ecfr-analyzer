# ยง 25.112   Dealer registration.

Every brewer who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10, filed under subpart G of this part, and approval of that notice by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the brewer's registration as a dealer at the brewery. Every brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see ยง 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of wine, spirits, or other brewers' beer. As provided in ยง 31.52 of this chapter, the brewer is subject to no additional registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. Otherwise, a brewer who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the brewery must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
