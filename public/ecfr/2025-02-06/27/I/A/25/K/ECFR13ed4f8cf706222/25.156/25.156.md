The following keg sizes are also authorized at the stated barrel equivalents:


(b) If any barrel or authorized size keg contains a quantity of beer more than 2 percent in excess of its rated capacity, tax will be determined and paid on the actual quantity of beer (without benefit of any tolerance) contained in the keg.
