# ยง 25.223   Destruction of beer off brewery premises.

(a) *Destruction without supervision.* A brewer may destroy beer without supervision if the appropriate TTB officer does not advise the brewer before the date specified in the notice that destruction of the beer is to be supervised.


(b) *Destruction with supervision.* The appropriate TTB officer may require that an appropriate TTB officer verify the information in the notice of destruction or witness the destruction of the beer. The appropriate TTB officer may also require a delay in the destruction of the beer or, if the place of destruction is not readily accessible to an appropriate TTB officer, may require that the beer be moved to a more convenient location. In this case, the brewer may not destroy the beer except under the conditions imposed by the appropriate TTB officer.
