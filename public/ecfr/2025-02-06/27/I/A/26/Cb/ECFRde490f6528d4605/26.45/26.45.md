# ยง 26.45   Warehouse receipts covering distilled spirits.

The sale of warehouse receipts for distilled spirits is equivalent to the sale of distilled spirits. Accordingly, every person bringing distilled spirits into the United States from Puerto Rico who sells, or offers for sale, warehouse receipts for distilled spirits stored in warehouses, or elsewhere, must register and keep records as a dealer in liquors at the place where the warehouse receipts are sold, or offered for sale, in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
