# § 26.70   Superseding bonds and new bonds for previously exempt persons.

(a) *Superseding bonds.* Superseding bonds will be required in case of insolvency or removal of any surety, and may, at the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer, be required in any other contingency affecting the validity or impairing the efficiency of an existing bond. Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, continuing or liquidating the business of the principal, must execute and file a superseding bond or obtain the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds. Where, under the provisions of § 26.72, the surety on any bond given under this subpart has filed an application to be relieved of liability under said bond and the principal desires or intends to continue the operations to which such bond relates, he must file a valid superseding bond to be effective on or before the date specified in the surety's notice. Superseding bonds must show the current date of execution and the effective date.


(b) *New bonds for previously exempt persons.* If a person has not furnished a bond as provided in this subpart because the person was exempt from bond requirements under §§ 26.66(c), 26.67(b), or 26.68(b), the person must furnish a bond to cover shipments following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the person during the calendar year exceeds $50,000. If a person has not furnished the required bond for shipments under this subpart, the person must prepay tax on those shipments as provided in § 26.112(e).
