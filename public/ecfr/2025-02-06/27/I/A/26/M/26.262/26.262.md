# ยง 26.262   Determination of tax on distilled spirits.

(a) If the certificate required by ยง 26.205 covers distilled spirits, and the distilled spirits are not being transferred under subparts O or Oa of this part, the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 which provides for a tax equal to the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 will be collected on each proof gallon, and fractional part thereof, contained in the shipment.


(b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 7652 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not exceed 2 
1/2 percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.


(c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with ยง 26.262a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each withdrawal or other disposition of the distilled spirits within the United States.
