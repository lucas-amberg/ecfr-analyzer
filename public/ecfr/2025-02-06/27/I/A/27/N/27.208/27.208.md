# ยง 27.208   Liquor bottles not eligible for release from customs custody.

Upon receipt of a letterhead application, the appropriate TTB officer may, in nonrecurring cases, authorize a person to bring into the United States liquor bottles that do not conform to the provisions of this part if that TTB officer determines that the nonconformance is due to an unintentional error; the nonconforming liquor bottle is determined not to be deceptive, as provided in ยง 27.206; and the entry of the nonconforming liquor bottle will not jeopardize the revenue. The person bringing such liquor bottles into the United States under TTB authorization must maintain proof of such authorization for not less than three years from the date that the liquor bottles were released from customs custody and make it available upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.
