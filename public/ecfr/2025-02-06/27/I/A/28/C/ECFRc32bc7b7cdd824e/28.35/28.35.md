Liquors may not, under the law, be transferred to a foreign-trade zone for the purpose of destruction. However, liquors transported to and deposited in a foreign-trade zone for exportation or for storage pending exportation may be destroyed under the supervision of the district director of customs, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the liquors, after deposit in a zone, have become unmerchantable or unfit for export.
