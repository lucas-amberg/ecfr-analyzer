# § 28.117   Responsibility for return of spirits.

The person who withdrew the spirits without payment of tax shall be responsible for arranging the return of the spirits to the distilled spirits plant receiving them. The person or his agent shall submit a copy of the notice required by § 28.116 to the appropriate customs official. If the spirits are returned before the TTB Form 5100.11 has been filed with the customs official, the person shall submit the form with the notice. The customs officer shall, if the spirits are eligible for return under § 28.115, accept the notice as authority for the return of the spirits to the distilled spirits plant identified in the notice. The customs officer shall retain the notice and shall mark each copy of TTB Form 5100.11 “Canceled”, note the date thereon, return both copies to the person, and, if the spirits are in customs custody, release them for return. The person shall retain one copy of the canceled TTB Form 5100.11 and file one copy with the appropriate TTB officer identified on the form.
