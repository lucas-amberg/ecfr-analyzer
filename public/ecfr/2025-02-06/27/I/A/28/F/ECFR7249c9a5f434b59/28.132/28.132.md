# § 28.132   Responsibility for return of wine.

The person who withdrew the wines without payment of tax shall be responsible for arranging the return of the wines to the bonded wine cellar from which they were withdrawn. In case of emergency, the person may arrange the return of wines to bonded premises without an approved application, but such wines shall be kept separate at the bonded premises and shall not be recorded in the records and reports of the proprietor until an approved application for such return has been obtained as provided in § 28.131. Such person or his agent shall present to the appropriate customs official the two copies of the approved application authorizing the return unless the wines are returned before the TTB Form 5100.11 has been filed with the customs official. The customs officer shall, if he finds that the wines are eligible for return under § 28.130, accept the approved application as authority for the return of the wines to the bonded wine cellar noted on the application and shall mark each copy of TTB Form 5100.11 “Canceled”, note the date thereon, affix a copy of the approved application to each of the canceled TTB Forms 5100.11, return both TTB Forms 5100.11 to the person, and, where the wines are in his custody, release them for return. The canceled TTB Forms 5100.11, with attachments, shall be delivered by such person or his agent to the proprietor of the bonded wine cellar. When wines have been returned before the TTB Forms 5100.11 were filed with customs officials, the two copies of the approved application shall be submitted, by the person or his agent, to the proprietor of the bonded wine cellar who shall cancel and date each copy of TTB Form 5100.11 and affix copies of the approved application thereto.
