The principal on the bond under which the specially denatured spirits were withdrawn free of tax shall be responsible for arranging the return of the spirits to the distilled spirits plant receiving them. The principal or his agent shall submit a copy of the notice required by § 28.161 to the appropriate customs official. If the specially denatured spirits are returned before the TTB Form 5100.11 has been filed with the customs official, the principal shall submit the form with the notice. The customs officer shall, if the specially denatured spirits are eligible for return under § 28.160, accept the notice as authority for the return of the specially denatured spirits to the distilled spirits plant identified in the notice. The customs officer shall retain the notice and shall mark each copy of TTB Form 5100.11 “Canceled”, note the date thereon, return both copies to the principal, and, if the spirits are in customs custody, release them for return. The principal shall retain one copy of the canceled TTB Form 5100.11 and file one copy with the appropriate TTB officer identified on the form.
