# § 30.25   Use of precision specific gravity hydrometers.

The provisions of § 30.23 respecting the care, handling, and use of precision instruments shall be followed with respect to the care, handling, and use of precision grade specific gravity hydrometers. Specific gravity hydrometers shall be read to the nearest subdivision. Because of temperature density relationships and the selection of the standardization temperature of 60 °/60 °F., the specific gravity readings will be greater at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and less at temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, correction of the specific gravity readings will be made for temperature other than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Such correction may be ascertained by dividing the specific gravity hydrometer reading by the applicable correction factor in Table 7.
