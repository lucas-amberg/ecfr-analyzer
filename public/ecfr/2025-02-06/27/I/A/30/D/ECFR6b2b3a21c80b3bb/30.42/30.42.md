# ยง 30.42   Denatured spirits.

The quantity, in gallons, of any lot or package of specially denatured spirits may be determined by weighing it and then dividing its weight by the weight per gallon of the formula concerned, as given in the appropriate tables in subpart H of 27 CFR part 21. In the case of completely denatured spirits, the gallonage of any lot or package may be ascertained by determining its weight and apparent proof (hydrometer indication, corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and then multiplying the weight of the wine gallons per pound factor shown in Table 4 for the (apparent) proof.
