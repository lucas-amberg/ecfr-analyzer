# ยง 30.62   Table 2, showing wine gallons and proof gallons by weight.

The wine and proof gallon content by weight and proof of packages of distilled spirits usually found in actual practice will be ascertained from this table. The left-hand column contains the weights. The true percent of proof is shown on the heading of each page in a range from 90 degrees to 200 degrees. Under the true percent of proof and on the same horizontal line with the weight will be found the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and the proof gallons respectively. Where either the weight or the proof of a quantity of spirits is beyond the limitations of this table, the number of proof gallons may be ascertained by reference to Table 3. This table may also be used to ascertain the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and proof gallons of spirituous liquor containing dissolved solids where the weight, apparent proof (hydrometer indication corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit), and obscuration factor have been determined.
