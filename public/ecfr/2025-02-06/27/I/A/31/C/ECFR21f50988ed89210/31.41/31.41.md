# § 31.41   Clubs or similar organizations.

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a club or similar organization is a dealer for purposes of this part if the club or organization:


(1) Furnishes liquors to members under conditions constituting a sale (including the acceptance of orders therefor, furnishing the liquors ordered and collecting the price thereof); or


(2) Conducts a bar for the sale of liquors on the occasion of an outing, picnic, or other entertainment, unless the club is a “limited retail dealer” described in § 31.35. The registration of the proprietor of the premises where the bar is located will not relieve the club or organization from its own obligation to register; or


(3) Purchases liquors for members without prior agreement concerning payment therefor and such organization subsequently recoups those costs.


(b) Compliance with the registration and other requirements of this part is not required if money is collected in advance from members for the purchase of liquors, or if money is advanced for the purchase of liquors pursuant to an agreement with the members for reimbursement.
