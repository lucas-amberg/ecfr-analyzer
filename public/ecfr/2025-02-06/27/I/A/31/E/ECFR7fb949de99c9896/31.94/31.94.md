# § 31.94   Retail dealers “At Large.”

A retail dealer in liquors or a retail dealer in beer whose business requires the dealer to travel from place to place, such as a dealer who sells at carnivals or circuses, must register “At Large” covering the dealer's activities throughout the United States by filing only one registration. A dealer submitting such a registration must state on the registration form, or on an attachment thereto, the nature of the dealer's business and the reason the dealer requires registration “At Large.”
