# § 31.172   Place of filing.

Records of receipt and disposition and monthly summary reports required by §§ 31.155, 31.156, and 31.160 must be maintained at the dealer's place of business. The appropriate TTB officer may, upon request, authorize maintenance of files, or an individual file, at another business location under the control of the same wholesale dealer, when it is determined that such maintenance will not cause undue inconvenience to TTB officers desiring to examine those files.
