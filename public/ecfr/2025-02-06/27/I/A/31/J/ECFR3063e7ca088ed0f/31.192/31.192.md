# § 31.192   Photographic copies of records.

(a) *General.* Dealers may record, copy, or reproduce records required by this part. Dealers may use any process that accurately reproduces the original record and that forms a durable medium for preserving the original record.


(b) *Copies of records treated as original records.* Whenever records are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records must be preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provision must be made for examining, viewing, and using the reproduced record in the same manner as if it were the original record. A reproduced record will be treated and considered for all purposes as though it were the original record. All provisions of law and regulations applicable to the original record are applicable to the reproduced record. As used in this section, “original record” means the record required by this part to be maintained or preserved by a dealer, even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the document.
