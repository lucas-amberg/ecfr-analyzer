# § 31.212   Labeling.

Every dealer packaging alcohol for industrial use must affix to each package filled a label bearing in conspicuous print the words “Alcohol” and “For Industrial Use,” the proof of the alcohol, the capacity of the container, and the packaging dealer's name and address. The dealer may incorporate in the label other appropriate statements; however, such statements must not obscure or contradict the data required by this section to be shown on such labels.
