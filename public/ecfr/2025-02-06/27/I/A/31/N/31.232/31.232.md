# § 31.232   Wine bottling.

Each person desiring to bottle, package, or repackage taxpaid wines must, before carrying on those operations, apply and receive permission from the appropriate TTB officer in accordance with part 24 of this chapter. The decanting of wine by caterers or other retail dealers for table or room service, banquets, and similar purposes shall not be considered as “bottling,” if the decanters are not furnished for the purpose of carrying wine away from the area where served.
