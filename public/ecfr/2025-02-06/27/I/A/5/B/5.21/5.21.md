This requirement applies to distilled spirits produced and bottled in the United States and to distilled spirits imported in bulk, regardless of where produced, and bottled in the United States. Bottlers may obtain an exemption from this requirement only if they satisfy the conditions set forth in ยง 5.23.


(c) *Evidence of COLA.* Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, a bottler or importer must provide evidence that a container of distilled spirits is covered by a COLA.
