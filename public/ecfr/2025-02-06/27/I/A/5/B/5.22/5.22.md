(a) *What a COLA authorizes.* An approved TTB Form 5100.31 authorizes the bottling of distilled spirits covered by the certificate of label approval (COLA), as long as the container bears labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the COLA, or labels with changes authorized by TTB on the COLA or otherwise (such as through the issuance of public guidance available on the TTB website at *https://www.ttb.gov*).


(b) *When to obtain a COLA.* The COLA must be obtained prior to bottling. No bottler may bottle distilled spirits, or remove distilled spirits from the premises where bottled, unless a COLA has been obtained.


(c) *Application for a COLA.* The bottler may apply for a COLA by submitting an application to TTB on Form 5100.31, in accordance with the instructions on the form. The bottler may apply for a COLA either electronically by accessing TTB's online system, COLAs Online, at *https://www.ttb.gov,* or by submitting the paper form. For procedures regarding the issuance of COLAs, see part 13 of this chapter.
