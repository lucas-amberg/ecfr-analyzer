# § 5.23   Application for exemption from label approval for distilled spirits bottled in the United States.

(a) *Exemption.* Any bottler of distilled spirits may apply to be exempt from the requirements of §§ 5.21, 5.22, and 5.30(h), by showing to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the distilled spirits to be bottled are not to be sold, offered for sale, or shipped or delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced, in interstate or foreign commerce.


(b) *Application required.* The bottler must file an application on TTB Form 5100.31 for exemption from label approval before bottling the distilled spirits. The bottler may apply for a certificate of exemption from label approval either electronically, by accessing TTB's online system, COLAs Online, at *https://www.ttb.gov,* or by using the paper form. For procedures regarding the issuance of certificates of exemption from label approval, see part 13 of this chapter.


(c) *Labeling of distilled spirits covered by certificate of exemption.* The application for a certificate of exemption from label approval requires that the applicant identify the State in which the product will be sold. As a condition of receiving exemption from label approval, the label covered by an approved certificate of exemption must include the statement “For sale in [name of State] only.” See §§ 19.517 and 19.518 of this chapter for additional labeling rules that apply to distilled spirits covered by a certificate of exemption.
