# ยง 5.44   Adding a label or other information to a container that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer.

Any label or other information that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer of the distilled spirits may be added to containers (by the addition of stickers, engraving, stenciling, etc.) without prior approval from TTB and without being covered by a certificate of label approval or certificate of exemption from label approval. Such information may be added before or after the containers have been removed from distilled spirits plant premises or released from customs custody. The information added:


(a) May not violate the provisions of subpart F, G, or H of this part;


(b) May not contain any reference to the characteristics of the product; and


(c) May not be added to the container in such a way that it obscures any other labels on the container.
