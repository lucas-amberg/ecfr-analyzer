# § 5.62   Packaging (cartons, coverings, and cases).

(a) *General.* An individual covering, carton, or other container of the bottle used for sale at retail (other than a shipping container), may not contain any statement, design, device, or graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation that is prohibited on labels by regulations in subpart F, G, or H of this part.


(b) *Sealed opaque cartons.* If containers are enclosed in sealed opaque coverings, cartons, or other containers used for sale at retail (other than shipping containers), such coverings, cartons, or other containers must bear all mandatory label information.


(c) *Other cartons.* (1) If an individual covering, carton, or other container of the bottle used for sale at retail (other than a shipping container) is so designed that the bottle is readily removable, it may display any information which is not in conflict with the label on the bottle contained therein.


(2) Cartons displaying brand names and/or designations must display such names and designations in their entirety—brand names required to be modified, *e.g.,* by “Brand” or “Product of U.S.A.”, must also display such modification.


(3) Specialty products for which a truthful and adequate statement of composition is required must display such statement.


(d) *Labeling of containers within the packaging.* The container within the packaging is subject to all labeling requirements of this part, including mandatory labeling information requirements, regardless of whether the packaging bears such information.
