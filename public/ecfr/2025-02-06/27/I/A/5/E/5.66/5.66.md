# § 5.66   Name and address for domestically bottled distilled spirits that were wholly made in the United States.

(a) *General.* Domestically bottled distilled spirits that were wholly made in the United States and contain no imported distilled spirits must be labeled in accordance with this section. (See §§ 5.67 and 5.68 for name and address requirements applicable to distilled spirits that are not wholly made in the United States.) For purposes of this section, a “processor” who solely bottles the labeled distilled spirits will be considered the “bottler.”


(b) *Form of statement.* The bottler, distiller, or processor of the distilled spirits must be identified by a phrase describing the function performed by that person. If that person performs more than one function, the label may (but is not required to) so indicate.


(1) If the name of the bottler appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “bottled by,” “canned by,” “packed by,” or “filled by,” followed by the name and address of the bottler.


(2) If the name of the processor appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “blended by,” “made by,” “prepared by,” “produced by,” or “manufactured by,” as appropriate, followed by the name and address of the processor. When applied to distilled spirits, the term “produced by” indicates a processing operation (formerly known as rectification) that involves a change in the class or type of the product through the addition of flavors or some other processing activity.


(3) If the name of the distiller appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “distilled by,” followed by the name and address of the distiller. If the distilled spirits were bottled for the distiller thereof, the name and address of the distiller may be preceded by a phrase such as “distilled by and bottled for,” or “bottled for.”


(c) *Listing of more than one function.* If different functions are performed by more than one person, statements on the label may not create the misleading impression that the different functions were performed by the same person.


(d) *Form of address*—(1) *General.* The address consists of the city and State where the operation occurred, or the city and State of the principal place of business of the person performing the operation. This information must be consistent with the information on the basic permit. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses. The postal abbreviation of the State name may be used; for example, California may be abbreviated as CA.


(2) *More than one address.* If the bottler, distiller, or processor listed on the name and address statement is the actual operator of more than one distilled spirits plant engaged in bottling, distilling, or processing operations, as applicable, the label may state, immediately following the name of the permittee, the addresses of those other plants, in addition to the address of the plant at which the distilled spirits were bottled. In this situation, the address where the operation occurred must be indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.


(3) *Principal place of business.* The label may provide the address of the bottler's, distiller's, or processor's principal place of business, in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling, or other operation occurred, provided that the address where the operation occurred is indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.


(4) *Distilled spirits bottled for another person.* (i) If distilled spirits are bottled for another person, other than the actual distiller thereof, the label may state, in addition to (but not in place of) the name and address of the bottler, the name and address of such other person, immediately preceded by the words “bottled for” or another similar appropriate phrase. Such statements must clearly indicate the relationship between the two persons (for example, contract bottling).


(ii) If the same brand of distilled spirits is bottled by two distillers that are not under the same ownership, the label for each distiller may set forth both locations where bottling takes place, as long as the label uses the actual location (and not the principal place of business) and as long as the nature of the arrangement is clearly set forth.


(5) *Additional addresses.* No additional places or addresses may be stated for the same person unless:


(i) That person is actively engaged in the conduct of an additional bona fide and actual alcohol beverage business at such additional place or address, and


(ii) The label also contains in direct conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive material indicating the function occurring at such additional place or address in connection with the particular product (such as “distilled by.”)


(e) *Special rule for straight whiskies.* If “straight whiskies” (see § 5.143) of the same type are distilled in the same State by two or more different distillers and are combined (either at the time of bottling or at a warehouseman's bonded premises for further storage) and subsequently bottled and labeled as “straight whisky,” that “straight whisky” must bear a label that contains name and address information of the bottler. If that combined “straight whisky” is bottled by or for the distillers, in lieu of the name and address of the bottler, the label may contain the words “distilled by,” followed immediately by the names (or trade names) and addresses of the different distillers who distilled a portion of the “straight whisky” and the percentage of “straight whisky” distilled by each distiller, with a tolerance of plus or minus 2 percent. If “straight whisky” consists of a mixture of “straight whiskies” of the same type from two or more different distilleries of the same proprietor located within the same State, and if that “straight whisky” is bottled by or for that proprietor, in lieu of the name and address of the bottler, the “straight whisky” may bear a label containing the words “distilled by” followed by the name (or trade name) of the proprietor and the addresses of the different distilleries that distilled a portion of the “straight whisky.”


(f) *State of distillation for whisky.* (1) The State of distillation, which is the State in which original distillation takes place, must appear on the label of any type of whisky defined in § 5.143(c)(2) through (7), (15), and (16), which is distilled in the United States. The State of distillation may appear on any label and must be shown in at least one of the following ways:


(i) By including a “distilled by” (or “distilled and bottled by” or any other phrase including the word “distilled”) statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location;




(ii) If the address shown in the “bottled by” statement includes the State in which distillation occurred, by including a “bottled by” statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location;


(iii) By including the name of the State in which original distillation occurred immediately adjacent to the class or type designation (such as “Kentucky bourbon whisky”), as long as the product was both distilled and aged in that State in conformance with the requirements of § 5.143(b); or


(iv) By including a separate statement, such as “Distilled in [name of State].”


(2) The appropriate TTB officer may require that the State of distillation or other information appear on a label of any whisky subject to the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section (and may prescribe placement requirements for such information), even if that State appears in the name and address statement, if such additional information is necessary to negate any misleading or deceptive impression that might otherwise be created as regards the actual State of distillation.


(3) In the case of “light whisky,” the State name “Kentucky” or “Tennessee” may not appear on any label, except as a part of a name and address as specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section.


(g) *Trade or operating names.* The name of the person appearing on the label may be the trade name or the operating name, as long as it is identical to a trade or operating name appearing on the basic permit. In the case of a distillation statement for spirits bottled in bond, the name or trade name under which the spirits were distilled must be shown.
