# § 5.70   Net contents.

The requirements of this section apply to the net contents statement required by § 5.63.


(a) *General.* The volume of spirits in the container must appear on a label as a net contents statement. The word “liter” may be alternatively spelled “litre” or may be abbreviated as “L”. The word “milliliters” may be abbreviated as “ml.,” “mL.,” or “ML.” Net contents in equivalent U.S. customary units of measurement and in metric equivalents such as centiliters may appear on a label and, if used, must appear in the same field of vision as the metric net contents statement.


(b) *Tolerances.* (1) The following tolerances are permissible for purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section:


(i) *Errors in measuring.* Discrepancies due to errors in measuring that occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice;


(ii) *Differences in capacity.* Discrepancies due exclusively to differences in the capacity of containers, resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in manufacturing the containers so as to be of uniform capacity, provided that the discrepancy does not result from a container design that prevents the manufacture of containers of an approximately uniform capacity; and


(iii) *Differences in atmospheric conditions.* Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric conditions in various places, including discrepancies resulting from the ordinary and customary exposure of alcohol beverage products in containers to evaporation, provided that the discrepancy is determined to be reasonable on a case by case basis.


(2) *Shortages and overages.* A contents shortage in certain of the containers in a shipment may not be counted against a contents overage in other containers in the same shipment for purposes of determining compliance with the requirements of this section.
