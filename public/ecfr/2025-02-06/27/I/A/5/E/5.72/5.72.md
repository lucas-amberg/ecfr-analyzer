# § 5.72   Coloring materials.

The words “artificially colored” must appear on a label of any distilled spirits product containing synthetic or natural materials that primarily contribute color, or when information on a label conveys the impression that a color was derived from a source other than the actual source of the color, except that:


(a) If no coloring material other than a color exempt from certification under FDA regulations has been added, a truthful statement of the source of the color may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored,” for example, “Contains Beta Carotene” or “Colored with beet extract.” See 21 CFR parts 73 and 74 for the list of such colors under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations;


(b) If no coloring material has been added other than one certified as suitable for use in foods by the FDA, the words “(to be filled in with name of) certified color added” or “Contains Certified Color” may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored”; and


(c) If no coloring material other than caramel has been added, the words “colored with caramel,” “contains caramel color,” or another statement specifying the use of caramel color, may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored.” However, no statement of any type is required for the use of caramel color in brandy, rum, or Tequila, or in any type of whisky other than straight whisky if used at not more than 2.5 percent by volume of the finished product. Provided, if any amount of caramel color is used in American single malt whisky, or in straight American single malt whisky, a statement specifying the use of caramel color must appear on the label. 


(d) As provided in § 5.61, the use of FD&C Yellow No. 5, carmine, or cochineal extract must be specifically stated on the label even if the label also contains a phrase such as “contains certified color” or “artificially colored.”
