# § 5.150   Cordials and liqueurs.

(a) *The class cordials and liqueurs.* Cordials and liqueurs are flavored distilled spirits that are made by mixing or redistilling distilled spirits with or over fruits, flowers, plants, or pure juices therefrom, or other natural flavoring materials, or with extracts derived from infusions, percolation, or maceration of such materials, and containing sugar (such as sucrose, fructose, dextrose, or levulose) in an amount of not less than 2.5 percent by weight of the finished product. Designations on labels may be “Cordial” or “Liqueur,” or, in the alternative, may be one of the type designations below. Cordials and liqueurs may not be designated as “straight”. The designation of a cordial or liqueur may include the word “dry” if sugar is less than 10 percent by weight of the finished product.
