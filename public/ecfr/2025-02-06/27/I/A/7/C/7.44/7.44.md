# ยง 7.44   Adding a label or other information to a container that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer.

Any label or other information that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer of the malt beverage may be added to containers (by the addition of stickers, engraving, stenciling, etc.) without prior approval from TTB and without being covered by a certificate of label approval. Such information may be added before or after the containers are removed from brewery premises or released from customs custody. The information added:


(a) May not violate the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part;


(b) May not contain any reference to the characteristics of the product; and


(c) May not be added to the container in such a way that it obscures any other label on the container.
