# § 7.51   Requirement for firmly affixed labels.

(a) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any label that is not an integral part of the container must be affixed to the container in such a way that it cannot be removed without thorough application of water or other solvents.


(b) *Exception for keg labels.* The following provisions apply to labels on kegs with a capacity of 5.16 gallons or more that bear mandatory information, as defined by § 7.61(a)(5), and are in the form of a keg collar or tap cover, as defined in § 7.1.


(1) Such keg collars or tap covers are considered to be firmly affixed if removal would break or destroy the keg collar or tap cover in such a way that it cannot be reused.


(2) Such keg collars or tap covers are not required to be firmly affixed, provided that the name of the bottler or importer of the malt beverage, as applicable under §§ 7.66-7.68, is permanently or semi-permanently stated on the keg in the form of embossing, engraving, stamping, or through the use of a sticker or ink jet method.
