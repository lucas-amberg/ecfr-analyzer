# § 7.129   Health-related statements.

(a) *Definitions.* When used in this section, the following terms have the meaning indicated:


(1) *Health-related statement* means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required under part 16 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, a malt beverage, or any substance found within the malt beverage product, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the alcohol beverage product, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (for example, statements of vitamin content). Numerical statements of the calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content of the product do not constitute claims of nutritional value.


(2) *Specific health claim* means a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related condition.


(3) *Health-related directional statement* means a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption.


(b) *Rules for malt beverage labels, containers, and packaging*—(1) *Health-related statements.* In general, malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.


(2) *Specific health claims.* (i) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as needed on the use of specific health claims on labels, containers, or packaging. If FDA determines that the use of such a claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on the malt beverage label.


(ii) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a malt beverage label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; is sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.


(3) *Health-related directional statements.* A health-related directional statement is presumed misleading unless it:


(i) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and


(ii)(A) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons”; or


(B) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.
