(a) *Name.* The name of the viticultural area described in this section is “San Ysidro District.”


(b) *Approved maps.* The appropriate maps for determining the boundaries of the San Ysidro District viticultural area are four U.S.G.S. Quadrangle (7.5 minute series) maps. They are titled:


(1) Gilroy, Calif., 1955 (photorevised 1981);


(2) Chittenden, Calif., 1955 (photorevised 1980);


(3) San Felipe, Calif., 1955 (photorevised 1971);

(c) *Boundary.* The San Ysidro District viticultural area is located in Santa Clara County, California, within the Santa Clara Valley viticultural area. The boundary is as follows:


(1) The beginning point is the intersection of California State Highway 152 and Ferguson Road with an un-named wash, or intermittent stream, on the Gilroy, Calif., U.S.G.S. map;


(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows the wash northeast as it runs co-incident with the old Grant boundary for approximately 3,800 feet;


(3) The boundary then follows the wash when it diverges from the old Grant boundary and continues approximately 2,300 feet in a northeasterly direction, crosses and recrosses Crews Road, then follows the wash southeast until the wash turns northeast in section 35, T.10S., R.4E., on the Gilroy Hot Springs, Calif., map;


(4) The boundary then diverges from the wash, continuing in a straight line in a southeasterly direction, across an unimproved road, until it intersects with the 600 foot contour line.


(5) The boundary then proceeds in a straight line at about the 600 foot elevation in a southeasterly direction until it meets the minor northerly drainage of the San Ysidro Creek;


(6) The boundary then follows the minor northerly drainage of San Ysidro Creek southeast for approximately 2,000 feet to the seasonal pond adjacent to Canada Road;


(7) From the seasonal pond, the boundary follows the southerly drainage of San Ysidro Creek for about 1,300 feet until it reaches the southwest corner of section 36, T.10S., R.4E.;


(8) The boundary then continues in a straight line in a southerly direction across Canada Road for approximately 900 feet until it intersects with the 600 foot contour line;


(9) The boundary follows the 600 foot contour line for approximately 6,000 feet in a generally southeasterly direction, diverges from the contour line and continues southeast another 1,200 feet until it meets an unimproved road near the north end of a seasonal pond on the San Felipe, Calif., U.S.G.S. map;


(10) The boundary follows the unimproved road to Bench Mark 160 at Highway 152.


(11) The boundary then follows Highway 152 in a northwesterly direction across the northeast corner of the Chittenden, Calif., U.S.G.S. map, and back to the beginning point at the junction of Ferguson Road and Highway 152.
