(9) Thence in a straight line in a northeasterly direction along this extension of Inglewood Avenue to its intersection with the north fork of Bale Slough;


(10) Thence in a southeasterly direction along the north fork of Bale Slough approximately 2,750 feet to its intersection with the end of the county road shown on the map as Zinfandel Avenue, known locally as Zinfandel Lane, near the 201-foot elevation marker;


(11) Then in a northeasterly direction along Zinfandel Avenue (Zinfandel Lane) approximately 2.12 miles to the intersection of that road and Silverado Trail, then continuing northeasterly in a straight line to the 380-foot contour line;


(12) Then following the 380-foot contour line southeasterly through Section 33 to the western border of Section 34, T.8 N., R.5 W., then following that section line north to the 500-foot contour line;
