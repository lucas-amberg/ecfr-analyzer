(a) *Name.* The name of the viticultural area described in this section is “Fair Play.”


(b) *Approved maps.* The four United States Geological Survey (USGS) 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Fair Play viticultural area are titled:


(1) Aukum, Calif., 1952 (photorevised 1973);


(2) Camino, CA, 1952 (photorevised 1973);


(3) Sly Park, CA, 1952 (photorevised 1973); and

(c) *Boundaries.* The Fair Play viticultural area is located in El Dorado County, California and is located entirely within the existing Sierra Foothills and El Dorado viticultural areas. The boundary for Fair Play is as follows:


(1) The beginning point of the boundary is the intersection of the Middle Fork of the Cosumnes River and the U.S.G.S. map section line between Sections 26 and 27, T. 9 N., R. 11 E. (“Aukum” Quadrangle);


(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows northeast along the Middle Fork of the Cosumnes River until it meets an unnamed medium-duty road (Mt. Aukum Road or El Dorado County Road E-16) just as it crosses onto the “Camino” Quadrangle map;


(3) The boundary continues then northeast along Mt. Aukum Road to its intersection with Grizzly Flat Road at the town of Somerset (“Camino” Quadrangle);


(4) The boundary continues east along Grizzly Flat Road to its intersection with the 2,200-foot contour line (“Camino Quadrangle”);


(5) The boundary continues northeasterly and then easterly along the 2,200-foot contour line until the contour line intersects with Jackass Canyon Creek near the eastern boundary of Section 10, T. 9 N., R. 12. E., on the “Camino Quadrangle” map;


(6) The boundary then proceeds southeast along Jackass Canyon Creek, crossing over the southwestern corner of the “Sly Park” Quadrangle map and onto the “Omo Ranch” Quadrangle map, to the headwaters of the creek, then proceeds in a straight line southeast to Grizzly Flat Road in Section 24, T. 9 N., R. 12 E.;


(7) The boundary continues east along Grizzly Flat Road until the road intersects with the range line between R. 12 E. and R. 13 E. (“Omo Ranch Quadrangle”);


(8) The boundary then follows south along the range line between R. 12 E. and R. 13 E. to its intersection with an unnamed medium-duty road in T. 8 N. (Omo Ranch Road) (“Omo Ranch” Quadrangle);


(9) The boundary then continues west in a straight line approximately 0.3 miles to the point where Cedar Creek intersects with the 3200-foot contour line, within Section 1, T. 8 N.,R. 12 E. (“Omo Ranch” Quadrangle); 


(10) The boundary follows along Cedar Creek west and then southwest until it empties into Scott Creek (“Aukum” Quadrangle);


(11) The boundary then proceeds west along Scott Creek until it empties into the South Fork of the Cosumnes River (“Aukum” Quadrangle);


(12) The boundary continues west along the South Fork of the Cosumnes River to its intersection with the western boundary of Section 14, T. 8 N., R 11 E. (“Aukum Quadrangle”);


(13) The boundary then proceeds north along the western boundary lines of Sections 14, 11, and 2, T. 8 N., R 11 E., and then the western boundary lines of Sections 35 and 26, T. 9 N., R 11 E., to return to the beginning point (“Aukum Quadrangle”).
