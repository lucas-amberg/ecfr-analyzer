(c) *Boundary.* The Horse Heaven Hills viticultural area is located in portions of Benton, Klickitat, and Yakima Counties, Washington. The boundary of the Horse Heaven Hills viticultural area is described below:


(1) Beginning on the Umatilla map at the intersection of Interstate Highway 82 and the north bank of the Columbia River in Benton County, Washington, proceed westerly (downstream) along the river's north bank, passing through the Irrigon, Paterson, West of Paterson, Boardman, Crow Butte, and Golgotha Butte maps, to the mouth of Pine Creek in section 32, T4N/R22E, on the Heppner Junction map in Klickitat County; then


(2) Follow Pine Creek northwesterly (upstream) for approximately 7.0 miles to the junction of Pine Creek and the western boundary of section 16, T4N/R21E, on the Wood Gulch map, then continue north along the section boundary to the point where East Road, which coincides with the section line at this point, crosses the 1,700-foot contour line, very near the southwestern corner of section 9, T4N, R21E; then


(3) Proceed northeasterly along the meandering 1,700-foot contour line through, and crossing between, the Crider Valley and Douty Canyon maps (crossing Alder Creek, Stegeman Canyon, Spring Canyon, Sand Ridge, and Willow Creek) to the point where the 1,700-foot contour line intersects Sand Ridge Road in section 4, T5N, R22E, on the Douty Canyon map; then


(4) Continue north-northeasterly along the meandering 1,700-foot contour line through, and crossing between, the Tule Prong and Douty Canyon maps (crossing Tule Canyon, Tule Prong, and Dead Canyon) to the contour line's intersection with Alderdale Road in section 31, T7N/R23E, northeast of Coyote Canyon, on the Prosser SW map in Yakima County; then

(8) From that peak, proceed east-southeast to the 2,093 foot peak in the northeastern quadrant of section 25, T8N/R23E on the Prosser map, then northeasterly in a straight line to the 2,193-foot peak of Horse Hill in the northeast corner of section 25, T8N/R23E, then northeasterly in a straight line, crossing into Benton County, to the 2,107-foot peak in section 19, T8N/R24E, then easterly to the 2,081-foot peak in section 21, T8N/R24E, then east-northeasterly through the 1,813-foot peak near the northwest corner of section 13, T8N/R24E, to the 1,861-foot peak marked with radio towers near the southern boundary of section 12, T8N/R24E; then


(9) From that peak, proceed northeasterly in a straight line to an unmarked 1,410-foot summit in the northeast corner of section 7, T8N/R25E, on the Whitstran map, then east-southeasterly to the 1,637-foot peak near the center of section 8, T8N/R25E, and then north-northeasterly to the intersection of State Route 221 and Carter Road near the southeast corner of section 5, T8N/R25E; then


(10) Follow Carter Road northerly to the point where it becomes an unimproved road and continue northerly then easterly along the unimproved road to the 1,854-foot peak of Gibbon Hill in the northeast corner of section 4, T8N/R25E; then

(17) Proceed east on Clodfelter Road to its intersection with Williams Road at the eastern boundary of section 5, T7N/R28E, and continue east on Williams Road to its intersection with the 1,800-foot contour line in section 4, T7N/R28E; then


(18) Follow the meandering 1,800-foot contour line southerly then easterly to the contour line's junction with the northeast corner of section 15, T7N/R28E; then


(19) From that point, proceed east-southeasterly in a straight line to the 1,680-foot benchmark in section 17, T7N/R29E, on the Johnson Butte map, and continue east-northeasterly in a straight line through the 2,043-foot peak of Johnson Butte in section 16, T7N/R29E, to the 2,220-foot peak of Jump Off Joe summit in section 12, T7N/R29E; then
