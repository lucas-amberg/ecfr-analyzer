(b) *Approved maps.* The three United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Sierra Pelona Valley viticultural area are titled:


(1) Agua Dulce, CA, 1995;


(2) Sleepy Valley, CA, 1995; and


(3) Ritter Ridge, Calif., 1958, Photorevised 1974.


(c) *Boundary.* The Sierra Pelona Valley viticultural area is located in Los Angeles County, California. The boundary of the Sierra Pelona Valley viticultural area is as described below:

(4) Proceed west-northwest in a straight line 0.15 mile, crossing over the Agua Dulce Road, to the line's intersection with the 2,400-foot elevation line and an unimproved dirt road, section 34, T5N, R14W; then


(5) Proceed generally west along the meandering 2,400-foot elevation line to the line's intersection with the section 34 west boundary line, T5N, R14W; then


(6) Proceed north along the section 34 west boundary line 1 mile to the line's intersection with the 2,800-foot elevation line and the section 27 west boundary line; then


(7) Proceed along the 2,800-foot elevation line first generally northeast, then northwest around Saddleback Mountain, and then north across a trail and an unimproved dirt road, to the line's intersection with the section 21 south boundary line, T5N, R14W; then


(8) Proceed straight east along the section 21 south boundary line 0.25 mile to the southeast corner of section 21, T5N, R14W; then


(9) Proceed north along the section 21 south boundary line onto the Sleepy Valley map 0.6 mile to the line's intersection with the 2,800-foot elevation line and the section 22 west boundary line, T5N, R14W; then


(10) Proceed along the 2,800-foot elevation line generally northeast around the 3,166-foot and 3,036-foot pinnacles, then continue southwest to the line's intersection with the section 22 north boundary line, T5N, R14W; then


(11) Proceed west along the section 22 north boundary line 0.2 mile to the line's intersection with the 2,600-foot elevation line, T5N, R14W; then


(12) Proceed generally west-southwest along the 2,600-foot elevation line to the line's intersection with the section 21 west boundary line, T5N, R14W; then


(13) Proceed north along the section 21 west boundary line 0.2 mile to the line's intersection with the 2,400-foot elevation line and the section 20 east boundary line, T5N, R14W; then


(14) Proceed generally southwest along the 2,400-foot elevation line to the line's intersection with an unimproved dirt road in section 20, T5N, R14W; then


(15) Proceed northwest along the unimproved dirt road 0.15 mile to its intersection with the Sierra Highway, a secondary highway, section 20, T5N, R14W; then


(16) Proceed southwest along the Sierra Highway 0.15 mile to its intersection with an unnamed stream, section 20, T5N, R14W; then


(17) Proceed in a straight line north-northwest approximately 0.3 mile to the line's intersection with the Angeles National Forest boundary line, an unnamed stream running through Rowher Canyon, and the section 17 south boundary line, T5N, R14W; then


(18) Proceed straight east, north, and east, making 90-degree turns, along the Angeles National Forest boundary line to the line's intersection with the section 7 southwest corner, T5N, R13W; then


(19) Proceed straight north along the Angeles National Forest boundary line and the section 7 west boundary line 0.5 mile to the line's intersection with the 3,400-foot elevation line, T5N, R13W; then


(20) Proceed along the 3,400-foot elevation line generally east, north, then west to the line's intersection with the section 6 west boundary line, T5N, R13W; then


(21) Proceed north along the section 6 west boundary line 0.4 mile to the line's intersection with the 3,400-foot elevation line, T5N, R13W; then


(22) Proceed generally southeast along the 3,400-foot elevation line, crossing over Latteau, Willow Springs, and Hauser Canyons and continuing onto the Ritter Ridge map, to the line's intersection with an unimproved dirt road at Summit, section 16, T5N, R13W; then


(23) Proceed south along the unnamed dirt road less than 0.1 mile, crossing the Sierra Highway, to its intersection with the 3,400-foot elevation line, section 16, T5N, R13W; then


(24) Proceed generally southwest along the 3,400-foot elevation line, meandering between the Sleepy Valley and Ritter Ridge maps and then returning to the Sleepy Valley map, to the line's intersection with the section 20 north boundary line, T5N, R13W; then


(25) Proceed in a straight line west along the section 20 north boundary line 0.2 mile to the line's intersection with the 3,200-foot elevation line, section 20, T5N, R13W; then


(26) Proceed generally southwest along the 3,200-foot elevation line to the line's intersection with the section 19 west boundary line, T5N, R13W; then


(27) Proceed in a straight line north along the section 19 west boundary line 0.15 mile to the line's intersection with a pipeline, T5N, R13W; and then


(28) Proceed southwest onto the Agua Dulce map 1.25 miles along the pipeline, returning to the beginning point.
