(4) Proceed south-southeasterly (downstream) along the unnamed intermittent stream approximately 1.2 miles to the stream's intersection with the R11E/R12E common boundary line, section 1, T27S/R11E; then


(5) Proceed south along the R11E/R12E common boundary line approximately 0.15 mile to the line's intersection with an unnamed light-duty road locally known as Kiler Canyon Road, section 1, T27S/R11E; then


(6) Proceed westerly on the light-duty and then unimproved Kiler Canyon Road approximately 4 miles, crossing onto the York Mountain map, to the road's intersection with Summit Canyon Road (locally known as Peachy Canyon Road), section 33, T26S/R11E; then

(10) Proceed west-northwesterly in a straight line approximately 5.7 miles, crossing onto the Cypress Mountain map, to the R9E/R10E common boundary line at the northwest corner of section 6, T27S/R10E; then


(11) Proceed north along the R9E/R10E common boundary line approximately 6.5 miles, crossing onto the Lime Mountain map, to the line's intersection with the second unnamed intermittent stream that crosses the western boundary line of section 31, T25S/R10E; then


(12) Proceed easterly in a straight line approximately 0.45 mile to a marked 1,165-foot peak in section 31, T25S/R10E, and then continue easterly in a straight line approximately 0.8 mile to the marked 1,135-foot peak in section 32, T25S/R10E; then


(13) Proceed due east-northeasterly in a straight line approximately 0.3 mile to the line's intersection with Dip Creek, section 32, T25S/R10E; then


(14) Proceed southeasterly and then easterly along Dip Creek approximately 6 miles, crossing onto the Adelaida map, to the creek's intersection with San Miguel Road (locally known as Chimney Rock Road), section 13, T26S/R10E; then


(15) Proceed easterly on San Miguel Road (locally known as Chimney Rock Road, then Nacimiento Lake Drive, then Godfrey Road, and then San Marcos Road) approximately 8.6 miles, crossing onto the Paso Robles map, to the road's intersection with an unnamed light-duty road locally known as Wellsona Road, section 6, T26S/R12E; then
