(8) Proceed northerly, then northwesterly along the 800-foot elevation contour, crossing onto the Horton map, to the intersection of the 800-foot elevation contour and an unnamed, unimproved road with a marked 782-foot elevation point in Section 10, T16S/R6W; then


(9) Proceed west in a straight line to the 1,000-foot elevation contour; then


(10) Proceed northerly along the 1,000-foot elevation contour, crossing onto the Glenbrook map, to the elevation contour's third intersection with the Lane-Benton County line in Section 10, T15S/R6W; then


(11) Proceed east along the Lane-Benton County line, crossing onto the Monroe map, to the R6W/R5W range line; then

(14) Proceed northeasterly along Shafer Creek to its intersection with the 300-foot elevation contour; then


(15) Proceed easterly along the 300-foot elevation contour, crossing Territorial Highway, to the intersection of the elevation contour with the marked old railroad grade in Section 33/T14S/R5W; then


(16) Proceed south along the old railroad grade to its intersection with the southern boundary of Section 9, T15S/R5W; then


(17) Proceed west along the southern boundary of Section 9 to its intersection with Territorial Highway; then


(18) Proceed south along Territorial Highway to its intersection with the 360-foot elevation contour in Section 16; T15S/R5W; then
