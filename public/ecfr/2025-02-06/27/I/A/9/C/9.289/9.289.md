(15) Proceed southeast in a straight line, crossing the North Fork of Cache Creek, to the 1,400-foot elevation contour in section 12 west of the summit of Chalk Mountain; then


(16) Proceed southeasterly, then southerly along the meandering 1,400- foot elevation contour to its third intersection with the eastern boundary of section 13; then


(17) Proceed west in a straight line to an unnamed, unimproved 4-wheel drive road in section 13; then


(18) Proceed south in a straight line, crossing over a second unnamed, unimproved 4-wheel drive road in section 13, to the 1,240-foot elevation contour in section 24, T14N/R7W; then


(19) Proceed east in a straight line to the 1,400-foot elevation contour in section 24; then


(20) Proceed southeasterly, then northeasterly along the meandering 1,400-foot elevation contour to its intersection with an unnamed creek in section 19, T14N/R6W; then


(21) Proceed southwesterly (downstream) along the unnamed creek to its intersection with the 1,200-foot contour in section 19; then


(22) Proceed south in a straight line to the northern boundary of section 30, T14N/R6W; then


(23) Proceed southeast, then east along the northern boundary of section 30 to its intersection with the 1,400-foot elevation contour; then
