(13) Proceed north along the western boundary of section 24, T4S, R2E, to the southeast corner of section 14, T4S, R2E; then


(14) Continue west along the southern boundary of section 14, T4S, R2E, to its southwest corner and then proceed north along the western boundary of section 14 to its intersection with the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, T4S, R2E; then


(15) Follow the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct west-southwest approximately 4.2 miles to the Aqueduct's intersection with the R1E/R2E range line on the La Costa Valley map, T4S; then


(16) Continue southwest in a straight line approximately 3.9 miles, crossing Apperson, Welsh, and Alameda Creeks, to BM 533 in section 10, T5S, R1E; then


(17) Proceed due west-northwest in a straight line approximately 1.9 miles, passing onto the Niles map, to the line's intersection with the eastern boundary of section 5 and the Fremont Boundary Line, T5S, R1E; then


(18) Continue northwest in a straight line approximately 1.1 miles to an unnamed, 1,291-foot peak in section 32, T4S, R1E; then


(19) Continue northwest in a straight line approximately 1.1 miles to an unnamed, 1,058-foot peak in section 30, T4S, R1E; then


(20) Continue northwest in a straight line approximately 3.8 miles, passing through BM 161 in section 11, T4S, R1W, until the line intersects Palomares Road, a medium duty road, in section 11; then


(21) Follow Palomares Road in a northerly direction for approximately 0.7 miles to the road's intersection with the power transmission line shown in section 11, T4S, R1W; then


(22) Proceed northwest along the power transmission line for approximately 6.4 miles, passing through the Dublin map near Walpert Ridge, onto the Hayward map to the point where the power transmission line turns nearly west, approximately 500 feet south of an unnamed, 891-foot, peak, T3S, R2W; then
