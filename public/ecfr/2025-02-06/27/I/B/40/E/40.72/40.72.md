# § 40.72   Use of factory premises.

(a) *General.* Unless otherwise authorized by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in § 40.47, the premises used by a manufacturer of tobacco products for his factory shall be used exclusively for the purposes of manufacturing and storing tobacco products; storing materials, equipment, and supplies related thereto or used or useful in the conduct of the business; and carrying on activities in connection with business of the manufacturer of tobacco products.


(b) *Processed tobacco.* (1) A manufacturer of tobacco products that processes tobacco or receives processed tobacco on its factory premises solely for use in the manufacture of tobacco products under its permit, that removes processed tobacco from the factory premises only for purposes related to its business of manufacturing tobacco products as set forth in (b)(2) of this section, and that maintains records sufficient to show the final disposition of any processed tobacco removed from the factory premises may engage in such activities on the factory premises under the authority of its existing permit without prior authorization from TTB under § 40.47. If a manufacturer of tobacco products removes processed tobacco for purposes other than those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that manufacturer must obtain prior authorization from TTB in accordance with § 40.47 and must keep records and submit reports as prescribed in §§ 40.521 and 40.522.


(2) The following activities are considered to be activities related to the manufacture of tobacco products: Removal of samples of processed tobacco for the purpose of soliciting orders of tobacco products; removal of processed tobacco for destruction; removal of processed tobacco for scientific testing or testing of equipment which results in the destruction of the processed tobacco or the return of the processed tobacco to the factory premises; and transfer of processed tobacco between permitted premises of the same manufacturer. Any removal of processed tobacco other than those listed above requires the manufacturer to first obtain authorization to engage in another business within the factory under § 40.47 and to keep records and submit reports under §§ 40.521 and 40.522, unless the manufacturer can show to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the removal is connected with the business of a manufacturer of tobacco products rather than with the business of a manufacturer of processed tobacco.
