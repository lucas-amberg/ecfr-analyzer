# ยง 40.287   Remission of tax liability on shortage.

Whenever a manufacturer of tobacco products desires to submit a claim for remission of tax liability on shortages of tobacco products in bond, disclosed by physical inventory as set forth in ยง 40.255, he shall prepare such claim on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate. Both copies of the claim shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The claim shall specify the quantities of tobacco products on which claim is made and the tax liability in respect thereof, and shall set forth the circumstances surrounding the shortage and the reason the manufacturer believes tax is not due or payable. The appropriate TTB officer will, after such investigation as he deems appropriate, allow the claim to the extent he is satisfied the shortage was due to operating losses such as damage during grading, sorting, or packaging, and was not caused by theft or other unlawful or improper removal. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer he will return the copy of TTB F 5620.8 to the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy shall be retained by the manufacturer.
