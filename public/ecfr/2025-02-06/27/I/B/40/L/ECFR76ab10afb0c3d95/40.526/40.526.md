A permit to manufacture processed tobacco will only be granted to those persons engaged in the processing of tobacco. A permit may be suspended, and subsequently revoked, if the person has no activity under such permit for a period of one year. A person whose permit as a manufacturer of processed tobacco has been revoked for non-use, who wishes to engage in such business, must re-apply for such permit.
