(a)(1) *General.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in order for tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes to be released from customs custody without payment of tax under internal revenue bond, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5704(c) or (d), the information required by this paragraph must be filed electronically with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The information must be filed with CBP at the time of filing the entry or entry summary, as appropriate, and it must be filed along with any other information that is required by CBP for purposes of determining and collecting the Federal excise tax and administering the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Any information required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section that is submitted to CBP as part of the entry or entry summary for purposes of meeting CBP requirements will also satisfy the requirements of this section. Regardless of the method of filing, the importer must retain as a record the information required by this section, any information provided to CBP for CBP purposes, and any supporting documentation and such records must be available for inspection upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.


(2) *Information required.* The manufacturer of tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes or export warehouse proprietor who wishes to obtain the release of tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide the following information, as applicable:


(i) The number of the permit issued under 27 CFR part 40 to the manufacturer of tobacco products or export warehouse proprietor, or the TTB-assigned number of the manufacturer of cigarette papers or tubes, to whom the products are shipped or consigned;


(ii) The employer identification number (EIN), assigned by the Internal Revenue Service, of the manufacturer of tobacco products, the manufacturer of cigarette papers or tubes, or the export warehouse proprietor to whom the products are shipped or consigned;


(iii) The name and address of the ultimate consignee, consistent with the name and address on the permit issued under part 40 of this chapter;


(iv) For tobacco products, the number of the permit, issued under subpart K of this part, of the importer;


(v) For tobacco products, the employer identification number (EIN) assigned to the importer by the Internal Revenue Service and provided to TTB by the importer on its permit application to TTB on TTB Form 5230.4;


(vi) A description of the product consistent with the tax classification of the product under the Internal Revenue Code as described in § 41.81 (for example, “large cigars”); and


(vii) The quantity of the product for Federal excise tax purposes, by sticks or by pounds and ounces (or kilograms and grams), as applicable.


(b) *Releases without payment of tax*—(1) *Tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes put up in packages.* Tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes put up in packages, as defined at § 41.11, may be released without payment of tax only for delivery to the proprietor of an export warehouse (as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5704(c)) or, if classified under chapter 98, subchapter I of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (relating to duty on certain articles exported and returned), for delivery to the original manufacturer of such tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes or to the proprietor of an export warehouse authorized by such manufacturer to receive them (as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5704(d)). If the information required in paragraph (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section is not filed with the entry or entry summary, as appropriate, or, if the information required in paragraph (c) of this section is not made available to CBP upon request, the tobacco products, cigarette papers, or cigarette tubes are not eligible for release from customs custody without payment of tax, and no person may remove such products from customs custody without payment of tax.


(2) *Tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes not put up in packages.* Tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes not put up in packages, as defined at § 41.11, may not be released from customs custody subject to tax, and no person may obtain release of such products from customs custody. Tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes not put up on packages may be released from customs custody without payment of tax for delivery to the proprietor of an export warehouse, or to a manufacturer of tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5704(c). As a result, if the information required in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section is not filed with the entry or entry summary, as appropriate, or, if the information required in paragraph (c) of this section is not made available to CBP upon request, tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes not put up in packages are not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such product from customs custody.


(c) *Filing on paper.* A manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor who wants to obtain the release of tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes from customs custody without payment of tax under its internal revenue bond, and who does not file electronically, must prepare a notice of release on TTB F 5200.11 and submit the form to the appropriate TTB officer in accordance with the instructions on the form. The appropriate TTB officer will certify on the TTB F 5200.11 that the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor has TTB authorization to receive the products. No one filing on paper may obtain release of the products under this section until they have received the TTB F 5200.11 certified by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor must have possession of the TTB F 5200.11, bearing TTB certification, at the time the products are released from customs custody and must make the form available to a customs officer upon request at such time. After release of the products, the TTB F 5200.11 must be retained by the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor and made available to the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer upon request.
