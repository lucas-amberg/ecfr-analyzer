# § 41.163   Refund of tax.

The taxes paid on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes imported or brought into the United States may be refunded (without interest) to the taxpayer on proof satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer that the taxpayer has paid the tax on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of such taxpayer, or withdrawn by him from the market. Any claim for refund of tax under this section shall be prepared on Form 2635 (5620.8), in duplicate, and shall include a statement that the tax imposed on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes by 26 U.S.C. 7652 or chapter 52, as applicable, has been paid in respect to the articles covered in the claim, and that the articles were lost, destroyed, or withdrawn from the market, within six months preceding the date the claim is filed and shall be executed under the penalties of perjury. A claim for refund relating to articles lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 41.165, and a claim relating to articles withdrawn from the market shall include a schedule prepared and verified as prescribed in §§ 41.170 and 41.171 or §§ 41.172 and 41.173. The original of the claim shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The duplicate of the claim, with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the claimant.
