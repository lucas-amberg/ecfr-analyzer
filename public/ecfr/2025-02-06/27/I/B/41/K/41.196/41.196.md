# ยง 41.196   Power of attorney.

If the application for a permit or any report or other document required to be executed under this part is to be signed by an individual as an attorney in fact for any person (including one of the partners for a partnership or one of the members of an association), or if an individual is otherwise to officially represent such person, a power of attorney on TTB F 5000.8 must be furnished to the appropriate TTB officer. A power of attorney is not required for individuals whose authority is furnished with the corporate documents required by ยง 41.193. A new TTB F 5000.8 does not have to be filed with the appropriate TTB officer if that form previously was submitted to TTB and is still in effect.
