When the appropriate TTB officer has reason to believe that an importer of tobacco products has not in good faith complied with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and regulations thereunder, or with any other provision of 26 U.S.C. with intent to defraud, or has violated any condition of the permit, or has failed to disclose any material information required or made any material false statement in the application for the permit, or is, by reason of previous or current legal proceedings involving a felony violation of any other provision of Federal criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, not likely to maintain operations in compliance with 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, or has been convicted of a felony violation of any provision of Federal or State criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, the appropriate TTB officer shall issue an order, stating the facts charged, citing such person to show cause why the permit should not be suspended or revoked. Such citation shall be issued and opportunity for hearing afforded in accordance with part 71 of this chapter, which part is applicable to such proceedings.
