# ยง 41.223   Fiduciary successor.

If an administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other fiduciary is to take over the business of an importer of tobacco products as a continuing operation, the fiduciary must, before commencing operations, apply for a permit in accordance with ยง 41.191 and furnish certified copies, in duplicate, of the order of the court or other pertinent documents, showing his or her appointment and qualification as the fiduciary. Where a fiduciary intends only to liquidate the business, qualification as an importer of tobacco products is not required if the fiduciary promptly files with the appropriate TTB officer a written statement to that effect.
