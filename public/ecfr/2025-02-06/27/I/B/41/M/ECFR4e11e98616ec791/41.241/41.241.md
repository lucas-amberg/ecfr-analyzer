# § 41.241   Duration of permit.

(a) *Permits with an effective date on or after August 26, 2013.* A permit issued under § 41.240 bearing an effective date of August 26, 2013 or later will be valid for a period of five years from the effective date shown on the permit. Provided a timely application for renewal is filed under § 41.242, the expiring permit will continue in effect until final action is taken by TTB on the application for renewal.


(b) *Permits with an effective date prior to August 26, 2013.* A person operating as an importer of processed tobacco that holds a permit bearing an effective date that is prior to August 26, 2013 and that wishes to continue operations as an importer of processed tobacco must apply for and receive a new permit issued under § 41.240. The person must file the application under § 41.232 within 150 days after August 26, 2013, or within 30 days prior to the expiration date shown on the existing permit form, whichever is later. If a person timely files an application but that application is not complete (that is, the applicant has not submitted information or documentation sufficient for TTB to take action on the permit), and if the applicant has not provided the missing information within one year of a written request for it or within any shorter time period specified in the written request, the permit application will be deemed abandoned and the applicant will be notified in writing that no permit will be issued in response to the incomplete application. Provided that a timely application is filed, the person may continue operations under the existing permit until TTB takes final action on the application for the new permit.
