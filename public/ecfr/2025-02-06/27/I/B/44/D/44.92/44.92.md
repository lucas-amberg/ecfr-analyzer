# § 44.92   Investigation of applicant.

(a) *Investigation.* The appropriate TTB officer shall promptly cause such inquiry or investigation to be made, as may be necessary, to verify the information furnished in connection with an application for permit and to ascertain whether the applicant is eligible for a permit. Any of the following conditions may be grounds for denial of a permit:


(1) The premises on which it is proposed to conduct the business are not adequate to protect the revenue; or


(2) The applicant (including, in the case of a corporation, any officer, director, or principal stockholder and, in the case of a partnership, a partner)—


(i) Is, by reason of his business experience, financial standing, or trade connections or by reason of previous or current legal proceedings involving a felony violation of any other provision of Federal criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, not likely to maintain operations in compliance with this chapter;


(ii) Has been convicted of a felony violation of any provision of Federal or State criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes; or


(iii) Has failed to disclose any material information required or made any material false statement in the application therefor.


(b) *TTB action.* An appropriate TTB officer who has reason to believe that the applicant is not entitled to a permit shall promptly give the applicant notice of the contemplated disapproval of his application and opportunity for hearing thereon in accordance with part 71 of this chapter, which part (including the provisions relating to the recommended decision and to appeals) is made applicable to such proceedings. If, after such notice and opportunity for hearing, the appropriate TTB officer finds that the applicant is not entitled to a permit, he shall, by order stating the findings on which his decision is based, deny the permit.
