# ยง 44.104   Fiduciary successor.

If an administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other fiduciary, is to take over the business of an export warehouse proprietor, as a continuing operation, such fiduciary shall, before commencing operations, make application for permit and file bond as required by subpart D of this part, furnish certified copies, in duplicate, of the order of the court, or other pertinent documents, showing his appointment and qualification as such fiduciary, and make an opening inventory, in accordance with the provisions of ยง 44.144; *Provided,* That where a diagram has been furnished by the predecessor, in accordance with the provisions of ยง 44.88, the successor may adopt such diagram. However, where a fiduciary intends merely to liquidate the business, qualification as an export warehouse proprietor will not be required if he promptly files with the appropriate TTB officer a statement to that effect, together with an extension of coverage of the predecessor's bond, executed by the fiduciary, also by the surety on such bond, in accordance with the provisions of ยง 44.126.
