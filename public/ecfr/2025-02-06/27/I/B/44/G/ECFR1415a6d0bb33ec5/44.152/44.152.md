# ยง 44.152   Claim for remission of tax liability.

Remission of the tax liability on tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes may be extended to the export warehouse proprietor liable for the tax where such articles in bond are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of such proprietor. Where articles are so lost or destroyed the proprietor shall report promptly such fact, and the circumstances, to the appropriate TTB officer. If the proprietor wishes to be relieved of the tax liability, the proprietor must prepare and file a claim on TTB Form 5620.8. The nature, date, place, and extent of the loss or destruction must be stated in such claim. The claim must be accompanied by such evidence as is necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the claim is valid. When the appropriate TTB officer has acted on the claim, such officer will return a copy of TTB Form 5620.8 to the proprietor as notice of such action. The proprietor must keep the copy of TTB Form 5620.8 for 3 years following the close of the calendar year in which the claim is filed.
