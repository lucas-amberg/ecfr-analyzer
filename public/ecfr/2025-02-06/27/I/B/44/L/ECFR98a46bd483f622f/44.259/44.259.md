Where cigars are withdrawn from a customs warehouse for direct delivery to a vessel or aircraft for transportation to a noncontiguous foreign country, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States, the customs warehouse proprietor making the withdrawal shall file two copies of the notice of removal, Form 5200.14, with the office of the district director of customs at the port where the shipment is to be laden. Such copies of the notice of removal should be filed with the related shipper's export declaration, Commerce Form 7525-V. In the event the copies of the notice of removal are not filed with the shipper's export declaration, when the copies of the notice are filed with the district director of customs they shall show all particulars necessary to enable that officer to associate the notice with the related shipper's export declaration and any other documents filed with his office in connection with the shipment. After the vessel or aircraft on which the shipment has been laden clears or departs from the port of lading the customs authority shall execute the certificate of exportation on both copies of the notice of removal, retain one copy for his records, and deliver or transmit the other copy to the customs warehouse proprietor making the shipment for filing with the appropriate TTB officer.
