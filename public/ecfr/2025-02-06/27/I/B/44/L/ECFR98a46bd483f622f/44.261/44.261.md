# ยง 44.261   To contiguous foreign countries.

Where cigars are withdrawn from a customs warehouse for export to a contiguous foreign country, the customs warehouse proprietor making the shipment shall furnish to the district director of customs at the border or other port of exit two copies of the notice of removal, Form 5200.14, together with the related shipper's export declaration, Commerce Form 7525-V. In the event the copies of the notice of removal are not filed with the shipper's export declaration or, in the case of a shipment for the armed forces of the United States in the contiguous foreign country where no shipper's export declaration is required, the copies of the notice when filed with the district director of customs shall show all particulars necessary to enable that officer to associate the notice with the related shipper's export declaration, if any, and any other documents filed with his office in connection with the shipment. After the shipment has been cleared by customs from the United States, the customs authority at the port of exit shall complete the certificate of exportation on both copies of the notice of removal, retain one copy for his records, and transmit the other copy to the customs warehouse proprietor making the shipment for filing with the appropriate TTB officer.
