(a) *Issuance of special tax stamps.* Upon filing a properly executed return on TTB Form 5630.5t together with the full tax remittance, the taxpayer will be issued an appropriately designated special tax stamp. If the return covers multiple locations, TTB will send to the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office in the case of a corporate taxpayer) one appropriately designated stamp for each location listed on the attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t required by ยง 46.101(b)(2).


(b) *Distribution of special tax stamps for multiple locations.* On receipt of the special tax stamps, the taxpayer must verify that there is one stamp for each location listed on the attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t and that the information on each stamp is correct. The taxpayer must then forward each stamp to the place of business designated on the stamp. Incorrect stamps must be returned to the appropriate TTB officer as provided in ยง 46.120.


(c) *Examination of special tax stamps.* Each stamp denoting payment of special tax must be kept available for inspection by an appropriate TTB officer during business hours at the location for which the stamp is designated.
