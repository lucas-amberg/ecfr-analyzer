# § 46.120   Errors discovered on inspection.

When a TTB officer discovers on a special tax stamp a material error in the name, ownership, or address of the taxpayer, that officer will require the taxpayer to surrender the erroneous tax stamp and prepare a new Form 5630.5t, designated “Amended Return,” showing correctly all of the information required in § 46.101 and containing, in the body of the form or in an attachment thereto, a statement of the reason for requesting correction of the stamp. On receipt of the amended return and an acceptable explanation for the error, the officer will make the proper correction on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer. However, if the error found by the TTB officer is on a special tax stamp issued as a result of a return on Form 5630.5t filed under § 46.101(b), that officer will instruct the taxpayer to return the stamp, with a statement showing the nature of the error and the correct data, to the TTB officer who issued the stamp, for correction in accordance with § 46.119.
