# § 53.102   No exclusion or readjustment for other advertising charges or reimbursements.

(a) *Exclusions from price.* No exclusion in computing the taxable price of any article sold by the manufacturer may be allowed in respect of any charge for advertising if, and to the extent that, such charge:


(1) Is for advertising which does not qualify as local advertising within the meaning of section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 53.100, or


(2) Does not satisfy all of the conditions and limitations stated in section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and paragraph (c) of § 53.100.


(b) *Readjustments of price.* No credit or refund under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code may be allowed in respect of any amount which was included in the taxable price of an article sold by the manufacturer and which was later paid by him to his vendee in reimbursement of costs incurred for advertising, if, and to the extent that, the amount so paid:


(1) Is for advertising which does not qualify as local advertising within the meaning of section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and paragraph (b) of § 53.100, or


(2) Is not within the limitation provided in section 4216(e)(2) of the Code, as computed in accordance with § 53.101, as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the amount is so paid over or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter in the same calendar year. See, however, § 53.175, relating to redetermination of price readjustments in cases where local advertising charges excluded from taxable price in one calendar year become taxable as of May 1 of the following calendar year.
