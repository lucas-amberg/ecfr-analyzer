(a) *General.* An appropriate TTB officer may, in the performance of his or her duty, enter in the daytime any building or place where any articles or objects subject to tax are made, produced, or kept, so far as it may be necessary for the purpose of examining said articles or objects and also enter at night any such building or place, while open, for a similar purpose. 


(b) *Distilled spirits plants.* Any appropriate TTB officer may, at all times, as well by night as by day, enter any plant or any other premises where distilled spirits are produced or rectified, or structure or place used in connection therewith for storage or other purposes; to make examination of the materials, equipment and facilities thereon; and make such gauges and inventories as such officer deems necessary. Whenever any appropriate TTB officer, having demanded admittance, and having declared his or her name and office, is not admitted to such premises by the proprietor or other person having charge thereof, such officer may at all times, use such force as is necessary for such officer to gain entry to such premises. 


(c) *Authority to break up grounds.* An appropriate TTB officer, and any person acting in his or her aid, may break up the ground on any part of a distilled spirits plant, or any other premises where spirits are produced or rectified, or any ground adjoining or near to such plant or premises, or any wall or partition thereof, or belonging thereto, or other place, to search for any pipe, cock, private conveyance, or utensil; and, upon finding any such pipe or conveyance leading therefrom or thereto, to break up any ground, house, wall, or other place through or into which such pipe or other conveyance leads, and to break or cut away such pipe or other conveyance, and turn any cock, or to determine whether such pipe or other conveyance conveys or conceals any spirits, mash, wort, or beer, or other liquor, from the sight or view of the appropriate TTB officer, so as to prevent or hinder such officer from taking a true account thereof.
