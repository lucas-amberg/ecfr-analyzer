# § 70.61   Payment by check or money order.

(a) *Authority to Receive*—(1) *General.* (i) The appropriate TTB officer may accept checks drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or money orders in payment for internal revenue taxes, provided such checks or money orders are collectible in U.S. currency at par, and subject to the further provisions contained in this section. The appropriate TTB officer may accept such checks or money orders in payment for internal revenue stamps (authorized under Subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of Subtitle F which relates to Subtitle E) to the extent and under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A check or money order in payment for internal revenue taxes or internal revenue stamps should be made payable to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. A check or money order is payable at par only if the full amount thereof is payable without any deduction for exchange or other charges. As used in this section, the term “money order” means:


(A) U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order; and


(B) Money order issued by a domestic building and loan association (as defined in section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code) or by a similar association incorporated under the laws of a possession of the United States;


(C) A money order issued by such other organization as the appropriate TTB officer may designate; and


(D) A money order described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section in cases therein described. However, the appropriate TTB officers may refuse to accept any personal check whenever there is good reason to believe that such check will not be honored upon presentment.


(ii) An American citizen residing in a country with which the United States maintains direct exchange of money orders on a domestic basis may pay his/her tax by postal money order of such country. For a list of such countries, see section 171.27 of the Postal Manual of the United States.


(iii) If one check or money order is remitted to cover two or more persons' taxes, the remittance should be accompanied by a letter of transmittal clearly identifying—


(A) Each person whose tax is to be paid by the remittance;


(B) The amount of the payment on account of each such person; and


(C) The kind of tax paid.


(2) *Payment for internal revenue stamps—In general.* The appropriate TTB officer may accept checks and money orders described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in payment for internal revenue stamps authorized under Subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code or under any provision of Subtitle F which relates to Subtitle E. However, the appropriate TTB officer may refuse to accept any personal check whenever there is good reason to believe that the check will not be honored upon presentment.


(3) *Payment of tax on distilled spirits, wine, beer, tobacco products, pistols, revolvers, firearms (other than pistols and revolvers), shells and cartridges; proprietor in default.* Where a check or money order tendered in payment for taxes on distilled spirits, wine or beer products (imposed under Chapter 51 of the Internal Revenue Code), or tobacco products (imposed under chapter 52 of the Internal Revenue Code), or pistols, revolvers, firearms (other than pistols and revolvers), shells and cartridges (imposed under chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue Code) is not paid on presentment, or where a taxpayer is otherwise in default in payment of such taxes, any remittance for such taxes made during the period of such default, and until the appropriate TTB officers finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized by the acceptance of personal checks, shall be in cash, or shall be in the form of a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check, drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States, or under the laws of any State or possession of the United States, or a money order as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) *Checks or money orders not paid*—(1) *Ultimate liability.* The person who tenders any check (whether certified or uncertified, cashier's, treasurer's, or other form of check) or money order in payment for taxes is not released from liability until the check or money order is paid; and, if the check or money order is not duly paid, the person shall also be liable for all legal penalties and additions, to the same extent as if such check or money order had not been tendered. For the penalty in case a check or money order is not duly paid, see section 6657 of the Internal Revenue Code. For assessment of the amount of a check or money order not duly paid see section 6201(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.


(2) *Liability of banks and others.* If any certified, treasurer's, or cashier's check (or other guaranteed draft) or money order is not duly paid, the United States shall have a lien for the amount of such check upon all assets of the bank or trust company on which drawn or for the amount of such money order upon the assets of the issuer thereof. The unpaid amount shall be paid out of such assets in preference to any other claims against such bank or issuer except the necessary costs and expenses of administration and the reimbursement of the United States for the amount expended in the redemption of the circulating notes of such bank. In addition, the Government has the right to exact payment from the person required to make the payment.
