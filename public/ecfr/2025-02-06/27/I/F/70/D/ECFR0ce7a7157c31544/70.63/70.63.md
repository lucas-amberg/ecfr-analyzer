# § 70.63   Computations on returns or other documents.

(a) *Amounts shown on forms.* To the extent permitted by any TTB form or instructions prescribed for use with respect to any TTB return, declaration, statement, or other document, or supporting schedules, any amount required to be reported in such form may be entered at the nearest whole dollar amount. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such whole dollar amounts may be entered on any form will be set forth in the instructions issued with respect to such form. For the purpose of the computation to the nearest dollar, a fractional part of a dollar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half dollar or more, in which case the amount (determined without regard to the fractional part of a dollar) shall be increased by $1. The following illustrates the application of this paragraph:


(b) *Election not to use whole dollar amounts*—(1) *Method of election.* Where any TTB form, or the instructions issued with respect to such form, provide that whole dollar amounts shall be reported, any person making a return, declaration, statement, or other document on such form may elect not to use whole dollar amounts by reporting thereon all amounts in full, including cents.


(2) *Time of election.* The election not to use whole dollar amounts must be made at the time of filing the return, declaration, statement, or other document. Such election may not be revoked after the time prescribed for filing such return, declaration, statement, or other document, including extensions of time granted for such filing. Such election may be made on any return, declaration, statement, or other document which is filed after the time prescribed for filing (including extensions of time), and such an election is irrevocable.


(3) *Effect of election.* The taxpayer's election shall be binding only on the return, declaration, statement, or other document filed for a taxable year or period, and a new election may be made on the return, declaration, statement, or other document filed for a subsequent taxable year or period.


(4) *Fractional part of a cent.* For treatment of the fractional part of a cent in the payment of taxes, see 26 U.S.C. 6313 and § 70.62 of this part.


(c) *Inapplicability to computation of amount.* The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply only to amounts required to be reported on a return, declaration, statement, or other document. They do not apply to items which must be taken into account in making the computations necessary to determine such amounts. For example, each item of liability must be taken into account at its exact amount, including cents, in computing the amount of total liability required to be reported on a tax return or supporting schedule. It is the amount of total liability, so computed, which is to be reported at the nearest whole dollar on the return or supporting schedule.
