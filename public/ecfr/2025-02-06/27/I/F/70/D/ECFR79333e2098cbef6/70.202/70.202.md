# ยง 70.202   Intervention.

If the United States is not a party to a civil action or suit, the United States may intervene in such action or suit to assert any lien arising under provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau on the property which is the subject of such action or suit. The provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2410 (except subsection (b)) and of 28 U.S.C. 1444 shall apply in any case in which the United States intervenes as if the United States had originally been named a defendant in such action or suit. If the application of the United States to intervene is denied, the adjudication in such civil action or suit shall have no effect upon such lien.
