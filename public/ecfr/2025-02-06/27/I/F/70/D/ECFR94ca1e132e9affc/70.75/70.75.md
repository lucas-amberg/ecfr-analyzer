(3) The taxpayer's financial solvency is or appears to be threatened.


(b) The tax, interest, additional amounts, and additions to the tax will, upon assessment, become immediately due and payable, and the appropriate TTB officer shall, without delay, issue a notice and demand for payment thereof in full.
