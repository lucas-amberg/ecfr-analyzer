(a) *Invalidity of lien without notice.* The lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is not valid against any purchaser (as defined in § 70.143(f) of this part), holder of a security interest (as defined in § 70.143(a) of this part), mechanic's lienor (as defined in § 70.143(b) of this part), or judgment lien creditor (as defined in § 70.143(g) of this part) until a notice of lien is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part. Except as provided by 26 U.S.C. 6323, if a person becomes a purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor, or judgment lien creditor after a notice of lien is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the interest acquired by such person is subject to the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321.
