# § 70.148   Place for filing notice; form.

(a) *Place for filing.* The notice of lien referred to in § 70.145 of this part shall be filed as follows:


(1) *Under State laws*—(i) *Real property.* In the case of real property, notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(ii) *Personal property.* In the case of personal property, whether tangible or intangible, the notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provision of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that State law merely conforming to or reenacting Federal law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a second office for filing as designated by the laws of such State.


(2) *With the clerk of the United States district court.* Whenever a State has not by law designated one office which meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, the notice shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. For example, a State has not by law designated one office meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, if more than one office is designated within the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices with respect to all property located in such State, county or other governmental subdivision. A State has not by law designated one office meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, if more than one office is designated in the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices with respect to all of the personal property of a particular taxpayer.


(3) *With the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia.* If the property subject to the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is deemed situated, under the provision of paragraph (b) of this section, in the District of Columbia, the notice shall be filed in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia.


(b) *Situs of property subject to lien.* For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, property is deemed situated as follows:


(1) *Real property.* Real property is deemed situated at its physical location.


(2) *Personal property.* Personal property, whether tangible or intangible, is deemed situated at the residence of the taxpayer at the time the notice of lien is filed.


(c) *Form*—(1) *In general.* The notice referred to in § 70.145 of this part shall be filed on TTB Form 5651.2, “Notice of Federal Tax Lien under Internal Revenue Laws”. Such notice is valid notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien. For example, omission from the notice of lien of a description of the property subject to the lien does not affect the validity thereof even though State law may require that the notices contain a description of the property subject to the lien.


(2) *TTB Form 5651.2 defined.* The term “TTB Form 5651.2” generally means a paper form. However, if a State in which a notice referred to in § 70.145 of this part is filed permits a notice of Federal tax lien to be filed by the use of an electronic or magnetic medium the term “TTB Form 5651.2” includes a TTB Form 5651.2 filed by the use of any electronic or magnetic medium permitted by that State. A TTB Form 5651.2 must identify the taxpayer, the tax liability giving rise to the lien, and the date the assessment arose regardless of the method used to file the notice of Federal tax lien.
