# § 70.149   Refiling of notice of tax lien.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Requirement to refile.* In order to continue the effect of a notice of lien, the notice must be refiled in the place described in paragraph (b) of this section during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (c) of this section). In the event that two or more notices of lien are filed with respect to a particular tax assessment, the failure to comply with the provision of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (c) of this section in respect of one of the notices of lien does not affect the effectiveness of the refiling of any other notice of lien. Except for the filing of a notice of lien required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to a change of residence), the validity of any refiling of a notice of lien is not affected by the refiling or nonrefiling of any other notice of lien.


(2) *Effect of refiling.* A timely refiled notice of lien is effective as of the date on which the notice of lien to which it relates was effective.


(3) *Effect of failure to refile.* Except as provided below, if the appropriate TTB officer fails to refile a notice of lien in the manner described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the notice of lien is not effective, after the expiration of the required refiling period, as against any person without regard to when the interest of the person in the property subject to the lien was acquired. However, the failure of the appropriate TTB officer to refile a notice of lien during the required refiling period will not, following the expiration of the refiling period, affect the effectiveness of the notice with respect to:


(i) Property which is the subject matter of a suit, to which the United States is a party, commenced prior to the expiration of the required refiling period, or


(ii) Property which has been levied upon by the United States prior to the expiration of the refiling period. However, if a suit or levy referred to in the preceding sentence is dismissed or released, respectively, and property is subject to the lien at such time, a notice of lien with respect to the property is not effective after the suit or levy is dismissed or released unless refiled during the required refiling period. Failure to refile a notice of lien does not affect the existence of the lien.


(4) *Filing of new notice.* If a notice of lien is not refiled, and if the lien remains in existence, the Bureau may nevertheless file a new lien either on the prescribed form for the filing of a notice of lien or on the form prescribed for refiling a notice of lien. This new filing must meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6323(f) and § 70.148 of this part and is effective from the date on which such filing is made.


(b) *Place for refiling notice of lien*—(1) *In general.* A notice of lien refiled during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (c) of this section) shall be effective only:


(i) If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was filed under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6323; and


(ii) In any case in which 90 days or more prior to the date the refiling of the notice of lien under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is completed, the Bureau receives written information (in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, if a notice of such lien is also filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii) in the State in which such new residence is located (or, if such new residence is located in the District of Columbia or outside the United States, in the District of Columbia).


(2) *Notice of change of taxpayer's residence*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be effective only if it:


(A) Is received, in writing, from the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative by the appropriate TTB officer who filed the original notice of lien.


(B) Relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and


(C) States the taxpayer's name and the address of the taxpayer's new residence.


(ii) *Other rules applicable.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, no communication (either written or oral) to the Bureau will be considered effective as notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence under this section, whether or not the Bureau has actual notice or knowledge of the taxpayer's new residence. For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received by the Bureau without reference to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7502.


(c) *Required refiling period.* For the purpose of this section, the term “required refiling period” means:


(1) The 1-year period ending 30 days after the expiration of 6 years after the date of the assessment of the tax, and


(2) The 1-year period ending with the expiration of 6 years after the close of the preceding required refiling period for such notice of lien.
