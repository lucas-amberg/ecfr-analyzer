# ยง 70.433   Collection of taxes.

(a) *Tobacco products.* Taxes on tobacco products are paid by the manufacturer on the basis of a return. If the manufacturer has filed a proper bond, such manufacturer may defer payment at the time of removal and file semimonthly returns to cover the taxes. If the manufacturer has not filed such a bond or if the manufacturer has defaulted in any way in paying the taxes, the manufacturer is required to file a prepayment return prior to removal of such products, and to continue so doing until the appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized by deferred payment. Tax returns, with remittances, are filed by the domestic manufacturer in accordance with instructions on the appropriate TTB form. Taxes on cigars produced in a customs bonded manufacturing warehouse, Class 6, are paid on the basis of a return to the director of customs in accordance with customs procedures and regulations. Taxes on tobacco products imported or brought into the United States from a foreign country, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States are paid by the importer to the director of customs on the basis of a return made on the customs form by which release from customs custody is to be effected. However, taxes on tobacco products manufactured in Puerto Rico and brought into the United States may be prepaid in Puerto Rico on the basis of a return. If a Puerto Rican manufacturer has filed a proper bond, such manufacturer may defer payment at the time of release for shipment to the United States and file a semimonthly return to cover the taxes. If the manufacturer has not filed such a bond or if such manufacturer has defaulted in any way in payment of taxes, the manufacturer must file a prepayment return prior to removal of such products for shipment to the United States, and continue to do so until the appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized by deferred payment. Tax returns, with remittances, are filed by the domestic manufacturer in accordance with instructions on the appropriate TTB form. 


(b) *Cigarette papers and tubes.* Taxes on cigarette papers and tubes are paid by the manufacturer on the basis of a semimonthly return. Such returns, with remittances, are filed in accordance with the instructions on the appropriate TTB form. Taxes on cigarette papers and tubes imported or brought into the United States from a foreign country, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States are paid to the director of customs before removal on the basis of a return made on the customs form by which release from customs custody is effected. However, taxes on cigarette papers and tubes of Puerto Rican manufacture which are to be shipped to the United States may be prepaid in Puerto Rico on the basis of a return.


(c) *Special tax.* Special (occupational) taxes are paid by manufacturers of tobacco products, manufacturers of cigarette papers and tubes, and export warehouse proprietors on the basis of a return. Special tax stamps are issued to denote the payment of special (occupational) taxes.
