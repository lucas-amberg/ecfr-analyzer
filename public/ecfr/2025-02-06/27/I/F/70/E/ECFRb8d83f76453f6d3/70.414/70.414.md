(k) *Reopening claims.* A claimant who wishes to have a rejected claim reopened must, within the applicable statutory period of limitations, submit a written application to the officer who originally rejected the claim for reconsideration of the claim. Such application must show that the additional evidence to be presented is new and material, and that such evidence was unknown to the claimant, or unobtainable by the claimant, when the claim was previously under consideration.


(l) *Claimant's rights under law and regulations.* Before final action has been taken on a claim, a claimant who, by reason of an oversight, misunderstanding of law and regulations, miscalculation, or other cause, did not claim the full amount of abatement, refund, credit, or drawback, as the case may be, of tax to which the claimant is legitimately entitled, may amend a valid claim, and statements filed in support thereof, in instances where such a claim is deficient in establishing the claimants eligibility to the rights extended to such claimant under law and regulations.
