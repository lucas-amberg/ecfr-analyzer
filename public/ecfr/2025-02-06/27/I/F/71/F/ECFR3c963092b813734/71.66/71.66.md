# ยง 71.66   Prehearing conferences.

In any proceeding the administrative law judge may, upon his own motion or upon the motion of one of the parties or their qualified representatives, in his discretion direct the parties or their qualified representatives to appear at a specified time and place for a conference to consider:


(a) The simplifications of the issues;


(b) The necessity of amendments to the pleadings;


(c) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions of facts and of documents;


(d) The limitation of the number of expert witnesses; and


(e) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the proceeding. As soon as practicable after such conference, the administrative law judge shall issue an order which recites the action taken thereat, the amendments allowed to the pleadings and the agreements made by the parties or their qualified representatives as to any of the matters considered, and which limits the issues for hearing to those not disposed of by admission or agreement; and such order shall control the subsequent course of the proceedings, unless modified for good cause by a subsequent order.
