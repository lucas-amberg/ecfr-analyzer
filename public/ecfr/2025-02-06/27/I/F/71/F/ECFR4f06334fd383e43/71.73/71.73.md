# ยง 71.73   After citation.

If a respondent surrenders the permit after citation and prior to an initial decision, the appropriate TTB officer may accept the surrender of the permit and dismiss the proceeding as moot. If, however, in the opinion of the appropriate TTB officer, the evidence is such as to warrant suspension, revocation or annulment, as the case may be, the surrender of the permit shall be refused, and the proceeding shall continue.
