# § 555.208   Construction of type 2 magazines.

A type 2 magazine is a box, trailer, semitrailer, or other mobile facility.


(a) *Outdoor magazines*—(1) *General.* Outdoor magazines are to be bullet-resistant, fire-resistant, weather-resistant, theft-resistant, and ventilated. They are to be supported to prevent direct contact with the ground and, if less than one cubic yard in size, must be securely fastened to a fixed object. The ground around outdoor magazines must slope away for drainage or other adequate drainage provided. When unattended, vehicular magazines must have wheels removed or otherwise effectively immobilized by kingpin locking devices or other methods approved by the Director.


(2) *Exterior construction.* The exterior and doors are to be constructed of not less than 
1/4-inch steel and lined with at least two inches of hardwood. Magazines with top openings will have lids with water-resistant seals or which overlap the sides by at least one inch when in a closed position.


(3) *Hinges and hasps.* Hinges and hasps are to be attached to doors by welding, riveting, or bolting (nuts on inside of door). Hinges and hasps must be installed so that they cannot be removed when the doors are closed and locked.


(4) *Locks.* Each door is to be equipped with (i) two mortise locks; (ii) two padlocks fastened in separate hasps and staples; (iii) a combination of a mortise lock and a padlock; (iv) a mortise lock that requires two keys to open; or (v) a three-point lock. Padlocks must have at least five tumblers and a case-hardened shackle of at least 
3/8-inch diameter. Padlocks must be protected with not less than 
1/4-inch steel hoods constructed so as to prevent sawing or lever action on the locks, hasps, and staples. These requirements do not apply to magazine doors that are adequately secured on the inside by means of a bolt, lock, or bar that cannot be actuated from the outside.


(b) *Indoor magazines*—(1) *General.* Indoor magazines are to be fire-resistant and theft-resistant. They need not be bullet-resistant and weather-resistant if the buildings in which they are stored provide protection from the weather and from bullet penetration. No indoor magazine is to be located in a residence or dwelling. The indoor storage of high explosives must not exceed a quantity of 50 pounds. More than one indoor magazine may be located in the same building if the total quantity of explosive materials stored does not exceed 50 pounds. Detonators must be stored in a separate magazine (except as provided in § 555.213) and the total quantity of detonators must not exceed 5,000.


(2) *Exterior construction.* Indoor magazines are to be constructed of wood or metal according to one of the following specifications:


(i) Wood indoor magazines are to have sides, bottoms and doors constructed of at least two inches of hardwood and are to be well braced at the corners. They are to be covered with sheet metal of not less than number 26-gauge (.0179 inches). Nails exposed to the interior of magazines must be countersunk.


(ii) Metal indoor magazines are to have sides, bottoms and doors constructed of not less than number 12-gauge (.1046 inches) metal and be lined inside with a nonsparking material. Edges of metal covers must overlap sides at least one inch.


(3) *Hinges and hasps.* Hinges and hasps are to be attached to doors by welding, riveting, or bolting (nuts on inside of door). Hinges and hasps must be installed so that they cannot be removed when the doors are closed and locked.


(4) *Locks.* Each door is to be equipped with (i) two mortise locks; (ii) two padlocks fastened in separate hasps and staples; (iii) a combination of a mortise lock and a padlock; (iv) a mortise lock that requires two keys to open; or (v) a three-point lock. Padlocks must have at least five tumblers and a case-hardened shackle of at least 
3/8-inch diameter. Padlocks must be protected with not less than 
1/4-inch steel hoods constructed so as to prevent sawing or lever action on the locks, hasps, and staples. Indoor magazines located in secure rooms that are locked as provided in this subparagraph may have each door locked with one steel padlock (which need not be protected by a steel hood) having at least five tumblers and a case-hardened shackle of at least 
3/8-inch diameter, if the door hinges and lock hasp are securely fastened to the magazine. These requirements do not apply to magazine doors that are adequately secured on the inside by means of a bolt, lock, or bar that cannot be actuated from the outside.


(c) *Detonator boxes.* Magazines for detonators in quantities of 100 or less are to have sides, bottoms and doors constructed of not less than number 12-gauge (.1046 inches) metal and lined with a nonsparking material. Hinges and hasps must be attached so they cannot be removed from the outside. One steel padlock (which need not be protected by a steel hood) having at least five tumblers and a case-hardened shackle of at least 
3/8-inch diameter is sufficient for locking purposes.
