(a) *General.* Each distributor of cigarettes shall retain the records required by §§ 646.146 and 646.147 for three years following the close of the year in which the records are made. The distributor shall keep the required records on his business premises.


(b) *Shorter retention periods.* The appropriate ATF officer may, pursuant to an application submitted by a distributor, approve a shorter retention period where—


(1) The distributor requesting the shorter retention period is an agent of a tobacco products manufacturer;


(2) The tobacco products manufacturer will keep the required record for each disposition of more than 60,000 cigarettes from the agent's premises for the full retention period specified in paragraph (a) of this section; and


(3) The approval of a shorter retention period will not unduly hinder the administration of enforcement of this subpart.


(c) *Application requirements.* Each distributor proposing to employ a shorter retention period shall submit a written application, in duplicate, to the appropriate ATF officer. A distributor may not employ a shorter retention period until approval is received from the appropriate ATF officer. Each application should indicate the duration of the proposed retention period and should include the information required by paragraph (b) of this section.
