The United States may not file a charge under 18 U.S.C. 1831 of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (the “EEA”) (18 U.S.C. 1831 *et seq.*), or use a violation under section 1831 of the EEA as a predicate offense under any other law, without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, or the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division (or the Acting official in each of these positions if a position is filled by an Acting official). Violations of this regulation are appropriately sanctionable and will be reported by the Attorney General to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees.

This regulation shall remain in effect until October 11, 2011.
