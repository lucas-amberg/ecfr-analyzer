# ยง 10.2   Language of registration statement.

Registration statements must be in English if possible. If in a foreign language they must be accompanied by an English translation certified under oath by the translator, before a notary public or other person authorized by law to administer oaths for general purposes as a true and adequate translation. The statements, with the exception of signature, must be typewritten if practicable but will be accepted if written legibly in ink.
