# § 100.17   Request for payment.

(a) The carrier shall provide sufficient supporting documentation at the time of submission of request for payment to allow adequate analysis and evaluation of the incurred costs. The FBI reserves the right to request additional cost data from carriers in order to ensure compliance with this part.


(b) Instructions for submission of the supporting documentation for the request for payment are as follows:


(1) The carrier shall submit to the FBI incurred costs by line item with supporting information.


(2) A cost element breakdown as described in § 100.17(f) shall be attached for each agreed upon line item.


(3) Supporting breakdowns shall be furnished for each cost element, consistent with the carrier's cost accounting system.


(c) When more than one line item has been agreed upon, summary total amounts covering all line items shall be furnished for each cost element. Depending on the carrier's accounting system, breakdowns shall be provided to the FBI for the following categories of cost elements, as applicable:


(1) *Materials.* Provide a consolidated cost summary of individual material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or agreement line items and the basis upon which they were determined (vendor invoices, time sheets, payroll records, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, software, components, and assemblies. For all reimbursable items, identify the item, source, quantity, and cost.


(2) *Direct labor.* Provide a breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and furnish the methodologies used in identifying these costs. Have available for audit, in accordance with § 100.18, time sheet and labor rate calculation justification for all direct labor charged to the agreement.


(3) *Allocable direct costs.* Indicate how allocable costs are computed and applied, including cost breakdowns, comparing estimates to actual data as a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of actual costs.


(4) *Subcontracting costs.* For any subcontractor costs submitted for reimbursement, along with a copy of the invoice, the carrier must have available for audit in accordance with § 100.18, documentation that costs incurred are just and reasonable.


(5) *Other costs.* List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories described above (e.g., special tooling, travel, computer and consultant services) and have available for audit in accordance with § 100.18, documentation that costs incurred are just and reasonable.


(d) There is a clear distinction between submitting cost data and merely making available books, records, and other documents without identification.


(1) The requirement for submission of cost data is met when all accurate cost data reasonably available to the carrier have been submitted, either actually or by specific identification of the data that are available for review in the carrier's files, to the FBI.


(2) Should later information which affects the level of reimbursement come into the carrier's possession, it must be promptly submitted to the FBI.


(3) The requirement for submission of cost data continues up to the time of final reimbursement.


(e) In submitting its invoice, the carrier must include an index, which cross references the actual cost data submitted with the cost estimate.


(f) Headings for submission are as follows:


(1) Total Project Cost: Summary.


(i) Cost Elements (Enter appropriate cost elements.)


(ii) Actual Costs Incurred—Total Cost (Enter those necessary and reasonable costs that were incurred in the efficient completion of CALEA requirements.)


(iii) Actual Costs Incurred—Unit Cost (Enter the unit costs for each cost element.)


(iv) Supporting Material (Identify the attachment in which the information supporting the specific cost element may be found.)


(2) Total Project Costs: Detail (at Switch Level or Project Level, as appropriate.)


(i) Cost Elements (Enter appropriate cost elements.)


(ii) Actual Costs Incurred—Total Cost (Enter those necessary and reasonable costs that were incurred in the efficient completion of CALEA requirements.)


(iii) Actual Costs Incurred—Unit Cost (Enter the unit costs for each cost element.)


(iv) Supporting Material (Identify the attachment in which the information supporting the specific cost element may be found.)
