# § 104.21   Presumptively covered conditions.

(a) *In general.* The Special Master shall maintain and publish on the Fund's Web site a list of presumptively covered conditions that resulted from the terrorist-related air crashes of September 11, 2001, or rescue and recovery or debris removal efforts during the immediate aftermath of such crashes. The list shall consist of the WTC-Related Physical Health Conditions that resulted from the terrorist-related air crashes of September 11, 2001 or rescue and recovery or debris removal efforts during the immediate aftermath of such crashes. Group B claims shall be eligible for compensation only if the Special Master determines based on the evidence presented that a claimant who seeks compensation for physical harm has at least one WTC-Related Physical Health Condition, or, with respect to a deceased individual, the cause of such individual's death is determined at least in part to be attributable to a WTC-Related Physical Health Condition.


(b) *Updates.* The Special Master shall update the list of presumptively covered conditions to conform to any changes in the WTC-Related Physical Health Conditions. Claims may then be amended pursuant to § 104.22(e)(ii).


(c) *Conditions other than presumptively covered conditions.* A claimant may also be eligible for payment under § 104.51 where the claimant has at least one WTC-Related Physical Health Condition and the Special Master determines that the claimant—


(1) Has a physical injury to the body that resulted from the terrorist-related air crashes of September 11, 2001 or rescue and recovery or debris removal efforts during the immediate aftermath of such crashes or presents extraordinary circumstances; and


(2) Is otherwise eligible for payment.
