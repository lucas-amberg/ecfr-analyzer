# § 104.43   Determination of presumed economic loss for decedents.

In reaching presumed determinations for economic loss for Personal Representatives bringing claims on behalf of eligible decedents, the Special Master shall consider sums corresponding to the following:


(a) *Loss of earnings or other benefits related to employment.* The Special Master, as part of the process of reaching a “determination” pursuant to section 405(b) of the Act, has developed a methodology and may publish updated schedules, tables, or charts that will permit prospective claimants to estimate determinations of loss of earnings or other benefits related to employment based upon individual circumstances of the deceased victim, including: The age of the decedent as of the date of death; the number of dependents who survive the decedent; whether the decedent is survived by a spouse; and the amount and nature of the decedent's income for recent years. The decedent's salary/income in the three years preceding the year of death (or for other years the Special Master deems relevant) shall be evaluated in a manner that the Special Master deems appropriate. The Special Master may, if she deems appropriate, take an average of income figures for the three years preceding the year of death, and may also consider income for other periods that she deems appropriate, including published pay scales for victims who were government or military employees. In computing any loss of earnings due to physical harm as defined herein the Special Master shall, for each year for which any loss of earnings or other benefits related to employment is computed, limit the annual past or projected future gross income of the decedent to an amount that is not greater than $200,000. For purposes of the computation of loss of earnings, annual gross income shall have the meaning given such term in section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In cases where the victim was a minor child, the Special Master may assume an average income for the child commensurate with the average income of all wage earners in the United States. For victims who were members of the armed services or government employees such as firefighters or police officers, the Special Master may consider all forms of compensation (or pay) to which the victim was entitled. For example, military service members' and uniformed service members' compensation includes all of the various components of compensation, including, but not limited to, basic pay (BPY), basic allowance for housing (BAH), basic allowance for subsistence (BAS), federal income tax advantage (TAD), overtime bonuses, differential pay, and longevity pay.


(b) *Medical expense loss.* This loss equals the documented past out-of-pocket medical expenses that were incurred as a result of the eligible physical harm suffered by the decedent (*i.e.,* those medical expenses that were not paid for or reimbursed through health insurance or other programs). This loss shall be calculated on a case-by-case basis, using documentation and other information submitted by the Personal Representative. The Special Master shall not consider any future medical expense loss.


(c) *Replacement services loss.* For decedents who did not have any prior earned income, or who worked only part-time outside the home, economic loss may be determined with reference to replacement services and similar measures.


(d) *Loss due to death/burial costs.* This loss shall be calculated on a case- by-case basis, using documentation and other information submitted by the personal representative and includes the out-of-pocket burial costs that were incurred.


(e) *Loss of business or employment opportunities.* Such losses shall be addressed through the procedure outlined above in paragraph (a) of this section.
