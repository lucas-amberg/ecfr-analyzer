# § 115.13   Supervision and monitoring.

(a) The agency shall ensure that each facility it operates shall develop, document, and make its best efforts to comply on a regular basis with a staffing plan that provides for adequate levels of staffing, and, where applicable, video monitoring, to protect inmates against sexual abuse. In calculating adequate staffing levels and determining the need for video monitoring, facilities shall take into consideration:


(1) Generally accepted detention and correctional practices;


(2) Any judicial findings of inadequacy;


(3) Any findings of inadequacy from Federal investigative agencies;


(4) Any findings of inadequacy from internal or external oversight bodies;


(5) All components of the facility's physical plant (including “blind-spots” or areas where staff or inmates may be isolated);


(6) The composition of the inmate population;


(7) The number and placement of supervisory staff;


(8) Institution programs occurring on a particular shift;


(9) Any applicable State or local laws, regulations, or standards;


(10) The prevalence of substantiated and unsubstantiated incidents of sexual abuse; and


(11) Any other relevant factors.


(b) In circumstances where the staffing plan is not complied with, the facility shall document and justify all deviations from the plan.


(c) Whenever necessary, but no less frequently than once each year, for each facility the agency operates, in consultation with the PREA coordinator required by § 115.11, the agency shall assess, determine, and document whether adjustments are needed to:


(1) The staffing plan established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;


(2) The facility's deployment of video monitoring systems and other monitoring technologies; and


(3) The resources the facility has available to commit to ensure adherence to the staffing plan.


(d) Each agency operating a facility shall implement a policy and practice of having intermediate-level or higher-level supervisors conduct and document unannounced rounds to identify and deter staff sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Such policy and practice shall be implemented for night shifts as well as day shifts. Each agency shall have a policy to prohibit staff from alerting other staff members that these supervisory rounds are occurring, unless such announcement is related to the legitimate operational functions of the facility.
