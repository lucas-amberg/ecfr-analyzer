# § 16.47   Privacy Act requests for an accounting of record disclosures.

(a) *Requirements for making a Privacy Act request for accounting of record disclosures.* Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept as stated in paragraph (c) of this section, individuals may make a Privacy Act request for an accounting of record disclosures about themselves that have been made by the Department to another person, organization, or agency. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. If the requester believes that the same record is in more than one system of records, the requester should address their request to each component that the requester believes maintains the record. For the quickest possible handling, requesters should mark both their request letters and envelopes “Privacy Act Accounting Request.” Requests must otherwise follow the procedures in § 16.41.


(b) *Processing Privacy Act requests for an accounting of record disclosures.* Unless otherwise specified in this section, components shall process Privacy Act requests for accountings of record disclosures following the procedures in §§ 16.42 and 16.43.


(c) *Where accountings of record disclosures are not required.* Components are not required to provide Privacy Act accountings of record disclosures to a requester in cases in which they relate to:


(1) Disclosures of information not subject to the Privacy Act;


(2) Disclosures of records not maintained in a system of records;


(3) Disclosures of records maintained in a system of records for which accountings are not required to be kept, including disclosures to those officers and employees of the Department who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1), or disclosures that are required under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(2);


(4) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law enforcement agencies specifying the law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or


(5) Disclosures made from systems of records that have been exempted from the accounting of record disclosure requirements pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k), through the applicable regulations in this subpart.


(d) *Appeals.* A requester may appeal a component's refusal to grant a Privacy Act request for an accounting of record disclosures in the same manner, and under the same procedures, as a Privacy Act access appeal, as set forth in § 16.45.
