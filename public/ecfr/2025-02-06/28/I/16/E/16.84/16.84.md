# § 16.84   Exemption of Immigration Appeals System.

(a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) (2), (3) and (4): 


(1) Decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (JUSTICE/BIA-001).


(b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
