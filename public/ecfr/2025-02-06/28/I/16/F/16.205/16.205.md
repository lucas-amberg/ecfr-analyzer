# § 16.205   Closed meetings—Informal procedures.

(a) *Finding.* Based upon a review of the meetings of the U.S. Parole Commission since the effective date of the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act (May 14, 1976), the regulations issued pursuant thereto (28 CFR part 2) the experience of the U.S. Board of Parole, and the regulations pertaining to the Commission's authority under 29 U.S.C. 504 and 29 U.S.C. 1111 (28 CFR parts 4 and 4a), the Commission finds that the majority of its meetings may properly be closed to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (d)(4) and (c)(10). The major part of normal Commission business lies in the adjudication of individual parole cases, all of which proceedings commence with an initial parole or revocation hearing and are determined on the record thereof.


(b) *Meetings to which applicable.* The following types of meetings may be closed in the event that a majority of the Commissioners present at the meeting, and authorized to act on behalf of the Commission, votes by recorded vote at the beginning of each meeting or portion thereof, to close the meeting or portions thereof:


(1) Original jurisdiction initial and appellate case deliberations conducted pursuant to 28 CFR 2.17 and 2.27;


(2) National Appeals Board deliberations pursuant to 28 CFR 2.26;


(3) Meetings of the Commission to conduct a hearing on the record regarding applications for certificates of exemption pursuant to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. 504, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1111 (28 CFR 4.1-17 and 29 CFR 4a.1-17).
