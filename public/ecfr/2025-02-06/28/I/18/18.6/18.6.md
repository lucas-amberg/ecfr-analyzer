All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties, and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues.

The opposing party may answer within such time as may be designated by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may permit further replies by both parties.
