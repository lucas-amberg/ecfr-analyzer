# § 2.36   Rescission guidelines.

(a) The following guidelines shall apply to the sanctioning of disciplinary infractions or new criminal conduct committed by a prisoner during any period of confinement that is credited to his current sentence (whether before or after sentence is imposed), but prior to his release on parole; and by a parole violator during any period of confinement prior to or following the revocation of his parole (except when such period of confinement has resulted from initial parole to a detainer). These guidelines specify the customary time to be served for such behavior which shall be added to the time required by the original presumptive or effective date. Credit shall be given towards service of these guidelines for any time spent in custody on a new offense that has not been credited towards service of the original presumptive or effective date. If a new concurrent or consecutive sentence is imposed for such behavior, these guidelines shall also be applied at the initial hearing on such term. 


(1) Administrative rule infraction(s) (including alcohol abuse) normally can be adequately sanctioned by postponing a presumptive or effective date by 0-60 days per instance of misconduct, or by 0-8 months in the case of use or simple possession of illicit drugs or refusal to provide a urine sample. Escape or other new criminal conduct shall be considered in accordance with the guidelines set forth below.


(2) *Escape/new criminal behavior in a prison facility* (including a community corrections center). The time required pursuant to the guidelines set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be added to the time required by the original presumptive or effective date. 


(i) *Escape or attempted escape*—(A) Escape or attempted escape, except as listed below—8-16 months.


(B) If from non-secure custody with voluntary return in 6 days or less—≤6 months.


(C) If by fear or force applied to person(s), grade under (ii) but not less than Category Five.


(ii) *Other new criminal behavior in a prison facility.*

(3) *New criminal behavior in the community* (e.g., while on pass, furlough, work release, or on escape). In such cases, the guidelines applicable to reparole violators under § 2.21 shall be applied, using the new offense severity (from § 2.20) and recalculated salient factor score (such score shall be recalculated as if the prisoner had been on parole at the time of the new criminal behavior). The time required pursuant to these guidelines shall be added to the time required by the original presumptive or effective date.


(b) The above are merely guidelines. Where the circumstances warrant, a decision outside the guidelines (above or below) may be rendered provided specific reasons are given. For example, a substantial period of good conduct since the last disciplinary infraction in cases not involving new criminal conduct may be treated as a mitigating circumstance.
