# ยง 2.6   Withheld and forfeited good time.

While neither a forfeiture of good time nor a withholding of good time shall bar a prisoner from receiving a parole hearing, section 4206 of title 18 of the U.S. Code permits the Commission to parole only those prisoners who have substantially observed the rules of the institution.
