# § 2.219   Maximum terms of imprisonment and supervised release.

(a) *Imprisonment; first revocation.* When a term of supervised release is revoked, the maximum authorized term of imprisonment that the Commission may require the offender to serve, in accordance with D.C. Code 24-403.01(b)(7), is determined by reference to the maximum authorized term of imprisonment for the offense of conviction. The maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation shall be:


(1) Five years, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is life, or if the offense is statutorily designated as a Class A felony;


(2) Three years, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is 25 years or more, but less than life, and the offense is not statutorily designated as a Class A felony;


(3) Two years, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is 5 years or more, but less than 25 years; or


(4) One year, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is less than 5 years.


(b) *Further term of supervised release; first revocation.* (1) When a term of supervised release is revoked, and the Commission imposes less than the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may also impose a further term of supervised release after imprisonment. A term of imprisonment is “less than the maximum authorized term of imprisonment” if the term is one day or more shorter than the maximum authorized term of imprisonment.


(2) The maximum authorized length of such further term of supervised release shall be the original maximum term of supervised release that the sentencing court was authorized to impose for the offense of conviction, less the term of imprisonment imposed by the Commission upon revocation of supervised release. The original maximum authorized term of supervised release is as follows:


(i) Five years if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is 25 years or more;


(ii) Three years if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense is more than one year but less than 25 years; and


(iii) Life if the person is required to register for life, and 10 years in any other case, if the offender has been sentenced for an offense for which registration is required by the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1999.


(3) For example, if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation is three years and the original maximum authorized term of supervised release is five years, the Commission may impose a three-year term of imprisonment with no supervised release to follow, or any term of imprisonment of less than three years with a further term of supervised release of five years minus the term of imprisonment actually imposed (such as a one-year term of imprisonment followed by a four-year term of supervised release, or a two-year term of imprisonment followed by a three-year term of supervised release).


(c) *Reference table.* The following table may be used in most cases as a reference to determine both the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation and the original maximum authorized term of supervised release:


(d) *Imprisonment; successive revocations.* (1) When the Commission revokes a term of supervised release that was imposed by the Commission after a previous revocation of supervised release, the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, less the term or terms of imprisonment that were previously imposed by the Commission. In calculating such previously-imposed term or terms of imprisonment, the Commission shall use the term as imposed without deducting any good time credits that may have been earned by the offender prior to his release from prison. In no case shall the total of successive terms of imprisonment imposed by the Commission exceed the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation. 


(2) For example, if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation is three years and the original maximum authorized term of supervised release is five years, the Commission at the first revocation may have imposed a one-year term of imprisonment and a further four-year term of supervised release. At the second revocation, the maximum authorized term of imprisonment will be two years, *i.e.,* the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation (three years) minus the one-year term of imprisonment that was imposed at the first revocation. 


(e) *Further term of supervised release; successive revocations.* (1) When the Commission revokes a term of supervised release that was imposed by the Commission following a previous revocation of supervised release, the Commission may also impose a further term of supervised release. The maximum authorized length of such a term of supervised release shall be the original maximum authorized term of supervised release permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, less the total of the terms of imprisonment imposed by the Commission on the same sentence (including the term of imprisonment imposed in the current revocation). 


(2) For example, if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation is three years and the original maximum authorized term of supervised release is five years, the Commission at the first revocation may have imposed a one-year term of imprisonment and a four-year further term of supervised release. If, at a second revocation, the Commission imposes another one-year term of imprisonment, the maximum authorized further term of supervised release will be three years (the original five-year period minus the total of two years of imprisonment). 


(f) *Effect of sentencing court imposing less than the original maximum authorized term of supervised release.* If the Commission has revoked supervised release, the maximum authorized period of further supervised release is determined by reference to the original maximum authorized term permitted for the offense of conviction (see paragraph (b) of this section), even if the sentencing court did not impose the original maximum authorized term permitted for the offense of conviction.
