# § 27.8   Alternative dispute resolution.

(a) At any stage in the process set forth in §§ 27.3 through 27.5 of this part, the Complainant may request Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) through the Department of Justice Mediator Corps (DOJMC) Program. The Complainant may elect to participate in ADR by notifying in writing the office before which the matter is then pending.


(b) If the Complainant elects mediation, the FBI, represented by the Office of General Counsel, will participate.


(c) When the Complainant requests to engage in ADR, the process set forth in §§ 27.3 through 27.5, as applicable, including all time periods specified therein, will be stayed for an initial period of 90 days, beginning on the date of transmittal of the matter to the DOJMC Program office. Upon joint request by the parties to the office before which the matter is stayed, the period of the stay may be extended up to an additional 45 days. Further requests for extension of the stay may be granted only by the Director, regardless of the office before which the matter is pending, upon a joint request showing good cause. The stay otherwise will be lifted if the DOJMC Program notifies the office before which the matter is stayed that the Complainant no longer wishes to engage in mediation, or that the parties are unable to reach agreement on resolution of the complaint and that continued efforts at mediation would not be productive.
