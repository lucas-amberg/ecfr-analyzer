# ยง 31.502   Assurances and plan information.

(a) In its application for a Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant (JAIBG), each State must provide assurances to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), absent a waiver as provided in the JAIBG Program Guidance Manual, that:


(1) The State will subgrant at least 75% of the State's allocation of funds to eligible units of local government to implement authorized programs at the local level; and


(2) The State, and each unit of local government applying for a subgrant from the State, will expend not less than 45% of any grant provided to such State or unit of local government, other than funds set aside for administration, for program purposes 3-9 in ยง 31.500 (c) through (i) of this subpart, and will not spend less than 35% for program purposes 1, 2, and 10 in ยง 31.500 (a), (b), and (j) of this subpart, unless the State certifies to OJJDP, or the unit of local government certifies to the State, that the interests of public safety and juvenile crime control would be better served by expending the grant award for purposes set forth in the twelve program areas in a different ratio. Such certification shall provide information concerning the availability of existing structures or initiatives within the intended areas of expenditure (or the availability of alternative funding sources for those areas), and the reasons for the State or unit of local government's alternative use.


(3) The funds provided under this part shall be administered in compliance with the standards set forth in part 38 (Equal Treatment for Faith-based Organizations) of this chapter. 


(b) Following award of JAIBG funds to a State by OJJDP, but prior to obligation of program funds by the State or of subgrant funds by a unit of local government for any authorized program purpose, a State administering JAIBG funds must provide to OJJDP information that demonstrates that the State, or a unit of local government that receives JAIBG funds, has established a coordinated enforcement plan for reducing juvenile crime, developed by a Juvenile Crime Enforcement Coalition (JCEC).


(c) State coordinated enforcement plans must be developed by a Juvenile Crime Enforcement Coalition consisting of representatives of law enforcement and social service agencies involved in juvenile crime prevention. To assist in developing the State's coordinated enforcement plan, States may choose to utilize members of the State Advisory Group (SAG) established by the State's Chief Executive under section 223(a)(3) of Part B of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act of 1974, as amended, codified at 42 U.S.C. 5633(a)(3), if appropriate membership exists, or use or establish another planning group that constitutes a coalition of law enforcement and social service agencies.


(d) When establishing a local Juvenile Crime Enforcement Coalition (JCEC), units of local government must include, unless impracticable, individuals representing:


(1) Police,


(2) Sheriff,


(3) Prosecutor,


(4) State or local probation services,


(5) Juvenile court,


(6) Schools,


(7) Business, and


(8) Religious affiliated, fraternal, nonprofit, or social service organizations involved in crime prevention.


(e) Units of local government may utilize members of Prevention Policy Boards established pursuant to section 505(b)(4) of Title V of the JJDP Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. 5784(b)(4), to meet the JCEC requirement, provided that each JCEC meets the membership requirements listed in paragraph (d) of this section.
