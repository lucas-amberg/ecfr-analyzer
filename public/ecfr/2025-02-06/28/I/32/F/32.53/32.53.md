(ii) The WTC responder's injury was sustained in the course of performance of line of duty activity or a line of duty action that exposed him to airborne toxins, other hazards, or other adverse conditions resulting from the September 11, 2001, attacks;


(3) The sole ground of the denial was that the claim did not establish that—

(ii) The injury allegedly sustained by the WTC responder was the direct and proximate cause of his death or permanent and total disability;


(4) The alleged injury on which the claim was based is a WTC-related health condition; and




(5) The claimant files with the PSOB Office a motion for such reconsideration before the earlier of two year—


(i) The date on which the WTC-related physical health condition, if any, is determined by the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, for the WTC responder, to meet the definition at section 104.2(i) of this title (as in effect on January 17, 2017); or


(ii) The date on which the WTC-related health condition, if any, is certified, for the WTC responder, (as applicable) 42 U.S.C. 300mm-22(b)(1)(B)(ii) or 42 U.S.C. 300mm-22(b)(2)(A)(ii).
