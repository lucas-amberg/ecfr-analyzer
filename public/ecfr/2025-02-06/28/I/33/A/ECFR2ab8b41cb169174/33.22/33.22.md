Section 808 of the Justice Assistance Act provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law, title to all expendable and nonexpendable personal property purchased with funds made available under this title, including property with funds made available under this title as in effect before the effective date of the Justice Assistance Act of 1984, shall vest in the criminal justice agency or nonprofit organization that purchased the property if it certifies to the State Office that it will use the property for criminal justice purposes. If such certification is not made, title to the property shall vest in the State Office, which shall seek to have the property used for criminal justice purposes elsewhere in the state prior to using it or disposing of it in any other manner. If a State Office does not exist, certification will be made directly to the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
