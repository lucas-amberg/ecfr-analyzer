(a) The Act encourages the implementation of programs that have been proven successful. Pursuant to section 403(a)(14) of the Act, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, after a process of consultation coordinated by the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Justice Programs with the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, certifies that the following programs have been proven successful:

Local programs must be designed to meet the needs and problems of specific neighborhoods or communities and particular population groups, including the elderly. They must make extensive use of volunteers. The specific services or activities to be implemented depend on the local situation and crime problem, but usually have, as a core element, neighborhood (block) watch with additional activities optional. Programs to provide training, technical assistance and other support services are also eligible for funding. Program objectives and elements are described in greater detail in the *Program Brief on Community Crime Prevention.*

The majority of the model programs have established *storefronts* in which law enforcement officers pose as fences who buy stolen goods. In areas where there is a high concentration of organized crime, programs have employed techniques to infiltrate organizations in order to obtain evidence for prosecution of serious crime. Program objectives and elements are described in greater detail in the *Program Brief on Property Crime (STING) Program.*

Model programs result in reduction of case processing time, minimization of court appearances for victims and witnesses, and improvement of the public's perception of the quality of the criminal justice system. This program is available for both metropolitan trial courts and state-level court systems.

Particular care must be taken that persons charged with violent crimes be detained and that the impact on victims and witnesses be a factor in screening decisions. The program calls for the development of a jail population management plan as part of a planning phase, followed by implementation of specific activities and services. Among the activities and services that may be funded are central intake and screening, pretrial services, diversion to detoxification centers, citation release, community corrections, sentencing alternatives, and jail management information systems.

PMSS uses automated data processing systems to support priority prosecution, improved conviction rates, speedy trial management, and improved efficiency/effectiveness of the prosecutor's office. Model programs result in information systems which support prosecution activities such as identification of violent and career criminals, case and subpoena preparation and witness notification. Systems are used to monitor management decisions and prosecutor actions and to reduce case processing time and case preparation time. Program objectives and elements are described in greater detail in the *Program Brief on Prosecution Management Support System.* This Program Brief has been designed to provide guidance for all criminal justice information systems.
