(c)(1) Whenever a State government or unit of local government or any officer or employee thereof acting in an official capacity, has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice prohibited by section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA, a civil action may be instituted after exhaustion of administrative remedies by the person aggrieved in an appropriate U.S. District Court or in a State court or general jurisdiction. 


(2) Administrative remedies shall be deemed to be exhausted upon the expiration of 60 days after the date the administrative complaint was filed with the Office or any other administrative enforcement agency, unless within such period there has been a determination by the Office or the agency on the merits of the complaint, in which case such remedies shall be deemed exhausted at the time the determination becomes final. 


(3) The Attorney General, or a specifically designated assistant for or in the name of the United States may intervene upon timely application in any civil action brought to enforce compliance with section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA if he certifies that the action is of general public importance.
