(a)(1) *General.* It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice under 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(1) for a person or other entity to intentionally discriminate or to engage in a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien) with respect to the hiring, or recruitment or referral for a fee, of the individual for employment or the discharging of the individual from employment—


(i) Because of such individual's national origin; or


(ii) In the case of a protected individual, as defined in § 44.101(k), because of such individual's citizenship status.


(2) *Intimidation or retaliation.* It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice under 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(5) for a person or other entity to intimidate, threaten, coerce, or retaliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured under 8 U.S.C. 1324b or because the individual intends to file or has filed a charge or a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under that section.


(3) *Unfair documentary practices.* It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice under 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(6) for—

(B) To refuse to honor documents tendered that on their face reasonably appear to be genuine and to relate to the individual; and


(ii) To make such request or refusal for the purpose or with the intent of discriminating against any individual in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, regardless of whether such documentary practice is a condition of employment or causes economic harm to the individual.


(b) *Exceptions.* (1) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to—


(i) A person or other entity that employs three or fewer employees;


(ii) Discrimination because of an individual's national origin by a person or other entity if such discrimination is covered by 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2; or


(iii) Discrimination because of citizenship status which—


(A) Is otherwise required in order to comply with law, regulation, or Executive order; or


(B) Is required by Federal, State, or local government contract; or


(C) The Attorney General determines to be essential for an employer to do business with an agency or department of the Federal, State, or local government.


(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, it is not an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to prefer to hire an individual, or to recruit or refer for a fee an individual, who is a citizen or national of the United States over another individual who is an alien if the two individuals are equally qualified.
