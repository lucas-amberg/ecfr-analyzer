# § 5.206   Language and wording of registration statement.

(a) Except as provided in the next sentence, each statement, amendment, exhibit, or notice required to be filed under the Act shall be submitted in the English language. An exhibit may be filed even though it is in a foreign language if it is accompanied by an English translation certified under oath by the translator before a notary public, or other person authorized by law to administer oaths for general purposes, as a true and accurate translation. 


(b) A statement, amendment, exhibit, or notice required to be filed under the Act should be typewritten, but will be accepted for filing if it is written legibly in ink, or if it is filed in an electronic format acceptable to the Registration Unit. 


(c) Copies of any document made by any of the duplicating processes may be filed pursuant to the Act if they are clear and legible. 


(d) A response shall be made to every item on each pertinent form, unless a registrant is specifically instructed otherwise in the form. Whenever the item is inapplicable or the appropriate response to an item is “none,” an express statement to that effect shall be made.
