# ยง 51.59   Redistricting plans.

(a) *Relevant factors.* In determining whether a submitted redistricting plan has a prohibited purpose or effect the Attorney General, in addition to the factors described above, will consider the following factors (among others):


(1) The extent to which malapportioned districts deny or abridge the right to vote of minority citizens;


(2) The extent to which minority voting strength is reduced by the proposed redistricting;


(3) The extent to which minority concentrations are fragmented among different districts;


(4) The extent to which minorities are over concentrated in one or more districts;


(5) The extent to which available alternative plans satisfying the jurisdiction's legitimate governmental interests were considered;


(6) The extent to which the plan departs from objective redistricting criteria set by the submitting jurisdiction, ignores other relevant factors such as compactness and contiguity, or displays a configuration that inexplicably disregards available natural or artificial boundaries; and


(7) The extent to which the plan is inconsistent with the jurisdiction's stated redistricting standards.


(b) *Discriminatory purpose.* A jurisdiction's failure to adopt the maximum possible number of majority-minority districts may not be the sole basis for determining that a jurisdiction was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.
