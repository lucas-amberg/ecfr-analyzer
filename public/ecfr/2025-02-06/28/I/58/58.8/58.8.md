(e) *Deadlines for filing and submitting MOR.* The MOR must be filed with the court and submitted to the United States Trustee on a monthly basis. Unless otherwise provided by local rule, each MOR must be filed by no later than the 21st day of the month immediately following the reporting period covered by the MOR. The MOR must be filed every month until one of the following occurs:


(1) The effective date of a confirmed plan of reorganization;


(2) The conversion of the case to a case under another chapter; or


(3) The dismissal of the case.


(f) *UST Form 11-PCR, Post-confirmation Report.* Following the effective date of a confirmed plan, reorganized debtors and any other authorized parties who have been charged with administering the confirmed plan must file with the court and serve upon the United States Trustee, any governmental unit charged with responsibility for collection or determination of any tax arising out of such operation, and any requesting party in interest quarterly post-confirmation reports using UST Form 11-PCR. In jointly administered cases, unless otherwise required by the United States Trustee in the United States Trustee's discretion, each jointly administered debtor, reorganized debtor, or other authorized party who has been charged with administering a confirmed plan is required to file a separate PCR on a nonconsolidated basis. The PCR must contain the following:


(1) Date the petition was filed and the date of plan confirmation;


(2) Summary of all post-confirmation amounts disbursed. This summary must be segregated into disbursements during the most recent reporting period and total disbursements since the date of the confirmation order;


(3) All preconfirmation professional fees approved by the court in the case for the most recent period and cumulatively since the date of the order for relief (separately reported, for the professional fees incurred by or on behalf of the debtor, between those that would have been incurred absent a bankruptcy case and those not);


(4) Information regarding the recoveries of holders of claims under confirmed plans. This information must be expressed in aggregate dollar values and, in the case of claims, as a percentage of total claims of the class allowed;


(5) Information on whether a final decree has been entered or is anticipated to be entered; and


(6) Information about the payment of quarterly fees to the United States Trustee during the reporting period.


(g) *Deadlines for filing and submitting PCR.* The PCR must be filed with the court and submitted to the United States Trustee on a quarterly basis. Unless otherwise provided by local rule, each PCR must be filed not later than the 21st day following the last day of the reporting (previous) quarter. The PCR must be filed every quarter until one of the following occurs:


(1) The date of the final decree;


(2) The conversion of the case to a case under another chapter; or


(3) The dismissal of the case.


(h) *Accounting methods.* Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are required to be used when completing the Periodic Reports, except if the debtor used a different set of accounting standards prepetition or if the United States Trustee or an order of the court otherwise modifies the GAAP requirement. If the debtor uses GAAP accounting, supporting documents must comply with GAAP, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification 852, “Reorganizations.”


(i) *Certification of Periodic Reports' accuracy.* The Periodic Reports must be certified under penalty of perjury that they are true and correct by an individual who is authorized under applicable law to certify on behalf of the debtor, trustee, reorganized debtor, or other authorized party who has been charged with administering a confirmed plan. The debtor's, trustee's, reorganized debtor's, or other authorized party's attorney must maintain possession of the Periodic Reports with original holographic signatures for five years, unless otherwise provided by local rule. In addition to the obligations imposed by (l)(2), a pro se debtor must submit the Periodic Reports with original holographic signatures to the office of the United States Trustee in the district in which the bankruptcy case is pending.


(j) *Mandatory usage of Periodic Reports.* The Periodic Reports must be utilized by debtors and trustees when completing their monthly operating reports or post-confirmation reports. The Periodic Reports shall be used without alteration, except as otherwise provided in this rule, in a particular UST Form 11-MOR or UST Form 11-PCR, or in the instructions for UST Form 11-MOR or UST Form 11-PCR. The Periodic Reports may be modified to permit minor changes not affecting wording or the order of presenting information. All debtors and chapter 11 trustees serving in districts where a United States Trustee is serving must use the Periodic Reports in the administration of their cases, in the same manner and with the same content, as set forth in this Rule.


(1) All Periodic Reports may be electronically or mechanically reproduced so long as the content and the form remain consistent with the Periodic Reports as they are posted on EOUST's website; and


(2) The Periodic Reports shall be filed via the United States Bankruptcy Courts' Case Management/Electronic Case Filing System (CM/ECF) as a “smart form,” meaning the reports are data-embedded.
