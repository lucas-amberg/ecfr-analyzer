# ยง 61.6   Consideration of environmental documents in decisionmaking.

The NEPA regulations contain requirements to ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency decisionmaking. To implement these requirements, the Department of Justice shall:


(a) Consider from the earliest possible point in the process all relevant environmental documents in evaluating proposals for Department action;


(b) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments and responses accompany the proposal through existing Department review processes;


(c) Consider those alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed when evaluating proposals for Department action, or if it is desirable to consider substantially different alternatives, first supplement the environmental document to include analysis of the additional alternatives;


(d) Where an EIS has been prepared, consider the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is the subject of the EIS.
