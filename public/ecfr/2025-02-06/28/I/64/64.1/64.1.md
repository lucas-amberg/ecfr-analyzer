# ยง 64.1   Purpose.

This regulation designates categories of federal officers and employees in addition to those already designated by the statute, who will be within the protective coverage of 18 U.S.C. 1114, which prohibits the killing or attempted killing of such designated officers and employees. The categories of federal officers and employees covered by section 1114 are also protected, while they are engaged in or on account of the performance of their official duties, from a conspiracy to kill, 18 U.S.C. 1117; kidnapping, 18 U.S.C. 1201(a)(5); forcible assault, intimidation, or interference, 18 U.S.C. 111; and threat of assault, kidnap or murder with intent to impede, intimidate, or retaliate against such officer or employee, 18 U.S.C. 115(a)(1)(B). In addition, the immediate family members of such officers and employees are protected against assault, kidnap, murder, attempt to kidnap or murder, and threat to assault, kidnap, or murder with intent to impede, intimidate, or retaliate against such officer or employee, 18 U.S.C. 115(a)(1)(A). The protective coverage has been extended to those federal officers and employees whose jobs involve inspection, investigative or law enforcement responsibilities, or whose work involves a substantial degree of physical danger from the public that may not be adequately addressed by available state or local law enforcement resources.
