# ยง 68.10   Motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

(a) The respondent, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the event that the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the complainant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The filing of a motion to dismiss does not affect the time period for filing an answer.


(b) The Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the complaint, based on a motion by the respondent or without a motion from the respondent, if the Administrative Law Judge determines that the complainant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. However, in the prehearing phase of an adjudicatory proceeding brought under this part, the Administrative Law Judge shall not dismiss a complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, upon his or her own motion, without affording the complainant an opportunity to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed.
