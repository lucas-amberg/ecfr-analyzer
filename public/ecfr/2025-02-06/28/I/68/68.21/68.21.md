(b) Each matter of which an admission is requested is admitted unless, within thirty (30) days after service of the request or such shorter or longer time as the Administrative Law Judge may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party:


(1) A written statement denying specifically the relevant matters of which an admission is requested;


(2) A written statement setting forth in detail the reasons why he/she can neither truthfully admit nor deny them; or


(3) Written objections on the ground that some or all of the matters involved are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole or in part.

(d) Any matter admitted under this section is conclusively established unless the Administrative Law Judge upon motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.


(e) A copy of each request for admission and each written response shall be served on all parties.
