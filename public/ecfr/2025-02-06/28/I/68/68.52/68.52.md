(4) In the case of a person or entity composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions, each of which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment, without reference to the practices of, and under the control of, or common control with, another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered a separate person or entity.

In determining the amount of the penalty, due consideration shall be given to the size of the business of the employer being charged, the good faith of the employer, the seriousness of the violation, whether or not the individual was an unauthorized alien, and the history of previous violations.


(6) With respect to a violation of section 274A(a)(1)(B) of the INA where a person or entity participating in a pilot program has failed to provide notice of final nonconfirmation of employment eligibility of an individual to the Attorney General as required by Pub.

(xii) In the case of an unfair immigration-related employment practice where a person or entity, for the purpose or with the intent of discriminating against an individual in violation of section 274B(a), requests more or different documents than are required under section 274A(b) or refuses to honor documents that on their face reasonably appear to be genuine, to pay a civil penalty of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000 for each individual discriminated against before March 15, 1999, and not less than $110 and not more than $1,100 for each individual discriminated against on or after March 15, 1999, or to order any of the remedies listed as paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(vii) of this section.

(4) In applying paragraph (d) of this section in the case of a person or entity composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions, each of which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment, without reference to the practices of, and not under the control of or common control with another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered a separate person or entity.
