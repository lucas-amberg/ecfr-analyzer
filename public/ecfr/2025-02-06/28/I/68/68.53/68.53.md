# ยง 68.53   Review of an interlocutory order of an Administrative Law Judge in cases arising under section 274A or 274C.

(a) *Authority.* In a case arising under section 274A or 274C of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer may, within thirty (30) days of the date of an Administrative Law Judge's interlocutory order, issue an order that modifies or vacates the interlocutory order. The Chief Administrative Hearing Officer may review an Administrative Law Judge's interlocutory order if:


(1) An Administrative Law Judge, when issuing an interlocutory order, states in writing that the Judge believes:


(i) That the order concerns an important question of law on which there is a substantial difference of opinion; and 


(ii) That an immediate appeal will advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or that subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy; or


(2) Within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of an interlocutory order a party requests by motion that the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer review the interlocutory order. This motion shall contain a clear statement of why interlocutory review is appropriate under the standards set out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or


(3) Within ten (10) days of the entry of the interlocutory order, the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer, upon the Officer's own initiative, determines that such order is appropriate for interlocutory review pursuant to the standards set out in paragraph (a)(1) and issues a notification of review. This notification shall state the issues to be reviewed.


(b) *Stay of proceedings.* Review of an Administrative Law Judge's interlocutory order will not stay the proceeding unless the Administrative Law Judge or the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer determines that the circumstances require a postponement.


(c) *Review by Chief Administrative Hearing Officer.* Review by the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer of an interlocutory order shall be conducted in the same manner as is provided for review of final orders in ยง 68.54(b) through (d). An interlocutory order, or an order modifying, vacating, or remanding an interlocutory order, shall not be considered a final agency order. If the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer does not modify, vacate, or remand an interlocutory order reviewed pursuant to paragraph (a) within thirty (30) days of the date that the order is entered, the Administrative Law Judge's interlocutory order is deemed adopted.


(d) *Effect of interlocutory review.* (1) An order by the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer modifying or vacating an interlocutory order shall also remand the case to the Administrative Law Judge. Further proceedings in the case shall be conducted consistent with the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer's order.


(2) Whether or not an interlocutory order is reviewed by the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer, all parties retain the right to request administrative review of the final order of the Administrative Law Judge pursuant to ยง 68.54 with respect to all issues in the case.
