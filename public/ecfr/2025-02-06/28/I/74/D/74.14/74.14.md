# § 74.14   Determination of the relationship of statutory heirs.

(a) A spouse of a deceased eligible individual must establish his or her marriage by one (or more) of the following: 


(1) A copy of the public record of marriage, certified or attested; 


(2) An abstract of the public record, containing sufficient data to identify the parties, the date and place of marriage, and the number of prior marriages by either party if shown on the official record, issued by the officer having custody of the record or other public official authorized to certify the record; 


(3) A certified copy of the religious record of marriage; 


(4) The official report from a public agency as to a marriage which occurred while the deceased eligible individual was employed by such agency; 


(5) An affidavit of the clergyman or magistrate who officiated; 


(6) The original certificate of marriage accompanied by proof of its genuineness; 


(7) The affidavits or sworn statements of two or more eyewitnesses to the ceremony; 


(8) In jurisdictions where “Common Law” marriages are recognized, the affidavits or certified statements of the spouse setting forth all of the facts and circumstances concerning the alleged marriage, such as the agreement between the parties at the beginning of their cohabitation, places and dates of residences, and whether children were born as the result of the relationship. This evidence should be supplemented by affidavits or certified statements from two or more persons who know as the result of personal observation the reputed relationship which existed between the parties to the alleged marriage, including the period of cohabitation, places of residences, whether the parties held themselves out as husband and wife and whether they were generally accepted as such in the communities in which they lived; or 


(9) Any other evidence which would reasonably support a finding by the Administrator that a valid marriage actually existed. 


(b) A child should establish that he or she is the child of a deceased eligible individual by one of the following types of evidence: 


(1) A birth certificate showing that the deceased eligible individual was the child's parent; 


(2) An acknowledgment in writing signed by the deceased eligible individual; 


(3) Evidence that the deceased eligible individual has been identified as the child's parent by a judicial decree ordering the deceased eligible individual to contribute to the child's support or for other purposes; or 


(4) Any other evidence that reasonably supports a finding of a parent-child relationship, such as—


(i) A certified copy of the public record of birth or a religious record showing that the deceased eligible individual was the informant and was named as the parent of the child; 


(ii) Affidavits or sworn statements of a person who knows that the deceased eligible individual accepted the child as his or hers; or 


(iii) Information obtained from public records or a public agency, such as school or welfare agencies, which shows that with the deceased eligible individual's knowledge, the deceased eligible individual was named as the parent of the child. 


(c) Except as may be provided in paragraph (b) of this section, evidence of the relationship by an adopted child must be shown by a certified copy of the decree of adoption. In jurisdictions where petition must be made to the court for release of adoption documents or information, or where the release of such documents or information is prohibited, a revised birth certificate will be sufficient to establish the fact of adoption. 


(d) The relationship of a step-child to a deceased eligible individual shall be demonstrated by—


(1) Evidence of birth to the spouse of the deceased eligible individual as required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section; 


(2) Evidence of adoption as required by section (b) of this section when the step-child was adopted by the spouse; 


(3) Other evidence which reasonably supports the finding of a parent-child relationship between the child and the spouse; 


(4) Evidence that the step-child was either living with or in a parent-child relationship with the deceased eligible individual at the time of the eligible individual's death; and 


(5) Evidence of the marriage of the deceased eligible individual and the step-child's natural or adoptive parent, as required by paragraph (a) of this section.


(e) A parent of a deceased eligible individual may establish his or her parenthood of the deceased eligible individual by providing one of the following types of evidence:


(1) A birth certificate that shows the person to be the deceased eligible individual's parent;


(2) An acknowledgment in writing signed by the person before the eligible individual's death; or


(3) Any other evidence which reasonably supports a finding of such a parent-child relationship, such as—


(i) A certified copy of the public record of birth or a religious record showing that the person was the informant and was named as the parent of the deceased eligible individual;


(ii) Affidavits or sworn statements of persons who know the person had accepted the deceased eligible individual as his or her child; or 


(iii) Information obtained from public records or a public agency such as school or welfare agencies, which shows that with the deceased eligible individual's knowledge, the person had been named as parent of the child.


(f) An adoptive parent of a deceased eligible individual must show one of the following as evidence—


(1) A certified copy of the decree of adoption and such other evidence as may be necessary; or 


(2) In jurisdictions where petition must be made to the court for release of such documents or information, or where release of such documents or information is prohibited, a revised birth certificate showing the person as the deceased eligible individual's parent will suffice.
