# ยง 76.19   Prehearing conferences.

(a) *Purpose and scope.* Upon motion of a party or in the Judge's discretion, the Judge may direct the parties or their counsel to participate in a prehearing conference at any reasonable time prior to a hearing, or during the course of a hearing, when the Judge finds that the proceeding would be expedited by such a conference. Prehearing conferences normally shall be conducted by telephone unless, in the opinion of the Judge, such method would be impractical, or when such conferences can be conducted in a more expeditious or effective manner by correspondence or personal appearance. Reasonable notice of the time, place, and manner of the prehearing conference shall be given. At the conference, the following matters may be considered:


(1) The simplification of issues;


(2) The necessity of amendments to pleadings;


(3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of facts and of the authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid unnecessary proof;


(4) The limitations on the number of expert or other witnesses;


(5) Negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;


(6) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;


(7) The identification of documents or matters of which official notice may be required;


(8) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of the actions decided at the conference; and


(9) Such other matters, including the disposition of pending motions and resolution of issues regarding the admissibility of evidence, as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.


(b) *Reporting.* A verbatim record of the conference shall not be kept unless directed by the Judge.


(c) *Order.* Actions taken as a result of a prehearing conference shall be reduced to a written order unless the Judge concludes that a stenographic report shall suffice or, if the conference takes place within seven (7) days of the beginning of a hearing, and the Judge elects to make a statement on the record at the hearing summarizing the actions taken.
