# § 79.41   Definitions.

(a) *Cor pulmonale* means heart disease, including hypertrophy of the right ventricle, due to pulmonary hypertension secondary to fibrosis of the lung. 


(b) *Designated time period* means the period beginning on January 1, 1942, and ending on December 31, 1971. 


(c) *Employment for at least one year* means employment for a total of at least one year (12 consecutive or cumulative months). 


(d) *Fibrosis of the lung* or *pulmonary fibrosis* means chronic inflammation and scarring of the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli with collagen deposition and progressive thickening. 


(e) *Miner* or *uranium mine worker* means a person who operated or otherwise worked in a uranium mine. 


(f) *National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified “B” reader* means a physician who is certified as such by NIOSH. A list of certified “B” readers is available from the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program upon request. 


(g) *Nonmalignant respiratory disease* means fibrosis of the lung, pulmonary fibrosis, cor pulmonale related to fibrosis of the lung, silicosis, or pneumoconiosis. 


(h) *Pneumoconiosis* means a chronic lung disease resulting from inhalation and deposition in the lung of particulate matter, and the tissue reaction to the presence of the particulate matter. For purposes of this subpart, the claimant's exposure to the particulate matter that led to the disease must have occurred during employment in a uranium mine. 


(i) *Primary lung cancer* means any physiological condition of the lung, trachea, or bronchus that is recognized under that name or nomenclature by the National Cancer Institute. The term includes in situ lung cancers. 


(j) *Readily available documentation* means documents in the possession, custody, or control of the claimant or an immediate family member. 


(k) *Silicosis* means a pneumoconiosis due to the inhalation of the dust of stone, sand, flint, or other materials containing silicon dioxide, characterized by the formation of pulmonary fibrotic changes. 


(l) *Specified state* means Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon, or Texas. Additional states may be included, provided: 


(1) A uranium mine was operated in such state at any time during the period beginning on January 1, 1942, and ending on December 31, 1971; 


(2) The state submits an application to the Assistant Director (specified in § 79.70(a)) to include such state; and 


(3) The Assistant Director makes a determination to include such state. 


(m) *Uranium mine* means any underground excavation, including “dog holes,” as well as open-pit, strip, rim, surface, or other aboveground mines, where uranium ore or vanadium-uranium ore was mined or otherwise extracted. 


(n) *Working level* means the concentration of the short half-life daughters of radon that will release (1.3 × 10
5) million electron volts of alpha energy per liter of air. 


(o) *Working level month of radiation* means radiation exposure at the level of one working level every work day for a month, or an equivalent cumulative exposure over a greater or lesser amount of time. 


(p) *Written diagnosis by a physician* means a written determination of the nature of a disease made from a study of the signs and symptoms of a disease that is based on a physical examination of the patient, medical imaging or a chemical, microscopic, microbiologic, immunologic or pathologic study of physiologic and functional tests, secretions, discharges, blood, or tissue. For purposes of satisfying the requirement of a “written diagnosis by a physician” for living claimants specified in § 79.46, a physician submitting a written diagnosis of a nonmalignant respiratory disease must be employed by the Indian Health Service or the Department of Veterans Affairs or be board certified, and must have a documented, ongoing physician-patient relationship with the claimant. An “ongoing physician-patient relationship” can include referrals made to specialists from a primary care provider for purposes of diagnosis or treatment. “Board certification” requires, in addition to physician licensing, the successful completion of a residency training program and passage of a Board exam in a relevant field or specialty. Relevant specialties include: family practice, internal medicine, pathology, preventive medicine, radiology, surgery, and thoracic surgery (and including subspecialties such as cardiovascular disease, medical oncology, pulmonary disease) as listed by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
