# ยง 79.74   Representatives and attorney's fees.

(a) *Representation.* In submitting and presenting a claim to the Program, a claimant or beneficiary may, but need not, be represented by an attorney or by a representative of an Indian Tribe or tribal organization. Non-attorneys (other than representatives of an Indian Tribe or tribal organization) are not permitted to represent claimants or beneficiaries before the Program. To the extent that resources are available, the Assistant Director will provide assistance to all persons who file claims for compensation. Only qualified attorneys, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, may receive from a claimant or beneficiary any fee in connection with a successful claim. 


(b) *Fees.* (1) Notwithstanding any contract, the attorney of a claimant or beneficiary, along with any assistants or experts retained by the attorney on behalf of the claimant or beneficiary, may not receive from a claimant or beneficiary any fee for services rendered in connection with an unsuccessful claim. The attorney of a claimant or beneficiary may recover costs incurred in connection with an unsuccessful claim.


(2) Notwithstanding any contract and except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the attorney of a claimant or beneficiary, along with any assistants or experts retained by the attorney on behalf of the claimant or beneficiary, may receive from a claimant or beneficiary no more than 2% of the total award for all services rendered in connection with a successful claim, exclusive of costs.


(3)(i) If an attorney entered into a contract with the claimant or beneficiary for services before July 10, 2000, with respect to a particular claim, then that attorney may receive up to 10% of the total award for services rendered in connection with a successful claim, exclusive of costs.


(ii) If an attorney resubmits a previously denied claim, then that attorney may receive up to 10% of the total award to the claimant or beneficiary for services rendered in connection with that subsequently successful claim, exclusive of costs. Resubmission of a previously denied claim includes only those claims that were previously denied and refiled under the Act.


(4) Any violation of paragraph (b) of this section shall result in a fine of not more than $5,000.


(c) *Attorney qualifications.* An attorney may not represent a claimant or beneficiary unless the attorney is engaged in the private practice of law and an active member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a state. Attorneys who are members of multiple state bars, and who are suspended, sanctioned, disbarred, or disqualified from the practice of law for professional misconduct in one state may not represent a claimant or beneficiary even though the attorney continues to remain in good standing of the bar of another state. If a claimant or beneficiary is represented by an attorney, then the attorney must submit the following documents to the Program along with the claim:


(1) A statement of the attorney's active membership in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a state; and


(2) A signed representation agreement, retainer agreement, fee agreement, or contract, documenting the attorney's authorization to represent the claimant or beneficiary. The document must acknowledge that the Act's fee limitations are satisfied.
