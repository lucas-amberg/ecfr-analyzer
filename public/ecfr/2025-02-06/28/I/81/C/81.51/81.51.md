# § 81.51   Child Pornography Victims Reserve.

The Child Pornography Victims Reserve (“Reserve”) was established on December 7, 2018, to provide a source of defined monetary assistance for eligible victims of trafficking in child pornography, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2259(d). Pursuant to the authority of the Department of Justice (“the Department”) to administer the Reserve, the Department will—


(a) Accept a request that the Department seek a court order for a determination of eligibility for defined monetary assistance from a claimant who chooses to proceed through the Department;


(b) Process such request and use reasonable efforts to follow up with such claimant to obtain information sufficient for a court to determine the claimant's eligibility for defined monetary assistance;


(c) Upon confirming that the request to the Department is complete and not duplicative of a previously received request, use reasonable efforts to identify a Federal child pornography trafficking case in which an image of the identified victim appears and in which the Department may present an application for court determination of the claimant's eligibility; and


(d) Pay a claimant (or an authorized representative, if applicable) pursuant to a Federal court order determining that such claimant is eligible to receive defined monetary assistance.
