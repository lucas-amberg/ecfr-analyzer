# § 90.25   Reallocation of funds.

This section implements 42 U.S.C. 3796gg-1(j), regarding reallocation of funds.


(a) *Returned funds.* A State may reallocate funds returned to the State, within a reasonable amount of time before the award end date.


(b) *Insufficient eligible applications.* A State may also reallocate funds if the State does not receive sufficient eligible applications to award the full funding under the allocations in 42 U.S.C. 3796gg-1(c)(4). An “eligible” application is one that is from an eligible entity that has the capacity to perform the proposed services, proposes activities within the scope of the program, and does not propose significant activities that compromise victim safety. States should have the following information on file to document the lack of sufficient eligible applications:


(1) A copy of their solicitation;


(2) Documentation on how the solicitation was distributed, including all outreach efforts to entities from the allocation in question, which entities the State reached out to that did not apply, and, if known, why those entities did not apply;


(3) An explanation of their selection process;


(4) A list of who participated in the selection process (name, title, and employer);


(5) Number of applications that were received for the specific allocation category;


(6) Information about the applications received, such as what agency or organization they were from, how much money they were requesting, and any reasons the applications were not funded;


(7) If applicable, letters from any relevant State-wide body explaining the lack of applications, such as from the State Court Administrator if the State is seeking to reallocate money from courts; and


(8) For the culturally specific allocation, in addition to the items in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section, demographic statistics of the relevant racial and ethnic minority groups within the State and documentation that the State has reached out to relevant organizations within the State or national organizations.
