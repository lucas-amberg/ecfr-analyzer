# ยง 90.32   Reimbursement request.

Each year for which funds are available for the Tribal Reimbursement Program, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) will issue a Notice of Reimbursement Opportunity with instructions on how to apply for the maximum allowable reimbursement. The reimbursement request for each participating Tribe will include a certification that the participating Tribe meets the eligibility requirements of ยง 90.31. It will also include a list of expenses that the participating Tribe incurred in exercising STCJ in the previous year, in categories such as law enforcement, prosecution, indigent defense, pre-trial services, corrections, and probation. If a participating Tribe has newly implemented tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians and therefore cannot submit 12 months' worth of expenses for the prior year, the participating Tribe may use estimated amounts for each category of expenses.
