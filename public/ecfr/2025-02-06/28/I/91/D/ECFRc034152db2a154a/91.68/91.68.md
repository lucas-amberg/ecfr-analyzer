# ยง 91.68   Compliance with other Federal environmental statutes, regulations and executive orders.

(a) *Other Federal environmental laws.* All projects initiated by State or local units of government with VOI/TIS grant funding are also subject, where applicable, to the environmental impact analysis requirements of the following statutes, their implementing regulations, and the relevant executive orders: 


(1) Archeological and Historical Preservation Act, 


(2) Coastal Zone Management Act, 


(3) Coastal Barrier Resources Act, 


(4) Clean Air Act, 


(5) Safe Drinking Water Act, 


(6) Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 


(7) Endangered Species Act, 


(8) Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 


(9) National Historic Preservation Act, 


(10) Wilderness Act, 


(11) Farmland Protection Policy Act, 


(12) Flood Disaster Protection Act 


(13) Executive Order on Floodplain Management, 


(14) Executive Order on Wetland Protection, 


(15) Executive Order on Environmental Justice, and 


(16) Executive Order on Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment. 


(b) *Combined requirements.* Documenting compliance with the environmental requirements in paragraph (a) of this section does not normally require separate documents or separate processes. Rather, documenting compliance with all of these requirements is generally accomplished by incorporating them into the NEPA documents. For example, one category of environmental impacts that must be addressed in a NEPA analysis is potential impacts to historic properties. The National Historic Preservation Act, as well as the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's regulations at 36 CFR part 800, also contain Federal requirements for addressing the impacts on historic properties from Federal actions. In order to avoid duplicate compliance procedures, the NEPA document traditionally becomes the process for meeting the requirements of both laws.
