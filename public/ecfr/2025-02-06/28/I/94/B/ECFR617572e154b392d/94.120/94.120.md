Supporting activities for which VOCA funds may be used include, but are not limited to, the following:


(a) Coordination *of activities*—Coordination activities that facilitate the provision of direct services, include, but are not limited to, State-wide coordination of victim notification systems, crisis response teams, multi-disciplinary teams, coalitions to support and assist victims, and other such programs, and salaries and expenses of such coordinators;

(c) *Multi-system, interagency, multi-disciplinary response to crime victim needs*—Activities that support a coordinated and comprehensive response to crime victims needs by direct service providers, including, but not limited to, payment of salaries and expenses of direct service staff serving on child and adult abuse multi-disciplinary investigation and treatment teams, coordination with federal agencies to provide services to victims of federal crimes and/or participation on Statewide or other task forces, work groups, and committees to develop protocols, interagency, and other working agreements;


(d) *Contracts for professional services*—Contracting for specialized professional services (*e.g.,* psychological/psychiatric consultation, legal services, interpreters), at a rate not to exceed a reasonable market rate, that are not available within the organization;


(e) *Automated systems and technology*—Subject to the provisions of the DOJ Grants Financial Guide and government-wide grant rules relating to acquisition, use and disposition of property purchased with federal funds, procuring automated systems and technology that support delivery of direct services to victims (*e.g.,* automated information and referral systems, email systems that allow communications among victim service providers, automated case-tracking and management systems, smartphones, computer equipment, and victim notification systems), including, but not limited to, procurement of personnel, hardware, and other items, as determined by the SAA after considering—


(1) Whether such procurement will enhance direct services;


(2) How any acquisition will be integrated into and/or enhance the program's current system;


(3) The cost of installation;


(4) The cost of training staff to use the automated systems and technology;


(5) The ongoing operational costs, such as maintenance agreements, supplies; and


(6) How additional costs relating to any acquisition will be supported;


(f) *Volunteer trainings*—Activities in support of training volunteers on how to provide direct services when such services will be provided primarily by volunteers; and


(g) *Restorative justice*—Activities in support of opportunities for crime victims to meet with perpetrators, including, but not limited to, tribal community-led meetings and peace-keeping activities, if such meetings are requested or voluntarily agreed to by the victim (who may, at any point, withdraw) and have reasonably anticipated beneficial or therapeutic value to crime victims. SAAs that plan to fund this type of service should closely review the criteria for conducting these meetings, and are encouraged to discuss proposals with OVC prior to awarding VOCA funds for this type of activity. At a minimum, the following should be considered:—


(1) The safety and security of the victim;


(2) The cost versus the benefit or therapeutic value to the victim;


(3) The procedures for ensuring that participation of the victim and offenders are voluntary and that the nature of the meeting is clear;


(4) The provision of appropriate support and accompaniment for the victim;


(5) Appropriate debriefing opportunities for the victim after the meeting; and


(6) The credentials of the facilitators.
