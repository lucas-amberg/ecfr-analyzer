# ยง 301.204   Continuation of lost-time wages.

(a) Once approved, the inmate shall receive lost-time wages until the inmate: 


(1) Is released; 


(2) Is transferred to another institution for reasons unrelated to the work injury; 


(3) Returns to the pre-injury work assignment; 


(4) Is reassigned to another work area or program for reasons unrelated to the sustained work injury, or is placed into Disciplinary Segregation; or, 


(5) Refuses to return to a regular work assignment or to a lighter duty work assignment after medical certification of fitness for such duty. 


(b) An inmate medically certified as fit for return to work shall sustain no monetary loss due to a required change in work assignment. Where there is no light duty or regular work assignment available at the same rate of pay as the inmate's pre-injury work assignment, the difference shall be paid in lost-time wages. Lost-time wages are paid until a light duty or regular work assignment at the same pay rate as the inmate's pre-injury work assignment is available.
