# ยง 345.32   Hiring.

(a) Inmate workers are ordinarily hired through waiting lists. Except as noted in ยง 345.33, inmates are to be placed on the waiting lists in order of receipt of applications for work with Industries, and are to be hired in the same sequence. 


(b) Waiting lists are to be maintained and kept available for scrutiny by auditors and other staff with a need to know. SOI's are encouraged to maintain a waiting list for each FPI factory.
