# § 345.40   General.

This subpart authorizes the establishment of minimum work standards for inmate workers assigned to the Industries program at all field locations. The SOI may reproduce these standards and may also develop additional local guidelines to augment these standards and to adapt them to local needs and conditions. Local Industries shall place these standards and any additional local guidelines on display at appropriate locations within the industrial sites. Inmates shall be provided with a copy of these standards and local guidelines, and shall sign receipts acknowledging they have received and understand them before beginning work in the Industries program. In the case of a disabled inmate, alternate media or means of communicating this information and indicating the inmate's receipt may be provided, if necessary as a reasonable accommodation. 


(a) At a minimum, each industrial location is to have work standards for each of the following areas: 


(1) Safety—ensuring the promotion of workplace safety and the avoidance of activities that could result in injury to self or others. 


(2) Quality assurance—ensuring that work is done as directed by the supervisor in an attentive manner so as to minimize the chance of error. 


(3) Personal conduct and hygiene—ensuring the promotion of harmony and sanitary conditions in the workplace through observation of good hygiene and full cooperation with other inmate workers, work supervisors, and training staff. 


(4) Punctuality and productivity—ensuring the productive and efficient use of time while the inmate is on work assignment or in training. 


(b) *Compliance with work standards.* Each inmate assigned to FPI shall comply with all work standards pertaining to his or her work assignment. Adherence to the standards should be considered in evaluating the inmate's work performance and documented in individual hiring, retention, and promotion/demotion situations.
