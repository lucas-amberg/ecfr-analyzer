# § 501.1   Bureau of Prisons emergencies.

(a) *Suspension of rules during an emergency.* The Director of the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) may suspend operation of the rules in this chapter as necessary to handle an institutional emergency or an emergency affecting the Bureau. When there is an institutional emergency which the Director or Warden considers a threat to human life or safety, the Director or Warden may suspend the operation of the rules in this chapter as necessary to handle the emergency.


(b) *Responsibilities of the Warden*—(1) *Notifying the Director.* If the Warden suspends operation of the rules, the Warden must, within 24 hours of the suspension or as soon as practicable, notify the Director by providing written documentation which:


(i) Describes the institutional emergency that threatens human life or safety;


(ii) Sets forth reasons why suspension of the rules is necessary to handle the institutional emergency;


(iii) Estimates how long suspension of the rules will last; and


(iv) Describes criteria which would allow normal rules application to resume.


(2) *Submitting certification to Director of continuing emergency.* 30 days after the Warden suspends operation of the rules, and every 30 days thereafter, the Warden must submit to the Director written certification that an institutional emergency threatening human life or safety and warranting suspension of the rules continues to exist. If the Warden does not submit this certification to the Director, or if the Director so orders at any time, the suspension of the rules will cease.
