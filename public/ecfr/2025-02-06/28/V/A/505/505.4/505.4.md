# ยง 505.4   Calculation of assessment by unit staff.

Bureau of Prisons Unit Team staff are responsible for computing the amount of the fee to be paid by each inmate who has not been exempted from fee assessment. The inmate will only be assessed an amount once for the cost of incarceration for each separate period of incarceration.


(a) Unit Team staff are to rely exclusively on the information contained in the Presentence Investigation Report and findings and orders of the sentencing court in order to determine the extent of an inmate's assets, liabilities and dependents.


(b) The fee is assessed in accordance with the following formula: If an inmate's assets are equal to or less than the poverty level, as established by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and published annually in the _Federal Register,_ no fee is to be imposed. If an inmate's assets are above the poverty level, Unit Team staff are to impose a fee equal to the inmate's assets above the poverty level up to the average cost to the Bureau of Prisons of confining an inmate for one year.


(c) If the amount of time that the inmate is in custody is less than 334 days (including pretrial custody time), the maximum fee to be imposed is to be computed by prorating the fee on a monthly basis.
