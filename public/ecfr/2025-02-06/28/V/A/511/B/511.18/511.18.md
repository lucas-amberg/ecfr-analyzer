# § 511.18   When Bureau staff can arrest and detain a non-inmate.

(a) You may be arrested and detained by Bureau staff anytime there is probable cause indicating that you have violated or attempted to violate applicable criminal laws while at a Bureau facility, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. 3050.


(b) “Probable cause” exists when specific facts and circumstances lead a reasonably cautious person (not necessarily a law enforcement officer) to believe a violation of criminal law has occurred, and warrants consideration for prosecution.


(c) Non-inmates arrested by Bureau staff under this regulation will be physically secured, using minimally necessary force and restraints, in a private area of the facility away from others. Appropriate law enforcement will be immediately summoned to investigate the incident, secure evidence, and commence criminal prosecution.
