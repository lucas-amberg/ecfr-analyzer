# § 513.43   Inmate access to certain Bureau Program Statements.

Inmates are encouraged to use the simple local access procedures described in this section to review certain Bureau Program Statements, rather than the FOIA procedures described in §§ 513.60 through 513.68 of this subpart. 


(a) For a current Bureau Program Statement containing rules (regulations published in the _Federal Register_ and codified in 28 CFR), local access is available through the institution law library. 


(b) For a current Bureau Program Statement not containing rules (regulations published in the _Federal Register_ and codified in 28 CFR), inmates may request that it be placed in the institution law library. Placement of a requested Program Statement in the law library is within the discretion of the Warden, based upon local institution conditions. 


(c) Inmates are responsible for the costs of making personal copies of any Program Statements maintained in the institution law library. For copies of Program Statements obtained under the FOIA procedures described in §§ 513.60 through 513.68 of this subpart, fees will be calculated in accordance with 28 CFR 16.10.
