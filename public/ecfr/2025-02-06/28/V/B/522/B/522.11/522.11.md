# ยง 522.11   Civil contempt commitments.

Inmates can come into Bureau custody for civil contempt commitments in two ways:


(a) The U.S. Marshals Service may request a designation from the Bureau for a civil contempt commitment if local jails are not suitable due to medical, security or other reasons; or


(b) The committing court may specify a Bureau institution as the place of incarceration in its contempt order. We will designate the facility specified in the court order unless there is a reason for not placing the inmate in that facility.
