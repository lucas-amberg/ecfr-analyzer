# ยง 523.44   Application of FSA Time Credits.

(a) *How Time Credits may be applied.* For any inmate eligible to earn FSA Time Credits under this subpart who is:


(1) Sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the U.S. Code, the Bureau may apply FSA Time Credits toward prerelease custody or supervised release as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.


(2) Subject to a final order of removal under immigration laws as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17) (*see* 18 U.S.C. 3632(d)(4)(E)), the Bureau may not apply FSA Time Credits toward prerelease custody or early transfer to supervised release.


(3) Serving a term of imprisonment pursuant to a conviction for an offense under laws other than the U.S. Code (see Section 105 of the FSA, Pub. L. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5214 (not codified; included as note to 18 U.S.C. 3621)), the Bureau may not apply FSA Time Credits toward prerelease custody or early transfer to supervised release. This paragraph (a)(3) will not bar the application of FSA Time Credits, as authorized by the DC Code, for those serving a term of imprisonment for an offense under the DC Code.


(b) *Consideration for application of FSA Time Credits.* Where otherwise permitted by this subpart, the Bureau may apply FSA Time Credits toward prerelease custody or early transfer to supervised release under 18 U.S.C. 3624(g) only if an eligible inmate has:


(1) Earned FSA Time Credits in an amount that is equal to the remainder of the inmate's imposed term of imprisonment;


(2) Shown through the periodic risk reassessments a demonstrated recidivism risk reduction or maintained a minimum or low recidivism risk, during the term of imprisonment; and


(3) Had the remainder of his or her imposed term of imprisonment computed under applicable law.


(c) *Prerelease custody.* The Bureau may apply earned FSA Time Credits toward prerelease custody only when an eligible inmate has, in addition to satisfying the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section:


(1) Maintained a minimum or low recidivism risk through his or her last two risk and needs assessments; or


(2) Had a petition to be transferred to prerelease custody or supervised release approved by the Warden, after the Warden's determination that:


(i) The prisoner would not be a danger to society if transferred to prerelease custody or supervised release;


(ii) The prisoner has made a good faith effort to lower their recidivism risk through participation in recidivism reduction programs or productive activities; and


(iii) The prisoner is unlikely to recidivate.


(d) *Transfer to supervised release.* The Bureau may apply FSA Time Credits toward early transfer to supervised release under 18 U.S.C. 3624(g) only when an eligible inmate has, in addition to satisfying the criteria in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:


(1) An eligible inmate has maintained a minimum or low recidivism risk through his or her last risk and needs assessment;


(2) An eligible inmate has a term of supervised release after imprisonment included as part of his or her sentence as imposed by the sentencing court; and


(3) The application of FSA Time Credits would result in transfer to supervised release no earlier than 12 months before the date that transfer to supervised release would otherwise have occurred.
