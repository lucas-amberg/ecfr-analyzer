# § 541.4   Loss of good conduct sentence credit as a mandatory sanction.

(a) You will lose good conduct sentence credit as a mandatory disciplinary sanction if you are in one of the following two groups:


(1) *VCCLEA-violent inmates.* The date of your U.S. Code offense was on or after September 13, 1994, but before April 26, 1996, and you committed a “crime of violence” as defined by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA); or


(2) *PLRA inmates and DC Code offenders.* The date of your U.S. Code offense was on or after April 26, 1996, and, therefore, under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), or the date of your District of Columbia (DC) Code offense was on or after August 5, 2000.


(b) If you are an inmate in one of the above groups and commit a prohibited act, you will lose good conduct sentence credit as a mandatory disciplinary sanction. The amount of good conduct sentence credit you will lose depends on the severity level of the prohibited act(s) committed, as follows:


(1) *Greatest Severity Level Offenses.* You will lose at least 41 days, or 75% of available credit if less than 54 days are available for the prorated period, for each act committed.


(2) *High Severity Level Offenses.* You will lose at least 27 days, or 50% of available credit if less than 54 days are available for the prorated period, for each act committed.


(3) *Moderate Severity Level Offenses.* You will lose at least 14 days, or 25% of available credit if less than 54 days are available for the prorated period, after committing two or more Moderate severity acts during the current year of your good conduct sentence credit availability.


(4) *Low Severity Level Offenses.* You will lose at least 7 days, or 12.5% of available credit if less than 54 days are available for the prorated period, after committing three or more Low severity acts during the current year of your good conduct sentence credit availability.
