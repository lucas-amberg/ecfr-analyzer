# § 544.52   Levels of Occupational Education Programs.

Occupational education programs are offered at the certificate level and the classroom level. Each level may include the following types of training:


(a) *Exploratory Training.* Exploratory training is a study of occupations and industries for the purpose of providing the student with a general knowledge of the occupation and the world of work, rather than specific skill development.


(b) *Marketable Training.* Marketable training provides specific entry-level or advanced job skills. Marketable training may include “live work”, that is, the training would result in a product or service produced by the inmate for actual use by the institution, FPI, another federal agency, or community service project.


(c) *Apprentice Training.* Apprentice training provides an inmate the opportunity to participate in training which prepares the inmate for employment in various trades through structured apprenticeship programs approved at the state and national levels by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, U.S. Department of Labor.
