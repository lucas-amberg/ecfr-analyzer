# ยง 550.42   Procedures for urine surveillance.

(a) Contractor authorized personnel of the same sex as the inmate must witness collection of the inmate's urine sample. Inmates may not be involved in the collection, recording, mailing, or processing of the test results.


(b) If an inmate fails to provide a urine sample within two hours of a request for it, center staff may file a disciplinary report. To eliminate the possibility of diluted or adulterated samples, center staff shall keep the inmate under direct supervision during this two-hour period.


(c) Center staff shall have each positive urine test validated to substantiate the positive result. Center staff shall file a disciplinary report if the inmate's urine test shows a positive result for the presence of drugs which the inmate cannot satisfactorily justify to center staff.


(d) The results of disciplinary hearings and a copy of positive urine testing results which the inmate cannot satisfactorily justify to center staff shall be sent to the appropriate Regional U.S. Parole Commission Office, the Community Programs Manager (CPM), and the U.S. Probation Office.
