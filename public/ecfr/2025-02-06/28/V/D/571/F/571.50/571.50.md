# ยง 571.50   Purpose and scope.

This subpart establishes procedures for processing a fine, or fine and costs ordered by the court with respect to an inmate convicted of an offense committed before November 1, 1987. When the court orders a prisoner's confinement until payment of a fine, or fine and costs under 18 U.S.C. 3565, the Bureau of Prisons shall confine that inmate until the fine, or fine and costs are paid, unless the inmate qualifies for release under 18 U.S.C. 3569.


(a) An inmate held on the sole basis of his/her inability to pay such fine, or fine and costs, and whose non-exempt property does not exceed $20.00 may request discharge from imprisonment on the basis of indigency (see 18 U.S.C. 3569).


(b) Under 18 U.S.C. 3569, the determination of indigency may be made by a U.S. Magistrate Judge. Where the U.S. Magistrate Judge makes a finding of non-indigency based on the inmate's application for a determination of his ability to pay the committed fine, or fine and costs, staff shall refer the application to the appropriate United States Attorney for the purpose of making a final decision on the inmate's discharge under 18 U.S.C. 3569. It is to be noted that 18 U.S.C. 3569 provides for confining an inmate for nonpayment of a committed fine, or fine and costs.
