# § 700.22   Request for accounting of record disclosures.

(a) An individual may request the Office to provide him with an accounting of those other agencies to which the Office has disclosed the record, and the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure. A request for an accounting must be made in writing and must identify the particular record for which the accounting is requested. The request also must be addressed to the Office and both the envelope and the request itself must clearly be marked: “Privacy Act Accounting Request.” 


(b) The Office shall not be required to provide an accounting to an individual to the extent that the accounting relates to—


(1) Records for which no accounting must be kept pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(1), 


(2) Disclosures of records to law-enforcement agencies for lawful law-enforcement activities, pursuant to written requests from such law-enforcement agencies specifying records sought and the law-enforcement activities for which the records are sought, under 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (b)(7), or 


(3) Records for which an accounting need not be disclosed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) or (k). 


(c) A denial of a request for an accounting may be appealed to Independent Counsel in the same manner as a denial of a request for access, with both the envelope and the letter of appeal itself clearly marked: “Privacy Act Accounting Appeal.”
