# ยง 803.3   Use of the seal.

(a) Each Agency's seal is used by that Agency's staff for official Agency business as approved by the appropriate Director or designee in accordance with all subparts of 28 CFR 803.3.


(b) Use of the Agency seal by any person or organization outside of the Agency may be made only with the appropriate prior written approval.


(1) Any request for such use must be made in writing to the Office of the General Counsel, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia, 633 Indiana Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20004, and must specify, in detail, the exact use to be made. Any permission granted by the appropriate Director or designee applies only to the specific use for which it was granted and is not to be construed as permission for any other use.


(2) The decision whether to grant such a request is made on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of all relevant factors, which may include: the benefit or cost to the government of granting the request; the unintended appearance of endorsement or authentication by the Agency; the potential for misuse; the effect upon Agency security; the reputability of the use; the extent of the control by the Agency over the ultimate use; and the extent of control by the Agency over distribution of any products or publications bearing the Agency seal.


(c) Falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering the Agency seal or reproduction, or knowingly using or possessing with fraudulent intent an altered Agency seal or reproduction is punishable under 28 U.S.C. 506.


(d) Any person using the Agency seal or reproduction in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this part is subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1017, which states penalties for the wrongful use of an Agency seal, and other provisions of law as applicable.
