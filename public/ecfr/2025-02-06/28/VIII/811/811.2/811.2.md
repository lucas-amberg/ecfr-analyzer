(a) Sex offender registration requirements apply to all persons who live, reside, work, or attend school in the District of Columbia, and who: 


(1) committed a registration offense on or after July 11, 2000; 


(2) committed a registration offense at any time and were in custody or under supervision on or after July 11, 2000; 


(3) were required to register under the law of the District of Columbia as was in effect on July 10, 2000; or 


(4) committed a registration offense at any time in another jurisdiction and, within the registration period (see §§ 811.5 and 811.6), entered the District of Columbia to live, reside, work or attend school. 


(b) “Committed a registration offense” means that a person was found guilty or found not guilty by reason of insanity of a registration offense or was determined to be a sexual psychopath. Registration offenses are defined in section 2(8) of the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1999 (D.C. Official Code § 22-4001(8)), subject to the exceptions in section 17(b) of that Act (D.C. Official Code section 22-4016), and are listed descriptively in the Appendix to Part 811 (which also provides information on registration and notification classes). Any future revision to the statutory provisions designating registration offenses will be effective notwithstanding the timing of any conforming revision of these regulations, including the Appendix.
