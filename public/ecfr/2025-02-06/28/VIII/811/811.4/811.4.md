# ยง 811.4   Determination of the obligation to register and the length of registration.

(a) If the Superior Court finds that a person committed a registration offense, the Superior Court enters an order certifying that the person is a sex offender and that the person is subject to registration for a prescribed period of time (see ยง 811.6). 


(b) If a court order has not been entered certifying that a person is a sex offender and that the person is subject to registration for a prescribed period of time, CSOSA makes those determinations. CSOSA also determines the notification classification if the Court has not done so. Facts on which CSOSA's determination may be based include: 


(1) The offense or offenses of conviction (or finding of not guilty by reason of insanity) or a determination that the person is a sexual psychopath; 


(2) For certain offenses, facts that may not be apparent on the face of the conviction (or finding of not guilty by reason of insanity), such as:


(i) the age of the victim; 


(ii) whether force was involved; or 


(iii) whether the offense involved an undercover law enforcement officer who was believed to be an adult; 


(3) Prior criminal history; 


(4) For an offense committed in or prosecuted under the law of another jurisdiction, whether the offense involved conduct that was the same as or substantially similar to a District of Columbia registration offense; and 


(5) The amount of time that has elapsed as computed under ยง 811.6.
