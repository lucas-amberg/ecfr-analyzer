# ยง 811.5   Commencement of the obligation to register.

(a) A sex offender's obligation to register starts when the sex offender is found guilty or not guilty by reason of insanity of a registration offense or is determined to be a sexual psychopath. However, CSOSA may suspend registration requirements during any period of time in which a sex offender is detained, incarcerated, confined, civilly committed, or hospitalized in a secure facility. 


(b) A sex offender must register if the sex offender is placed on probation, parole, supervised release, or convalescent leave, is conditionally or unconditionally released from a secure facility, is granted unaccompanied grounds privileges or other unaccompanied leave, absconds or escapes, is otherwise not detained, incarcerated, confined, civilly committed, or hospitalized in a secure facility, or enters the District of Columbia from another jurisdiction to live, reside, work, or attend school. Registration shall be effectuated as provided in ยง 811.7 and may be carried out prior to the occurrence of a circumstance described in this paragraph, including the release of or granting of leave to a sex offender.
