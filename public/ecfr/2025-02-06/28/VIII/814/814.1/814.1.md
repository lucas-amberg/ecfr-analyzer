(ii) Debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 1 *et seq.*);


(iii) Debts arising under the tariff laws of the United States;


(iv) Any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (*e.g.,* travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108); or
