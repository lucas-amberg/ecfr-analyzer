On an annual basis, each Federal agency using wage determinations under the Davis-Bacon Act or any of the laws referenced by ยง 5.1 of this subtitle, must furnish the Administrator with a report that contains a general outline of its proposed construction programs for the upcoming 3 fiscal years based on information in the Federal agency's possession at the time it furnishes its report. This report must include a list of proposed projects (including those for which options to extend the contract term of an existing construction contract are expected during the period covered by the report); the estimated start date of construction; the anticipated type or types of construction; the estimated cost of construction; the location or locations of construction; and any other project-specific information that the Administrator requests. The report must also include notification of any significant changes to previously reported construction programs, such as the delay or cancellation of previously reported projects. Reports must be submitted no later than April 10 of each year by email to *DavisBaconFedPlan@dol.gov*, and must include the name, telephone number, and email address of the official responsible for coordinating the submission.
