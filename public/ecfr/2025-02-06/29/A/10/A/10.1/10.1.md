# § 10.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Purpose.* This part contains the Department of Labor's rules relating to the administration of Executive Order 13658 (Executive Order or the Order), “Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors,” and implements the enforcement provisions of the Executive Order. The Executive Order assigns responsibility for investigating potential violations of and obtaining compliance with the Executive Order to the Department of Labor. The Executive Order states that the Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are promoted when the Federal Government contracts with sources that adequately compensate their workers. There is evidence that raising the pay of low-wage workers can increase their morale and productivity and the quality of their work, lower turnover and its accompanying costs, and reduce supervisory costs. The Executive Order thus states that cost savings and quality improvements in the work performed by parties who contract with the Federal Government will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Government procurement. Executive Order 13658 therefore generally requires that the hourly minimum wage paid by contractors to workers performing on or in connection with covered contracts with the Federal Government shall be at least:


(1) $10.10 per hour, beginning January 1, 2015; and


(2) An amount determined by the Secretary of Labor, beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter.


(b) *Policy.* Executive Order 13658 sets forth a general position of the Federal Government that increasing the hourly minimum wage paid by Federal contractors to $10.10 will increase efficiency and cost savings for the Federal Government. The Executive Order therefore establishes a minimum wage requirement for Federal contractors and subcontractors. The Order provides that executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that new covered contracts, contract-like instruments, and solicitations (collectively referred to as “contracts”) include a clause, which the contractor and any subcontractors shall incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, as a condition of payment, that the minimum wage to be paid to workers, including workers whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c), in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, shall be at least:


(1) $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2015; and


(2) Beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary pursuant to the Order. Nothing in Executive Order 13658 or this part shall excuse noncompliance with any applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law or any applicable law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under the Order.


(c) *Scope.* Neither Executive Order 13658 nor this part creates or changes any rights under the Contract Disputes Act or any private right of action. The Executive Order provides that disputes regarding whether a contractor has paid the minimum wages prescribed by the Order, to the extent permitted by law, shall be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary in regulations issued under the Order. However, nothing in the Order or this part is intended to limit or preclude a civil action under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3730, or criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001. The Order similarly does not preclude judicial review of final decisions by the Secretary in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 *et seq.*

(d) *Relation to Executive Order 14026.* As of January 30, 2022, Executive Order 13658 is superseded to the extent that it is inconsistent with Executive Order 14026 of April 27, 2021, “Increasing the Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors,” and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 23. A covered contract that is entered into on or after January 30, 2022, or that is renewed or extended (pursuant to an option or otherwise) on or after January 30, 2022, is generally subject to the higher minimum wage rate established by Executive Order 14026 and its regulations at 29 CFR part 23.
