# Appendix A to Part 13—Contract Clause


The following clause shall be included by the contracting agency in every contract, contract-like instrument, and solicitation to which Executive Order 13706 applies, except for procurement contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR):


(a) *Executive Order 13706.* This contract is subject to Executive Order 13706, the regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor in 29 CFR part 13 pursuant to the Executive Order, and the following provisions.


(b) *Paid Sick Leave.* (1) The contractor shall permit each employee (as defined in 29 CFR 13.2) engaged in the performance of this contract by the prime contractor or any subcontractor, regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between the contractor and employee, to earn not less than 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. The contractor shall additionally allow accrual and use of paid sick leave as required by Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13. The contractor shall in particular comply with the accrual, use, and other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 13.5 and 13.6, which are incorporated by reference in this contract.


(2) The contractor shall provide paid sick leave to all employees when due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by 29 CFR 13.24), rebate, or kickback on any account. The contractor shall provide pay and benefits for paid sick leave used no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the paid sick leave was taken.


(3) The prime contractor and any upper-tier subcontractor shall be responsible for the compliance by any subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor with the requirements of Executive Order 13706, 29 CFR part 13, and this clause.


(c) *Withholding.* The contracting officer shall, upon its own action or upon written request of an authorized representative of the Department of Labor, withhold or cause to be withheld from the prime contractor under this or any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay employees the full amount owed to compensate for any violation of the requirements of Executive Order 13706, 29 CFR part 13, or this clause, including any pay and/or benefits denied or lost by reason of the violation; other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, and liquidated damages.


(d) *Contract Suspension/Contract Termination/Contractor Debarment.* In the event of a failure to comply with Executive Order 13706, 29 CFR part 13, or this clause, the contracting agency may on its own action or after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the contractor in default with any additional cost. A breach of the contract clause may be grounds for debarment as a contractor and subcontractor as provided in 29 CFR 13.52.


(e) The paid sick leave required by Executive Order 13706, 29 CFR part 13, and this clause is in addition to a contractor's obligations under the Service Contract Act and Davis-Bacon Act, and a contractor may not receive credit toward its prevailing wage or fringe benefit obligations under those Acts for any paid sick leave provided in satisfaction of the requirements of Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13.


(f) Nothing in Executive Order 13706 or 29 CFR part 13 shall excuse noncompliance with or supersede any applicable Federal or State law, any applicable law or municipal ordinance, or a collective bargaining agreement requiring greater paid sick leave or leave rights than those established under Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13.


(g) *Recordkeeping.* (1) Any contractor performing work subject to Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13 must make and maintain, for no less than three (3) years from the completion of the work on the contract, records containing the information specified in paragraphs (i) through (xv) of this section for each employee and shall make them available for inspection, copying, and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor:


(i) Name, address, and Social Security number of each employee;


(ii) The employee's occupation(s) or classification(s);


(iii) The rate or rates of wages paid (including all pay and benefits provided);


(iv) The number of daily and weekly hours worked;


(v) Any deductions made;


(vi) The total wages paid (including all pay and benefits provided) each pay period;


(vii) A copy of notifications to employees of the amount of paid sick leave the employee has accrued, as required under 29 CFR 13.5(a)(2);


(viii) A copy of employees' requests to use paid sick leave, if in writing, or, if not in writing, any other records reflecting such employee requests;


(ix) Dates and amounts of paid sick leave taken by employees (unless a contractor's paid time off policy satisfies the requirements of Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13 as described in § 13.5(f)(5), leave must be designated in records as paid sick leave pursuant to Executive Order 13706);


(x) A copy of any written responses to employees' requests to use paid sick leave, including explanations for any denials of such requests, as required under 29 CFR 13.5(d)(3);


(xi) Any records reflecting the certification and documentation a contractor may require an employee to provide under 29 CFR 13.5(e), including copies of any certification or documentation provided by an employee;


(xii) Any other records showing any tracking of or calculations related to an employee's accrual or use of paid sick leave;


(xiii) The relevant covered contract;


(xiv) The regular pay and benefits provided to an employee for each use of paid sick leave; and


(xv) Any financial payment made for unused paid sick leave upon a separation from employment intended, pursuant to 29 CFR 13.5(b)(5), to relieve a contractor from the obligation to reinstate such paid sick leave as otherwise required by 29 CFR 13.5(b)(4).


(2)(i) If a contractor wishes to distinguish between an employee's covered and non-covered work, the contractor must keep records or other proof reflecting such distinctions. Only if the contractor adequately segregates the employee's time will time spent on non-covered work be excluded from hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. Similarly, only if that contractor adequately segregates the employee's time may a contractor properly refuse an employee's request to use paid sick leave on the ground that the employee was scheduled to perform non-covered work during the time she asked to use paid sick leave.


(ii) If a contractor estimates covered hours worked by an employee who performs work in connection with covered contracts pursuant to 29 CFR 13.5(a)(i) or (iii), the contractor must keep records or other proof of the verifiable information on which such estimates are reasonably based. Only if the contractor relies on an estimate that is reasonable and based on verifiable information will an employee's time spent in connection with non-covered work be excluded from hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. If a contractor estimates the amount of time an employee spends performing in connection with covered contracts, the contractor must permit the employee to use her paid sick leave during any work time for the contractor.


(3) In the event a contractor is not obligated by the Service Contract Act, the Davis-Bacon Act, or the Fair Labor Standards Act to keep records of an employee's hours worked, such as because the employee is exempt from the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime requirements, and the contractor chooses to use the assumption permitted by 29 CFR 13.5(a)(1)(iii), the contractor is excused from the requirement in paragraph (1)(d) of this section to keep records of the employee's number of daily and weekly hours worked.


(4)(i) Records relating to medical histories or domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, created for purposes of Executive Order 13706, whether of an employee or an employee's child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, or other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship, shall be maintained as confidential records in separate files/records from the usual personnel files.


(ii) If the confidentiality requirements of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) apply to records or documents created to comply with the recordkeeping requirements in this contract clause, the records and documents must also be maintained in compliance with the confidentiality requirements of the GINA, section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or ADA as described in 29 CFR 1635.9, 41 CFR 60-741.23(d), and 29 CFR 1630.14(c)(1), respectively.


(iii) The contractor shall not disclose any documentation used to verify the need to use 3 or more consecutive days of paid sick leave for the purposes listed in 29 CFR 13.5(c)(1)(iv) (as described in 29 CFR 13.5(e)(1)(ii)) and shall maintain confidentiality about any domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking, unless the employee consents or when disclosure is required by law.


(5) The contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours.


(6) Nothing in this contract clause limits or otherwise modifies the contractor's recordkeeping obligations, if any, under the Davis-Bacon Act, the Service Contract Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, Executive Order 13658, their respective implementing regulations, or any other applicable law.


(h) The contractor (as defined in 29 CFR 13.2) shall insert this clause in all of its covered subcontracts and shall require its subcontractors to include this clause in any covered lower-tier subcontracts.


(i) *Certification of Eligibility.* (1) By entering into this contract, the contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has an interest in the contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed pursuant to section 5 of the Service Contract Act, section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act, or 29 CFR 5.12(a)(1).


(2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm whose name appears on the list of persons or firms ineligible to receive Federal contracts currently maintained on the System for Award Management Web site, *http://www.SAM.gov*.


(3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.


(j) *Interference/Discrimination.* (1) A contractor may not in any manner interfere with an employee's accrual or use of paid sick leave as required by Executive Order 13706 or 29 CFR part 13. Interference includes, but is not limited to, miscalculating the amount of paid sick leave an employee has accrued, denying or unreasonably delaying a response to a proper request to use paid sick leave, discouraging an employee from using paid sick leave, reducing an employee's accrued paid sick leave by more than the amount of such leave used, transferring an employee to work on non-covered contracts to prevent the accrual or use of paid sick leave, disclosing confidential information contained in certification or other documentation provided to verify the need to use paid sick leave, or making the use of paid sick leave contingent on the employee's finding a replacement worker or the fulfillment of the contractor's operational needs.


(2) A contractor may not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee for:


(i) Using, or attempting to use, paid sick leave as provided for under Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13;


(ii) Filing any complaint, initiating any proceeding, or otherwise asserting any right or claim under Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13;


(iii) Cooperating in any investigation or testifying in any proceeding under Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13; or


(iv) Informing any other person about his or her rights under Executive Order 13706 and 29 CFR part 13.


(k) *Waiver.* Employees cannot waive, nor may contractors induce employees to waive, their rights under Executive Order 13706, 29 CFR part 13, or this clause.


(l) *Notice.* The contractor must notify all employees performing work on or in connection with a covered contract of the paid sick leave requirements of Executive Order 13706, 29 CFR part 13, and this clause by posting a notice provided by the Department of Labor in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite so it may be readily seen by employees. Contractors that customarily post notices to employees electronically may post the notice electronically, provided such electronic posting is displayed prominently on any Web site that is maintained by the contractor, whether external or internal, and customarily used for notices to employees about terms and conditions of employment.


(m) *Disputes concerning labor standards.* Disputes related to the application of Executive Order 13706 to this contract shall not be subject to the general disputes clause of the contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 13. Disputes within the meaning of this contract clause include disputes between the contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives.
