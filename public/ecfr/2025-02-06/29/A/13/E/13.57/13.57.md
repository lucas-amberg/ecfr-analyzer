# § 13.57   Administrative Review Board proceedings.

(a) *Authority*—(1) *General.* The Administrative Review Board has jurisdiction to hear and decide in its discretion appeals concerning questions of law and fact from investigative findings letters of the Administrator issued under § 13.51(c)(1) or the final sentence of § 13.51(c)(2)(ii), Administrator's rulings issued under § 13.58, and decisions of Administrative Law Judges issued under § 13.55.


(2) *Limit on scope of review.* (i) The Administrative Review Board shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of any provision of this part. The Administrative Review Board is an appellate body and shall decide cases properly before it on the basis of substantial evidence contained in the entire record before it. The Administrative Review Board shall not receive new evidence into the record.


(ii) The Equal Access to Justice Act, as amended, does not apply to proceedings under this part. Accordingly, the Administrative Review Board shall have no authority to award attorney's fees and/or other litigation expenses pursuant to the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act for any proceeding under this part.


(b) *Decisions.* The Administrative Review Board's decision shall be issued within a reasonable period of time following receipt of the petition for review and shall be served upon all parties by mail to the last known address and on the Chief Administrative Law Judge (in cases involving an appeal from an Administrative Law Judge's decision).


(c) *Orders.* If the Board concludes a violation occurred, an order shall be issued mandating action to remedy the violation, including, but not limited to, any monetary or equitable relief described in § 13.44. Where the Administrator has sought imposition of debarment, the Administrative Review Board shall determine whether an order imposing debarment is appropriate. The ARB's order is subject to discretionary review by the Secretary as provided in Secretary's Order 01-2020 (or any successor to that order).
