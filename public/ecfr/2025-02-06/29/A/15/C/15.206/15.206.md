# ยง 15.206   What claims arising at a residence or Telework location may be covered under the MPCECA?

(a) Claims arising at a residence, Telework center or other flexiplace location may be covered under the MPCECA.


(b) For the purpose of this subpart, residence means a house, apartment or other location that is a Department employee's principal abode.


(c) Claims for property damage at an alternative work location at which the employee is performing duties pursuant to an approved Telework agreement may be covered by the MPCECA if the property was being used incident to service with the Department, as, for the purposes of this subpart, that location is considered to be an official duty station. Under most circumstances, property damage will only be allowed if it occurs at or in connection with the employee's workstation.


(d) Claims under the MPCECA at a residence not covered by paragraph (c) of this section may be allowable for damage to, or loss of, property arising from fire, flood, hurricane, other natural disaster, theft, or other unusual occurrence, if the property was being used incident to service with the Department, while such property is located at:


(1) Residences within the 50 States or the District of Columbia that were assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in kind by the United States; or


(2) Residences outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia that were occupied by the claimant, whether or not they were assigned or otherwise provided in kind by the United States, except when the claimant is a civilian employee who is a local inhabitant; or


(3) Any warehouse, office, working area or other place (except residences) authorized or apparently authorized for the reception or storage of property.
