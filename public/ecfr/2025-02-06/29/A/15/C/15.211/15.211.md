# ยง 15.211   How is a claim under this subpart processed?

(a) The Counsel for Claims and Compensation, the Regional Solicitors, and the Associate Regional Solicitors are authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise and settle claims filed under this subpart that arise within their respective jurisdictions, except that any claim for an amount in excess of $25,000 shall fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Counsel for Claims and Compensation.


(b) Any writing received by the Office of the Solicitor within the time limits set forth in ยง 15.203 will be accepted and considered a claim under the MPCECA if it constitutes a demand for compensation from the Department. A sample claim, located on the Department's Office of the Solicitor, Federal Employees' and Energy Workers' Compensation Division Web site at *www.dol.gov,* is provided for convenience of filing. The SF-95 form used to file a claim under the FTCA is not an appropriate form for a claim under the MPCECA claim.


(c) A demand is not required to be for a specific sum of money.


(d) The determination upon the claim shall be provided to the claimant in writing by the deciding official.
