# § 18.72   Summary decision.

(a) *Motion for summary decision or partial summary decision.* A party may move for summary decision, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary decision is sought. The judge shall grant summary decision if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to decision as a matter of law. The judge should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.


(b) *Time to file a motion.* Unless the judge orders otherwise, a party may file a motion for summary decision at any time until 30 days before the date fixed for the formal hearing.


(c) *Procedures*—(1) *Supporting factual positions.* A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:


(i) Citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or


(ii) Showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.


(2) *Objection that a fact is not supported by admissible evidence.* A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.


(3) *Materials not cited.* The judge need consider only the cited materials, but the judge may consider other materials in the record.


(4) *Affidavits or declarations.* An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.


(d) *When facts are unavailable to the nonmovant.* If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the judge may:


(1) Defer considering the motion or deny it;


(2) Allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or


(3) Issue any other appropriate order.


(e) *Failing to properly support or address a fact.* If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by paragraph (c) of this section, the judge may:


(1) Give an opportunity to properly support or address the fact;


(2) Consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion;


(3) Grant summary decision if the motion and supporting materials—including the facts considered undisputed—show that the movant is entitled to it; or


(4) Issue any other appropriate order.


(f) *Decision independent of the motion.* After giving notice and a reasonable time to respond, the judge may:


(1) Grant summary decision for a nonmovant;


(2) Grant the motion on grounds not raised by a party; or


(3) Consider summary decision on the judge's own after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.


(g) *Failing to grant all the requested relief.* If the judge does not grant all the relief requested by the motion, the judge may enter an order stating any material fact—including an item of damages or other relief—that is not genuinely in dispute and treating the fact as established in the case.


(h) *Affidavit or declaration submitted in bad faith.* If satisfied that an affidavit or declaration under this section is submitted in bad faith or solely for delay, the judge—after notice and a reasonable time to respond—may order sanctions or other relief as authorized by law.
