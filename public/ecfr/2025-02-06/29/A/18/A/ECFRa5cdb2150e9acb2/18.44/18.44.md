# § 18.44   Prehearing conference.

(a) *In general.* The judge, with or without a motion, may order one or more prehearing conferences for such purposes as:


(1) Expediting disposition of the proceeding;


(2) Establishing early and continuing control so that the case will not be protracted because of lack of management;


(3) Discouraging wasteful prehearing activities;


(4) Improving the quality of the hearing through more thorough preparation; and


(5) Facilitating settlement.


(b) *Scheduling.* Prehearing conferences may be conducted in person, by telephone, or other means after reasonable notice of time, place and manner of conference has been given.










(c) *Participation.* All parties must participate in prehearing conferences as directed by the judge. A represented party must authorize at least one of its attorneys or representatives to make stipulations and admissions about all matters that can reasonably be anticipated for discussion at the prehearing conference, including possible settlement.


(d) *Matters for consideration.* At the conference, the judge may consider and take appropriate actions on the following matters:


(1) Formulating and simplifying the issues, and eliminating frivolous claims or defenses;


(2) Amending the papers that had framed the issues before the matter was referred for hearing;


(3) Obtaining admissions and stipulations about facts and documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and ruling in advance on the admissibility of evidence;


(4) Avoiding unnecessary proof and cumulative evidence, and limiting the number of expert or other witnesses;


(5) Determining the appropriateness and timing of dispositive motions under §§ 18.70 and 18.72;


(6) Controlling and scheduling discovery, including orders affecting disclosures and discovery under §§ 18.50 through 18.65;


(7) Identifying witnesses and documents, scheduling the filing and exchange of any exhibits and prehearing submissions, and setting dates for further conferences and for the hearing;


(8) Referring matters to a special master;


(9) Settling the case and using special procedures to assist in resolving the dispute such as the settlement judge procedure under § 18.13, private mediation, and other means authorized by statute or regulation;


(10) Determining the form and content of prehearing orders;


(11) Disposing of pending motions;


(12) Adopting special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted proceedings that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or unusual proof problems;


(13) Consolidating or ordering separate hearings under § 18.43;


(14) Ordering the presentation of evidence early in the proceeding on a manageable issue that might, on the evidence, be the basis for disposing of the proceeding;


(15) Establishing a reasonable limit on the time allowed to present evidence; and


(16) Facilitating in other ways the just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of the proceeding.


(e) *Reporting.* The judge may direct that the prehearing conference be recorded and transcribed. If the conference is not recorded, the judge should summarize the conference proceedings on the record at the hearing or by separate prehearing notice or order.
