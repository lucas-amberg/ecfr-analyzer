# § 18.95   Review of decision and review by the Secretary.

(a) *Review.* The statute or regulation that conferred hearing jurisdiction provides the procedure for review of a judge's decision. If the statute or regulation does not provide a procedure, the judge's decision becomes the Secretary's final administrative decision, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Finality.* A decision of the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA) shall constitute the Secretary's final administrative decision except in those cases over which the Secretary has, in accordance with this paragraph (b) and paragraph (c) of this section, assumed jurisdiction:


(1) In any case for which administrative review is sought or handled in accordance with 20 CFR 655.171(a) or 20 CFR 655.461, at any point from when the BALCA receives a request for review until the passage of 10 business days after the date on which BALCA has issued its decision.


(2) In any case for which a de novo hearing is sought or handled under 20 CFR 655.171(b), at any point within 15 business days after the date on which the BALCA has issued its decision.


(3) In any case for which review is sought or handled in accordance with 20 CFR 656.26 and 20 CFR 656.27, at any point from when the BALCA receives a request for review until the passage of 30 business days after the BALCA has issued its decision.


(c) *Review by the Secretary*—(1) *Transmission of information.* (i) Whenever the BALCA receives a request for review, it shall immediately transmit a copy of such request to the Deputy Secretary.


(ii) Within 3 business days of when the BALCA issues a decision, the Chair of the BALCA, or his or her designee, shall transmit to the Deputy Secretary a copy of the decision and a concise recommendation as to whether the decision involves an issue or issues of such exceptional importance that review by the Secretary is warranted.


(2) *Review.* (i) The Secretary may, at any point within the time periods provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, and in his or her sole discretion, assume jurisdiction to review the decision or determination of the Certifying Officer, the Office of Foreign Labor Certification Administrator, the National Prevailing Wage Center Director, or the BALCA, as the case may be.


(ii) When the Secretary assumes jurisdiction over a case, the Secretary shall promptly notify the BALCA. The BALCA shall promptly notify the parties to the case of such action and shall submit the Appeal File and any briefs filed to the Secretary.


(iii) In any case the Secretary decides, the Secretary's decision shall be stated in writing and transmitted to the BALCA, which shall promptly publish the decision and transmit it to the parties to the case. Such decision shall constitute final action by the Department and shall serve as binding precedent on all Department employees and in all Department proceedings involving the same issue or issues.


(iv) The Solicitor of Labor, or his or her designee, shall have the responsibility for providing legal advice to the Secretary with respect to the Secretary's exercise of review under this section, except that no individual involved in the investigation or prosecution of a case shall advise the Secretary on the exercise of review with respect to such case or a case involving a common nucleus of operative fact.
