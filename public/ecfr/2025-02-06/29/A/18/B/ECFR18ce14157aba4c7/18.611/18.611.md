# ยง 18.611   Mode and order of interrogation and presentation.

(a) *Control by judge.* The judge shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to: 


(1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth,


(2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and 


(3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.


(b) *Scope of cross-examination.* Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The judge may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.


(c) *Leading questions.* Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions.
