# ยง 18.403   Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of confusion or waste of time.

Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of confusion of issues, or misleading the judge as trier of fact, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
