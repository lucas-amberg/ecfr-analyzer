# ยง 2.11   General principles.

The following general principles will be observed in granting or denying requests for permission to cover hearings audiovisually: 


(a) Notice and comment and on-the-record rule making proceedings may involve administrative hearings. If such administrative hearings are held, we encourage their audiovisual coverage. 


(b) Audiovisual coverage shall be excluded in adjudicatory proceedings involving the rights or status of individuals (including those of small corporations likely to be indistinguishable in the public mind from one or a few individuals) in which an individual's past culpable conduct or other aspect of personal life is a primary subject of adjudication, and where the person in question objects to coverage. 


(c) Certain proceedings involve balancing of conflicting values in order to determine whether audiovisual coverage should be allowed. Where audiovisual coverage is restricted, the reasons for the restriction shall be stated in the record.
