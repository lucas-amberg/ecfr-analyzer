(b) *Notice to beneficiaries of programs supported by indirect Federal financial assistance.* The entity responsible for disbursing Federal funds as part of a program of indirect Federal financial assistance administered by DOL must give the written notice described in paragraph (c) of this section to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries.


(c) *Contents of the notice.* The required language for the written notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries is set forth in appendix C to this subpart. The notice includes the following:


(1) The organization may not discriminate against beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;


(2) The organization may not require beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;


(3) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;


(4) Beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries may report an organization's violation of these protections, including any denials of services or benefits by an organization, by contacting or filing a written complaint with DOL's Civil Rights Center, 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Room N-4123, Washington, DC 20210, or by email to *CRCExternalComplaints@dol.gov;* and


(5) Beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries may seek information about whether there are any other federally funded organizations that provide these kinds of services in their area by calling DOL's US2-JOBS helpline toll-free at 1-877-US2-JOBS (1-877-872-5627) or TTY 1-877-889-5627.


(d) *Timing.* The written notice set forth in appendix C to this subpart must be given to prospective beneficiaries before they enroll in the program or receive services from the program. The written notice may be incorporated into materials that are otherwise provided to prospective beneficiaries. When the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such written notice in advance of the actual service, organizations must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.
