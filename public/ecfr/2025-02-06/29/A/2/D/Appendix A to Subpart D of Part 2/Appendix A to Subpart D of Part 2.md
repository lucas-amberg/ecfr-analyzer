# Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 2â€”Notice or Announcement of Award Opportunities


(a) Faith-based organizations may apply for this award on the same basis as any other organization, subject to the protections and requirements of this subpart and any applicable constitutional and statutory requirements, including 42 U.S.C. 2000bb *et seq.* DOL will not, in the selection of recipients, discriminate for or against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to favor or disfavor a similarly situated secular organization.


(b) A faith-based organization that participates in this program will retain its independence from the Government and may continue to carry out its mission consistent with religious freedom and conscience protections in Federal law.


(c) A faith-based organization may not use direct Federal financial assistance to support or engage in any explicitly religious activities except where consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and any other applicable requirements. An organization receiving Federal financial assistance also may not, in providing services funded by DOL, or in conducting outreach activities related to such services, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.
