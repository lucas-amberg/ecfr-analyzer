Because this program is supported in whole or in part by financial assistance from the Federal Government, we are required to let you know that:


(1) We may not discriminate against you on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;


(2) We may not require you to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization) that are offered by our organization, and any participation by you in such activities must be purely voluntary;


(3) We must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization) from activities supported with direct Federal financial assistance;


(4) You may report violations of these protections, including any denials of services or benefits by an organization, by contacting or filing a written complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor's Civil Rights Center, 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Room N-4123, Washington, DC 20210, or by email to *CRCExternalComplaints@dol.gov;* and


(5) If you would like to seek information about whether there are any other federally funded organizations that provide these kinds of services in your area, please call toll-free 1-877-US2-JOBS (1-877-872-5627) or TTY 1-877-889-5627.


This written notice must be given to you before you enroll in the program or receive services from the program, unless the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such notice before we provide the actual service. In such an instance, this notice must be given to you at the earliest available opportunity.
