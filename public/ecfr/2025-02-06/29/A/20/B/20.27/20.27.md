# ยง 20.27   Cooperation with other DOL agencies and Federal agencies.

(a) Appropriate use should be made of the cooperative efforts of other DOL agencies and Federal agencies in effecting collection by administrative offset. Generally, agencies should comply with requests from other agencies to initiate administrative offset to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the requesting agency has not complied with the applicable regulations or the request would otherwise be contrary to law or the best interests of the United States.


(b) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, a DOL agency may request that monies due and payable to a debtor by another DOL agency or a Federal agency outside the Department be administratively offset in order to collect debts owed the creditor DOL agency by the debtor. In requesting an administrative offset, the creditor DOL agency must provide the DOL agency or other Federal agency holding funds of the debtor with written certification stating 


(1) That the debtor owes the creditor agency a debt (including the amount of debt); and 


(2) That the creditor agency has complied with the applicable Federal Claims Collection Standards, including any hearing or review.
