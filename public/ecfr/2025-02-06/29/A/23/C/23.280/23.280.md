# § 23.280   Tipped employees.

(a) *Payment of wages to tipped employees.* With respect to workers who are tipped employees as defined in § 23.20 and this section, the amount of wages paid to such employee by the employee's employer shall be equal to:


(1) An hourly cash wage of at least:


(i) $10.50 an hour beginning on January 30, 2022;


(ii) Beginning January 1, 2023, 85 percent of the wage in effect under section 2 of the Executive Order, rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05;


(iii) Beginning January 1, 2024, and for each subsequent year, 100 percent of the wage in effect under section 2 of the Executive Order; and


(2) An additional amount on account of the tips received by such employee (tip credit) which amount is equal to the difference between the hourly cash wage in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the wage in effect under section 2 of the Executive Order. Where tipped employees do not receive a sufficient amount of tips in the workweek to equal the amount of the tip credit, the employer must increase the cash wage paid for the workweek under paragraph (a)(1) of this section so that the amount of the cash wage paid and the tips received by the employee equal the minimum wage under section 2 of the Executive Order.


(3) An employer may pay a higher cash wage than required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and take a lower tip credit but may not pay a lower cash wage than required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and take a greater tip credit. In order for the employer to claim a tip credit, the employer must demonstrate that the worker received at least the amount of the credit claimed in actual tips. If the worker received less than the claimed tip credit amount in tips during the workweek, the employer is required to pay the balance on the regular payday so that the worker receives the wage in effect under section 2 of the Executive Order with the defined combination of wages and tips.


(4) If the cash wage required to be paid under the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701 *et seq.,* or any other applicable law or regulation is higher than the wage required by section 2 of the Executive Order, the employer shall pay additional cash wages equal to the difference between the wage in effect under section 2 of the Executive Order and the highest wage required to be paid.


(b) *Requirements with respect to tipped employees.* The definitions and requirements concerning tipped employees, the tip credit, the characteristics of tips, service charges, tip pooling, and notice set forth in 29 CFR 10.28(b) through (f) apply with respect to workers who are tipped employees, as defined in § 23.20, performing on or in connection with contracts covered under Executive Order 14026, except that the minimum required cash wage shall be the minimum required cash wage described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the purposes of Executive 14026. For the purposes of this section, where 29 CFR 10.28(b) through (f) uses the term “Executive Order,” that term refers to Executive Order 14026.
