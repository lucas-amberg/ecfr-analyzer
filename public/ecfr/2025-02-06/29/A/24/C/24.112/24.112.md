# ยง 24.112   Judicial review.

(a) Except as provided under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, within 60 days after the issuance of a final order (including a decision issued by the Secretary upon his or her discretionary review) for which judicial review is available, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the order may file a petition for review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of the violation. A final order of the ARB (or a decision issued by the Secretary upon his or her discretionary review) is not subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.


(b) Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, within 120 days after the issuance of a final order (including a decision issued by the Secretary upon his or her discretionary review) for which judicial review is available, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the order may file a petition for review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of the violation.


(c) Under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, within 90 days after the issuance of a final order (including a decision issued by the Secretary upon his or her discretionary review) for which judicial review is available, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the order may file a petition for review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of the violation.


(d) Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, after the issuance of a final order (including a decision issued by the Secretary upon his or her discretionary review) for which judicial review is available, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the order may file a petition for review of the order in the United States district court in which the violation allegedly occurred. For purposes of judicial economy and consistency, when a final order under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act also is issued under any other statute listed in ยง 24.100(a), the adversely affected or aggrieved person may file a petition for review of the entire order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of the violation. The time for filing a petition for review of an order issued under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and any other statute listed in ยง 24.100(a) is determined by the time period applicable under the other statute(s).


(e) If a timely petition for review is filed, the record of a case, including the record of proceedings before the administrative law judge, will be transmitted by the ARB or the ALJ, as appropriate, to the appropriate court pursuant to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the local rules of the court.
