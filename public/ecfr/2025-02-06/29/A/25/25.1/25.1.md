# ยง 25.1   Purpose and scope.

These procedures govern the nomination of arbitrators by the Secretary to perform the advisory functions specified under section 11 of Executive Order 10988. Any arbitrators so nominated will be available for either or both of the following purposes: 


(a) To investigate the facts and issue an advisory decision with respect to the appropriateness of a unit of Federal employees for the purpose of exclusive recognition and as to related issues submitted for consideration; or 


(b) To determine and advise whether an employee organization represents a majority of employees in an appropriate unit by conducting or supervising an election (wherein a majority of those voting, provided there is a representative vote, cast their ballots for or against representation), or by other appropriate means. A request for a nomination will be considered as contemplating the performance of functions within the above categories if it specifies as a purpose obtaining an advisory decision on one or more questions involved in a unit determination or determination of majority status, such as an advisory decision on the eligibility of voters or the right to appear on the ballot, arising in connection with an election to be held, or on a question relating to matters affecting the results of an election which took place after the agreement to conduct the election had been entered into, provided such conduct materially affected the results of the election. Subject to compliance with these procedures, the Secretary will nominate an arbitrator whenever he is so requested by an agency or by an employee organization which is seeking recognition as the exclusive representative of Federal employees in a prima facie appropriate unit and which meets all the prerequisites for seeking such recognition.
