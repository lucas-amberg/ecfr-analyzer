# § 30.3   Equal opportunity standards applicable to all sponsors.

(a)(1) *Discrimination prohibited.* It is unlawful for a sponsor of a registered apprenticeship program to discriminate against an apprentice or applicant for apprenticeship on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability with regard to:


(i) Recruitment, outreach, and selection procedures;


(ii) Hiring and/or placement, upgrading, periodic advancement, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;


(iii) Rotation among work processes;

(x) Any other benefit, term, condition, or privilege associated with apprenticeship.


(2) *Discrimination standards and defenses.* (i) *Race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or sexual orientation.* In implementing this section, the Registration Agency will look to the legal standards and defenses applied under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e *et seq.* and Executive Order 11246, as applicable, in determining whether a sponsor has engaged in a practice unlawful under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(ii) *Disability.* With respect to discrimination based on a disability, the Registration Agency will apply the same standards, defenses, and exceptions to the definition of disability as those set forth in title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12112 and 12113, as amended, and the implementing regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) at 29 CFR part 1630, which include, among other things, the standards governing reasonable accommodation, medical examinations and disability-related inquiries, qualification standards, and direct threat defense. The Interpretive Guidance on title I of the ADA set out as an appendix to part 1630 issued pursuant to title I may be relied upon for guidance in complying with the nondiscrimination requirements of this part with respect to the treatment of individuals with disabilities.


(iii) *Age.* The Registration Agency will apply the same standards and defenses for age discrimination as those set forth in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. 623, and the implementing regulations promulgated by the EEOC at 29 CFR part 1625.




(iv) *Genetic information.* The Registration Agency will apply the same standards and defenses for discrimination based on genetic information as those set forth in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), 42 U.S.C. 2000ff *et seq.* and the implementing regulations promulgated by the EEOC at 29 CFR part 1635.


(b) *General duty to engage in affirmative action.* For each registered apprenticeship program, a sponsor is required to take affirmative steps to provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship. These steps must include:


(1) *Assignment of responsibility.* The sponsor will designate an individual or individuals with appropriate authority under the program, such as an apprenticeship coordinator, to be responsible and accountable for overseeing its commitment to equal opportunity in registered apprenticeship, including the development and implementation of an affirmative action program as required by § 30.4. The individual(s) must have the resources, support of, and access to the sponsor leadership to ensure effective implementation. The individual(s) will be responsible for:


(i) Monitoring all registered apprenticeship activity to ensure compliance with the nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations required by this part;


(ii) Maintaining records required under this part; and


(iii) Generating and submitting reports as may be required by the Registration Agency.


(2) *Internal dissemination of equal opportunity policy.* The sponsor must inform all applicants for apprenticeship, apprentices, and individuals connected with the administration or operation of the registered apprenticeship program of its commitment to equal opportunity and its affirmative action obligations. In addition, the sponsor must require that individuals connected with the administration or operation of the apprenticeship program take the necessary action to aid the sponsor in meeting its nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations under this part. A sponsor, at a minimum, is required to:




(i) Publish its equal opportunity pledge—set forth in paragraph (c) of this section—in the apprenticeship standards required under § 29.5(b) of this title, and in appropriate publications, such as apprentice and employee handbooks, policy manuals, newsletters, or other documents disseminated by the sponsor or that otherwise describe the nature of the sponsorship;


(ii) Post its equal opportunity pledge from paragraph (c) of this section on bulletin boards, including through electronic media, such that it is accessible to all apprentices and applicants for apprenticeship;


(iii) Conduct orientation and periodic information sessions for individuals connected with the administration or operation of the apprenticeship program, including all apprentices and journeyworkers who regularly work with apprentices, to inform and remind such individuals of the sponsor's equal employment opportunity policy with regard to apprenticeship, and to provide the training required by paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section; and


(iv) Maintain records necessary to demonstrate compliance with these requirements and make them available to the Registration Agency upon request.


(3) *Universal outreach and recruitment.* The sponsor will implement measures to ensure that its outreach and recruitment efforts for apprentices extend to all persons available for apprenticeship within the sponsor's relevant recruitment area without regard to race, sex, ethnicity, or disability. In furtherance of this requirement, the sponsor must:


(i) Develop and update annually a list of current recruitment sources that will generate referrals from all demographic groups within the relevant recruitment area. Examples of relevant recruitment sources include: The public workforce system's One-Stop Career Centers and local workforce investment boards; community-based organizations; community colleges; vocational, career and technical schools; pre-apprenticeship programs; and Federally-funded, youth job-training programs such as YouthBuild and Job Corps or their successors;


(ii) Identify a contact person, mailing address, telephone number, and email address for each recruitment source; and


(iii) Provide recruitment sources advance notice, preferably 30 days, of apprenticeship openings so that the recruitment sources can notify and refer candidates. Such notification must also include documentation of the sponsor's equal opportunity pledge specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(4) *Maintaining apprenticeship programs free from harassment, intimidation, and retaliation.* The sponsor must develop and implement procedures to ensure that its apprentices are not harassed because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability and to ensure that its apprenticeship program is free from intimidation and retaliation as prohibited by § 30.17. To promote an environment in which all apprentices feel safe, welcomed, and treated fairly, the sponsor must ensure the following steps are taken:


(i) Providing anti-harassment training to all individuals connected with the administration or operation of the apprenticeship program, including all apprentices and journeyworkers who regularly work with apprentices. This training must not be a mere transmittal of information, but must include participation by trainees, such as attending a training session in person or completing an interactive training online. The training content must include, at a minimum, communication of the following:


(A) That harassing conduct will not be tolerated;


(B) The definition of harassment and the types of conduct that constitute unlawful harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, and disability; and


(C) The right to file a harassment complaint under § 30.14 of this part.


(ii) Making all facilities and apprenticeship activities available without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability except that if the sponsor provides restrooms or changing facilities, the sponsor must provide separate or single-user restrooms and changing facilities to assure privacy between the sexes;


(iii) Establishing and implementing procedures for handling and resolving complaints about harassment and intimidation based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, and disability, as well as complaints about retaliation for engaging in protected activity described in § 30.17 of this part.


(5) *Compliance with Federal and State equal employment opportunity laws.* The sponsor must comply with all other applicable Federal and State laws and regulations that require equal employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity, as applicable), sexual orientation, age (40 or older), genetic information, or disability. Failure to comply with such laws if such noncompliance is related to the equal employment opportunity of apprentices and/or graduates of such an apprenticeship programs under this part is grounds for deregistration or the imposition of other enforcement actions in accordance with § 30.15.


(c) *Equal opportunity pledge.* (1) Each sponsor of an apprenticeship program must include in its Standards of Apprenticeship and apprenticeship opportunity announcements the following equal opportunity pledge:


(2) The nondiscrimination bases listed in this pledge may be broadened to conform to consistent State and local requirements. Sponsors may include additional protected bases but may not exclude any of the bases protected by this part.


(d) * Compliance.* (1) Current sponsors: A sponsor that has a registered apprenticeship program as of the effective date of this regulation must comply with all obligations of this section within 180 days of the effective date of this rule.


(2) New sponsors: A sponsor registering with a Registration Agency after the effective date of this regulation shall comply with all obligations of this section upon registration or 180 days after the effective date of this regulation, whichever is later.
