# ยง 31.6   Assurances required.

(a) *General.* (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, and every contract, subcontact, agreement or arrangement except an application to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility, and every contract, subcontract, agreement or arrangement to provide such a facility shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contract, subcontract, agreement or arrangement contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. Every award of Federal financial assistance shall require the submission of such an assurance. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended to the program. In the case where the assistance is sought for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith. The Secretary shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement. 


(2) In the case where Federal assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interest therein, from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property or interest therein from the Federal Government is involved, but property is acquired with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. When the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the Secretary, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing facilities on such property for the purpose for which the property was transferred, the Secretary may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to subordinate such rights of reversion to the sum of such mortgage or other encumbrance. 


(b) *Continuing Federal financial assistance.* Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application


(1) Contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and 


(2) Provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the Secretary to give reasonable guarantee that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.
