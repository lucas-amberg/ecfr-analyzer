(a) *General.* No qualified handicapped individual shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity which receives Federal financial assistance.


(b) *Discriminatory actions prohibited.* (1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, service or training, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangments, on the basis of handicap: 


(i) Deny a qualified handicapped individual the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, service or training; 


(ii) Afford a qualified handicapped individual an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, service or training that is not equal to that afforded others; 


(iii) Provide a qualified handicapped individual with any aid, benefit, service or training that is not as effective as that provided to others; 


(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped individuals or to any class of handicapped individuals unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped individuals with aid, benefits, services or training that are as effective as those provided to others; 


(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped individual by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, service or training to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity; 


(vi) Deny a qualified handicapped individual the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or 


(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped individual in enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, service or training. 


(2) For purposes of this part, aid, benefits, services or training, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped individuals, but must afford handicapped individuals equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs. 


(3) A recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped individual the opportunity to participate in its regular aid, benefits, services, or training, despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, services, or training for the handicapped which are established in accordance with this part. 


(4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration: 


(i) That have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped individuals to discrimination on the basis of handicap; 


(ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped individuals; or 


(iii) That perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same state. 


(5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections. 


(i) That have the effect of excluding handicapped individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance; or 


(ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped individuals. 


(6) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, service or training provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, service or training provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased, rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial assistance. 


(7)(i) In providing services receiving Federal financial assistance, except for employment-related training, a recipient to which this subpart applies, except small recipients, shall ensure that no handicapped participant is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the program or activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of auxiliary aids for participants with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills. In employment and employment-related training, this paragraph shall apply only to the intake, assessment and referral services. A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this subpart applies so that, when viewed in its entirety, auxiliary aids are readily available. 


(ii) Auxiliary aids may include brailled and taped written materials, interpreters or other effective methods of making orally delivered information available to persons with hearing impairments, readers for persons with visual impairments, equipment adapted for use by persons with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature. 


(c) *Aid, benefits, services, or training limited by Federal law.* The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from aid, benefits, program services, or training limited by Federal statute on Executive order to handicapped individuals or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped individuals from aid, benefits, services, or training limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of handicapped individuals is not prohibited by this part. 


(d) *Integrated setting.* Recipients shall administer programs or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped individuals. 


(e) *Communications with individuals with impaired vision and hearing.* Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries are available to persons with impaired vision and hearing.
