(a) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility, brings itself into compliance with this part and satisfies the Assistant Secretary that it will fully comply with section 504 and this part.


(b) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance may request the Assistant Secretary to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance.

If the Assistant Secretary determines that those requirements have been satisfied, the applicant's or recipient's eligibility shall be restored.
