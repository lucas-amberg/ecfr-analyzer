# § 36.400   Education programs or activities.

(a) *General.* Except as provided elsewhere in these Title IX regulations, no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient that receives Federal financial assistance. Sections 36.400 through 36.455 do not apply to actions of a recipient in connection with admission of its students to an education program or activity of a recipient to which §§ 36.300 through 36.310 do not apply, or an entity, not a recipient, to which §§ 36.300 through 36.310 would not apply if the entity were a recipient. 


(b) *Specific prohibitions.* Except as provided in §§ 36.400 through 36.455, in providing any aid, benefit, or service to a student, a recipient shall not, on the basis of sex: 


(1) Treat one person differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or condition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service; 


(2) Provide different aid, benefits, or services or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different manner; 


(3) Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service; 


(4) Subject any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment; 


(5) Apply any rule concerning the domicile or residence of a student or applicant, including eligibility for in-state fees and tuition; 


(6) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by providing significant assistance to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit, or service to students or employees; 


(7) Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity. 


(c) *Assistance administered by a recipient educational institution to study at a foreign institution.* A recipient educational institution may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other awards established by foreign or domestic wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments, or by acts of foreign governments and restricted to members of one sex, that are designed to provide opportunities to study abroad, and that are awarded to students who are already matriculating at or who are graduates of the recipient institution; *Provided,* that a recipient educational institution that administers or assists in the administration of such scholarships, fellowships, or other awards that are restricted to members of one sex provides, or otherwise makes available, reasonable opportunities for similar studies for members of the other sex. Such opportunities may be derived from either domestic or foreign sources. 


(d) *Aids, benefits or services not provided by recipient.* (1) This paragraph (d) applies to any recipient that requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or that facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or equivalent to an education program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments. 


(2) Such recipient: 


(i) Shall develop and implement a procedure designed to assure itself that the operator or sponsor of such other education program or activity takes no action affecting any applicant, student, or employee of such recipient that these Title IX regulations would prohibit such recipient from taking; and 


(ii) Shall not facilitate, require, permit, or consider such participation if such action occurs.
