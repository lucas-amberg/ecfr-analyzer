(2) Each Methods of Administration must be designed to give a reasonable guarantee that all recipients will comply, and are complying, with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIA and this part.


(b) The Methods of Administration must be:


(1) In writing, addressing each requirement of § 37.54(d) with narrative and documentation;


(2) Reviewed and updated as required in § 37.55; and


(3) Signed by the Governor.


(c) [Reserved]


(d) At a minimum, each Methods of Administration must:


(1) Describe how the State programs and recipients have satisfied the requirements of the following regulations:


(i) Sections 37.20 through 37.22 (assurances);


(ii) Sections 37.23 through 37.28 (Equal Opportunity Officers);

(2) Include the following additional elements:


(i) A system for determining whether a grant applicant, if financially assisted, and/or a training provider, if selected as eligible under section 122 of the Act, is likely to conduct its WIA Title I—financially assisted programs or activities in a nondiscriminatory way, and to comply with the regulations in this part;


(ii) A system for periodically monitoring the compliance of recipients with WIA section 188 and this part, including a determination as to whether each recipient is conducting its WIA Title I—financially assisted program or activity in a nondiscriminatory way. At a minimum, each periodic monitoring review required by this paragraph must include:


(A) A statistical or other quantifiable analysis of records and data kept by the recipient under § 37.37, including analyses by race/ethnicity, sex, age, and disability status;


(B) An investigation of any significant differences identified in paragraph (A) of this section in participation in the programs, activities, or employment provided by the recipient, to determine whether these differences appear to be caused by discrimination. This investigation must be conducted through review of the recipient's records and any other appropriate means; and


(C) An assessment to determine whether the recipient has fulfilled its administrative obligations under section 188 or this part (for example, recordkeeping, notice and communication) and any duties assigned to it under the MOA;


(iii) A review of recipient policy issuances to ensure they are nondiscriminatory;


(iv) A system for reviewing recipients' job training plans, contracts, assurances, and other similar agreements to ensure that they are both nondiscriminatory and contain the required language regarding nondiscrimination and equal opportunity;


(v) Procedures for ensuring that recipients comply with the requirements of Section 504 and this part with regard to individuals with disabilities;


(vi) A system of policy communication and training to ensure that EO Officers and members of the recipients' staffs who have been assigned responsibilities under the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIA or this part are aware of and can effectively carry out these responsibilities;


(vii) Procedures for obtaining prompt corrective action or, as necessary, applying sanctions when noncompliance is found; and

(A) Policy and procedural issuances concerning required elements of the Methods of Administration;


(B) Copies of monitoring instruments and instructions;


(C) Evidence of the extent to which nondiscrimination and equal opportunity policies have been developed and communicated as required by this part;
