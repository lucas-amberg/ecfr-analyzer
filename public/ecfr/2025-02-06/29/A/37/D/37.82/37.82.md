# ยง 37.82   Does the Director accept every complaint for resolution?

No. The Director must determine whether CRC will accept a particular complaint for resolution. For example, a complaint need not be accepted if:


(a) It has not been timely filed;


(b) CRC has no jurisdiction over the complaint; or


(c) CRC has previously decided the matter.
