# ยง 38.8   Discrimination prohibited based on pregnancy.

Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, including childbearing capacity, is a form of sex discrimination and a violation of the nondiscrimination provisions of WIOA and this part. Recipients may not treat persons of childbearing capacity, or those affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, adversely in accessing any aid, benefit, service, or training under a WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity. In their covered employment practices, recipients must treat people of childbearing capacity and those affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe-benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work. Related medical conditions include, but are not limited to: Lactation; disorders directly related to pregnancy, such as preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure), placenta previa, and gestational diabetes; symptoms such as back pain; complications requiring bed rest; and the after-effects of a delivery. A pregnancy-related medical condition may also be a disability. See ยง 38.4(q)(3)(ii). Examples of unlawful pregnancy discrimination may include:


(a) Refusing to provide any aid, benefit, service, or training under a WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity to a pregnant individual or an individual of childbearing capacity, or otherwise subjecting such individuals to adverse treatment on the basis of pregnancy or childbearing capacity;


(b) Limiting an individual's access to any aid, benefit, service, or training under a WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity based on her pregnancy, or requiring a doctor's note in order for a pregnant woman to begin or continue participation while pregnant when doctors' notes are not required for participants who are similarly situated;


(c) Denying an individual access to any aid, benefit, service, or training under a WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity or requiring the individual to terminate participation in any WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity when the individual becomes pregnant or has a child; and


(d) Denying reasonable accommodations or modifications of policies, practices, or procedures to a pregnant applicant or participant who is temporarily unable to participate in some portions of a WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity because of pregnancy, childbirth, and/or related medical conditions, when such accommodations or modifications are provided, or are required to be provided, by a recipient's policy or by other relevant laws, to other similarly situated applicants or participants.
