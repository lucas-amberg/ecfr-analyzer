At a minimum, each annual monitoring review required by this paragraph must include:


(1) A statistical or other quantifiable analysis of records and data kept by the recipient under ยง 38.41, including analyses by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, preferred language, age, and disability status;


(2) An investigation of any significant differences identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in participation in the programs, activities, or employment provided by the recipient, to determine whether these differences appear to be caused by discrimination.

(3) An assessment to determine whether the recipient has fulfilled its administrative obligations under Section 188 of WIOA or this part (for example, recordkeeping, notice and communication) and any duties assigned to it under the Nondiscrimination Plan.
