(ii) A review of recipient policy issuances to ensure they are nondiscriminatory;


(iii) A system for reviewing recipients' job training plans, contracts, assurances, and other similar agreements to ensure that they are both nondiscriminatory and contain the required language regarding nondiscrimination and equal opportunity;
