# § 4.159   General minimum wage.

The Act, in section 2(b)(1), provides generally that no contractor or subcontractor under any Federal contract subject to the Act shall pay any employee engaged in performing work on such a contract less than the minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Section 2(a)(1) provides that the minimum monetary wage specified in any such contract exceeding $2,500 shall in no case be lower than this Fair Labor Standards Act minimum wage. Section 2(b)(1) is a statutory provision which applies to the contractor or subcontractor without regard to whether it is incorporated in the contract; however, §§ 4.6 and 4.7 provide for inclusion of its requirements in covered contracts and subcontracts. Because this statutory requirement specifies no fixed monetary wage rate and refers only to the minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and because its application does not depend on provisions of the contract, any increase in such Fair Labor Standards Act minimum wage during the life of the contract is, on its effective date, also effective to increase the minimum wage payable under section 2(b)(1) to employees engaged in performing work on the contract.
