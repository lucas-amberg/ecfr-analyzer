# § 4.180   Overtime pay—in general.

The Act does not provide for compensation of covered employees at premium rates for overtime hours of work. Section 6 recognizes, however, that other Federal laws may require such compensation to be paid to employees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the Act (see § 4.181) and prescribes, for purposes of such laws, the manner in which fringe benefits furnished pursuant to the Act shall be treated in computing such overtime compensation as follows: “In determining any overtime pay to which such service employees are entitled under any Federal law, the regular or basic hourly rate of such an employee shall not include any fringe benefit payments computed hereunder which are excluded from the regular rate under the Fair Labor Standards Act by provisions of section 7(d) [now section 7(e)] thereof.” Fringe benefit payments which qualify for such exclusion are described in part 778, subpart C of this title. The interpretations there set forth will be applied in determining the overtime pay to which covered service employees are entitled under other Federal statutes. The effect of section 6 of the Act in situations where equivalent fringe benefits or cash payments are provided in lieu of the specified fringe benefits is stated in § 4.177(e) of this part, and illustrated in § 4.182.
