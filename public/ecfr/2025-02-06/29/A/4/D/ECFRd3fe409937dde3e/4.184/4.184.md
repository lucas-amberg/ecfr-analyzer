# § 4.184   Posting of notice.

Posting of the notice provided by the Wage and Hour Division shall be in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite, as required by § 4.6(e). The display of the notice in a place where it may be seen by employees performing on the contract will satisfy the requirement that it be in a “prominent and accessible place”. Should display be necessary at more than one site, in order to assure that it is seen by such employees, additional copies of the poster may be obtained without cost from the Division. The contractor or subcontractor is required to notify each employee of the compensation due or attach to the poster any applicable wage determination specified in the contract listing all minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits to be paid or furnished to the classes of service employees performing on the contract.
