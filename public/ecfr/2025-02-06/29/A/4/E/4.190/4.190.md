# ยง 4.190   Contract cancellation.

(a) As provided in section 3 of the Act, where a violation is found of any contract stipulation, the contract is subject upon written notice to cancellation by the contracting agency, whereupon the United States may enter into other contracts or arrangements for the completion of the original contract, charging any additional cost to the original contractor.


(b) Every contractor shall certify pursuant to ยง 4.6(n) of subpart A that it is not disqualified for the award of a contract by virtue of its name appearing on the debarred bidders list or because any such currently listed person or firm has a substantial interest in said contractor, as described in ยง 4.188. Upon discovery of such false certification or determination of substantial interest in a firm performing on a Government contract, as the case may be, the contract is similarly subject upon written notice to immediate cancellation by the contracting agency and any additional cost for the completion of the contract charged to the original contractor as specified in paragraph (a). Such contract is without warrant of law and has no force and effect and is void ab initio, 33 Comp Gen. 63; Decision of the Comptroller General, B-115051, August 6, 1953. Furthermore, any profit derived from said illegal contract is forfeited (*Paisner* v. *U.S.,* 138 Ct. Cl. 420, 150 F. Supp. 835 (1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 941).
