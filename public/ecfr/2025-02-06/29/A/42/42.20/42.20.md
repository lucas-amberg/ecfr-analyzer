(e) The designated Farm Labor Specialist (ESA), Farm Labor Regional Coordinators (OSHA), and MSFW Monitor Advocates (USES) in each region shall be available to provide staff support to the Regional Committees. 


(f) To facilitate coordination with farm labor groups and growers in each region, the respective Regional Committee shall hold an annual public meeting, transcribe or recorded at the option of the Regional Committee, which shall be: 


(1) Publicized to all appropriate migrant farmworker and grower associations in the region; 


(2) Conducted by the director of the Regional Committee with other DOL agency representatives participating as necessary; and 


(3) Opened to all members of the public.
