# § 5.9   Suspension of funds.

(a) *Suspension and withholding.* In the event of failure or refusal of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with the applicable statutes referenced by § 5.1 and the labor standards clauses contained in § 5.5, whether incorporated into the contract physically, by reference, or by operation of law, the Federal agency (and any other agency), may, upon its own action, or must, upon written request of an authorized representative of the Department of Labor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of the payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until such time as the violations are discontinued and/or until sufficient funds are withheld as may be considered necessary to compensate workers for the full amount of wages and monetary relief to which they are entitled, and to cover any liquidated damages and pre-judgment or post-judgment interest which may be due.


(b) *Cross-withholding.* To satisfy a contractor's liability for back wages on a contract, in addition to the suspension and withholding of funds from the contract(s) under which the violation(s) occurred, the necessary funds also may be withheld under any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, or any other federally assisted contract that is subject to Davis-Bacon labor standards and/or the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act and is held by the same prime contractor, regardless of whether the other contract was awarded or assisted by the same agency.


(c) *Cross-withholding from different legal entities.* Cross-withholding of funds may be requested from contracts held by other entities that may be considered to be the same prime contractor as that term is defined in § 5.2. Such cross-withholding is appropriate where the separate legal entities have independently consented to it by entering into contracts containing the withholding provisions at § 5.5(a)(2) and (b)(3). Cross-withholding from a contract held by a different legal entity is not appropriate unless the withholding provisions were incorporated in full or by reference in that different legal entity's contract. Absent exceptional circumstances, cross-withholding is not permitted from a contract held by a different legal entity where the Davis-Bacon labor standards were incorporated only by operation of law into that contract.
