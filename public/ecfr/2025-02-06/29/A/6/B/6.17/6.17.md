# ยง 6.17   Amendments to pleadings.

At any time prior to the close of the hearing record, the complaint or answer may be amended with the permission of the Administrative Law Judge and on such terms as he/she may approve. When issues not raised by the pleadings are reasonably within the scope of the original complaint and are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings, and such amendments may be made as necessary to make them conform to the evidence. Such amendments shall be allowed when justice and the presentation of the merits are served thereby, provided there is no prejudice to the objecting party's presentation on the merits. A continuance in the hearing may be granted or the record left open to enable the new allegations to be addressed. The presiding Administrative Law Judge may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit supplemental pleadings setting forth transactions, occurrences or events which have happened since the data of the pleadings and which are relevant to any of the issues involved.
