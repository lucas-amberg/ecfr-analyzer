(a) *Manner of access.* A component that has made a determination to grant a request for access shall grant the requester access to the requested record either by providing the requester with a copy of the record, or making the record available for inspection by the requester at a reasonable time and place. The component shall charge the requester only duplication costs in accordance with the provisions of ยง 71.6.
