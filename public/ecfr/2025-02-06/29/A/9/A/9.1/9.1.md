# § 9.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Purpose.* This part contains the Department of Labor's (Department) rules relating to the administration of Executive Order 14055 (Executive order or the order), “Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts,” and implements the enforcement provisions of the Executive order. The Executive order assigns enforcement responsibility for the nondisplacement requirements to the Department.


(b) *Policy.* (1) The Executive order states that the Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are served when the successor contractor or subcontractor hires the predecessor's employees. A carryover workforce minimizes disruption in the delivery of services during a period of transition between contractors, maintains physical and information security, and provides the Federal Government the benefit of an experienced and well-trained workforce that is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements. Accordingly, Executive Order 14055 sets forth a general position of the Federal Government that requiring successor service contractors and subcontractors performing on Federal contracts to offer a right of first refusal to suitable employment (*i.e.,* a job for which the employee is qualified) under the contract to those employees under the predecessor contract and its subcontracts whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.


(2) The Executive order provides that executive departments and agencies, including independent establishments subject to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, must, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that service contracts and subcontracts that succeed a contract for performance of the same or similar work, and solicitations for such contracts and subcontracts, include a clause that requires the contractor and its subcontractors to offer a right of first refusal of employment to service employees employed under the predecessor contract and its subcontracts whose employment would be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract in positions for which the employees are qualified. Nothing in Executive Order 14055 or this part will be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order, regulation, or law of the United States.


(c) *Scope.* Neither Executive Order 14055 nor this part creates or changes any rights under the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 7101 *et seq.,* or any private right of action that may exist under other applicable laws. The Executive order provides that disputes regarding the requirement of the contract clause prescribed by section 3 of the order, to the extent permitted by law, must be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary of Labor in regulations issued under the order. The order, however, does not preclude review of final decisions by the Secretary in accordance with the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 *et seq.* Additionally, the Executive order also provides that it is to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
