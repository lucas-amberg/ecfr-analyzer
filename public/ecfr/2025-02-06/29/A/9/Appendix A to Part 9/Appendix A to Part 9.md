# Appendix A to Part 9â€”Contract Clause


The following clause must be included by the contracting agency in every contract and solicitation to which Executive Order 14055 applies, except for procurement contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR):


(a) The contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer service employees (as defined in the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 6701(3)) employed under the predecessor contract and its subcontracts whose employment would be terminated as a result of the award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which those employees are qualified. The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ more or fewer employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work solely on the basis of that determination. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this clause, there shall be no employment opening under this contract or subcontract, and the contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract to any person prior to having complied fully with the obligations described in this clause. The contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 business days.


(b) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor and any subcontractors:


(1) Are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 6701(3); and


(2) Are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor for whom the contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on reliable evidence of the particular employees' past performance, that there would be just cause to discharge the employee(s) if employed by the contractor or any subcontractors.


(c) The contractor shall, not less than 10 business days before the earlier of the completion of this contract or of its work on this contract, furnish the contracting officer a certified list of the names, mailing addresses, and if known, phone numbers and email addresses of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. The contracting officer shall provide the list to the successor contractor, and the list shall be provided on request to employees or their representatives, consistent with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a), and other applicable law.


(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, the Secretary may impose appropriate sanctions against the contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order 14055, the regulations implementing that order, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.


(e) In every subcontract entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the contractor shall include provisions that ensure that each subcontractor shall honor the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause with respect to the employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its subcontractors. The subcontract shall also include provisions to ensure that the subcontractor shall provide the contractor with the information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the contractor to comply with paragraph (c) of this clause. The contractor shall take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance: provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the contractor may request that the United States enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.


(f)(1) The contractor must, not less than 30 calendar days before completion of the contractor's performance of services on a contract, furnish the contracting officer with a certified list of the names, mailing addresses, and if known, phone numbers and email addresses of all service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the workforce are made after the submission of the certified list described in this paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, the contractor must, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, not less than 10 business days before completion of the contractor's performance of services on a contract, furnish the contracting officer with an updated certified list of the names, mailing addresses, and if known, phone numbers and email addresses of all service employees employed within the last month of contract performance. The updated list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Only contractors experiencing a change in their workforce between the 30- and 10-day periods will have to submit a list in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause.


(2) The contracting officer must upon their own action or upon written request of the Administrator withhold or cause to be withheld as much of the accrued payments due on either the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Government that the Department of Labor representative requests or that the contracting officer decides may be necessary to pay unpaid wages or to provide other appropriate relief due under 29 CFR part 9. Upon the final order of the Secretary that such moneys are due, the Administrator may direct the relevant contracting agency to transfer the withheld funds to the Department of Labor for disbursement. If the contracting officer or the Administrator finds that the predecessor contractor has failed to provide a list of the names and mailing addresses of service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance in accordance with 29 CFR part 9, the contracting officer may, at their discretion, and must upon request by the Administrator, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of the payment of contract funds until such time as the list is provided to the contracting officer.


(3) Before contract completion, the contractor must provide written notice to service employees employed under the contract of their possible right to an offer of employment on the successor contract. Such notice will be either posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite or delivered to the employees individually. Where the workforce on the predecessor contract is comprised of a significant portion of workers who are not fluent in English, the notice will be provided in both English and a language in which the employees are fluent. The contractor further agrees to provide notifications to employees under the contract, and their representatives, if any, in the timeframes and methods requested by the contracting agency, to notify employees of any agency determination to except a successor contract from the nondisplacement requirements of 29 CFR part 9, and to notify them of the opportunity to provide information relevant to the contracting agency's location-continuity determination in the solicitation for a successor contract.


(g) The contractor and subcontractors must maintain records of their compliance with this clause for not less than a period of 3 years from the date the records were created. These records may be maintained in any format, paper or electronic, provided the records meet the requirements and purposes of 29 CFR part 9 and are fully accessible. The records maintained must include the following:


(1) Copies of any written offers of employment.


(2) A copy of any record that forms the basis for any exclusion or exception claimed under this part.


(3) A copy of the employee list(s) provided to or received from the contracting agency.


(4) An entry on the pay records of the amount of any retroactive payment of wages or compensation under the supervision of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to each employee, the period covered by such payment, and the date of payment, and a copy of any receipt form provided by or authorized by the Wage and Hour Division. The contractor must also deliver a copy of the receipt to the employee and file the original, as evidence of payment by the contractor and receipt by the employee, with the Administrator within 10 days after payment is made.


(h) The contractor must cooperate in any review or investigation by the contracting agency or the Department of Labor into possible violations of the provisions of this clause and must make records requested by such official(s) available for inspection, copying, or transcription upon request.


(i) Disputes concerning the requirements of this clause will not be subject to the general disputes clause of this contract. Such disputes will be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 9. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between or among any of the following: the contractor, the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the employees under the contract or its predecessor contract.


(j) Nothing in this clause will relieve a contractor or subcontractor of any obligation under the HUBZone program statute, 15 U.S.C. 657a, the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 8501-8506, the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107. The provisions of those laws must be satisfied in tandem with and, if necessary, prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 14055, 29 CFR part 9, and this clause. Thus, any contractor or subcontractor operating under a contract awarded on the basis of a HUBZone preference, 41 U.S.C. 657a(c); operating pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 8501-8506; or operating pursuant to agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to the regulations establishing a priority for individuals who are blind issued under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107, must ensure that it complies with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the relevant program. Such contractor or subcontractor must, whenever possible, also comply with requirements of this clause, Executive Order 14055, and 29 CFR part 9, to the extent that such compliance would not result in a violation of the requirements of the relevant program.
