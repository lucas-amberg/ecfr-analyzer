# § 9.11   Contracting agency requirements.

(a) *Contract clause.* The contract clause set forth in Appendix A of this part must be included in covered service contracts, and solicitations for such contracts, that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar work, except for procurement contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The contract clause in Appendix A affords employees who worked on the prior contract a right of first refusal pursuant to Executive Order 14055. For procurement contracts subject to the FAR, contracting agencies must use the clause set forth in the FAR developed to implement this section. Such clause will accomplish the same purposes as the clause set forth in appendix A of this part and be consistent with the requirements set forth in this section.


(b) *Notices.* Where a contract will be awarded to a successor for the same or similar work, the contracting officer must take steps to ensure that the predecessor contractor provides written notice to service employees employed under the predecessor contract of their possible right to an offer of employment, consistent with the requirements in § 9.12(e)(3), and, where relevant, notice to employees' representatives consistent with the provisions of § 9.11(c)(4) (relating to the location continuity analysis), and § 9.5(f) (relating to agency exceptions).


(c) *Location continuity.* (1) When an agency prepares a solicitation for a service contract that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar work, the agency must consider whether performance of the work in the same locality or localities in which the contract is currently being performed is reasonably necessary to ensure economical and efficient provision of services.


(2) If an agency determines that performance of the contract in the same locality or localities is reasonably necessary to ensure economical and efficient provision of services, then the agency must, to the extent consistent with law, include a requirement or preference in the solicitation for the successor contract that it be performed in the same locality or localities.


(3) When there is a possibility that the successor contract could be performed in a locality other than where the predecessor contract has been performed, and a location change is under consideration, an agency's location-continuity analysis should generally include, but not be limited to, the following considerations:


(i) Whether factors specific to the contract at issue suggest that the employment of a new workforce at a new location would increase the potential for disruption to the delivery of services during the period of transition between contracts (e.g., the large size of workforce to be replaced or the relatively significant level of experience or training of the predecessor workforce);


(ii) Whether factors specific to the contract at issue suggest that the employment of a new workforce at a new location would unnecessarily increase physical or informational security risks on the contract (e.g., whether workers on the contract have had and will have access to sensitive, privileged, or classified information);


(iii) Whether the workforce on the predecessor contract has demonstrated prior successful performance of contract objectives so as to warrant a preference to retain as much of the current workforce as possible; and


(iv) Whether program-specific statutory or regulatory requirements govern the method through which the location of contract performance must be determined or evaluated, or other contract-specific factors favor the performance of the contract in a particular location.


(4) Agencies must complete the location-continuity analysis required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section prior to the date of issuance of the solicitation. Where an incumbent contractor's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and a contract location change is possible and under consideration, the agency must, to the extent consistent with mission security, provide the employees with an opportunity prior to the issuance of the solicitation to submit information relevant to this analysis. Under such circumstances, the agency must, at the earliest reasonable time in the acquisition planning process, direct the incumbent contractor to notify the collective bargaining representative(s) for the affected employees of the appropriate method to communicate such information.


(i) *Method of notice.* Agencies must direct the incumbent contractor to provide notice in the manner set forth in this paragraph. The contractor must provide written notice directly to the employees' representative in the same manner customarily used by the contractor to communicate with the representative.


(ii) *Model notice.* Agencies may use the following sample language as a basis in preparing their own notices regarding location continuity: Notice to Employees Regarding Location Continuity of Federal Contract Services. The contract for [insert type of service] services currently performed by [insert name of incumbent contractor] is scheduled to expire on [insert date]. [Insert name of contracting agency] is currently preparing a [insert type of solicitation] for a new contract for the provision of these services. As part of the acquisition planning process, [insert name of contracting agency] is considering whether to require or include a preference that these services continue to be performed in the same locality. If you have information regarding the provision of these services that would be relevant to this location continuity analysis, please contact [insert name of contracting agency contact] at [insert email address]. Before completion of the [insert name of incumbent contractor] contract, a subsequent notice will be provided to employees regarding the rights of certain service employees on the current contract to an offer of employment on any successor contract that is awarded. For additional information, contact the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor at 1-866-4US-WAGE (1-866-487-9243), *https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd.* If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability, please dial 7-1-1 to access telecommunications relay services.


(5) If the successor contract will be performed in a new locality, nothing in this part requires the contracting agency or the successor contractor to pay the relocation costs of employees who exercise their right to work for the successor contractor or subcontractor under the contract clause.


(d) *Disclosures.* The contracting officer must provide the incumbent contractor's list of employees referenced in § 9.12(e) to the successor contractor no later than 21 calendar days prior to the start of performance on the successor's contract and, on request, the predecessor contractor must provide the employee list to employees or their representatives, consistent with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and other applicable law. When the incumbent contractor provides the contracting agency with an updated employee list pursuant to § 9.12(e)(2), the contracting agency will provide the updated list to the successor contractor no later than 7 calendar days prior to the start of performance on the successor contract. However, if the contract is awarded less than 30 days before the beginning of performance, then the predecessor contractor and the contracting agency must transmit the list as soon as practicable.


(e) *Actions on complaints*—(1) *Reporting*—(i) *Reporting time frame.* Within 15 calendar days of receiving a complaint or being contacted by the Wage and Hour Division with a request for the information in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the contracting officer will forward all information listed in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section to the local Wage and Hour office.


(ii) *Report contents:* The contracting officer will forward to the Wage and Hour Division any:


(A) Complaint of contractor noncompliance with this part;


(B) Available statements by the employee or the contractor regarding the alleged violation;


(C) Evidence that a seniority list was issued by the predecessor and provided to the successor;


(D) A copy of the seniority list;


(E) Evidence that the nondisplacement contract clause was included in the contract or that the contract was excepted by the contracting agency;


(F) Information concerning known settlement negotiations between the parties, if applicable;


(G) Any other relevant facts known to the contracting officer or other information requested by the Wage and Hour Division.


(2) [Reserved]


(f) *Incorporation of omitted contract clause.* Where the Department or the contracting agency discovers or determines, whether before or subsequent to a contract award, that a contracting agency made an erroneous determination that Executive Order 14055 or this part did not apply to a particular contract and/or failed to include the applicable contract clause in a contract to which the Executive order applies, the contracting agency will incorporate the contract clause in the contract through the exercise of any and all authority that may be needed (including, where necessary, its authority to negotiate or amend, its authority to pay any necessary additional costs, and its authority under any contract provision authorizing changes, cancellation and termination). Such incorporation must happen either on the initiative of the contracting agency or within 15 calendar days of notification by an authorized representative of the Department of Labor. Where the circumstances so warrant, the Administrator may require retroactive application of the contract clause to the commencement of performance under the contract or other date the Administrator determines to be appropriate. In determining whether retroactive application is appropriate, the Administrator will consider, among other factors, whether retroactive application would result in an overly onerous administrative or economic burden on the contracting agency that may constitute a severe disruption in the agency's procurement practices.
