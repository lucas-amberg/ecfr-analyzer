# ยง 9.13   Subcontracts.

(a) *Subcontractor liability.* The contractor or subcontractor must insert in any subcontracts the nondisplacement contract clause contained in Appendix A or the FAR, as appropriate. The contractor or subcontractor must also insert a clause in any subcontracts to require the subcontractor to include the Appendix A or FAR contract clause in any lower-tier subcontracts. The prime contractor is responsible for the compliance of any subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor with the contract clause. In the event of any violations of the contract clause, the prime contractor and any subcontractor(s) responsible will be jointly and severally liable for any unpaid wages and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and may be subject to debarment, as appropriate.


(b) *Discontinuation of subcontractor services.* When a prime contractor that is subject to the nondisplacement requirements of this part discontinues the services of a subcontractor at any time during the contract and performs those services itself, the prime contractor must offer employment on the contract to the subcontractor's employees who would otherwise be displaced and would otherwise be qualified in accordance with this part.
