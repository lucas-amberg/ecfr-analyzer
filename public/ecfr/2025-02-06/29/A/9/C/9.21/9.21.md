# ยง 9.21   Complaints.

(a) *Filing a complaint.* Any employee of the predecessor contractor who believes the successor contractor has violated this part, or their authorized representative, may file a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) within 120 days from the first date of contract performance. The employee or authorized representative may file a complaint directly with any office of the WHD. No particular form of complaint is required. A complaint may be filed orally or in writing. The WHD will accept the complaint in any language.


(b) *Confidentiality.* It is the policy of the Department of Labor to protect the identity of its confidential sources and to prevent an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Accordingly, the identity of any individual who makes a written or oral statement as a complaint or in the course of an investigation, as well as portions of the statement which would tend to reveal the individual's identity, will not be disclosed in any manner to anyone other than Federal officials without the prior consent of the individual. Disclosure of such statements will be governed by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, *see* 29 CFR part 70) and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).
