As part of the investigation, the Administrator may conduct interviews with the predecessor and successor contractors, as well as confidential interviews with the relevant contractors' workers at the worksite during normal work hours; inspect the relevant contractors' records; make copies and transcriptions of such records; and require the production of any documents or other evidence deemed necessary to determine whether a violation of this part, including conduct warranting imposition of debarment pursuant to ยง 9.23(d), has occurred.
