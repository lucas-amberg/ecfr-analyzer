# § 9.32   Requesting appeals.

(a) *General.* If any party desires review of the determination of the Administrator, including judicial review, a request for an Administrative Law Judge hearing or petition for review by the Administrative Review Board must first be filed in accordance with § 9.31(b).


(b) *Process*—(1) *For Administrative Law Judge hearing*—(i) *General.* Any aggrieved party may request a hearing by an Administrative Law Judge by sending a request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Office of the Administrative Law Judges within 20 days of the determination of the Administrator. The request for a hearing may be sent by mail or by any other means normally ensuring delivery and must be accompanied by a copy of the determination of the Administrator. At the same time, a copy of any request for a hearing will be sent to the complainant(s) or successor contractor, and their representatives, if any, as appropriate; the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division; and the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair Labor Standards, Office of the Solicitor, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20210.


(ii) *By the complainant.* The complainant or any other interested party may request a hearing where the Administrator determines, after investigation, that the employer has not committed violation(s), or where the complainant or other interested party believes that the Administrator has ordered inadequate monetary relief. In such a proceeding, the party requesting the hearing will be the prosecuting party and the employer will be the respondent; the Administrator may intervene as a party or appear as amicus curiae at any time in the proceeding, at the Administrator's discretion.


(iii) *By the contractor.* The employer or any other interested party may request a hearing where the Administrator determines, after investigation, that the employer has committed violation(s). In such a proceeding, the Administrator will be the prosecuting party and the employer will be the respondent.


(2) *For Administrative Review Board review*—(i) *General.* Any aggrieved party desiring review of a determination of the Administrator in which there were no relevant facts in dispute, or of an Administrative Law Judge's decision, must file a petition for review with the Administrative Review Board within 20 calendar days of the date of the determination or decision. The petition must be served on all parties and, where the case involves an appeal from an Administrative Law Judge's decision, the Chief Administrative Law Judge. See also § 9.32(b)(1).


(ii) *Contents and service*—(A) *Contents.* A petition for review must refer to the specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, or order at issue.


(B) *Service.* Copies of the petition and all briefs must be served on the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, and on the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair Labor Standards, Office of the Solicitor, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20210.


(C) *Effect of filing.* If a timely request for hearing or petition for review is filed, the determination of the Administrator or the decision of the Administrative Law Judge will be inoperative unless and until the Administrative Review Board issues an order affirming the determination or decision, or the determination or decision otherwise becomes a final order of the Secretary. If a petition for review concerns only the imposition of ineligibility sanctions, however, the remainder of the decision will be effective immediately. No judicial review will be available unless a timely petition for review to the Administrative Review Board is first filed.
