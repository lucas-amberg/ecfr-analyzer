# § 9.35   Administrative Review Board proceedings.

(a) *Authority*—(1) *General.* The ARB has jurisdiction to hear and decide in its discretion appeals pursuant to § 9.31(b)(2) concerning questions of law and fact from determinations of the Administrator issued under § 9.31 and from decisions of Administrative Law Judges issued under § 9.34. In considering the matters within the scope of its jurisdiction, the ARB acts as the authorized representative of the Secretary and acts fully on behalf of the Secretary concerning such matters.


(2) *Limit on scope of review.* (i) The ARB will not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of any provision of this part. The ARB is an appellate body and will decide cases properly before it on the basis of substantial evidence contained in the entire record before it. The ARB will not receive new evidence into the record.


(ii) The Equal Access to Justice Act, as amended, does not apply to proceedings under this part. Accordingly, for any proceeding under this part, the Administrative Review Board will have no authority to award attorney fees and/or other litigation expenses pursuant to the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act.


(b) *Decisions.* The ARB's final decision will be issued within 90 days of the receipt of the petition for review and will be served upon all parties by mail to the last known address and on the Chief Administrative Law Judge (in cases involving an appeal from an Administrative Law Judge's decision).


(c) *Orders.* If the ARB concludes that the contractor has violated this part, the final order will order action to remedy the violation, which may include hiring each affected employee in a position on the contract for which the employee is qualified, together with compensation (including lost wages), terms, conditions, and privileges of that employment. Where the Administrator has sought imposition of debarment, the ARB will determine whether an order imposing debarment is appropriate. The ARB's order under this section is subject to discretionary review by the Secretary as provided in Secretary's Order 01-2020 (or any successor to that order).


(d) *Costs.* If a final order finding the successor contractor violated this part is issued, the ARB may assess against the contractor a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs (not including attorney fees) and expenses reasonably incurred by the aggrieved employee(s) in the proceeding. This amount will be awarded in addition to any unpaid wages or other relief due under § 9.23(b).


(e) *Finality.* The decision of the Administrative Review Board will become the final order of the Secretary in accordance with Secretary's Order 01-2020 (or any successor to that order), which provides for discretionary review of such orders by the Secretary.
