# § 95.71   Closeout procedures.

(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. DOL may approve extensions when requested by the recipient. 


(b) Unless DOL authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations and/or accrued expenditures incurred under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions. 


(c) DOL shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out. 


(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that DOL has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts. 


(e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, DOL shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received. 


(f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 95.31 through 95.37. 


(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, DOL retains the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.
