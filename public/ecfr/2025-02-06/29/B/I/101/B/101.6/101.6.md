# ยง 101.6   Dismissal of charges and appeals to the General Counsel.

If the complainant refuses to withdraw the charge as recommended, the Regional Director dismisses the charge. The Regional Director thereupon informs the parties of this section, together with a simple statement of the grounds therefor, and the complainant's right of appeal to the General Counsel in Washington, DC, within 14 days. If the complainant appeals to the General Counsel, the entire file in the case is sent to Washington, DC, where the case is fully reviewed by the General Counsel with staff assistance. Oral presentation of the appeal issues may be permitted a party on timely written request, in which event the other parties are notified and afforded a like opportunity at another appropriate time. Following such review, the General Counsel may sustain the Regional Director's dismissal, stating the grounds of affirmance, or may direct the Regional Director to take further action.
