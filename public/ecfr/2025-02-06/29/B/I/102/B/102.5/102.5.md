# § 102.5   Filing and service of papers by parties: Form of papers; manner and proof of filing or service.

(a) *Form of papers to be filed.* All papers filed with the Board, General Counsel, Regional Director, Administrative Law Judge, or Hearing Officer must be typewritten or otherwise legibly duplicated on 8
1/2 by 11-inch plain white paper, and must have margins no less than one inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there. Typeface that is single-spaced must not contain more than 10.5 characters per inch, and proportionally-spaced typeface must be 12 point or larger, for both text and footnotes. Condensed text is not permitted. The text must be double-spaced, but headings and footnotes may be single-spaced, and quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-spaced. Case names must be italicized or underlined. Where any brief filed with the Board exceeds 20 pages, it must contain a subject index with page references and an alphabetical table of cases and other authorities cited.


(b) *Requests to exceed the page limits.* Requests for permission to exceed the page limits for documents filed with the Board must state the reasons for the requests. Unless otherwise specified, such requests must be filed not less than 10 days prior to the date the document is due.


(c) *E-Filing with the Agency.* Unless otherwise permitted under this section, all documents filed in cases before the Agency must be filed electronically (“E-Filed”) on the Agency's Web site (*www.nlrb.gov*) by following the instructions on the Web site. The Agency's Web site also contains certain forms that parties or other persons may use to prepare their documents for E-Filing. If the document being E-Filed is required to be served on another party to a proceeding, the other party must be served by email, if possible, or in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. Unfair labor practice charges, petitions in representation proceedings, and showings of interest may be filed in paper format or E-Filed. A party who files other documents in paper format must accompany the filing with a statement explaining why the party does not have access to the means for filing electronically or why filing electronically would impose an undue burden. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Rules, if a document is filed electronically the filer need not also file a hard copy of the document, and only one copy of a document filed in hard copy should be filed. Documents may not be filed with the Agency via email without the prior approval of the receiving office.


(d) *Filing with the Agency by Mail or Delivery.* Documents to be filed with the Board are to be filed with the Office of the Executive Secretary in Washington, DC. Documents to be filed with the Regional Offices are to be filed with the Regional Office handling the case. Documents to be filed with the Division of Judges are to be filed with the Division office handling the matter.


(e) *Filing by fax with the Agency.* Only unfair labor practice charges, petitions in representation proceedings, objections to elections, and requests for extensions of time for filing documents will be accepted by the Agency if faxed to the appropriate office. Other documents may not be faxed. At the discretion of the receiving office, the person submitting a document by fax may be required simultaneously to file the original with the office by overnight delivery service. When filing a charge, a petition in a representation proceeding, or election objections by fax pursuant to this section, receipt of the faxed document by the Agency constitutes filing with the Agency. A failure to timely file or serve a document will not be excused on the basis of a claim that facsimile transmission could not be accomplished because the receiving machine was off-line or busy or unavailable for any other reason.


(f) *Service.* Unless otherwise specified, documents filed with the Agency must be simultaneously served on the other parties to the case including, as appropriate, the Regional Office in charge of the case. Service of documents by a party on other parties may be made personally, or by registered mail, certified mail, regular mail, email (unless otherwise provided for by these Rules), private delivery service, or by fax for documents of or under 25 pages in length. Service of documents by a party on other parties by any other means, including by fax for documents over 25 pages in length, is permitted only with the consent of the party being served. When a party does not have the ability to receive service by email or fax, or chooses not to accept service of a document longer than 25 pages by fax, the other party must be notified personally or by telephone of the substance of the filed document and a copy of the document must be served by personal service no later than the next day, by overnight delivery service, or by fax or email as appropriate. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere in these Rules, service on all parties must be made in the same manner as that used in filing the document with the Board, or in a more expeditious manner. When filing with the Board is done by hand, however, the other parties must be immediately notified of such action, followed by service of a copy in a manner designed to insure receipt by them by the close of the next business day. The provisions of this section apply to the General Counsel after a complaint has issued, just as they do to any other party, except to the extent that the provisions of § 102.4(a) provide otherwise.


(g) *Proof of service.* When service is made by registered or certified mail, the return post office receipt will be proof of service. When service is made by a private delivery service, the receipt from that service showing delivery will be proof of service. However, these methods of proof of service are not exclusive; any sufficient proof may be relied upon to establish service.


(h) *Statement of service.* The person or party filing a document with the Agency must simultaneously file a statement of service. Such statement must include the names of the parties served, the date and manner of service, and the location of service such as mailing address, fax number, or email address as appropriate. The Agency requires proof of service as defined in paragraph (g) of this section only if, subsequent to the receipt of the statement of service, a question is raised with respect to proper service. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service.


(i) *Failure to properly serve.* Failure to comply with the requirements of this section relating to timeliness of service on other parties will be a basis for either:


(1) Rejecting the document; or


(2) Withholding or reconsidering any ruling on the subject matter raised by the document until after service has been made and the served party has had reasonable opportunity to respond.
