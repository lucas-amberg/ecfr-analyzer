# § 102.74   Complaint and formal proceedings.

If it appears to the Regional Director that the charge has merit, formal proceedings will be instituted in accordance with the procedures described in §§ 102.15 through 102.51, insofar as they are applicable, and insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart. If it appears to the Regional Director that issuance of a complaint is not warranted, the Director will decline to issue a complaint, and the provisions of § 102.19, including the provisions for appeal to the General Counsel, are applicable unless an election has been directed under §§ 102.77 and 102.78, in which event the provisions of § 102.81 are applicable.
