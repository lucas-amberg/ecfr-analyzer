(b) In the event the Administrative Law Judge hearing a complaint, concerning which the Board has procured temporary relief or a restraining order pursuant to Section 10(j), recommends a dismissal in whole or in part of such complaint, the chief law officer will promptly suggest to the district court which issued such temporary relief or restraining order the possible change in circumstances arising out of the findings and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge.
