(c) An order of the Administrative Law Judge scheduling further proceedings will specify the issues to be considered.


(d) Any evidentiary hearing held pursuant to this section will be open to the public and will be conducted in accordance with §§ 102.30 through 102.43, except §§ 102.33, 102.34, and 102.38.


(e) Rulings of the Administrative Law Judge are reviewable by the Board only in accordance with the provisions of § 102.26.
