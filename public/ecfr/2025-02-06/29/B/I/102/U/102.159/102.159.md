(a)(1) The Agency is not authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3716) to use administrative offset with respect to:


(i) Debts owed by any State or local government;


(ii) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United States; or


(iii) When a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits using administrative offset to collect the claim or type of claim involved.


(2) No claim that has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the Board's right to collect the debt first accrued may be collected by means of administrative offset, unless facts material to the right to collect the debt were not known, and could not reasonably have been known, by the official of the Agency who was charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts until within 10 years of the initiation of the collection action. A determination of when the debt first accrued may be made according to existing laws regarding the accrual of debts, such as under 28 U.S.C. 2415. Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments owed the Board which are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority, pursuant to this paragraph (a) or Board regulations established pursuant to such other statutory authority.


(b) Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United State will be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.
