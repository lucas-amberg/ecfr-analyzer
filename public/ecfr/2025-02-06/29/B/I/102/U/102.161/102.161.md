(1) Nature and amount of the Board's claim;


(2) Date by which payment is to be made (which normally may be not more than 30 days from the date that the initial notification was mailed or hand delivered);


(3) Agency's intent to collect by administrative offset and of the debtor's rights in conjunction with such an offset;


(4) Agency's intent to collect, as appropriate, interest, penalties, administrative costs and attorneys fees;


(5) Rights of the debtor to a full explanation of the claim, of the opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records with respect to the claim and to dispute any information in the Agency's records concerning the claim;


(6) Debtor's right to administrative appeal or review within the Agency concerning the Agency's claim and how such review must be obtained;
