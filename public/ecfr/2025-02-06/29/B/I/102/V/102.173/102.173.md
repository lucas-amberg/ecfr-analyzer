(a) Tax refund offset is intended to be an administrative collection remedy to be used consistent with IRS requirements for participation in the program, and the costs and benefits of pursuing alternative remedies when the tax refund offset program is readily available. To the extent practical, the requirements of the program will be met by merging IRS requirements into the Agency's overall requirements for delinquent debt collection.


(b) As appropriate, debts of an individual debtor of $100 or more will be reported to a consumer or commercial credit reporting agency before referral for tax refund offset.


(c) Debts owed by individuals will be screened for administrative offset potential using the most current information reasonably available to the Agency, and will not be referred for tax refund offset where administrative offset potential is found to exist.
