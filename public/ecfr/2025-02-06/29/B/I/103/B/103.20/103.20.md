# ยง 103.20   Election procedures and blocking charges.

(a) Whenever any party to a representation proceeding files an unfair labor practice charge together with a request that it block the processing of the petition to the election, or whenever any party to a representation proceeding requests that its previously filed unfair labor practice charge block the further processing of the petition, the party shall simultaneously file, but not serve on any other party, a written offer of proof in support of the charge. The offer of proof shall provide the names of the witnesses who will testify in support of the charge and a summary of each witness's anticipated testimony. The party seeking to block the processing of a petition shall also promptly make available to the regional director the witnesses identified in its offer of proof.


(b) If the regional director determines that the party's offer of proof describes evidence that, if proven, would interfere with employee free choice in an election, the regional director shall, absent special circumstances, hold the petition in abeyance and notify the parties of this determination.


(c) If the regional director determines that the party's offer of proof describes evidence that, if proven, would be inherently inconsistent with the petition itself, the regional director shall, absent special circumstances, hold the petition in abeyance and notify the parties of this determination; in appropriate circumstances, the regional director should dismiss the petition subject to reinstatement and notify the parties of this determination.


(d) If the regional director determines that the party's offer of proof does not describe evidence that, if proven, would interfere with employee free choice in an election or would be inherently inconsistent with the petition itself, and thus would require that the processing of the petition be held in abeyance absent special circumstances, the regional director shall continue to process the petition and conduct the election where appropriate.


(e) If, after holding a petition in abeyance, the regional director determines that special circumstances have arisen or that employee free choice is possible notwithstanding the pendency of the unfair labor practices, the regional director may resume processing the petition.


(f) If, upon completion of investigation of the charge, the regional director determines that the charge lacks merit and is to be dismissed, absent withdrawal, the regional director shall resume processing the petition, provided that resumption of processing is otherwise appropriate.


(g) Upon final disposition of a charge that the regional director initially determined had merit, the regional director shall resume processing a petition that was held in abeyance due to the pendency of the charge, provided that resumption of processing is otherwise appropriate.


(h) The provisions of this section are intended to be severable. If any paragraph of this section is held to be unlawful, the remaining paragraphs of this section not deemed unlawful are intended to remain in effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.
