# § 215.7   The Special Warranty.

(a) The Special Warranty mentioned in paragraph (b)(2) of § 215.3 refers to the protective arrangements developed for application to the Other Than Urbanized program. The warranty arrangement represents the understandings of the Department of Labor and the Department of Transportation, reached in May 1979, with respect to the protections to be applied for such grants. The Special Warranty provides fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interests of employees and meets the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5333(b). The Special Warranty Arrangement applicable to OTRB and Other Than Urbanized grants will be derived from the terms and conditions of the May 1979 Special Section 13(c) Warranty, and the Department's subsequent experience under 49 U.S.C. 5333(b). From time to time, the Department may update this Special Warranty Arrangement to reflect developments in the employee protection program.


(b) The requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5333(b) for OTRB and “Other Than Urbanized” grants are satisfied through application of a Special Warranty Arrangement certified by the Department of Labor; a copy of the current arrangement will be included on the OLMS *Web site.*

(c) The Federal Transit Administration will include the current version of the Special Warranty Arrangement, through reference in its Master Agreement, in each OTRB and Other Than Urbanized grant of assistance under the statute.


(1) The Federal Transit Administration will notify the Department that it is funding an OTRB or Other Than Urbanized grant by transmitting to the Department an information copy of each grant application upon approval of the grant.


(i) Each grant of assistance for an Other Than Urbanized program will contain a labor section identifying labor organizations representing transit employees of each subrecipient, the labor organizations representing employees of other transit providers in the service area, and a list of those transit providers. A sample format is posted on the OLMS *Web site* to facilitate the inclusion of this information in the grant application.


(ii) OTRB grants of assistance will contain a labor section identifying labor organizations representing employees of the recipient.


(2) The Department will notify labor organizations representing potentially affected transit employees of the approval of Other Than Urbanized and OTRB grants and inform them of their rights under the Special Warranty Arrangement.
