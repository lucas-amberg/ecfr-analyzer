# ยง 451.6   Extraterritorial application.

(a) It is not the purpose of the Act to impose on foreign labor organizations any regulation of the activities they carry on under the laws of the countries in which they are domiciled or have their principal place of business. The applicability of the Act is limited to the activities of persons or organizations within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The foregoing would be applicable, for example, to Canadian locals affiliated with international labor organizations organized within the United States.


(b) On the other hand, labor organizations otherwise subject to the Act are not relieved of the requirements imposed upon them with respect to actions taken by them in the United States or which will have effect in the United States, by virtue of the fact that they have foreign members or affiliates that participate in these actions. For example, a national or international labor organization which conducts its required election of officers by referendum or at a convention of delegates must comply with the election provisions of the Act, 
16 even though members of foreign locals participate in the balloting, or delegates of foreign locals participate in the election at the convention.


(c) Similarly, the provisions of the Act with respect to imposition of trusteeships 
17 are applicable to United States national or international labor organizations subject to this Act even though the action of the United States organization is taken with respect to a foreign local.
