# ยง 452.36   Reasonableness of qualifications.

(a) The question of whether a qualification is reasonable is a matter which is not susceptible of precise definition, and will ordinarily turn on the facts in each case. However, court decisions in deciding particular cases have furnished some general guidelines. The Supreme Court in *Wirtz* v. *Hotel, Motel and Club Employees Union, Local 6,* 391 U.S. 492 at 499 (1968) held that:


(b) Some factors to be considered, therefore, in assessing the reasonableness of a qualification for union office are:


(1) The relationship of the qualification to the legitimate needs and interests of the union;


(2) The relationship of the qualification to the demands of union office;


(3) The impact of the qualification, in the light of the Congressional purpose of fostering the broadest possible participation in union affairs;


(4) A comparison of the particular qualification with the requirements for holding office generally prescribed by other labor organizations; and


(5) The degree of difficulty in meeting a qualification by union members.
