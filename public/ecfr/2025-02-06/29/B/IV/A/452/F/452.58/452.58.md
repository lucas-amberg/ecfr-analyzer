# ยง 452.58   Self-nomination.

A system of self-nomination, if this is the only method for making nominations, deprives union members of a reasonable opportunity to nominate candidates and thus is inconsistent with the provisions of title IV. 
34 Self-nomination is permissible only if the members are afforded additional methods whereby they may nominate the candidates of their choice.
