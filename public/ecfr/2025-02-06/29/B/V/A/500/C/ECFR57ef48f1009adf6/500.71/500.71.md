# ยง 500.71   Utilization of only registered farm labor contractors.

The Act prohibits any person from utilizing the services of a farm labor contractor to supply migrant or seasonal agricultural workers without first taking reasonable steps to determine that the farm labor contractor possesses a valid Certificate of Registration, issued pursuant to the Act, which authorizes the activity for which the contractor is to be utilized. This prohibition also applies to a farm labor contractor who wishes to utilize the services of another farm labor contractor (see ยง 500.41). In making the determination about a contractor's registration status, a person may rely upon the contractor's possession of a Certificate of Registration which on its face is valid and which authorizes the activity for which the contractor is utilized. A person has the alternative to confirm the contractor's registration through the central registry maintained by the United States Department of Labor.
