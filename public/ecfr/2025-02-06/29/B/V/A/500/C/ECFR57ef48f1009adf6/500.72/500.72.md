# § 500.72   Agreements with workers.

(a) The Act prohibits farm labor contractors, agricultural employers and agricultural associations from violating, without justification, the terms of any working arrangements they have made with migrant or seasonal agricultural workers. Normally, “without justification” would not include situations in which failure to comply with the terms of any working arrangements was directly attributable to acts of God, due to conditions beyond the control of the person or to conditions which he could not reasonably foresee.


(b) Written agreements do not relieve any person of any responsibility that the person would otherwise have under the Act or these regulations.
