# § 500.130   Application and scope of safety and health requirement.

(a) Each person who owns or controls a facility or real property which is used as housing for any migrant agricultural worker must ensure that the facility or real property complies with all substantive Federal and State safety and health standards applicable to such housing.

(b) A farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, agricultural association or any other person is deemed an “owner” of a housing facility or real property if said person has a legal or equitable interest in such facility or real property.


(c) A farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, agricultural association or any other person is in “control” of a housing facility or real property, regardless of the location of such facility, if said person is in charge of or has the power or authority to oversee, manage, superintend or administer the housing facility or real property either personally or through an authorized agent or employee, irrespective of whether compensation is paid for engaging in any of the aforesaid capacities.


(d) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the agency of the U.S. Department of Labor which administers the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 651 *et seq.*) which provides for the establishment of safety and health standards generally.


(e) The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is the agency of the U.S. Department of Labor which administers the U.S. Employment Service pursuant to the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 *et seq.*) including the interstate clearance order system.
