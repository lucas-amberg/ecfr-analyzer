# ยง 505.3   Prevailing minimum compensation.

(a)(1) In the absence of an alternative determination made by the Administrator under paragraph (b) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the prevailing minimum compensation required to be paid under the Act to the various professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel employed on projects or productions assisted by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities shall be the compensation (including fringe benefits) contained in collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the following national or international labor organizations or their local affiliates:


(2) Professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel who are to perform activities which do not come within the jurisdiction of any collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the labor organizations named in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be paid minimum compensation as determined by agreement of the grant applicant or grantee and the personnel who will perform such activities or their representatives. Evidence of the agreement reached by the parties shall be submitted by the grant applicant to the grant agency, together with evidence of the prevailing minimum compensation for similar activities. If the parties do not agree on the minimum compensation to be paid to such personnel, the matter shall be referred to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for final determination.


(b)(1) Interested parties, including grant applicants, grantees, professional performers or related or supporting professional personnel and their representatives, may at any time submit to the Administrator a request for a determination of prevailing minimum compensation. The Administrator will make a determination concerning each such request in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(2) Any request for a determination of prevailing minimum compensation shall include or be accompanied by information as to the locality or localities, the class or classes of professional performers or related or supporting professional personnel for the project or production in question, the names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties, and all available information relating to prevailing minimum compensation currently being paid to such persons or to persons employed in similar activities. No particular form is prescribed for submission of information under this section.


(3) If the information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not submitted with a request for an alternative determination of prevailing minimum compensation or is insufficient to permit a determination, the Administrator may deny the request or request additional information, at the Administrator's discretion. Pertinent information from any source may be considered by the Administrator in connection with any request.


(4) The Administrator will respond to a request for determination under this section within 30 days of receipt, by issuing a determination of alternative prevailing minimum compensation or denying the request or advising that additional time is necessary for a decision. If the Administrator determines from a preponderance of all relevant evidence obtained in connection with the request that the compensation provided for in the agreements negotiated by the labor organizations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section does not prevail for any professional performer or related or supporting professional personnel employed on similar activities in the locality, the Administrator will issue a determination of the prevailing minimum compensation required to be paid under the Act to such persons. If the Administrator finds that the compensation provided for in the agreements negotiated by the labor organizations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section does prevail for the professional performers or related or supporting professional personnel in question, the requesting party will be so notified.


(c) All professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel (other than laborers or mechanics with respect to whom labor standards are prescribed in section 5(j) and 7(j) of the Act) employed on projects or productions which are financed in whole or in part under section 5 or section 7 of the Act will be paid, without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, not less than the prevailing minimum compensation determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, unless an alternative determination is made under paragraph (b) of this section. Pending the decision of the Administrator on a request for determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the grantee may be required to set aside in a separate escrow account sufficient funds to satisfy the difference between the compensation (including fringe benefits) actually paid to the employee(s) in question, and the compensation (including fringe benefits) required under the applicable collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the labor organization named in paragraph (a) of this section, or furnish a bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the Administrator for the protection of the compensation of the affected employees.
