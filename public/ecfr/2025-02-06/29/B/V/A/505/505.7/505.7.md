# ยง 505.7   Failure to comply.

The Secretary's representatives shall maintain a list of those grantees who are considered to be responsible for instances of failure to comply with the obligation of the grantees specified in section 5(i) (1) and (2) and section 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act, which are considered to have been willful or of such nature as to cast doubt on the reliability of formal assurances subsequently given and there shall be maintained a similar list where adjustment of the violations satisfactory to the Secretary was not properly made. Assurances from persons or organizations placed on either such list or any organization in which they have a substantial interest shall be considered inadequate for purposes of receiving further grants for a period not to exceed three (3) years from the date of notification by the Secretary that they have been placed on the lists unless, by appropriate application to the Secretary, they demonstrate a current responsibility to comply with section 5(i) (1) and (2) and section 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act, and demonstrate that correction of the violations has been made.
