# Appendix B to Part 510—Nonmanufacturing Industries Eligible for Minimum Wage Phase-In


This appendix contains a listing of all non-manufacturing industries (except those in major groups 01, 02, 08, and 09, pertaining to agriculture) for which data were collected and compiled by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for purposes of implementing the 1989 Amendments to FLSA. This listing follows the order and classifications used in the *SIC Manual, 1987,* which is incorporated by reference in these regulations (§ 510.21).


The data in this appendix are presented by major industry group (two-digit classification), industry group number (three-digit classification), and industry number (four-digit classification).


Tiers will not be listed for industry categories in which there were fewer than three responding employers, or one responding employer had more than 80 percent of the employment in the category, in conformance with practices of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in collecting and publishing similar data, until such time as Puerto Rico receives appropriate waivers of confidentiality from all employers in such categories. These categories are noted with an “a” on the following table. In situations where one or more employers declined to furnish a waiver, categories are noted with a “b” on the following table.


In addition, no tier will be listed where an industry was not included in the original survey because it was not in existence, because the industry was too small to be included, or for other reasons.


Employers who do not find the four-digit classification for their industry shall refer to the appropriate three-digit classification under which their establishment falls. If the appropriate three-digit classification is not listed, employers shall refer to the appropriate two-digit classification.


For example, no tier is listed for industry number 1423, crushed and broken granite. However, a tier is listed for industry group 142, crushed and broken stone, including riprap. Thus, an employer in industry 1423 must use the tier listed for industry group 142, *i.e.,* Tier 1. Furthermore, employers who find the appropriate four-digit designation in this appendix *must* use that designation and cannot refer to a two- or three-digit classification. For example, an employer with industry number 5719, miscellaneous homefurnishings stores, which has a Tier 1 designation, cannot refer to industry group number 571, home furniture and furnishings stores, which has a Tier 2 designation.


*Important:* In referring to this appendix to determine appropriate tier designations, please note that certain categories of employees are subject to treatment under Tier 1 regardless of the average hourly wage rate for the industry and the tier designation contained herein. These employees, as listed in the 1989 Amendments, are those employed by:


(a) The United States,


(b) An establishment that is a hotel, motel, or restaurant, or


(c) Any other retail or service establishment that employs such employee in connection with the preparation or offering of food or beverages for human consumption, either on the premises, or by such services as catering, banquet, box lunch, or curb or counter service, to the public, to employees, or to members or guests of clubs.


Please note that these named categories may not correspond exactly to categories established by the SIC manual.


If no four-digit, three-digit, or two-digit classification is listed for an industry, employers in that group must pay the Tier 1 rates.
