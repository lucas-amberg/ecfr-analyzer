Before any certificate is cancelled, however, interested parties shall be notified in writing of the facts warranting such cancellation and afforded an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance. In appropriate circumstances, the Administrator shall afford an opportunity for a hearing to resolve the disputed matter.
