# ยง 551.6   Action on petition.

(a) Upon the filing of a petition as provided in this part, the Administrator will give consideration thereto, and make any further inquiry into the facts that he may deem necessary. The Administrator may require, before taking further action thereof, that notice of the petition be given to affected employees in such manner as he shall determine to be appropriate to afford them an opportunity to submit any facts or reasons supporting or opposing the finding prayed for in the petition. If the Administrator determines that the petition fails to satisfy any of the requirements of this part, he shall deny the request for a finding or, in his discretion, advise petitioners that further consideration will be given to the submission if the deficiencies are remedied within a specified time. No further consideration will be given, however, to a request for a finding if the Administrator determines that the factual situation as described in the petition is not one in which authority to make the finding is provided by section 13(b)(11) and this part.


(b) If the Administrator determines that a petition meets all requirements of this part and if he is satisfied from consideration of all relevant facts and information available to him that the wage payment plan submitted has, within the meaning of section 13(b)(11) of the Act and this part, the general purpose and effect with respect to drivers or drivers' helpers making local deliveries, who are employed pursuant to its provisions on the basis of trip rates or other delivery payment plan, of reducing the hours worked by such employees to, or below, the maximum workweek applicable to them under section 7(a) of the Act, the Administrator will make an appropriate finding to this effect, and notify the petitioner; otherwise the request for such a finding will be denied.
