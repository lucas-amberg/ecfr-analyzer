# ยง 779.3   Pay standards for employees subject to previous coverage of the Act.

Before the 1966 amendments, the Act applied, as it still applies, to employees individually engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce, and to employees in certain enterprises, including enterprises in which retail sales of goods or services are made. The tests by which coverage based on the employee's individual activities is determined were not changed by the 1966 amendments and are described in subpart B of this part. An employee in an enterprise whose activities satisfy the conditions prescribed in the law prior to the 1966 amendments (discussed in subpart C) is covered under the present Act. Any employee whose employment satisfies the tests by which individual or enterprise coverage is determined under the Act prior to the 1966 amendments and who would not have come within some exemption in the law prior to the amendments is subject to the monetary provisions prescribed in the law for previously covered employees and is entitled to a minimum wage of at least $1.40 an hour beginning February 1, 1967, and not less than $1.60 an hour beginning February 1, 1968, unless expressly exempted by some provision of the amended Act. (In each instance where there is an increase in the minimum wage, the new minimum wage rate becomes effective 12:01 a.m., on the date indicated.) Such an employee is also entitled to overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times his regular rate of pay. (Minimum wage rates in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa are governed by special provisions of the Act. Information on these rates is available at any office of the Wage and Hour Division.)
