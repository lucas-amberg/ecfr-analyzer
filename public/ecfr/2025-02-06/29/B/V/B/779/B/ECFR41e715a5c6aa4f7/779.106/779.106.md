# § 779.106   Employees employed by an independent employer.

Where the work of an employee would be closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce if he were employed by a producer of the goods, the mere fact that the employee is employed by an independent employer will not justify a different answer. (See §§ 776.17(c) and 776.19 of this chapter.)
