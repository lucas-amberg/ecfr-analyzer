# § 779.243   Goods that have been “produced for commerce by any person.”

An employee will be considered to be handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods that have been “produced for commerce by any person” within the meaning of section 3(s), if he is performing the described activities with respect to goods which have been “produced for commerce” within the meaning of the Act. The term “produced” is defined in section 3(j) of the Act and, as explained above, has a well-established meaning under the existing law. (See § 779.104 and part 776 of this chapter.) The word as it is used in the context of the phrase “goods * * * produced for commerce by any person” in section 3(s) has the same meaning as in 3(j). Therefore, where goods are considered “produced for commerce” within the meaning of section 3(j) of the Act they also will be considered “produced for commerce” within the meaning of section 3(s). A discussion of when goods are produced for commerce within the meaning of section 3(j) is contained in § 779.108. Of course, within the meaning of section 3(s), the goods will be considered “produced for commerce” when they are so produced “by any person.”
