# ยง 779.267   Fluctuations in annual gross volume affecting enterprise coverage and establishment exemptions.

It is possible that the analysis performed at the beginning of each quarter to determine the applicability of the monetary provisions of the Act may reveal changes in the annual gross volume or other determinative factors which result in the enterprise or establishment meeting or ceasing to meet one or more of the tests for enterprise coverage or establishment exemption. Thus, enterprise coverage may result where the annual volume increases from an amount under to an amount over $250,000. Also, an enterprise having an annual gross volume of more than $1 million and meeting the requirements for a covered retail enterprise under the prior Act on the basis of previous sales analyses may fall below $1 million when the annual gross volume is computed at the beginning of the quarter being tested and as a result qualify only as a newly covered enterprise for the current quarter under the amended Act. Similarly, an enterprise previously subject to new coverage pay standards, having an annual gross volume of more than $250,000 but less than $1 million on the basis of previous sales analyses, may increase its annual gross volume to $1 million or more when recomputed at the beginning of the quarter being tested. It will thus become for the current quarter an enterprise in which employees are subject to the pay standards for employment covered under the Act prior to the amendments, provided that it meets the other conditions as discussed in ยง 779.245.
