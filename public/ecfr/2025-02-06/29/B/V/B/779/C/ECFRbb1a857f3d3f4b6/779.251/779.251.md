# § 779.251   Goods that have lost their out-of-State identity.

(a) Goods which are purchased or received by the enterprise within the State will not be considered goods which have “moved across State lines” if the goods, although they came from outside the State, had been processed or manufactured so as to have lost their identity as out-of-State goods before they are purchased or received by the enterprise. This assumes, of course, that the goods so manufactured or processed do not move across State lines before they are sold by the enterprise. Thus where an enterprise buys bread baked within the State which does not move across State lines before it is resold by the enterprise, the bread is not “goods, which have moved across State lines” even if the flour and other ingredients came from outside the State. The same conclusion will follow, under the same circumstances, where clothing is manufactured from out-of-State fabrics.


(b) In those cases where goods are composed in part of goods which have, and in part of goods which have not, moved across State lines, the entire product will be considered as goods which have moved across State lines, if, as a practical matter, it substantially consists of goods which are identifiable as out-of-State goods. Whether goods have been so changed as to have lost their out-of-State identity is question which will depend upon all the facts in a particular case.
