(b) *Section 13(a)(4).* An establishment which makes or processes lumber and building materials which it sells may qualify as an exempt establishment under section 13(a)(4) of the Act if it meets all the requirements (see *Arnold* v. *Kanowsky,* 361 U.S. 388) of that exemption. It must appear that:


(1) The establishment qualifies as an exempt retail establishment under section 13(a)(2) (see paragraph (a) of this section and § 779.350); and


(2) The establishment is recognized as a retail establishment in the industry (see § 779.347 and paragraph (c) of this section); and

(c) *Establishments recognized as retail in the industry.* An establishment which meets the requirements for exemption under section 13(a)(4) which are stated in paragraphs (b)(1), (3), and (4) of this section is recognized as retail establishment in the industry within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section if its annual dollar volume of sales of goods made or processed at the establishment does not exceed 50 percent of the annual dollar volume which it derives from sales that are recognized as retail and are not made for resale.


(d) *Establishments lacking a “retail concept.*” The exemptions provided by sections 13(a)(2) and 13(a)(4) of the Act do not apply to establishments in an industry in which there is no traditional concept of retail selling or servicing (see § 779.316), such as the establishment of a building contractor (see § 779.317; *Goldberg* v. *Dakota Flooring Co.,* 15 WH Cases 305), or a factory (see § 779.347).
