# § 779.507   Fourteen-year minimum.

(a) *Prohibited occupations.* With respect to employment in occupations other than manufacturing and mining, the Secretary is authorized to issue regulations or orders lowering the age minimum to 14 years where he finds that such employment is confined to periods which will not interfere with the minors' schooling and to conditions which will not interfere with their health and well-being. Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary permits the employment of 14- and 15-year-old children in a limited number of occupations where the work is performed outside school hours and is confined to other specified limits. Under the provisions of Child Labor Regulations, subpart C (§§ 570.31 through 570.38 of this chapter), employment of minors in this age group is not permitted in the following occupations:


(1) Manufacturing, mining, or processing occupations including occupations requiring the performance of any duties in a workroom or workplace where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise processed;


(2) Occupations involving the operation or tending of hoisting apparatus or of any power-driven machinery other than office machines;


(3) The operation of motor vehicles or service as helpers on such vehicles;


(4) Public messenger service;


(5) Occupations declared to be particularly hazardous or detrimental to health or well-being by the Secretary;


(6) Occupations in connection with (i) transportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline, or other means; (ii) warehousing and storage; (iii) communications and public utilities; and (iv) construction (including demolition and repair). Office and sales work performed in connection with the occupations specified in this subparagraph is permitted if such work is not performed on trains or any other media of transportation or at the actual site of construction operations.


(b) *Permissible occupations; conditions.* Employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in all occupations other than those in paragraph (a) of this section is permitted by the regulation under certain conditions specified in the regulation. The permissible occupations for minors between 14 and 16 years of age in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments are listed in § 570.34. The periods and conditions of employment for such minors are set out in § 570.35.
