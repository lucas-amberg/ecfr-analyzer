# § 780.148   “Any” practices meeting the requirements will qualify for exemption.

The language of section 3(f) of the Act, in defining the “secondary” meaning of “agriculture,” provides that any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such (his or its) farming operations are within the definition. The practices which may be exempt as “agriculture” if so performed are stated to include forestry or lumbering operations, preparation for market, and delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market. The specification of these practices is illustrative rather than limiting in nature. The broad language of the definition clearly includes all practices thus performed and not merely those named (see *Maneja* v. *Waialua,* 349 U.S. 254).
