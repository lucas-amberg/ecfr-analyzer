# ยง 780.317   Man-day exclusion.

Section 3(e)(2) specifically excludes from the employer's man-day total (as defined in section 3(u)) employees who qualify for exemption under section 13(a)(6)(C). (See ยง 780.301.) This man-day count is a basic factor in the application of the section 13(a)(6)(A) exemption. (See ยง 780.302 *et seq.*)
