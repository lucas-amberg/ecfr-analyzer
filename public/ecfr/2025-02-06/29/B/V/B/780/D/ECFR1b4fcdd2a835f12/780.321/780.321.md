Section 13(a)(6)(D) by its very terms is available only to employees 16 years of age or under. Accordingly, even though all the other tests of the exemption are met, the exemption is inapplicable in the case of an employee over 16 years of age and the employer must pay to such an employee the applicable statutory minimum wage unless his operations come within the reach of some other exemption, such as section 13(a)(6)(A). Furthermore, although section 13(a)(6)(D) provides a minimum wage and overtime exemption for minors 16 years of age or under, the employer must nevertheless comply with the child labor provisions of the Act prohibiting the employment of minors in agriculture except under certain conditions and circumstances. These provisons are discussed in part 1500, subpart G of this title.
