# ยง 780.724   Work exempt under another section of the Act.

Where an employee's employment during part of his workweek would qualify for exemption under section 13(b)(14) if it continued throughout the workweek, and the remainder of his workweek is spent in employment which, if it continued throughout the workweek, would qualify for exemption under another section or sections of the Act, the exemptions may be combined (see *Remington* v. *Shaw* (W.D. Mich.) 2 WH Cases 262). The employee, however, qualifies for exemption only to the extent of the exemption which is more limited in scope (see *Mitchell* v. *Hunt,* 263 F. 2d 913). For example, if part of the work is exempt from both minimum wage and overtime compensation under one section of the Act and the rest is exempt only from the overtime pay provisions under another section, the employee is exempt that week from the overtime provisions, but not from the minimum wage requirements. In this connection, attention is directed to another exemption in the Act which relates to work in grain elevators, which may apply in appropriate circumstances, either in combination with section 13(b)(14) or to employees for whom the requirements of section 13(b)(14) cannot be met. This other exemption is that provided by section 7(c). Section 7(c), which is discussed in part 526 of this chapter, provides a limited overtime exemption for employees employed in the seasonal industry of storing grain in country grain elevators, public terminal and sub-terminal elevators, wheat flour mills, nonelevator bulk storing establishments and flat warehouses, ยง 526.10(b)(14) of this chapter.
