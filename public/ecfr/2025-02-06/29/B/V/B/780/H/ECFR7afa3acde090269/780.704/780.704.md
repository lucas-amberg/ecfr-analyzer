# § 780.704   Dependence of exemption on nature of employing establishment.

If an employee is to be exempt under section 13(b)(14), he must be employed by an “establishment” which is “commonly recognized as a country elevator.” If he is employed by such an establishment, the fact that it may be part of a larger enterprise which also engages in activities that are not recognized as those of country elevators (see *Tobin* v. *Flour Mills,* 185 F. 2d 596) would not make the exemption inapplicable.
