# § 780.913   Nonexempt preparation.

(a) *Retail packing.* Since the exemption, as expressly stated in section 13(b)(16), includes the transportation of the fruits or vegetables only to places of first marketing or first processing, packing or preparing for retail or further distribution beyond the place of first processing or first marketing is not exempt as “preparation for transportation.” (*Schultz* v. *Durrence* (D. Ga.), 19 WH Cases 747, 63 CCH Lab. Cas. secs. 32, 387.)


(b) *Preparation for market.* No exemption is provided under section 13(b)(16) for operations performed on the farm in preparation for market (such as ripening, cleaning, grading, or sorting) rather than in preparation for the transportation described in the section. Exemption, if any, for these activities should be considered under sections 13(a)(6) and 13(b)(12). (See subparts D and E of this part 780.)


(c) *Processing or canning.* Processing is not exempt preparation for transportation. Thus, the canning of fruits or vegetables is not under section 13(b)(16).
