# § 780.1008   Examples of places not considered homes.

The following are examples of workplaces which, on examination, have been considered not to be a “home”:


(a) Living quarters allocated to and regularly used solely for production purposes, where workers work regular schedules and are under constant supervision by the employer, are not considered to be a home.


(b) While a convent, orphanage or similar institution is considered a home, an area in such place which is set aside for and used for sewing or other productive work under supervision is not a home.


(c) Where an employee performs work on wreaths in a home and also engages in work on the wreaths for the employer during that workweek in a factory, he is not exempt in that week, since some of his work is not performed in a home.
