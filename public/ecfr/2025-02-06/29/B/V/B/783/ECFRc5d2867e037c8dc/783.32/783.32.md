# § 783.32   “Seaman” includes crew members.

The term “seaman” includes members of the crew such as sailors, engineers, radio operators, firemen, pursers, surgeons, cooks, and stewards if, as is the usual case, their service is of the type described in § 783.31. In some cases it may not be of that type, in which event the special provisions relating to seamen will not be applicable (*Sternberg Dredging Co.* v. *Walling,* 158 F. 2d 678; *Cuascut* v. *Standard Dredging Co.,* 94 F. Supp. 197; *Woods Lumber Co.* v. *Tobin,* 199 F. 2d 455). However, an employee employed as a seaman does not lose his status as such simply because, as an incident to such employment, he performs some work not connected with operation of the vessel as a means of transportation, such as assisting in the loading or unloading of freight at the beginning or end of a voyage, if the amount of such work is not substantial.
