# § 784.16   “Regular rate.”

As explained in part 778 of this chapter, dealing with overtime compensation, employees subject to the overtime pay provisions of the Act must generally receive for their overtime work in any workweek as provided in the Act not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay. Section 7(e) of the Act defines the term “regular rate” “to include all remuneration for employment paid to, or on behalf of, the employee” except certain payments which are expressly described in and excluded by the statutory definition. This definition, which is discussed at length in part 778 of this chapter, determines the regular rate upon which time and one-half overtime compensation must be computed under section 7(a) of the Act for employees within its general coverage who are not exempt from the overtime provisions under either of the fishery and seafood exemptions provided by sections 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4) or under some other exemption contained in the Act.
