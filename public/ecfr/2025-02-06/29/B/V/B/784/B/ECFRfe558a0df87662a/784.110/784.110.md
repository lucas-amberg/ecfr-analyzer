# ยง 784.110   Performing operations both on nonaquatic products and named aquatic products.

By their terms, sections 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4) provide no exemption with respect to operations performed on any products other than the aquatic products named in these subsections (see ยง 784.107). Accordingly, neither of the exemptions is applicable to the making of any commodities from ingredients only part of which consist of such aquatic products, if a substantial amount of other products is contained in the commodity so produced (compare *Walling* v. *Bridgeman-Russell Co.,* 6 Labor Cases 61, 422, 2 WH Cases 785 (D. Minn.) and *Miller* v. *Litchfield Creamery Co.,* 11 Labor Cases 63, 274, 5 WH Cases 1039 (N.D. Ind.), with *Mitchell* v. *Trade Winds, Inc.,* 289 F. 2d 278). Thus, the first processing, canning, or processing of codfish cakes, clam chowder, dog food, crab cakes, or livestock food containing aquatic products is often not exempt within the meaning of the relevant exemptions.
