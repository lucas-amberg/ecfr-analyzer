# § 788.11   “Transporting [such] products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal.”

The transportation or movement of logs or other forestry products to a “mill processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal” is among the described operations. Loading and unloading, when performed by employees employed in the named operations, are included as exempt operations. Loading logs or other forestry products onto railroad cars or other transportation facilities for further shipment if performed as part of the exempt transportation will be considered a step in the exempt transportation (*Woods Lumber Co.* v. *Tobin,* 199 F. 2d 455 (C.A.5)). However, any other loading, transportation, or other activities performed in connection with the logs or other forestry products after they have been unloaded at one of the described destinations is not exempt. “Other transportation terminal” refers to any place where there are established facilities or equipment for the shipment or transportation of logs or other forestry products. Motor carrier yards, docks, wharves, or similar facilities are examples of other transportation terminals, but the place where logs are picked up by contract motor carriers or haulers at the site of the woods operations for transportation to the mill, processing plant, or railroad is not such a terminal.
