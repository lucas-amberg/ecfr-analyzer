# § 789.3   “* * * goods were produced in compliance with” * * * the requirements referred to.

It is apparent from the language of the statute and the statement appended to the Conference Report 
5 that the written assurance referred to is one with respect to specific goods in being, assuring the purchaser that the “goods in question were produced in compliance” with the requirements referred to in sections 12(a) and 15(a) (1). A written statement made prior to production of the particular goods is not the type of assurance contemplated by the statute.
