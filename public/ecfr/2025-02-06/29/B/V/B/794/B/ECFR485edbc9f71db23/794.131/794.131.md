# § 794.131   “Customer * * * engaged in bulk distribution”.

A sale to a customer of an enterprise engaged in the wholesale or bulk distribution of petroleum products will be considered to come within the 25 percent limitation for purposes of the exemption under section 7(b)(3) if it is made to a “customer who is engaged in the bulk distribution of such products for resale”. The identity of such customers is generally well known in the trade. For example, this would generally include other petroleum jobbers, brokers, wholesalers, and any others who engaged in the bulk distribution of petroleum products for resale. Thus a sale to a petroleum jobber who is engaged in selling petroleum products to gasoline stations would clearly be a sale to a customer described in section 7(b)(3). The essential tests are: first, that the customer must be one who is engaged in the distribution of “such products”, which means petroleum products; second, that he must engage in “the bulk distribution” of such products; and finally, that he must be engaged in such distribution “for resale”. These three requirements are discussed in §§ 794.132 through 794.134.
