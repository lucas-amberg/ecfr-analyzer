# § 794.133   “Bulk” distribution.

“Bulk” distribution of petroleum products typically connotes those methods of distribution in which large quantities of the product are distributed in a single delivery or delivery trip. Thus, “bulk” distribution includes deliveries from bulk storage facilities at the establishment to the tank truck of a customer (whether or not at “wholesale”). It also includes deliveries made in series on a single trip on a delivery route to the storage tanks or facilities of a number of customers from a bulk supply of the product transported by tank truck, motor transport, or other motor carrier operated by the enterprise. Such deliveries are to be contrasted with such typical small-quantity individual deliveries as those made into the tank of a motor vehicle for use in its propulsion.
