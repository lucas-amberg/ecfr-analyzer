# § 794.120   Meaning of “annual gross volume of sales.”

The annual gross volume of sales of an enterprise consists of its gross receipts from all types of sales during a 12-month period (§ 794.122). The gross volume derived from all sales transactions is included, and will embrace among other things receipts from service, credit, or similar charges. However, credits for goods returned or exchanged (as distinguished from “trade-ins”), rebates, discounts, and the like are not ordinarily included in the annual gross volume of sales. In determining whether the million dollar limit on annual gross sales volume is or is not exceeded, the sales volume from all the related activities which constitute the enterprise must be included; the dollar volume of the entire business in all establishments is added together. Thus, the gross volume of sales will include the receipts from sales made by any gasoline service stations of the enterprise, as well as the sales made by any other establishments of the enterprise. These principles and their application are considered in more detail in parts 776 and 779 of this chapter, which contain general discussions of “annual gross volume” as used in other provisions of the Act.
