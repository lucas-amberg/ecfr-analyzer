# ยง 810.105   Calculating the average hourly base wage rate.

(a) The average hourly base wage rate (also referred to in the USMCA as the production wage rate, and in the Uniform Regulations as the average base hourly wage rate) is calculated by dividing the total base wages paid for all hours worked in direct production at a plant or facility by the total number of hours worked in direct production at that plant or facility. The average hourly base wage rate must be at least US$16 per hour for the plant or facility to count toward a producer's LVC obligation.


(b) The three components of this calculation are computed as follows:


(1) *Hourly base wage rate* is the rate of compensation a worker is paid for each hour worked in direct production.


(i) Benefits, bonuses, premium payments, incentive pay, overtime premiums, and all other similar payments are excluded from the hourly base wage rate.


(ii) Amounts deducted from a worker's pay that are for the benefit of the worker and are reasonable may be included in the hourly base wage rate. The principles in determining whether deductions are for the benefit of the worker and are reasonable, and thus may be included as part of the hourly base wage rate, are explained in more detail in 29 CFR part 531.


(2) *Hours worked in direct production* means all time a worker spends personally involved in the production of passenger vehicles, light trucks, heavy trucks, or parts used in the production of these vehicles at a plant or facility located in a USMCA Country, or directly involved in the set-up, operation, or maintenance of equipment or tools used in the production of those vehicles or parts at that plant or facility. The total number of hours worked in direct production at a plant or facility, as referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, is calculated by adding together hours in direct production (as calculated under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii)) for all workers who perform direct production work at that plant or facility.


(i) Except for workers described in ยง 810.130, if at least 85 percent of a worker's total work hours are hours worked in direct production, the worker's total work hours are considered hours worked in direct production, and are included in the average hourly base wage rate calculation.


(ii) Except for workers described in ยง 810.130, if less than 85 percent of a worker's total work hours are hours worked in direct production, only the worker's hours worked in direct production are included in the average hourly base wage rate calculation.


(3) *Total base wages* is calculated using a two-step process. First, multiply each worker's hourly base wage rate (for the time period described in paragraph (d) of this section) by that worker's number of hours worked in direct production at that rate (for the same time period). Second, add the values calculated in step one to obtain total base wages paid for all hours worked in direct production at the plant or facility.


(c) The producer must include all hours worked in direct production at a plant or facility (other than by workers described in ยง 810.130) when calculating the average hourly base wage rate for that plant or facility. Where a worker is paid by a third party (such as a temporary employment agency), only the wages received by the worker are included in the average hourly base wage rate calculation.


(d) The producer must elect one of the following periods to calculate the average hourly base wage rate:


(1) The producer's previous fiscal year;


(2) The previous calendar year;


(3) The quarter or month to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported;


(4) The producer's fiscal year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported; or


(5) The calendar year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported.
