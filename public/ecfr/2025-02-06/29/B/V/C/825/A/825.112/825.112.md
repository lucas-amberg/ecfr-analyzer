# § 825.112   Qualifying reasons for leave, general rule.

(a) *Circumstances qualifying for leave.* Employers covered by FMLA are required to grant leave to eligible employees:


(1) For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child (*see* § 825.120);


(2) For placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care (*see* § 825.121);


(3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition (*see* §§ 825.113 and 825.122);


(4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's job (*see* §§ 825.113 and 825.123);


(5) Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty status (*see* §§ 825.122 and 825.126); and


(6) To care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the covered servicemember. *See* §§ 825.122 and 825.127.


(b) *Equal application.* The right to take leave under FMLA applies equally to male and female employees. A father, as well as a mother, can take family leave for the birth, placement for adoption, or foster care of a child.


(c) *Active employee.* In situations where the employer/employee relationship has been interrupted, such as an employee who has been on layoff, the employee must be recalled or otherwise be re-employed before being eligible for FMLA leave. Under such circumstances, an eligible employee is immediately entitled to further FMLA leave for a qualifying reason.
