(2) It must provide that the award of the arbitrator(s) under the interest arbitration procedure is final and binding on both parties.


(3) It must provide a fixed and determinate method for selecting the impartial interest arbitrator(s).

(b) The parties to a dispute who have agreed to such an interest arbitration procedure should jointly submit a copy of their agreed upon procedure to the appropriate regional office of the Service at as early a date as possible, but in any event prior to the appointment of BoI by the Service. See ยง 1420.5(f) for the addresses of regional offices.
