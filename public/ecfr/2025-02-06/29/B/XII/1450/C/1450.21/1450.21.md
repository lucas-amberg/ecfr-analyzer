(8) The method and time period for petitioning for a hearing;


(9) That the timely filing of a petition for hearing will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;


(10) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;


(11) That any knowingly false, misleading, or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:

(12) Any other right and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and


(13) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, that amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owned to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee.


(b) Notifications under this section shall be hand delivered with a record made of the date and time of delivery, or shall be mailed by certified mail return receipt requested.


(c) No notification, hearing, written responses or final decisions under this regulation are required of FMCS for any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage under a Federal benefit program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.
