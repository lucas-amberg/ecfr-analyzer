# ยง 1450.23   Deduction from pay.

(a) Deduction by salary offset, from an employee's current disposable pay, shall be subject to the following conditions:


(1) Ordinarily, debts to the United States should be collected in full, in one lump-sum. This will be done when funds are available. However, if funds are unavailable for payment in one lump sum, or if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection will normally be made in installments.


(2) The installments shall not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.


(3) Deduction will generally commence with the next full pay interval (ordinarily the next biweekly pay period) following written consent by the employee to salary offset, waiver of hearing, or the decision issued by the hearing officer.


(4) Installment deductions must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment except as provided in ยง 1450.24.
