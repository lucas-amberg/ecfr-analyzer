# ยง 1603.203   Unavailability or withdrawal of administrative law judges.

(a) In the event the administrative law judge designated to conduct the hearing becomes unavailable or withdraws from the adjudication, another administrative law judge may be designated for the purpose of further hearing or issuing a decision on the record as made, or both. At any time administrative law judges deem themselves disqualified, they may withdraw from an adjudication.


(b) Prior to issuance of a decision on the complaint, any party may move that the administrative law judge withdraw on the grounds of personal bias or other disqualification by filing with the administrative law judge an affidavit setting forth in detail the matters alleged to constitute grounds for withdrawal promptly upon discovery of the alleged facts. The administrative law judge shall rule upon the motion for withdrawal. If the administrative law judge concludes that the motion was filed promptly and has merit, the administrative law judge shall immediately withdraw from the adjudication. If the administrative law judge does not withdraw, the adjudication shall proceed.
