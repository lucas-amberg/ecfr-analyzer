(a) Interlocutory review may not be sought except when the administrative law judge determines either independently or upon motion of a party that:


(1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; 


(2) An immediate appeal will materially advance the completion of the proceeding; and


(3) The denial of an immediate appeal will cause irreparable harm to the party or the public.


(b) Application for interlocutory review shall be filed within 10 days after notice of the administrative law judge's ruling. Any application for review shall:


(1) Designate the ruling or part thereof from which appeal is being taken; and


(2) Contain arguments or evidence that tend to establish one or more of the grounds for interlocutory review contained in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) Any party opposing the application for interlocutory review shall file a response to the application within 10 days after service of the application. The applicant shall have no right to reply to a response unless the administrative law judge orders that a reply be filed.


(d) The administrative law judge shall promptly certify in writing any ruling that qualifies for interlocutory review under paragraph (a) of this section.


(e) The filing of an application for interlocutory review and the grant of an application shall not stay proceedings before the administrative law judge unless the administrative law judge or the Commission so orders. The Commission shall not consider a motion for a stay unless the motion was first made to the administrative law judge.
