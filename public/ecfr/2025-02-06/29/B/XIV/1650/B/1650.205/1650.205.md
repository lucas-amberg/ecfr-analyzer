# ยง 1650.205   Consideration of evidence submitted as a result of notification of intent.

(a) *Consideration of evidence.* If, as a result of the notification of intent, EEOC receives notice that the debtor will submit additional evidence or receives additional evidence from the debtor within the prescribed time period, collection will be stayed until EEOC:


(1) Considers the evidence presented by the debtor;


(2) Determines whether all or a portion of the debt is still past-due and legally enforceable; and


(3) Notifies the debtor of its determination.


(b) *Notification to the debtor.* Following its review of the evidence, EEOC will issue a written decision notifying the debtor whether EEOC has sustained, amended, or canceled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. The notice will advise the debtor of any further action to be taken, such as any modification of the debt amount and/or referral of the debt to Treasury, and explain the supporting rationale for the decision.
