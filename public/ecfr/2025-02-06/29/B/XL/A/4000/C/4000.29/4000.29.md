# § 4000.29   What if I use electronic delivery?

(a) *In general.* Your filing or issuance date is the date you electronically transmit your submission or issuance to the proper address if you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Note that we always treat an advance notice of reportable event and a Form 200 (notice of certain missed contributions) as filed when received. A submission made through our Web site is considered to have been transmitted when you perform the last act necessary to indicate that your submission is filed and cannot be further edited or withdrawn. You do not have to address electronic submissions made through our Web site. We are responsible for ensuring that such submissions go to the proper place.


(1) *Filings.* For electronic filings, if you fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section, we may treat your submission as invalid. 


(2) *Issuances.* For electronic issuances, we may treat your issuance as invalid if— 


(i) You fail to meet the requirements (“using measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt”) of § 4000.13(a), or 


(ii) You fail to meet the contact information requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 


(b) *Requirements.* To get the filing date under paragraph (a) of this section, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3). To get the issuance date under paragraph (a), you must meet the requirement of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3). 


(1) *Technical requirements for filings.* For filings, your electronic submission must comply with any technical requirements for that type of submission (our Web site, *http://www.pbgc.gov,* identifies the technical requirements for each type of filing). 


(2) *Technical requirements for issuances.* For issuances, you must comply with the safe-harbor method under § 4000.14. 


(3) *Identify contact person.* For an e-mail submission or issuance with an attachment, you must include, in the body of your e-mail, the name and telephone number of the person to contact if we or the intended recipient needs you to resubmit your filing or issuance. 


(c) *Failure to meet address requirement.* If you send your electronic submission or issuance to the wrong address (but you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section), your filing or issuance date is the date of receipt at the proper address.
