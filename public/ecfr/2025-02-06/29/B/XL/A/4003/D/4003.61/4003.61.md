# § 4003.61   Action by a single Appeals Board member.

(a) *Authority to act.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any member of the Appeals Board has the authority to take any action that the Appeals Board could take with respect to a routine appeal as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(b) *Routine appeal defined.* For purposes of this section, a routine appeal is any appeal that does not raise a significant issue of law or a precedent-setting issue. This would generally include any appeal that—


(1) Is outside the jurisdiction of the Appeals Board (for example, an appeal challenging the plan's termination date); 


(2) Is filed by a person other than an aggrieved person or an aggrieved person's authorized representative; 


(3) Is untimely and presents no grounds for waiver or extension of the time limit for filing the appeal, or only grounds that are clearly without merit; 


(4) Presents grounds that clearly warrant or clearly do not warrant the relief requested; 


(5) Presents only factual issues that are not reasonably expected to affect other appeals (for example, the participant's date of birth or date of hire); or 


(6) Presents only issues that are controlled by settled principles of existing law, including Appeals Board precedent (for example, an issue of plan interpretation that has been resolved by the Appeals Board in a decision on an appeal by another participant in the same plan).
