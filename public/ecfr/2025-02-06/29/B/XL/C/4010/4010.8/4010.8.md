(b) *Alternative methods of compliance*—(1) *At-risk funding target.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a filer is not required to provide the information specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section for the plan year for which actuarial information is being reported unless PBGC requests in writing that the information be provided, in which case the filer must provide the information within 30 days of such request or such later date as PBGC specifies in the request.


(2) *Actuarial valuation report.* If any of the information specified in paragraph (a)(11) of this section is not available by the date specified in § 4010.10(a), a filer may satisfy the requirement to provide such information by—


(i) Including a statement, with the material that is submitted to PBGC, that the filer will file the unavailable information by the alternative due date specified in § 4010.10(b), and


(ii) Filing such information (along with a certification by an enrolled actuary under paragraph (a)(12) of this section) with PBGC by that alternative due date.


(c) *Exempt plan.* The actuarial information specified in this section is not required with respect to a plan if the plan satisfies the conditions in paragraph (c)(1) through (3).


(1) The plan—


(i) Has fewer than 500 participants as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year or as of the valuation date for that plan year and has a 4010 funding shortfall (as defined in § 4010.11(a)(1)) for the plan year ending within the information year that is not in excess of $15 million, or


(ii) Has benefit liabilities as of the end of the plan year ending within the filer's information year, (determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section) equal to or less than the fair market value of the plan's assets.


(2) The plan has received, by or within ten days after the due dates, all required installments or other payments required to be made during the information year under ERISA sections 302 and 303 and Code sections 412 and 430.


(3) The plan has no outstanding minimum funding waivers (as described in § 4010.4(a)(3)) as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year.


(d) *Value of benefit liabilities.* The value of a plan's benefit liabilities at the end of a plan year must be determined using the plan census data described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the actuarial assumptions and methods described in paragraph (d)(2) or, where applicable, (d)(3) of this section.


(1) *Census data*—(i) *Census data period.* Plan census data must be determined (for all plans for any information year) either as of the end of the plan year or as of the beginning of the next plan year.


(ii) *Projected census data.* If actual plan census data are not available, a plan may use a projection of plan census data from a date within the plan year. The projection must be consistent with projections used to measure pension obligations of the plan for financial statement purposes and must give a result appropriate for the end of the plan year for these obligations. For example, adjustments to the projection process are required where there has been a significant event (such as a plan amendment or a plant shutdown) that has not been reflected in the projection data.


(2) *Actuarial assumptions and methods.* The value of benefit liabilities must be determined using the rules in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) *Benefits to be valued.* Benefits to be valued include all benefits earned or accrued under the plan as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year and other benefits payable from the plan including, but not limited to, ancillary benefits and retirement supplements, regardless of whether such benefits are protected by the anti-cutback provisions of section 411(d)(6) of the Code.


(ii) *Actuarial assumptions.* The value of benefit liabilities must be determined using the actuarial assumptions described in the following table:


(iii) *Future service.* Future service expected to be accrued by an active participant in an ongoing plan during future employment (based on the assumptions used to determine benefit liabilities) must be included in determining the earliest and unreduced retirement ages used to determine the expected retirement age and in determining an active participant's entitlement to early retirement subsidies and supplements at the expected retirement age. See the examples in paragraph (e) of this section.


(3) *Special actuarial assumptions for exempt plan determination.* Solely for purposes of determining whether a plan is an exempt plan for an information year, the value of benefit liabilities may be determined using the same retirement assumptions as used to determine the minimum required contribution under section 303 of ERISA and section 430 of the Code for the plan year ending within that information year without regard to the at-risk assumptions of section 303(i) of ERISA and section 430(i) of the Code.


(e) *Examples.* The following examples demonstrate how XRA is determined and applied for purposes of determining benefit liabilities under paragraph (d) of this section:


(1) *Example 1*—(i) *Facts.* Plan X has a normal retirement age of 65, but allows benefits to commence as early as age 55 for participants who complete at least 10 years of service before termination. Early retirement benefits are reduced for participants with fewer than 25 years of service. Employee A is an active participant who is age 40 and has completed 5 years of service. Assume the “medium” XRA look-up table applies, and that for purposes of § 4010.8(d), the filer has decided not to take pre-retirement decrements other than mortality table into account as permitted under § 4010.8(d)(2)(i).


(ii) *Determination of XRA.* If A continues working, the earliest age A could start receiving benefit is age 55. Therefore, A's earliest retirement age at valuation (ERA) is 55. Because the earliest that A can receive an unreduced benefit is when A completed 25 years of service (at age 60), A's URA is age 60. Under the medium XRA look-up table, A's XRA is 58.


(iii) *Determination of Benefit Liabilities.* The benefit liability is the present value of A's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming A retires at age 58 and elects to have benefits commence immediately. Since A will not be eligible to receive unreduced benefits at that time, the accrued benefit is reduced in accordance with the plan's early retirement reduction provisions, including any subsidies to which A will be entitled under the assumption that A works until age 58.


(2) *Example 2.* Employee B is also an active participant in plan X and is age 40 with 15 years of service. B will complete 25 years of service at age 50. However, because the plan does not allow for benefit commencement before age 55, B's ERA, URA and thus, XRA are all age 55. The benefit liability is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B retires at age 55 and elects to commence benefits immediately. Since B will be eligible to receive an unreduced benefit at that time, the full unreduced benefit amount is valued.


(3) *Example 3*—(i) *Facts.* Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that for purposes of § 4010.8(d), the filer has decided to take pre-retirement decrements other than mortality into account as permitted under § 4010.8(d)(2)(i). Assume the only pre-retirement decrement other than mortality is turnover. The plan's turnover rates go from age 21 to age 54, and the retirement rates go from age 55 to age 65.


(ii) *Determination of XRA.* If A terminates employment at or before age 45, A will not be eligible to receive benefits until age 65. Therefore, the portion of Employee A that is assumed to terminate before age 45 has an ERA, URA, and XRA of age 65. The portion of A that remains in service to age 45, after the application of the applicable turnover decrements, and then terminates at or after age 45, but before age 55, will be entitled to receive a reduced benefit as early as 55. Therefore, the portion of A that is assumed to terminate during this period has an ERA of 55, a URA of 65 and an XRA of 60. Since the turnover rates stop at age 55, the portion of A that remains in service to age 55 is assumed to remain in service until the XRA for that portion of A. For that portion of A, the ERA is 55, the URA is 60 and the XRA is 58. (For purposes of § 4010.8(d), the plan's assumed retirement rates are replaced by XRAs.)


(iii) *Determination of benefit liabilities.* The benefit liability of A is the sum of the present value of A's full accrued benefit at age 65 for the portion of A that terminates between age 40 and age 45, the present value of A's accrued benefit reduced for commencement at age 60 for the portion of A that terminates between age 45 and age 54, and the present value of A's accrued benefit reduced for commencement at age 58 for the portion of A that remains employed until age 55.


(4) *Example 4.* Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee B, the sole active participant, is age 40 with 15 years of service. The portion of B that is assumed to terminate before age 50 would be entitled to receive a reduced benefit as early as age 55 or an unreduced benefit at age 65. That portion of B has an ERA of 55, a URA of 65, and an XRA of 60. The benefit liability for that portion of B is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B commences a reduced benefit at age 60. The portion of B that survives to age 50 would be entitled to receive an unreduced benefit as early as age 55. That portion of B has an ERA, URA and XRA of 55. The benefit liability for this portion of B is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B retires and commences unreduced payments at age 55.


(f) *Multiple employer plans.* If, with respect to a multiple employer plan, the actuarial information required under this section 4010 for the plan year ending within the filer's information year has been filed under part 4010 by another filer, the filer may include this actuarial information by reference. The filer must report the name, EIN and plan number of the multiple employer plan and the name of the other filer that submitted this information.


(g) *Previous filing for plan year.* If the actuarial information for the plan year as required under this § 4010.8 has been submitted by the filer in a previous 4010 submission, the filing may include that actuarial information by reference to the previous submission.


(h) *Plans subject to special funding rules.* Instead of the requirements of paragraph (a)(11) of this section:


(1) In the case of a plan year for which a plan is subject to section 402(b) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280, dealing with certain frozen plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline caterers, the plan must meet the requirements in connection with the actuarial valuation report in accordance with instructions on PBGC's Web site, *http://www.pbgc.gov.*

(2) In the case of a plan year for which the application of new funding rules is deferred for a plan under section 104 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280, as amended by the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, Public Law 111-192, dealing with eligible charity plans and plans of certain rural cooperatives, the plan must meet the requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section (in connection with the actuarial valuation report) in effect as of December 31, 2007.


(3) In the case of a plan year for which a plan is subject to the Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act, Public Law 113-97, dealing with certain defined benefit pension plans maintained by more than one employer, the plan must meet the requirements in connection with the actuarial valuation report in accordance with instructions on PBGC's Web site, *http://www.pbgc.gov.*
