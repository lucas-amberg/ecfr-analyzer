# § 4022.8   Form of payment.

(a) *In general.* Except as provided in § 4022.7 (relating to the payment of lump sums), the PBGC will pay benefits— 


(1) In the automatic PBGC form described in paragraph (b) of this section; or 


(2) If an optional PBGC form described in paragraph (c) of this section is elected, in that optional form. 


(b) *Automatic PBGC form*—(1) *Participants*—(i) *Married participants.* The automatic PBGC form with respect to a participant who is married at the time the benefit enters pay status is the form a married participant would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election. 


(ii) *Unmarried participants.* The automatic PBGC form with respect to a participant who is unmarried at the time the benefit enters pay status is the form an unmarried person would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election. 


(2) *Beneficiaries*—(i) *QPSA beneficiaries.* The automatic PBGC form with respect to the spouse of a married participant in a plan with a termination date on or after August 23, 1984, who dies before his or her benefit enters pay status is the qualified preretirement survivor annuity such a spouse would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election. The PBGC will not charge the participant or beneficiary for this survivor benefit coverage for the time period beginning on the plan's termination date (regardless of whether the plan would have charged). 


(ii) *Alternate payees.* The automatic PBGC form with respect to an alternate payee with a separate interest under a qualified domestic relations order is the form an unmarried participant would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election. 


(c) *Optional PBGC forms*—(1) *Participant and beneficiary elections.* A participant may elect any optional form described in paragraphs (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section. A beneficiary described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (a QPSA beneficiary or an alternate payee) may elect any optional form described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iv) of this section. 


(2) *Permitted designees.* A participant or beneficiary, whether married or unmarried, who elects an optional form with a survivor feature (e.g., a 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity or, in the case of a participant, a joint-and-50%-survivor annuity) may designate either a spouse or a non-spouse beneficiary to receive survivor benefits. An optional joint-life form must be payable to a natural person or (with the consent of the PBGC) to a trust for the benefit of one or more natural persons. 


(3) *Spousal consent.* In the case of a participant who is married at the time the benefit enters pay status, the election of an optional form or the designation of a non-spouse beneficiary is valid only if the participant's spouse consents. 


(4) *Permitted optional single-life forms.* The PBGC may offer benefits in the following single-life forms: 


(i) A straight-life annuity; 


(ii) A 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity; 


(iii) A 10-year certain-and-continuous annuity; 


(iv) A 15-year certain-and-continuous annuity; and 


(v) The form an unmarried person would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election. 


(5) *Permitted optional joint-life forms.* The PBGC may offer benefits in the following joint-life forms: 


(i) A joint-and-50%-survivor annuity; 


(ii) A joint-and-50%-survivor-“pop-up” annuity (*i.e.,* where the participant's benefit “pops up” to the unreduced level if the beneficiary dies first); 


(iii) A joint-and-75%-survivor annuity; and 


(iv) A joint-and-100%-survivor annuity. 


(6) *Determination of benefit amount; starting benefit.* To determine the amount of the benefit in an optional PBGC form—


(i) *Single-life forms.* In the case of an optional PBGC form under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the PBGC will first determine the amount of the benefit in the form the plan would pay to an unmarried participant in the absence of an election. 


(ii) *Joint-life forms.* In the case of an optional PBGC form under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the PBGC will first determine the amount of the benefit in the form the plan would pay to a married participant in the absence of an election. For this purpose, the PBGC will treat a participant who designates a non-spouse beneficiary as being married to a person who is the same age as that non-spouse beneficiary. 


(7) *Determination of benefit amount; conversion factors.* The PBGC will convert the benefit amount determined under paragraph (c)(6) of this section to the optional form elected, using PBGC factors based on—


(i) *Mortality.* Unisex mortality rates that are a fixed blend of 50 percent of the male mortality rates and 50 percent of the female mortality rates from the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table as prescribed in Rev. Rul. 95-6, 1995-1 C.B. 80 (Internal Revenue Service Cumulative Bulletins are available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402); and 


(ii) *Interest.* An interest rate of six percent. 


(8) *Determination of benefit amount; limitation.* The PBGC will limit the benefit amount determined under paragraph (c)(7) of this section to the amount of the benefit it would pay in the form of a straight life annuity under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. 


(9) *Incidental benefits.* The PBGC will not pay an optional PBGC form with a death benefit (e.g., a joint-and-50%-survivor annuity) unless the death benefit would be an “incidental death benefit” under 26 CFR 1.401-1(b)(1)(i). If the death benefit would not be an “incidental death benefit,” the PBGC may instead offer a modified version of the optional form under which the death benefit would be an “incidental death benefit.” 


(d) *Change in benefit form.* Subject to benefit changes that PBGC may prescribe under § 4022.9(d), once payment of a benefit starts, the benefit form cannot be changed, regardless of whether the participant or beneficiary was put into pay status by the plan before the date PBGC becomes trustee of the plan.


(e) *PBGC discretion.* The PBGC may make other optional annuity forms available subject to the rules in paragraph (c) of this section.


(f) *Rollover amounts.* The annuity benefit resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4) of this chapter) is combined with any other benefit under the plan and paid in the same form and at the same time as the other benefit.
