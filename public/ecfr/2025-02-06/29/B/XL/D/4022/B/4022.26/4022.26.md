# § 4022.26   Benefit guarantee for participants who are majority owners.

(a) *Scope.* This section applies to the guarantee of all benefits described in subpart A of this part (subject to the limitations in § 4022.21) with respect to participants who are majority owners at the termination date or who were majority owners at any time within the five-year period preceding that date.


(b) *Formula.* Benefits provided by a plan are guaranteed to the extent provided in the following formula: The amount of the participant's benefit that PBGC would otherwise guarantee under section 4022 of ERISA and this part if the participant were not a majority owner, multiplied by a fraction not to exceed one, the numerator of which is the number of full years from the later of the effective date or the adoption date of the plan to the termination date, and the denominator of which is 10.


(c) *PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.* In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” in paragraph (b) of this section.
