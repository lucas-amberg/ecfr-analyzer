(a) *In general.* These rules (§§ 4022.101 through 4022.104) apply only if you die— 


(1) *Required payments for future periods.* Without having received all required payments for future periods under a form of annuity promising that, regardless of a participant's death, there will be annuity payments for a certain period of time (e.g., a certain-and-continuous annuity) or until a certain amount is paid (e.g., a cash-refund annuity or installment-refund annuity); 


(2) *No surviving beneficiary.* Without a surviving beneficiary designated to receive the payments described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and 


(3) *Time of death.* (i) On or after the date we take over your plan (as trustee); or 


(ii) Before the date we take over your plan, to the extent that, by that date, the plan administrator has not paid any required payments for future periods. 


(b) *Effect of plan or will.* These rules apply even if there is a contrary provision in a plan or will. 


(c) *Payments owed at time of death.* See §§ 4022.91 through 4022.95 for rules that apply to benefits we may owe you at the time of your death, such as a correction for monthly underpayments.
