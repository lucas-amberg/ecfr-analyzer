# § 4041.22   Administration of plan during pendency of termination process.

(a) *In general.* A plan administrator may distribute plan assets in connection with the termination of the plan only in accordance with the provisions of this part.

(1) Purchase irrevocable commitments to provide any plan benefits; or


(2) Pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, in any form other than an annuity.


(b) *Exception.* The plan administrator may pay benefits attributable to employer contributions either through the purchase of irrevocable commitments or in a form other than an annuity if—


(1) The participant has separated from active employment or is otherwise permitted under the Code to receive the distribution;


(2) The distribution is consistent with prior plan practice; and


(3) The distribution is not reasonably expected to jeopardize the plan's sufficiency for plan benefits.
