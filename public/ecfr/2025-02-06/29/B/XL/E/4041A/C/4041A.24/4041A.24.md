(a) *Annual valuation requirement.* The plan sponsor of a plan must have actuarial valuations performed in accordance with this section and with subpart B of part 4281 of this chapter.


(1) *Termination year valuation.* The plan sponsor of a plan must have an actuarial valuation performed for the plan for the plan year in which the plan terminates.


(2) *High-obligation valuations.* If the present value of a plan's nonforfeitable benefits exceeds $50 million according to the most recent actuarial valuation under this paragraph (a), the plan sponsor must have an actuarial valuation performed for the plan for each plan year.


(3) *Low-obligation valuations.* If the present value of a plan's nonforfeitable benefits does not exceed $50 million according to the most recent actuarial valuation under this paragraph (a), the plan sponsor may treat that actuarial valuation as the actuarial valuation for each of the four plan years following the plan year for which the actuarial valuation was performed.


(4) *Timing and filing.* Each actuarial valuation under this paragraph (a) must be performed within 150 days after the end of the plan year for which it is performed and must be filed with PBGC within 180 days after the end of that plan year in accordance with the valuation instructions on PBGC's website (*www.pbgc.gov*).


(5) *Exception for plans closing out.* Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, no actuarial valuation is required for the plan year in which a plan closes out under subpart D of this part.


(b) *Plan monitoring; benefit reductions*—(1) *Applicability.* This paragraph (b) applies to a plan that is not receiving financial assistance from PBGC for the plan year following the plan year for which an actuarial valuation is performed under paragraph (a) of this section.


(2) *Funding level determination.* Upon the plan sponsor's receipt of each actuarial valuation under paragraph (a) of this section, the plan sponsor must determine whether the value of nonforfeitable benefits exceeds the value of plan assets (including withdrawal liability claims). If it does, then the plan sponsor must—


(i) Amend the plan to reduce benefits subject to reduction (if any) in accordance with the procedures in subpart C of part 4281 of this chapter to the extent necessary to ensure that the plan's assets are sufficient to discharge when due all of the plan's obligations with respect to nonforfeitable benefits or, if that result cannot be achieved, to the maximum extent possible; and


(ii) If, after implementing the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the plan's assets are insufficient to discharge when due all of the plan's obligations with respect to nonforfeitable benefits, make determinations of plan solvency in accordance with § 4041A.25.


(3) *Notices of benefit reduction.* The plan sponsor of a plan that is amended to reduce benefits under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section must provide participants and beneficiaries and PBGC notice of the benefit reduction in accordance with § 4281.32 of this chapter.


(c) *Alternative method of compliance*—(1) *Applicability.* This paragraph (c) applies to a plan that meets both of the following requirements—


(i) The plan is receiving financial assistance from PBGC for the plan year following the plan year for which an actuarial valuation is required under paragraph (a) of this section.


(ii) The present value of the plan's nonforfeitable benefits does not exceed $50 million according to the most recent actuarial valuation under paragraph (a) of this section.


(2) *Alternative compliance requirements.* A plan sponsor is considered to comply with the actuarial valuation and filing requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if both—


(i) The plan sponsor files with PBGC the information in paragraph (c)(3) of this section within the time required for filing the actuarial valuation under paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and


(ii) If, within 90 days after the plan sponsor makes the filing described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, PBGC requests other information reasonably required to determine the plan's assets and liabilities, the plan sponsor files such other information within 60 days after PBGC's request.


(3) *Information to be provided.* The information the plan sponsor must file with PBGC under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is all of the following:


(i) The most recent summary plan description of the plan or the date the document was previously filed with PBGC.


(ii) The most recent actuarial valuation of the plan or the date the document was previously filed with PBGC.


(iii) Information reasonably necessary for PBGC to prepare an actuarial valuation as specified in the valuation instructions on PBGC's website (*www.pbgc.gov*).
