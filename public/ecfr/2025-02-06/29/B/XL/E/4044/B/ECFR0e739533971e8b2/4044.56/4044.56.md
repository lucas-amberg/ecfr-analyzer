# § 4044.56   XRA when a participant need not retire to receive a benefit.

(a) *Applicability.* Except as provided in § 4044.57, the plan administrator shall determine the XRA under this section when plan provisions or established plan practice do not require a participant to retire from his or her job to begin receiving his or her early retirement benefit. 


(b) *Data needed.* The plan administrator shall determine for each participant—


(1) The participant's URA; and 


(2) The participant's earliest retirement age at valuation date. 


(c) *Procedure.* Participants in this case are always assigned to the high retirement rate category and therefore the plan administrator shall use table II-C (Expected Retirement Ages for Individuals in the High Category) in § 4044.58 to determine the XRA. The plan administrator shall determine the XRA from table II-C by using the participant's URA and earliest retirement age at termination date.
