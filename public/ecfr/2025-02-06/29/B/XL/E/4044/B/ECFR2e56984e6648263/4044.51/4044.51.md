# § 4044.51   Benefits to be valued.

(a) *Form of benefit.* The plan administrator shall determine the form of each benefit to be valued in accordance with the following rules: 


(1) If a benefit is in pay status as of the valuation date, the plan administrator shall value the form of the benefit being paid.

(3) If a benefit is not in pay status as of the valuation date and no valid election with respect to the form of benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan administrator shall value the form of benefit that, under the terms of the plan, is payable in the absence of a valid election.

(2) *Where no election made.* If no valid election of the starting date of a benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan administrator shall assume that the starting date of the benefit is the later of—
