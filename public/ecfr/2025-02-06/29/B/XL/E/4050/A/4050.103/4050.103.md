# § 4050.103   Duties of plan administrator.

(a) *Providing for benefits.* For each distributee who is missing upon close-out of a subpart A plan, the plan administrator must provide for the distributee's plan benefits either—


(1) By purchasing an irrevocable commitment from an insurer, or


(2) By—


(i) Determining the distributee's benefit transfer amount under paragraph (d) of this section, and


(ii) Transferring to PBGC as described in this subpart A an amount equal to the distributee's benefit transfer amount.


(b) *Diligent search.* For each distributee whose location the plan administrator does not know with reasonable certainty upon close-out of a subpart A plan, the plan administrator must have conducted a diligent search as described in § 4050.104.


(c) *Filing with PBGC.* For each distributee who is missing upon close-out of a subpart A plan, the plan administrator must file with PBGC as described in § 4050.105.


(d) *Benefit transfer amount.* The benefit transfer amount for a missing distributee is the amount determined by the plan administrator as of the benefit determination date using whichever one of the following three methods applies:


(1) *De minimis.* If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is de minimis, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is equal to that single sum.


(2) *Non-de minimis; single sum payment cannot be elected.* If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment cannot be elected, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is the present value of the distributee's accrued benefit determined using PBGC missing participants assumptions, plus


(i) For a missing distributee not in pay status whose normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) precedes the benefit determination date, the aggregate value of payments of the straight life annuity that would have been payable beginning on the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date, as determined by the plan administrator; or


(ii) For a missing distributee in pay status, the aggregate value of payments of the pay status annuity due but not made, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from each payment due date to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date.


(3) *Non-de minimis; single sum payment can be elected.* If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment can be elected, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is the greater of the amounts determined using the methodology in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.
