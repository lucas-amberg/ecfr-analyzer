# § 4050.106   Missing participant benefits.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Benefit transfer amount not paid.* If a subpart A plan files with PBGC information about an irrevocable commitment provided by the subpart A plan for a missing distributee, PBGC will provide information about the irrevocable commitment to the distributee or another claimant that may be entitled to payment pursuant to the irrevocable commitment.


(2) *Benefit transfer amount paid.* If a subpart A plan pays PBGC a benefit transfer amount for a missing distributee, PBGC will pay benefits with respect to the missing distributee in accordance with this section, subject to the provisions of a QDRO.


(b) *Benefits for missing distributees who are participants.* Paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (k) of this section describe the benefits that PBGC will pay to a non-pay status missing participant of a subpart A plan who claims a benefit under the missing participants program.


(c) *De minimis benefit.* If the benefit transfer amount of a participant described in paragraph (b) of this section is de minimis, PBGC will pay the participant a lump sum equal to the accumulated single sum.


(d) *Non-de minimis benefit of unmarried participant.* If the benefit transfer amount of an unmarried participant described in paragraph (b) of this section is not de minimis, PBGC will pay the participant either the annuity described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, beginning not before age 55, and (if applicable) the make-up amount described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or, if the participant could have elected a lump sum under the subpart A plan, and the participant so elects under the missing participants program, the lump sum described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(1) *Annuity.* The annuity described in this paragraph (d)(1) is either—


(i) *Straight life annuity.* A straight life annuity in the amount that the subpart A plan would have paid the participant, starting at the date that PBGC payments start (or, if earlier, the later of the participant's normal retirement date or accrual cessation date), as reported to PBGC by the subpart A plan (including any early retirement subsidies), or through linear interpolation for participants who start payments between integral ages; or


(ii) *Other form of annuity.* At the participant's election, any form of annuity available to the participant under § 4022.8 of this chapter, in an amount that is actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section as of the date that PBGC payments start (or, if earlier, the later of the participant's normal retirement date or accrual cessation date), determined using the actuarial assumptions in § 4022.8(c)(7) of this chapter.


(2) *Make-up amount.* If PBGC begins to pay the annuity under paragraph (d)(1) of this section after the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), the make-up amount described in this paragraph (d)(2) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments of the annuity that would have been payable to the participant (in the elected form) beginning on the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC begins to pay the annuity.


(3) *Lump sum.* The lump sum described in this paragraph (d)(3) is equal to the participant's accumulated single sum.


(e) *Non-de minimis benefit of married participant.* If the benefit transfer amount of a married participant described in paragraph (b) of this section is not de minimis, PBGC will pay the participant either the annuity described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, beginning not before age 55, and (if applicable) the make-up amount described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; or, if the participant could have elected a lump sum under the subpart A plan, and the participant so elects under the missing participants program with the consent of the participant's spouse, the lump sum described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(1) *Annuity.* The annuity described in this paragraph (e)(1) is either—


(i) *Joint and survivor annuity.* A joint and 50 percent survivor annuity in an amount that is actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section as of the date that PBGC payments start (or, if earlier, the later of the participant's normal retirement date or accrual cessation date), determined using the actuarial assumptions in § 4022.8(c)(7) of this chapter; or


(ii) *Other form of annuity.* At the participant's election, with the consent of the participant's spouse, any form of annuity available to the participant under § 4022.8 of this chapter, in an amount that is actuarially equivalent to the joint and 50 percent survivor annuity under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section as of the date that PBGC payments start (or, if earlier, the later of the participant's normal retirement date or accrual cessation date), determined using the actuarial assumptions in § 4022.8(c)(7) of this chapter.


(2) *Make-up amount.* If PBGC begins to pay the annuity under paragraph (e)(1) of this section after the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), the make-up amount described in this paragraph (e)(2) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments of the annuity that would have been payable to the participant beginning on the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC begins to pay the annuity.


(3) *Lump sum.* The lump sum described in this paragraph (e)(3) is equal to the participant's accumulated single sum.


(f) *Benefits with respect to deceased missing distributees who were participants.* Paragraphs (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k) of this section describe the benefits that PBGC will pay with respect to a non-pay status missing participant of a subpart A plan who dies without receiving a benefit under the missing participants program.


(g) *De minimis benefit.* If the benefit transfer amount of a participant described in paragraph (f) of this section is de minimis, PBGC will pay to the qualified survivor(s) of the participant a lump sum equal to the participant's accumulated single sum.


(h) *Non-de minimis benefit; unmarried participant.* In the case of an unmarried participant described in paragraph (f) of this section whose benefit transfer amount is not de minimis,—


(1) *Death before normal retirement date.* If the participant dies before the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), PBGC will pay no benefits with respect to the participant; and


(2) *Death after normal retirement date.* If the participant dies on or after the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), PBGC will pay to the participant's qualified survivor(s) an amount equal to the aggregate value of payments of the straight life annuity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section that would have been payable to the participant from the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) to the participant's date of death, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC pays the qualified survivor(s).


(i) *Non-de minimis benefit; married participant with living spouse.* In the case of a married participant described in paragraph (f) of this section whose benefit transfer amount is not de minimis and whose spouse survives the participant and claims a benefit under the missing participants program, PBGC will pay the spouse, beginning not before the participant would have reached age 55, the annuity (if any) described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section and the make-up amounts (if applicable) described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, except that PBGC will pay the spouse, as a lump sum, the small benefit described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.


(1) *Annuity.* The annuity described in this paragraph (i)(1) is the survivor portion of a joint and 50 percent survivor annuity that is actuarially equivalent as of the assumed starting date (determined using the actuarial assumptions in § 4022.8(c)(7) of this chapter) to the straight life annuity in the amount that the subpart A plan would have paid the participant with an assumed starting date of—


(i) The date when the participant would have reached age 55, if the participant died before that date, or


(ii) The participant's date of death, if the participant died between age 55 and the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), or


(iii) The normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), if the participant died after that date.


(2) *Make-up amounts.* The make-up amounts described in this paragraph (i)(2) are the amounts described in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(i) *Payments from participant's death or 55th birthday to commencement of survivor annuity.* The make-up amount described in this paragraph (i)(2)(i) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments of the survivor portion of the joint and 50 percent survivor annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section that would have been payable to the spouse beginning on the later of the participant's date of death or the date when the participant would have reached age 55, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC pays the spouse.


(ii) *Payments from normal retirement date to participant's death.* The make-up amount described in this paragraph (i)(2)(ii) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments (if any) of the joint portion of the joint and 50 percent survivor annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section that would have been payable to the participant from the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) to the participant's date of death thereafter, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC pays the spouse.


(3) *Small benefit.* If the sum of the actuarial present value of the annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section plus the make-up amounts described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section is de minimis, then the lump sum that PBGC will pay the spouse under this paragraph (i)(3) is an amount equal to that sum. For this purpose, the actuarial present value of the annuity is determined using the actuarial assumptions in § 4022.8(c)(7) of this chapter as of the date when PBGC pays the spouse.


(j) *Non-de minimis benefit; married participant with deceased spouse.* In the case of a married participant described in paragraph (f) of this section whose benefit transfer amount is not de minimis and whose spouse survives the participant but dies without receiving a benefit under the missing participants program, PBGC will pay to the qualified survivor(s) of the participant's spouse the make-up amount described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section and to the qualified survivor(s) of the participant the make-up amount described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.


(1) *Payments from participant's death or 55th birthday to spouse's death.* The make-up amount described in this paragraph (j)(1) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments of the survivor portion of the joint and 50 percent survivor annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section that would have been payable to the spouse from the later of the participant's date of death or the date when the participant would have reached age 55 to the spouse's date of death, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC pays the spouse's qualified survivor(s).


(2) *Payments from normal retirement date to participant's death.* The make-up amount described in this paragraph (j)(2) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments of the joint portion of the joint and 50 percent survivor annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section that would have been payable to the participant from the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) to the participant's date of death thereafter, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC pays the participant's qualified survivor(s).


(k) *Benefits under contributory plans.* If a subpart A plan reports to PBGC that a portion of a missing participant's benefit transfer amount represents accumulated contributions as described in section 204(c)(2)(C) of ERISA and section 411(c)(2)(C) of the Code, PBGC will pay with respect to the missing participant at least the amount of accumulated contributions as reported by the subpart A plan, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the benefit determination date to the date when PBGC makes payment.


(l) *Date for determining marital status.* For purposes of this section, whether a participant is married, and if so the identity of the spouse, is determined as of the earlier of—
