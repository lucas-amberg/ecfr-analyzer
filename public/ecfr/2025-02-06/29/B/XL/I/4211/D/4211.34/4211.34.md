(b) *Share of initial plan year unfunded vested benefits.* An employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer's share of its prior plan's liabilities, as determined under ยง 4211.32(b)(1), and the employer's share of the adjusted initial plan year unfunded vested benefits, as determined under ยง 4211.32(b)(2), with such sum reduced as if it were being fully amortized in level annual installments over five years beginning with the first plan year after the initial plan year.
