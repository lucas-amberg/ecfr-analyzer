# ยง 4220.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) *General.* This part establishes procedures under which a plan sponsor shall request the PBGC to approve a plan amendment under section 4220 of ERISA. This part applies to all multiemployer plans covered by title IV of ERISA that adopt amendments pursuant to the authorization of sections 4201-4219 of ERISA (except for amendments adopted pursuant to section 4211(c)(5)). (The covered amendments are set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.) The subsequent modification of a plan amendment adopted by authorization of those sections is also covered by this part. This part does not, however, cover a plan amendment that merely repeals a previously adopted amendment, returning the plan to the statutorily prescribed rule.

(1) Section 4203 (b)(1)(B)(ii). 


(2) Section 4203(c)(4). 


(3) Section 4205(c)(1).

(12) Section 4219(c)(1)(C)(iii). 


(c) *Exception.* Submission of a request for approval under this part is not required for a plan amendment for which the PBGC has published a notice in the _Federal Register_ granting class approval.
