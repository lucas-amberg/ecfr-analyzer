(1) For the initial insolvency year, provide the notices of insolvency benefit level to PBGC and to interested parties.


(2) For any insolvency year following the initial insolvency year—


(i) If there is a change in the insolvency benefit level that affects plan payees generally, provide the notices of insolvency benefit level to PBGC and to plan payees (which, for purposes of this section, means participants and beneficiaries in pay status or reasonably expected to enter pay status during the insolvency year).
