(b) *Information required for changed assumptions in initial and revised applications.* An application for a plan that proposes to change any assumption used in the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, must include all of the following information:


(1) A table identifying which assumptions used in demonstrating the plan's eligibility for special financial assistance or in calculating the amount of special financial assistance differ from those assumptions used in the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, and detailed narrative explanations (with supporting rationale and information) as described in the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov* as to why any assumption used in the certification is no longer reasonable and why the changed assumption is reasonable.


(2) Deterministic cash flow projection (“Baseline”) in accordance with the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov* that shows the amount of special financial assistance that would be determined if all underlying assumptions used in the projection were the same as those used in the actuarial certification of plan status last completed before January 1, 2021 (excluding the plan's non-SFA and SFA interest rates, which must be the same as the interest rates required under § 4262.4(e)(1) and (2)). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), certain changes in assumptions as described in the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov* should be reflected in the Baseline projection.
