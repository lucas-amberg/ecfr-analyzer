# § 4281.12   Benefits to be valued.

(a) *Form of benefit.* The plan sponsor shall determine the form of each benefit to be valued, without regard to the form of benefit valued in any prior year, in accordance with the following rules: 


(1) If a benefit is in pay status as of the valuation date, the plan sponsor shall value the form of benefit being paid. 


(2) If a benefit is not in pay status as of the valuation date but a valid election with respect to the form of benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan sponsor shall value the form of benefit so elected. 


(3) If a benefit is not in pay status as of the valuation date and no valid election with respect to the form of benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan sponsor shall value the form of benefit that, under the terms of the plan or applicable law, is payable in the absence of a valid election. 


(b) *Timing of benefit.* The plan sponsor shall value benefits whose starting date is subject to election—


(1) By assuming that the starting date of each benefit is the earliest date, not preceding the valuation date, that could be elected; or 


(2) By using any other assumption that the plan sponsor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PBGC is more reasonable under the circumstances.
