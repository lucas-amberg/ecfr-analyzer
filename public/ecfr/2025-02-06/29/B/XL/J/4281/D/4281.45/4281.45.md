(a) *Requirement of notice.* The plan sponsor of an insolvent plan must file with PBGC a notice of insolvency benefit level containing the information described in § 4281.46(a) and issue to plan payees (which, for purposes of this section, means participants and beneficiaries in pay status or reasonably expected to enter pay status during the insolvency year) a notice of insolvency benefit level containing the information described in § 4281.46(b) in each of the following circumstances—


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for the initial insolvency year and for any insolvency year following the initial insolvency year, if there is a change in insolvency benefit level that affects plan payees generally, provide the notices of insolvency benefit level to PBGC and to plan payees.


(2) For any insolvency year following the initial insolvency year, if there is a change in the insolvency benefit level that affects only one plan payee or a class of plan payees but not plan payees generally (treating commencement of a person's benefits for this purpose as a change in the insolvency benefit level for that person), provide the notices of insolvency benefit level to PBGC and to each affected plan payee.

(i) Ninety (90) days before the beginning of the insolvency year; or


(ii) Thirty (30) days after the date the insolvency determination is made.


(2) The plan sponsor may deliver the notices required under this section to participants and beneficiaries in pay status or reasonably expected to enter pay status during the insolvency year for which the notice is given concurrently with the first benefit payment made after the date the insolvency determination is made.


(d) *Method of issuance to participants and beneficiaries.* The issuance of the notice of insolvency benefit level to participants and beneficiaries in pay status or reasonably expected to enter pay status during the insolvency year for which the notice is given must be made by a method permitted under the rules in subpart B of part 4000 of this chapter.
