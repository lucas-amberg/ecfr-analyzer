# ยง 4901.18   Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

If the Disclosure Officer fails to make a determination to grant or deny access to requested records, or the General Counsel does not make a decision on appeal from a denial of access to PBGC records, within the time prescribed (including any extension) for making such determination or decision, the requester's administrative remedies will be deemed exhausted and the requester may apply for judicial relief under FOIA. However, since a court may allow PBGC additional time to act as provided in FOIA, processing of the disclosure request or appeal will continue and PBGC will so advise the requester.
