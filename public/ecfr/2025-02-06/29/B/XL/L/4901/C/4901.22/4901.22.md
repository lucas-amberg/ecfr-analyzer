# ยง 4901.22   Partial disclosure.

If an otherwise disclosable record contains some material that is protected from disclosure, the record will not for that reason be withheld from disclosure if deletion of the protected material is feasible. This principle will be applied in particular to identifying details the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
