# ยง 4901.23   Record of concern to agency other than PBGC.

When reviewing a record in response to a disclosure request, PBGC will determine whether another agency is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. As to any such record, PBGC will proceed in one of the following ways:


(a) *Consultation with another agency.* When the record contains information of interest to another agency, PBGC will make a release determination only if its interest in the record is the primary interest and only after PBGC consults with that agency.


(b) *Referral to another agency.* (1) When an agency other than PBGC has primary interest in the record, then PBGC will refer the responsibility for responding to the disclosure request regarding that record to that agency.


(2) Whenever PBGC refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a disclosure request to another agency, PBGC will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA office.
