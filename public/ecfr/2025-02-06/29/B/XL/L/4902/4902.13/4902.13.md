# § 4902.13   Specific exemptions: Legal case management.

(a) *Exemption.* Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled “PBGC-19, Office of Negotiations and Restructuring/Office of General Counsel Case Management System” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).


(b) *Reasons for exemption.* The reasons for asserting this exemption are because the disclosure and other requirements of the Privacy Act could substantially compromise the efficacy and integrity of PBGC's ability to investigate administrative, civil, or criminal legal matters. Disclosure could invade the privacy of individuals and disclose their identity when they were expressly promised confidentiality. Disclosure could interfere with the integrity of information which would otherwise be subject to legal privileges, see, *e.g.,* 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5), and which could interfere with other important law enforcement concerns, see, *e.g.,* 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7).
