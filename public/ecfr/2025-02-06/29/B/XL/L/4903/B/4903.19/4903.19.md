# ยง 4903.19   How does a debtor request a special review based on a change in circumstances such as catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability?

(a) *Material change in circumstances.* A debtor who owes a debt to PBGC may, at any time, request a special review by PBGC of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.


(b) *Inability to pay.* For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (e.g., costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor must submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:


(1) Income from all sources;


(2) Assets;


(3) Liabilities;


(4) Number of dependents;


(5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;


(6) Medical expenses;


(7) Exceptional expenses, if any; and


(8) Any additional materials and information that PBGC may request relating to ability or inability to pay the amount(s) currently required.


(c) *Alternative payment arrangement.* If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor must submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to PBGC, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. PBGC will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. PBGC will notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, PBGC will notify the appropriate Federal agency or other persons about the new terms.
