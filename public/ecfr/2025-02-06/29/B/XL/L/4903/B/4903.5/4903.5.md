Generally, before starting the collection actions described in §§ 4903.6 and 4903.10 through 4903.18 of this part, PBGC will send no more than two written notices to the debtor. The notice will explain why the debt is owed to PBGC, the amount of the debt, how a debtor may pay the debt or make alternate repayment arrangements, how a debtor may review non-privileged documents related to the debt, how a debtor may dispute the debt, the collection remedies available to PBGC if the debtor refuses or otherwise fails to pay the debt, and other consequences to the debtor if the debt is not paid.

(10) How a debtor who is an individual may request a hearing if PBGC intends to garnish the debtor's private sector (*i.e.,* non-Federal) wages (see § 4903.14(a) of this part), including:


(i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;
