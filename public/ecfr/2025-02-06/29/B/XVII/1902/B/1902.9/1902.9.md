# § 1902.9   Requirements for approval of State posters.

(a)(1) In order to inform employees of their protections and obligations under applicable State law, of the issues not covered by State law, and of the continuing availability of Federal monitoring under section 18(f) of the Act, States with approved plans shall develop and require employers to post a State poster meeting the requirements set out in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.


(2) Such poster shall be substituted for the Federal poster under section 8(c)(1) of the Act and § 1903.2 of this chapter where the State attains operational status for the enforcement of State standards as defined in § 1954.3(b) of this chapter.


(3) Where a State has distributed its poster and has enabling legislation as defined in § 1954.3(b)(1) of this chapter but becomes nonoperational under the provisions of § 1954.3(f)(1) of this chapter because of failure to be at least as effective as the Federal program, the approved State poster may, at the discretion of the Assistant Secretary, continue to be substituted for the Federal poster in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(4) A State may, for good cause shown, request, under 29 CFR part 1953, approval of an alternative to a State poster for informing employees of their protections and obligations under the State plans, provided such alternative is consistent with the Act, § 1902.4(c)(2)(iv) and applicable State law. In order to qualify as a substitute for the Federal poster under this paragraph (a), such alternative must be shown to be at least as effective as the Federal poster requirements in informing employees of their protections and obligations and address the items listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.


(5) In developing the poster, the State shall address but not be limited to the following items:


(i) Responsibilities of the State, employers and employees;


(ii) The right of employees or their representatives to request workplace inspections;


(iii) The right of employees making such requests to remain anonymous;


(iv) The right of employees to participate in inspections;


(v) Provisions for prompt notice to employers and employees when alleged violations occur;


(vi) Protection for employees against discharge or discrimination for the exercise of their rights under Federal and State law;


(vii) Sanctions;


(viii) A means of obtaining further information on State law and standards and the address of the State agency;


(ix) The right to file complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration about State program administration;


(x) A list of the issues as defined in § 1902.2(c) which will not be covered by State plan;


(xi) The address of the Regional Office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; and


(xii) Such additional employee protection provisions and obligations under State law as may have been included in the approved State plan.


(b) Posting of the State poster shall be recognized as compliance with the posting requirements in section 8(c)(1) of the Act and § 1903.2 of this chapter, provided that the poster has been approved in accordance with subpart B of part 1953 of this chapter. Continued Federal recognition of the State poster is also subject to pertinent findings of effectiveness with regard to the State program under 29 CFR part 1954.
