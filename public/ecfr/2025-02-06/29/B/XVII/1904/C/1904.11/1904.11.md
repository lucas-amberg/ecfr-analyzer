# § 1904.11   Recording criteria for work-related tuberculosis cases.

(a) *Basic requirement.* If any of your employees has been occupationally exposed to anyone with a known case of active tuberculosis (TB), and that employee subsequently develops a tuberculosis infection, as evidenced by a positive skin test or diagnosis by a physician or other licensed health care professional, you must record the case on the OSHA 300 Log by checking the “respiratory condition” column. 


(b) *Implementation*—(1) *Do I have to record, on the Log, a positive TB skin test result obtained at a pre-employment physical?* No, you do not have to record it because the employee was not occupationally exposed to a known case of active tuberculosis in your workplace. 


(2) *May I line-out or erase a recorded TB case if I obtain evidence that the case was not caused by occupational exposure?* Yes, you may line-out or erase the case from the Log under the following circumstances: 


(i) The worker is living in a household with a person who has been diagnosed with active TB; 


(ii) The Public Health Department has identified the worker as a contact of an individual with a case of active TB unrelated to the workplace; or 


(iii) A medical investigation shows that the employee's infection was caused by exposure to TB away from work, or proves that the case was not related to the workplace TB exposure.
