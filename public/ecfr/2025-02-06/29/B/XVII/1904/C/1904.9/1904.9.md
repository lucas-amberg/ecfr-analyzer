# § 1904.9   Recording criteria for cases involving medical removal under OSHA standards.

(a) *Basic requirement.* If an employee is medically removed under the medical surveillance requirements of an OSHA standard, you must record the case on the OSHA 300 Log. 


(b) *Implementation*—(1) *How do I classify medical removal cases on the OSHA 300 Log?* You must enter each medical removal case on the OSHA 300 Log as either a case involving days away from work or a case involving restricted work activity, depending on how you decide to comply with the medical removal requirement. If the medical removal is the result of a chemical exposure, you must enter the case on the OSHA 300 Log by checking the “poisoning” column. 


(2) *Do all of OSHA's standards have medical removal provisions?* No, some OSHA standards, such as the standards covering bloodborne pathogens and noise, do not have medical removal provisions. Many OSHA standards that cover specific chemical substances have medical removal provisions. These standards include, but are not limited to, lead, cadmium, methylene chloride, formaldehyde, and benzene. 


(3) *Do I have to record a case where I voluntarily removed the employee from exposure before the medical removal criteria in an OSHA standard are met?* No, if the case involves voluntary medical removal before the medical removal levels required by an OSHA standard, you do not need to record the case on the OSHA 300 Log.
