(c) *Multi-state variances.* Where a Federal variance has been granted with multi-state applicability, including applicability in a State operating under a State plan approved under section 18 of the Act, from a standard, or portion thereof, identical to a State standard, or portion thereof, without filing the information required in § 1905.10(b)(11) or § 1905.11(b)(8) of this chapter, such variance shall likewise be deemed an authoritative interpretation of the employer(s)' compliance obligations with regard to the State standard, or portion thereof, upon filing the information required under § 1905.10(b)(11) or § 1905.11(b)(8) of this chapter, provided no objections of substance are found to be interposed by the State authority under § 1905.14 of this chapter.
