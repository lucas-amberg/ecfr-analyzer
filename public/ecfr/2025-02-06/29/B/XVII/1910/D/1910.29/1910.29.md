# § 1910.29   Fall protection systems and falling object protection—criteria and practices.

(a) *General requirements.* The employer must:


(1) Ensure each fall protection system and falling object protection, other than personal fall protection systems, that this part requires meets the requirements in this section. The employer must ensure each personal fall protection system meets the requirements in subpart I of this part; and


(2) Provide and install all fall protection systems and falling object protection this subpart requires, and comply with the other requirements in this subpart before any employee begins work that necessitates fall or falling object protection.


(b) *Guardrail systems.* The employer must ensure guardrail systems meet the following requirements:


(1) The top edge height of top rails, or equivalent guardrail system members, are 42 inches (107 cm), plus or minus 3 inches (8 cm), above the walking-working surface. The top edge height may exceed 45 inches (114 cm), provided the guardrail system meets all other criteria of paragraph (b) of this section (see Figure D-11 of this section).


(2) Midrails, screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, solid panels, or equivalent intermediate members are installed between the walking-working surface and the top edge of the guardrail system as follows when there is not a wall or parapet that is at least 21 inches (53 cm) high:


(i) Midrails are installed at a height midway between the top edge of the guardrail system and the walking-working surface;


(ii) Screens and mesh extend from the walking-working surface to the top rail and along the entire opening between top rail supports;


(iii) Intermediate vertical members (such as balusters) are installed no more than 19 inches (48 cm) apart; and


(iv) Other equivalent intermediate members (such as additional midrails and architectural panels) are installed so that the openings are not more than 19 inches (48 cm) wide.


(3) Guardrail systems are capable of withstanding, without failure, a force of at least 200 pounds (890 N) applied in a downward or outward direction within 2 inches (5 cm) of the top edge, at any point along the top rail.


(4) When the 200-pound (890-N) test load is applied in a downward direction, the top rail of the guardrail system must not deflect to a height of less than 39 inches (99 cm) above the walking-working surface.


(5) Midrails, screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, solid panels, and other equivalent intermediate members are capable of withstanding, without failure, a force of at least 150 pounds (667 N) applied in any downward or outward direction at any point along the intermediate member.


(6) Guardrail systems are smooth-surfaced to protect employees from injury, such as punctures or lacerations, and to prevent catching or snagging of clothing.


(7) The ends of top rails and midrails do not overhang the terminal posts, except where the overhang does not pose a projection hazard for employees.


(8) Steel banding and plastic banding are not used for top rails or midrails.


(9) Top rails and midrails are at least 0.25-inches (0.6 cm) in diameter or in thickness.


(10) When guardrail systems are used at hoist areas, a removable guardrail section, consisting of a top rail and midrail, are placed across the access opening between guardrail sections when employees are not performing hoisting operations. The employer may use chains or gates instead of a removable guardrail section at hoist areas if the employer demonstrates the chains or gates provide a level of safety equivalent to guardrails.


(11) When guardrail systems are used around holes, they are installed on all unprotected sides or edges of the hole.


(12) For guardrail systems used around holes through which materials may be passed:


(i) When materials are being passed through the hole, not more than two sides of the guardrail system are removed; and


(ii) When materials are not being passed through the hole, the hole must be guarded by a guardrail system along all unprotected sides or edges or closed over with a cover.


(13) When guardrail systems are used around holes that serve as points of access (such as ladderways), the guardrail system opening:


(i) Has a self-closing gate that slides or swings away from the hole, and is equipped with a top rail and midrail or equivalent intermediate member that meets the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; or


(ii) Is offset to prevent an employee from walking or falling into the hole;


(14) Guardrail systems on ramps and runways are installed along each unprotected side or edge.


(15) Manila or synthetic rope used for top rails or midrails are inspected as necessary to ensure that the rope continues to meet the strength requirements in paragraphs (b)(3) and (5) of this section.


(c) *Safety net systems.* The employer must ensure each safety net system meets the requirements in 29 CFR part 1926, subpart M.


(d) *Designated areas.* (1) When the employer uses a designated area, the employer must ensure:


(i) Employees remain within the designated area while work operations are underway; and


(ii) The perimeter of the designated area is delineated with a warning line consisting of a rope, wire, tape, or chain that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.


(2) The employer must ensure each warning line:


(i) Has a minimum breaking strength of 200 pounds (0.89 kN);


(ii) Is installed so its lowest point, including sag, is not less than 34 inches (86 cm) and not more than 39 inches (99 cm) above the walking-working surface;


(iii) Is supported in such a manner that pulling on one section of the line will not result in slack being taken up in adjacent sections causing the line to fall below the limits specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;


(iv) Is clearly visible from a distance of 25 feet (7.6 m) away, and anywhere within the designated area;


(v) Is erected as close to the work area as the task permits; and


(vi) Is erected not less than 6 feet (1.8 m) from the roof edge for work that is both temporary and infrequent, or not less than 15 feet (4.6 m) for other work.


(3) When mobile mechanical equipment is used to perform work that is both temporary and infrequent in a designated area, the employer must ensure the warning line is erected not less than 6 feet (1.8 m) from the unprotected side or edge that is parallel to the direction in which the mechanical equipment is operated, and not less than 10 feet (3 m) from the unprotected side or edge that is perpendicular to the direction in which the mechanical equipment is operated.


(e) *Covers.* The employer must ensure each cover for a hole in a walking-working surface:


(1) Is capable of supporting without failure, at least twice the maximum intended load that may be imposed on the cover at any one time; and


(2) Is secured to prevent accidental displacement.


(f) *Handrails and stair rail systems.* The employer must ensure:


(1) *Height criteria.* (i) Handrails are not less than 30 inches (76 cm) and not more than 38 inches (97 cm), as measured from the leading edge of the stair tread to the top surface of the handrail (see Figure D-12 of this section).


(ii) The height of stair rail systems meets the following:


(A) The height of stair rail systems installed before January 17, 2017 is not less than 30 inches (76 cm) from the leading edge of the stair tread to the top surface of the top rail; and
