# § 1910.68   Manlifts.

(a) *Definitions applicable to this section*—(1) *Handhold (Handgrip).* A handhold is a device attached to the belt which can be grasped by the passenger to provide a means of maintaining balance.


(2) *Open type.* One which has a handgrip surface fully exposed and capable of being encircled by the passenger's fingers.


(3) *Closed type.* A cup-shaped device, open at the top in the direction of travel of the step for which it is to be used, and closed at the bottom, into which the passenger may place his fingers.


(4) *Limit switch.* A device, the purpose of which is to cut off the power to the motor and apply the brake to stop the carrier in the event that a loaded step passes the terminal landing.


(5) *Manlift.* A device consisting of a power-driven endless belt moving in one direction only, and provided with steps or platforms and handholds attached to it for the transportation of personnel from floor to floor.


(6) *Rated speed.* Rated speed is the speed for which the device is designed and installed.


(7) *Split-rail switch.* An electric limit switch operated mechanically by the rollers on the manlift steps. It consists of an additional hinged or “split” rail, mounted on the regular guide rail, over which the step rollers pass. It is springloaded in the “split” position. If the step supports no load, the rollers will “bump” over the switch; if a loaded step should pass over the section, the split rail will be forced straight, tripping the switch and opening the electrical circuit.


(8) *Step (platform).* A step is a passenger carrying unit.


(9) *Travel.* The travel is the distance between the centers of the top and bottom pulleys.


(b) *General requirements*—(1) *Application.* This section applies to the construction, maintenance, inspection, and operation of manlifts in relation to accident hazards. Manlifts covered by this section consist of platforms or brackets and accompanying handholds mounted on, or attached to an endless belt, operating vertically in one direction only and being supported by, and driven through pulleys, at the top and bottom. These manlifts are intended for conveyance of persons only. It is not intended that this section cover moving stairways, elevators with enclosed platforms (“Paternoster” elevators), gravity lifts, nor conveyors used only for conveying material. This section applies to manlifts used to carry only personnel trained and authorized by the employer in their use.


(2) *Purpose.* The purpose of this section is to provide reasonable safety for life and limb.


(3) *Design requirements.* All new manlift installations and equipment installed after the effective date of these regulations shall meet the design requirements of the “American National Safety Standard for Manlifts ANSI A90.1-1969”, which is incorporated by reference as specified in § 1910.6, and the requirements of this section.


(4) *Reference to other codes and subparts.* The following codes and subparts of this part are applicable to this section: Safety Code for Mechanical Power Transmission Apparatus, ANSI B15.1-1953 (R 1958); Safety Code for Fixed Ladders, ANSI A14.3-1956; and subparts D, O, and S.
