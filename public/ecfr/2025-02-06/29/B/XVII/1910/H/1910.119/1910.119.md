# § 1910.119   Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals.

*Purpose.* This section contains requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. These releases may result in toxic, fire or explosion hazards.


(a) *Application.* (1) This section applies to the following:


(i) A process which involves a chemical at or above the specified threshold quantities listed in appendix A to this section;


(ii) A process which involves a Category 1 flammable gas (as defined in 1910.1200(c)) or a flammable liquid with a flashpoint below 100 °F (37.8 °C) on site in one location, in a quantity of 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) or more except for:


(A) Hydrocarbon fuels used solely for workplace consumption as a fuel (e.g., propane used for comfort heating, gasoline for vehicle refueling), if such fuels are not a part of a process containing another highly hazardous chemical covered by this standard;


(B) Flammable liquids with a flashpoint below 100 °F (37.8 °C) stored in atmospheric tanks or transferred which are kept below their normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration.


(2) This section does not apply to:


(i) Retail facilities;


(ii) Oil or gas well drilling or servicing operations; or,


(iii) Normally unoccupied remote facilities.


(b) *Definitions. Atmospheric tank* means a storage tank which has been designed to operate at pressures from atmospheric through 0.5 p.s.i.g. (pounds per square inch gauge, 3.45 Kpa).


*Boiling point* means the boiling point of a liquid at a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (p.s.i.a.) (760 mm.). For the purposes of this section, where an accurate boiling point is unavailable for the material in question, or for mixtures which do not have a constant boiling point, the 10 percent point of a distillation performed in accordance with the Standard Method of Test for Distillation of Petroleum Products, ASTM D-86-62, which is incorporated by reference as specified in § 1910.6, may be used as the boiling point of the liquid.


*Catastrophic release* means a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion, involving one or more highly hazardous chemicals, that presents serious danger to employees in the workplace.


*Facility* means the buildings, containers or equipment which contain a process.


*Highly hazardous chemical* means a substance possessing toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive properties and specified by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


*Hot work* means work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operations.


*Normally unoccupied remote facility* means a facility which is operated, maintained or serviced by employees who visit the facility only periodically to check its operation and to perform necessary operating or maintenance tasks. No employees are permanently stationed at the facility.


Facilities meeting this definition are not contiguous with, and must be geographically remote from all other buildings, processes or persons.


*Process* means any activity involving a highly hazardous chemical including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. For purposes of this definition, any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a highly hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.


*Replacement in kind* means a replacement which satisfies the design specification.


*Trade secret* means any confidential formula, pattern, process, device, information or compilation of information that is used in an employer's business, and that gives the employer an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. *See* Appendix E to § 1910.1200—Definition of a Trade Secret (which sets out the criteria to be used in evaluating trade secrets).


(c) *Employee participation.* (1) Employers shall develop a written plan of action regarding the implementation of the employee participation required by this paragraph.
