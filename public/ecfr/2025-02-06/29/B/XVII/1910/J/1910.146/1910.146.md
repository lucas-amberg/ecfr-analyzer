*Attendant* means an individual stationed outside one or more permit spaces who monitors the authorized entrants and who performs all attendant's duties assigned in the employer's permit space program.


*Authorized entrant* means an employee who is authorized by the employer to enter a permit space.


*Blanking or blinding* means the absolute closure of a pipe, line, or duct by the fastening of a solid plate (such as a spectacle blind or a skillet blind) that completely covers the bore and that is capable of withstanding the maximum pressure of the pipe, line, or duct with no leakage beyond the plate.


*Confined space* means a space that:


(1) Is large enough and so configured that an employee can bodily enter and perform assigned work; and


(2) Has limited or restricted means for entry or exit (for example, tanks, vessels, silos, storage bins, hoppers, vaults, and pits are spaces that may have limited means of entry.); and


(3) Is not designed for continuous employee occupancy.


*Double block and bleed* means the closure of a line, duct, or pipe by closing and locking or tagging two in-line valves and by opening and locking or tagging a drain or vent valve in the line between the two closed valves.


*Emergency* means any occurrence (including any failure of hazard control or monitoring equipment) or event internal or external to the permit space that could endanger entrants.


*Engulfment* means the surrounding and effective capture of a person by a liquid or finely divided (flowable) solid substance that can be aspirated to cause death by filling or plugging the respiratory system or that can exert enough force on the body to cause death by strangulation, constriction, or crushing.


*Entry* means the action by which a person passes through an opening into a permit-required confined space. Entry includes ensuing work activities in that space and is considered to have occurred as soon as any part of the entrant's body breaks the plane of an opening into the space.

(2) Airborne combustible dust at a concentration that meets or exceeds its LFL;


(3) Atmospheric oxygen concentration below 19.5 percent or above 23.5 percent;


(4) Atmospheric concentration of any substance for which a dose or a permissible exposure limit is published in subpart G, *Occupational Health and Environmental Control,* or in subpart Z, *Toxic and Hazardous Substances,* of this part and which could result in employee exposure in excess of its dose or permissible exposure limit;


(5) Any other atmospheric condition that is immediately dangerous to life or health.


*Hot work permit* means the employer's written authorization to perform operations (for example, riveting, welding, cutting, burning, and heating) capable of providing a source of ignition.


*Immediately dangerous to life or health* (IDLH) means any condition that poses an immediate or delayed threat to life or that would cause irreversible adverse health effects or that would interfere with an individual's ability to escape unaided from a permit space.


*Inerting* means the displacement of the atmosphere in a permit space by a noncombustible gas (such as nitrogen) to such an extent that the resulting atmosphere is noncombustible.


*Isolation* means the process by which a permit space is removed from service and completely protected against the release of energy and material into the space by such means as: blanking or blinding; misaligning or removing sections of lines, pipes, or ducts; a double block and bleed system; lockout or tagout of all sources of energy; or blocking or disconnecting all mechanical linkages.
