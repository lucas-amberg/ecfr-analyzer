(19) *Fixed extinguishing system* means a permanently installed system that either extinguishes or controls a fire at the location of the system.


(20) *Flame resistance* is the property of materials, or combinations of component materials, to retard ignition and restrict the spread of flame.


(21) *Foam* means a stable aggregation of small bubbles which flow freely over a burning liquid surface and form a coherent blanket which seals combustible vapors and thereby extinguishes the fire.


(22) *Gaseous agent* is a fire extinguishing agent which is in the gaseous state at normal room temperature and pressure. It has low viscosity, can expand or contract with changes in pressure and temperature, and has the ability to diffuse readily and to distribute itself uniformly throughout an enclosure.
