Energy delivered during each stroke may be varied.


(4) *Gravity hammers* mean a class of forging hammer wherein energy for forging is obtained by the mass and velocity of a freely falling ram and the attached upper die. Examples: board hammers and air-lift hammers.


(5) *Forging presses* mean a class of forging equipment wherein the shaping of metal between dies is performed by mechanical or hydraulic pressure, and usually is accomplished with a single workstroke of the press for each die station.


(6) *Trimming presses* mean a class of auxiliary forging equipment which removes flash or excess metal from a forging. This trimming operation can also be done cold, as can coining, a product sizing operation.


(7) *High-energy-rate forging machines* mean a class of forging equipment wherein high ram velocities resulting from the sudden release of a compressed gas against a free piston impart impact to the workpiece.


(8) *Forging rolls* mean a class of auxiliary forging equipment wherein stock is shaped between power driven rolls bearing contoured dies. Usually used for preforming, roll forging is often employed to reduce thickness and increase length of stock.


(9) *Ring rolls* mean a class for forging equipment used for shaping weldless rings from pierced discs or thick-walled, ring-shaped blanks between rolls which control wall thickness, ring diameter, height and contour.


(10) *Bolt-headers* mean the same as an upsetter or forging machine except that the diameter of stock fed into the machine is much smaller, i.e., commonly three-fourths inch or less.


(11) Rivet making machines mean the same as upsetters and boltheaders when producing rivets with stock diameter of 1-inch or more. Rivet making with less than 1-inch diameter is usually a cold forging operation, and therefore not included in this subpart.


(12) Upsetters (or forging machines, or headers) type of forging equipment, related to the mechanical press, in which the main forming energy is applied horizontally to the workpiece which is gripped and held by prior action of the dies.


(f) As used in § 1910.219, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the following mechanical power-transmission guarding terms shall have the meaning prescribed in this paragraph.


(1) *Belts* include all power transmission belts, such as flat belts, round belts, V-belts, etc., unless otherwise specified.

(4) *Exposed to contact* means that the location of an object is such that a person is likely to come into contact with it and be injured.


(5) *Flywheels* include flywheels, balance wheels, and flywheel pulleys mounted and revolving on crankshaft of engine or other shafting.


(6) *Maintenance runway* means any permanent runway or platform used for oiling, maintenance, running adjustment, or repair work, but not for passageway.


(7) *Nip-point belt and pulley guard* means a device which encloses the pulley and is provided with rounded or rolled edge slots through which the belt passes.


(8) *Point of operation* means that point at which cutting, shaping, or forming is accomplished upon the stock and shall include such other points as may offer a hazard to the operator in inserting or manipulating the stock in the operation of the machine.


(9) *Prime movers* include steam, gas, oil, and air engines, motors, steam and hydraulic turbines, and other equipment used as a source of power.


(10) *Sheaves* mean grooved pulleys, and shall be so classified unless used as flywheels.
