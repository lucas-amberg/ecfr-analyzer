(a) *Portable powered tool*—(1) *Portable circular saws.* (i) All portable, power-driven circular saws having a blade diameter greater than 2 in. shall be equipped with guards above and below the base plate or shoe. The upper guard shall cover the saw to the depth of the teeth, except for the minimum arc required to permit the base to be tilted for bevel cuts. The lower guard shall cover the saw to the depth of the teeth, except for the minimum arc required to allow proper retraction and contact with the work. When the tool is withdrawn from the work, the lower guard shall automatically and instantly return to covering position.


(ii) Paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to circular saws used in the meat industry for meat cutting purposes.


(2) *Switches and controls.* (i) All hand-held powered circular saws having a blade diameter greater than 2 inches, electric, hydraulic or pneumatic chain saws, and percussion tools without positive accessory holding means shall be equipped with a constant pressure switch or control that will shut off the power when the pressure is released. All hand-held gasoline powered chain saws shall be equipped with a constant pressure throttle control that will shut off the power to the saw chain when the pressure is released.


(ii) All hand-held powered drills, tappers, fastener drivers, horizontal, vertical, and angle grinders with wheels greater than 2 inches in diameter, disc sanders with discs greater than 2 inches in diameter, belt sanders, reciprocating saws, saber, scroll, and jig saws with blade shanks greater than a nominal one-fourth inch, and other similarly operating powered tools shall be equipped with a constant pressure switch or control, and may have a lock-on control provided that turnoff can be accomplished by a single motion of the same finger or fingers that turn it on.


(iii)(*a*) All other hand-held powered tools, such as, but not limited to, platen sanders, grinders with wheels 2 inches in diameter or less, disc sanders with discs 2 inches in diameter or less, routers, planers, laminate trimmers, nibblers, shears, saber, scroll, and jig saws with blade shanks a nominal one-fourth of an inch wide or less, may be equipped with either a positive “on-off” control, or other controls as described by paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(*b*) Saber, scroll, and jig saws with nonstandard blade holders may use blades with shanks which are nonuniform in width, provided the narrowest portion of the blade shank is an integral part in mounting the blade.


(*c*) Blade shank width shall be measured at the narrowest portion of the blade shank when saber, scroll, and jig saws have nonstandard blade holders.


(*d*) *Nominal* in this subparagraph means ±0.05 inch.


(iv) The operating control on hand-held power tools shall be so located as to minimize the possibility of its accidental operation, if such accidental operation would constitute a hazard to employees.

(3) *Portable belt sanding machines.* Belt sanding machines shall be provided with guards at each nip point where the sanding belt runs onto a pulley. These guards shall effectively prevent the hands or fingers of the operator from coming in contact with the nip points. The unused run of the sanding belt shall be guarded against accidental contact.


(4) *Cracked saws.* All cracked saws shall be removed from service.


(5) *Grounding.* Portable electric powered tools shall meet the electrical requirements of subpart S of this part.


(b) *Pneumatic powered tools and hose*—(1) *Tool retainer.* A tool retainer shall be installed on each piece of utilization equipment which, without such a retainer, may eject the tool.


(2) *Airhose.* Hose and hose connections used for conducting compressed air to utilization equipment shall be designed for the pressure and service to which they are subjected.


(c) *Portable abrasive wheels*—(1) *General requirements.* Abrasive wheels shall be used only on machine provided with safety guards as defined in paragraph (c) (1) through (4) of this section.


(i) *Exceptions.* The requirements of this paragraph (c)(1) shall not apply to the following classes of wheels and conditions.


(*a*) Wheels used for internal work while within the work being ground;


(*b*) Mounted wheels used in portable operations 2 inches and smaller in diameter; (see definition § 1910.241(b)(1)); and


(*c*) Types 16, 17, 18, 18R, and 19 cones, and plugs, and threaded hole pot balls where the work offers protection.


(ii)(*a*) A safety guard shall cover the spindle end, nut and flange projections. The safety guard shall be mounted so as to maintain proper alignment with the wheel, and the strength of the fastenings shall exceed the strength of the guard.


(*b*) *Exception.* Safety guards on all operations where the work provides a suitable measure of protection to the operator may be so constructed that the spindle end, nut and outer flange are exposed. Where the nature of the work is such as to entirely cover the side of the wheel, the side covers of the guard may be omitted.


(*c*) *Exception.* The spindle end, nut, and outer flange may be exposed on portable machines designed for, and used with, type 6, 11, 27, and 28 abrasive wheels, cutting off wheels, and tuck pointing wheels.


(2) *Cup wheels.* Cup wheels (Types 6 and 11) shall be protected by:


(i) Safety guards as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or,


(ii) Special “revolving cup guards” which mount behind the wheel and turn with it. They shall be made of steel or other material with adequate strength and shall enclose the wheel sides upward from the back for one-third of the wheel thickness. The mounting features shall conform with all regulations. (See paragraph (c)(5) of this section.) It is necessary to maintain clearance between the wheel side and the guard. The clearance shall not exceed one-sixteenth inch; or,


(iii) Some other form of guard that will insure as good protection as that which would be provided by the guards specified in paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph.


(3) *Vertical portable grinders.* Safety guards used on machines known as right angle head or vertical portable grinders shall have a maximum exposure angle of 180°, and the guard shall be so located so as to be between the operator and the wheel during use. Adjustment of guard shall be such that pieces of an accidentally broken wheel will be deflected away from the operator. (See Figure P-4.)


(4) *Other portable grinders.* The maximum angular exposure of the grinding wheel periphery and sides for safety guards used on other portable grinding machines shall not exceed 180° and the top half of the wheel shall be enclosed at all times. (See Figures P-5 and P-6.)


(5) *Mounting and inspection of abrasive wheels.* (i) Immediately before mounting, all wheels shall be closely inspected and sounded by the user (ring test, see subpart O, § 1910.215(d)(1)) to make sure they have not been damaged in transit, storage, or otherwise. The spindle speed of the machine shall be checked before mounting of the wheel to be certain that it does not exceed the maximum operating speed marked on the wheel.


(ii) Grinding wheels shall fit freely on the spindle and remain free under all grinding conditions. A controlled clearance between the wheel hole and the machine spindle (or wheel sleeves or adaptors) is essential to avoid excessive pressure from mounting and spindle expansion. To accomplish this, the machine spindle shall be made to nominal (standard) size plus zero minus .002 inch, and the wheel hole shall be made suitably oversize to assure safety clearance under the conditions of operating heat and pressure.


(iii) All contact surfaces of wheels, blotters, and flangers shall be flat and free of foreign matter.


(iv) When a bushing is used in the wheel hole it shall not exceed the width of the wheel and shall not contact the flanges.


(v) Requirements for the use of flanges and blotters, see subpart O, § 1910.215(c).


(6) *Excluded machinery.* Natural sandstone wheels and metal, wooden, cloth, or paper discs, having a layer of abrasive on the surface are not covered by this paragraph.
