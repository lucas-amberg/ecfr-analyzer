These types of logging include, but are not limited to, pulpwood and timber harvesting and the logging of sawlogs, veneer bolts, poles, pilings and other forest products. This standard does not cover the construction or use of cable yarding systems.


(2) This standard applies to all logging operations as defined by this section.


(3) Hazards and working conditions not specifically addressed by this section are covered by other applicable sections of part 1910.


(c) *Definitions applicable to this section.*

If the danger tree is not felled or removed, it shall be marked and no work shall be conducted within two tree lengths of the danger tree unless the employer demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create a hazard for an employee.


(vii) Each danger tree shall be carefully checked for signs of loose bark, broken branches and limbs or other damage before they are felled or removed. Accessible loose bark and other damage that may create a hazard for an employee shall be removed or held in place before felling or removing the tree.

Where the choker is hooked or unhooked from the downhill side or end of the log, the log shall be securely chocked to prevent rolling, sliding or swinging.


(iii) Each choker shall be positioned near the end of the log or tree length.


(iv) Each machine shall be positioned during winching so the machine and winch are operated within their design limits.


(v) No yarding line shall be moved unless the yarding machine operator has clearly received and understood the signal to do so. When in doubt, the yarding machine operator shall repeat the signal and wait for a confirming signal before moving any line.


(vi) No load shall exceed the rated capacity of the pallet, trailer, or other carrier.
