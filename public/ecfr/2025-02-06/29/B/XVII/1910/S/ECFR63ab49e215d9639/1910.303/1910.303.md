# § 1910.303   General.

(a) *Approval.* The conductors and equipment required or permitted by this subpart shall be acceptable only if approved, as defined in § 1910.399.


(b) *Examination, installation, and use of equipment*—(1) *Examination.* Electric equipment shall be free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees. Safety of equipment shall be determined using the following considerations:


(i) Suitability for installation and use in conformity with the provisions of this subpart;


(ii) Mechanical strength and durability, including, for parts designed to enclose and protect other equipment, the adequacy of the protection thus provided;


(iii) Wire-bending and connection space;


(iv) Electrical insulation;


(v) Heating effects under all conditions of use;


(vi) Arcing effects;


(vii) Classification by type, size, voltage, current capacity, and specific use; and


(viii) Other factors that contribute to the practical safeguarding of persons using or likely to come in contact with the equipment.


(2) *Installation and use.* Listed or labeled equipment shall be installed and used in accordance with any instructions included in the listing or labeling.


(3) *Insulation integrity.* Completed wiring installations shall be free from short circuits and from grounds other than those required or permitted by this subpart.


(4) *Interrupting rating.* Equipment intended to interrupt current at fault levels shall have an interrupting rating sufficient for the nominal circuit voltage and the current that is available at the line terminals of the equipment. Equipment intended to interrupt current at other than fault levels shall have an interrupting rating at nominal circuit voltage sufficient for the current that must be interrupted.


(5) *Circuit impedance and other characteristics.* The overcurrent protective devices, the total impedance, the component short-circuit current ratings, and other characteristics of the circuit to be protected shall be selected and coordinated to permit the circuit protective devices used to clear a fault to do so without the occurrence of extensive damage to the electrical components of the circuit. This fault shall be assumed to be either between two or more of the circuit conductors, or between any circuit conductor and the grounding conductor or enclosing metal raceway.


(6) *Deteriorating agents.* Unless identified for use in the operating environment, no conductors or equipment shall be located in damp or wet locations; where exposed to gases, fumes, vapors, liquids, or other agents that have a deteriorating effect on the conductors or equipment; or where exposed to excessive temperatures.


(7) *Mechanical execution of work.* Electric equipment shall be installed in a neat and workmanlike manner.


(i) Unused openings in boxes, raceways, auxiliary gutters, cabinets, equipment cases, or housings shall be effectively closed to afford protection substantially equivalent to the wall of the equipment.


(ii) Conductors shall be racked to provide ready and safe access in underground and subsurface enclosures that persons enter for installation and maintenance.


(iii) Internal parts of electrical equipment, including busbars, wiring terminals, insulators, and other surfaces, may not be damaged or contaminated by foreign materials such as paint, plaster, cleaners, abrasives, or corrosive residues.


(iv) There shall be no damaged parts that may adversely affect safe operation or mechanical strength of the equipment, such as parts that are broken, bent, cut, or deteriorated by corrosion, chemical action, or overheating.


(8) *Mounting and cooling of equipment.* (i) Electric equipment shall be firmly secured to the surface on which it is mounted.


(ii) Electric equipment that depends on the natural circulation of air and convection principles for cooling of exposed surfaces shall be installed so that room airflow over such surfaces is not prevented by walls or by adjacent installed equipment. For equipment designed for floor mounting, clearance between top surfaces and adjacent surfaces shall be provided to dissipate rising warm air.


(iii) Electric equipment provided with ventilating openings shall be installed so that walls or other obstructions do not prevent the free circulation of air through the equipment.


(c) *Electrical connections*—(1) *General.* Because of different characteristics of dissimilar metals:


(i) Devices such as pressure terminal or pressure splicing connectors and soldering lugs shall be identified for the material of the conductor and shall be properly installed and used;


(ii) Conductors of dissimilar metals may not be intermixed in a terminal or splicing connector where physical contact occurs between dissimilar conductors (such as copper and aluminum, copper and copper-clad aluminum, or aluminum and copper-clad aluminum) unless the device is identified for the purpose and conditions of use; and


(iii) Materials such as solder, fluxes, inhibitors, and compounds, where employed, shall be suitable for the use and shall be of a type that will not adversely affect the conductors, installation, or equipment.


(2) *Terminals.* (i) Connection of conductors to terminal parts shall ensure a good connection without damaging the conductors and shall be made by means of pressure connectors (including set-screw type), solder lugs, or splices to flexible leads. However, No. 10 or smaller conductors may be connected by means of wire binding screws or studs and nuts having upturned lugs or equivalent.


(ii) Terminals for more than one conductor and terminals used to connect aluminum shall be so identified.


(3) *Splices.* (i) Conductors shall be spliced or joined with splicing devices identified for the use or by brazing, welding, or soldering with a fusible metal or alloy. Soldered splices shall first be spliced or joined to be mechanically and electrically secure without solder and then soldered. All splices and joints and the free ends of conductors shall be covered with an insulation equivalent to that of the conductors or with an insulating device identified for the purpose.


(ii) Wire connectors or splicing means installed on conductors for direct burial shall be listed for such use.


(d) *Arcing parts.* Parts of electric equipment that in ordinary operation produce arcs, sparks, flames, or molten metal shall be enclosed or separated and isolated from all combustible material.


(e) *Marking*—(1) *Identification of manufacturer and ratings.* Electric equipment may not be used unless the following markings have been placed on the equipment:


(i) The manufacturer's name, trademark, or other descriptive marking by which the organization responsible for the product may be identified; and


(ii) Other markings giving voltage, current, wattage, or other ratings as necessary.


(2) *Durability.* The marking shall be of sufficient durability to withstand the environment involved.
