# § 1910.307   Hazardous (classified) locations.

(a) *Scope*—(1) *Applicability.* This section covers the requirements for electric equipment and wiring in locations that are classified depending on the properties of the flammable vapors, liquids or gases, or combustible dusts or fibers that may be present therein and the likelihood that a flammable or combustible concentration or quantity is present. Hazardous (classified) locations may be found in occupancies such as, but not limited to, the following: aircraft hangars, gasoline dispensing and service stations, bulk storage plants for gasoline or other volatile flammable liquids, paint-finishing process plants, health care facilities, agricultural or other facilities where excessive combustible dusts may be present, marinas, boat yards, and petroleum and chemical processing plants. Each room, section or area shall be considered individually in determining its classification.


(2) *Classifications.* (i) These hazardous (classified) locations are assigned the following designations:


(A) Class I, Division 1


(B) Class I, Division 2


(C) Class I, Zone 0


(D) Class I, Zone 1


(E) Class I, Zone 2


(F) Class II, Division 1


(G) Class II, Division 2


(H) Class III, Division 1


(I) Class III, Division 2


(ii) For definitions of these locations, see § 1910.399.


(3) *Other sections of this subpart.* All applicable requirements in this subpart apply to hazardous (classified) locations unless modified by provisions of this section.


(4) *Division and zone classification.* In Class I locations, an installation must be classified as using the division classification system meeting paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section or using the zone classification system meeting paragraph (g) of this section. In Class II and Class III locations, an installation must be classified using the division classification system meeting paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section.


(b) *Documentation.* All areas designated as hazardous (classified) locations under the Class and Zone system and areas designated under the Class and Division system established after August 13, 2007 shall be properly documented. This documentation shall be available to those authorized to design, install, inspect, maintain, or operate electric equipment at the location.


(c) *Electrical installations.* Equipment, wiring methods, and installations of equipment in hazardous (classified) locations shall be intrinsically safe, approved for the hazardous (classified) location, or safe for the hazardous (classified) location. Requirements for each of these options are as follows:


(1) *Intrinsically safe.* Equipment and associated wiring approved as intrinsically safe is permitted in any hazardous (classified) location for which it is approved;


(2) *Approved for the hazardous (classified) location.* (i) Equipment shall be approved not only for the class of location, but also for the ignitable or combustible properties of the specific gas, vapor, dust, or fiber that will be present.


(ii) Equipment shall be marked to show the class, group, and operating temperature or temperature range, based on operation in a 40-degree C ambient, for which it is approved. The temperature marking may not exceed the ignition temperature of the specific gas or vapor to be encountered. However, the following provisions modify this marking requirement for specific equipment:


(A) Equipment of the nonheat-producing type, such as junction boxes, conduit, and fittings, and equipment of the heat-producing type having a maximum temperature not more than 100 °C (212 °F) need not have a marked operating temperature or temperature range;


(B) Fixed lighting fixtures marked for use in Class I, Division 2 or Class II, Division 2 locations only need not be marked to indicate the group;


(C) Fixed general-purpose equipment in Class I locations, other than lighting fixtures, that is acceptable for use in Class I, Division 2 locations need not be marked with the class, group, division, or operating temperature;


(D) Fixed dust-tight equipment, other than lighting fixtures, that is acceptable for use in Class II, Division 2 and Class III locations need not be marked with the class, group, division, or operating temperature; and


(E) Electric equipment suitable for ambient temperatures exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) shall be marked with both the maximum ambient temperature and the operating temperature or temperature range at that ambient temperature; and


(3) *Safe for the hazardous (classified) location.* Equipment that is safe for the location shall be of a type and design that the employer demonstrates will provide protection from the hazards arising from the combustibility and flammability of vapors, liquids, gases, dusts, or fibers involved.


(d) *Conduits.* All conduits shall be threaded and shall be made wrench-tight. Where it is impractical to make a threaded joint tight, a bonding jumper shall be utilized.


(e) *Equipment in Division 2 locations.* Equipment that has been approved for a Division 1 location may be installed in a Division 2 location of the same class and group. General-purpose equipment or equipment in general-purpose enclosures may be installed in Division 2 locations if the employer can demonstrate that the equipment does not constitute a source of ignition under normal operating conditions.


(f) *Protection techniques.* The following are acceptable protection techniques for electric and electronic equipment in hazardous (classified) locations.


(1) *Explosionproof apparatus.* This protection technique is permitted for equipment in the Class I, Division 1 and 2 locations for which it is approved.


(2) *Dust ignitionproof.* This protection technique is permitted for equipment in the Class II, Division 1 and 2 locations for which it is approved.


(3) *Dust-tight.* This protection technique is permitted for equipment in the Class II, Division 2 and Class III locations for which it is approved.


(4) *Purged and pressurized.* This protection technique is permitted for equipment in any hazardous (classified) location for which it is approved.


(5) *Nonincendive circuit.* This protection technique is permitted for equipment in Class I, Division 2; Class II, Division 2; or Class III, Division 1or 2 locations.


(6) *Nonincendive equipment.* This protection technique is permitted for equipment in Class I, Division 2; Class II, Division 2; or Class III, Division 1 or 2 locations.
