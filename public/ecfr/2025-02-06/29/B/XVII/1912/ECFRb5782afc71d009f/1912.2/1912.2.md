# ยง 1912.2   Types of standards advisory committees.

The Assistant Secretary establishes two types of advisory committees under section 7(b) of the Act to assist him in his standards-setting duties. These are: 


(a) Continuing committees which have been, or may be established from time to time, to assist in the development of standards in areas where there is frequent rulemaking and the use of ad hoc committees is impractical; and


(b) Ad hoc committees which are established to render advice in particular rulemaking proceedings.
