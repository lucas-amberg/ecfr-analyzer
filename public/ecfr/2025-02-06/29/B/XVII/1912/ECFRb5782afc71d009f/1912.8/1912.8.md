# ยง 1912.8   Committee charters.

(a) *Filing.* No advisory committee shall take any action or conduct any business subsequent to January 5, 1973, until a committee charter has been filed with the Secretary of Labor, the standing committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction of the Department of Labor and the Library of Congress. 


(b) *Committee charter information.* Each Advisory committee charter shall contain the following information: 


(1) The committee's official designation; 


(2) The committee's objectives and scope of activity; i.e., the standard or standards to be developed; 


(3) The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out its purposes; 


(4) The agency to whom the advisory committee reports (i.e., the Assistant Secretary); 


(5) The agency responsible for providing support (i.e., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration); 


(6) Description of the committee's duties; 


(7) The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings; 


(8) The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and man-years; 


(9) The committee's termination date or other fixed period of termination, if less than 2 years (see ยง 1912.3(j) concerning the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health); and 


(10) The date the charter is filed with the Department of Labor's Committee Management Officer. 


(c) *Applicability of this section to subgroups* The applicability of this section to subgroups of an advisory committee depends upon the nature of the subgroup. With regard to formal subgroups, such as a formal subcommittee of an advisory committee, the requisite information should be set forth either in the charter of the parent committee or in a separate charter. Informal subgroups of an advisory committee, particularly those temporary in nature, need not be reflected expressly in a charter. 


(d) The Assistant Secretary shall file each charter with the Department's Committee Management Officer.
