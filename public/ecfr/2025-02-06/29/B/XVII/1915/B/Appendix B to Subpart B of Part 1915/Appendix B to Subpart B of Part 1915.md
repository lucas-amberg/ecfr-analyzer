(b) Until an inspection has been made to determine that such operation can be undertaken with safety, no alterations, repairs, or other such operations involving riveting, welding, burning, or like fire-producing actions shall be made: 


(1) Within or on the boundaries of cargo tanks that have been used to carry flammable or combustible liquid or chemicals in bulk, or within spaces adjacent to such cargo tanks; or 


(2) Within or on the boundaries of fuel tanks; or 


(3) To pipe lines, heating coils, pumps, fittings, or other appurtenances connected to such cargo or fuel tanks. 


(c) Such inspections shall be made and evidenced as follows: 


(1) In ports or places in the United States or its territories and possessions, the inspection shall be made by a Marine Chemist certificated by the National Fire Protection Association; however, if the services of such certified Marine Chemists are not reasonably available, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, upon the recommendation of the vessel owner and his contractor or their representative, shall select a person who, in the case of an individual vessel, shall be authorized to make such inspection. If the inspection indicates that such operations can be undertaken with safety, a certificate setting forth the fact in writing and qualified as may be required, shall be issued by the certified Marine Chemist or the authorized person before the work is started.
