# § 1915.76   Access to cargo spaces and confined spaces.

The provisions of this section apply to ship repairing, shipbuilding and shipbreaking except that paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies to ship repairing only.


(a) *Cargo spaces.* (1) There shall be at least one safe and accessible ladder in any cargo space which employees must enter.


(2) When any fixed ladder is visibly unsafe, the employer shall prohibit its use by employees.


(3) Straight ladders of adequate strength and suitably secured against shifting or slipping shall be provided as necessary when fixed ladders in cargo spaces do not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. When conditions are such that a straight ladder cannot be used, a Jacob's ladder meeting the requirements of § 1915.74(d) may be used.


(4) When cargo is stowed within 4 inches of the back of ladder rungs, the ladder shall be deemed “unsafe” for the purpose of this section.


(5) Fixed ladders or straight ladders provided for access to cargo spaces shall not be used at the same time that cargo drafts, equipment, materials, scrap or other loads are entering or leaving the hold. Before using these ladders to enter or leave the hold, the employee shall be required to inform the winchman or crane signalman of his intention.


(b) *Confined spaces.* (1) More than one means of access shall be provided to a confined space in which employees are working and in which the work may generate a hazardous atmosphere in the space except where the structure or arrangement of the vessel makes this provision impractical.


(2) When the ventilation ducts required by these regulations must pass through these means of access, the ducts shall be of such a type and so arranged as to permit free passage of an employee through at least two of these means of access.
