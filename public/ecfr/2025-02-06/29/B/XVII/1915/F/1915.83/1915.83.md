(a) *Steam supply system.* (1) The employer shall ensure that the vessel's steam piping system, including hoses, is designed to safely handle the working pressure prior to supplying steam from an outside source. The employer shall obtain a written or oral determination from a responsible vessel's representative, a contractor, or any other person who is qualified by training, knowledge, or experience to make such determination that the working pressure of the vessel's steam piping system is safe.


(2) The employer shall ensure that each outside steam supply connected to a vessel's steam piping system meets the following requirements:


(i) A pressure gauge and a relief valve are installed at the point where the temporary steam hose joins the vessel's steam piping system;


(ii) Each relief valve is set to relieve excess steam at, and is capable of relieving steam at, a pressure that does not exceed the safe working pressure of the system in its present condition;


(iii) There are no means of inadvertently disconnecting any relief valve from the system that it protects;


(iv) Each pressure gauge and relief valve is legible and located so it is visible and readily accessible; and


(v) Each relief valve is positioned so it is not likely to cause injury if steam is released.


(b) *Steam hoses.* The employer shall ensure that each steam hose meets the following requirements:


(1) The steam hose and its fittings are used in accordance with manufacturer's specifications;


(2) Each steam hose is hung tightly with short bights that prevent chafing and to reduce tension on the hose and its fittings;


(3) Each steam hose is protected from damage; and


(4) Each steam hose or temporary steam piping, including metal fittings and couplings, that pass through a walking or working area is shielded to protect employees from contact.


(c) *Electric shore power.* When a vessel is supplied with electric shore power, the employer shall take the following precautions prior to energizing any of the vessel's circuits:


(1) Ensure that the vessel is grounded;


(2) Equip each circuit to be energized with over-current protection that does not exceed the rated current-carrying capacity of the conductors; and


(3) Ensure that each circuit to be energized is in a safe condition. The employer must obtain a determination of the safe condition, either orally or in writing, from a responsible vessel's representative, a contractor, or any other person who is qualified by training, knowledge, or experience to make such determination.


(d) *Heat lamps.* The employer shall ensure that each heat lamp, including the face, is equipped with surround-type guards to prevent contact with the lamp and bulb.
