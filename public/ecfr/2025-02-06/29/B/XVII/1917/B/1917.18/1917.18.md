# ยง 1917.18   Log handling.

(a) The employer shall ensure that structures (bunks) used to contain logs have rounded corners and rounded structural parts to avoid sling damage.


(b) Two or more binders or equivalently safe means of containment shall remain on logging trucks and railcars to secure logs during movement of the truck or car within the terminal. During unloading, logs shall be prevented from moving while binders are being removed.


(c) Logs shall be hoisted by two slings or by other gear designed for safe hoisting.


(d) Logs placed adjacent to vehicle curbs on the dock shall not be over one tier high unless placed in bunks or so stacked as not to roll or otherwise create a hazard to employees.


(e) Before logs are slung up from the dock, they shall be stably supported to prevent spreading and to allow passage of slings beneath the load. When bunks or similar retaining devices are used, no log shall be higher than the stanchions or retaining members of the device.
