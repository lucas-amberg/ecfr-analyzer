Each application shall be signed and certified by the applicant and, if the applicant is an agency or organization, by a responsible officer of such agency or organization. 


(b) *Contents of application.* The application form shall include the following information: 


(1) A statement detailing the applicable types of work performed by the applicant in the past, noting the amount and extent of such work performed within the previous three years, listing representative vessels involved, and including representative job orders, if available, or equivalent evidence; 


(2) Descriptive details concerning any testing instruments and heat treatment furnaces which are to be used in conducting required tests or heat treatments. Test reports indicating that instruments meet the accuracy standards set forth in this part shall be included; 


(3) A list setting forth the ports in which applicant currently conducts his business as well as those in which he proposes to conduct gear certification activities;

Such list shall include any branch office personnel or surveyors appointed to act in the applicant's behalf in any of the ports of the United States: *Provided, however,* That where the submission of individual resumes would be unduly burdensome because of the large number of persons engaged in the applicant's behalf, the applicant, after stating this fact, need only submit a list of its personnel together with a detailed statement of the qualifications upon which the appointment of surveyors is based; 


(5) A detailed schedule of the fees proposed to be charged for the various gear certification services; 


(6) Evidence of financial stability; 


(7) Names of at least three business references who will furnish information regarding work performed by applicant;
