# § 1919.31   Proof tests—loose gear.

(a) Chains, rings, shackles and other loose gear (whether accessory to a machine or not) shall be tested with a proof load against the article equal to that shown in the following table: 


(b) In cases where persons accredited to carry out loose gear tests may be retained to conduct tests of special stevedoring gear as described in § 1918.61(b) of this chapter, which does not form part of a vessel's equipment, such tests shall adhere to the requirements set forth in § 1918.61(b) (1), (2), and (3) of this chapter. 


(c) After being tested as required by paragraph (a) of this section, and before being taken into use, all chains, rings, hooks, shackles, blocks or other loose gear, except as noted in § 1919.32, shall be thoroughly examined, the sheaves and pins of the blocks being removed for this purpose, to determine whether any part has been injured or permanently deformed by the test. Shell bolt nuts shall be securely locked upon reassembly. Defective loose gear components shall be replaced before the certificate is issued. 


(d) Any certificate relating to shackles, swivels or strength members of single-sheave blocks which have been restored to original dimensions by welding shall state this fact.
