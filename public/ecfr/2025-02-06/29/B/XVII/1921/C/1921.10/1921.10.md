# § 1921.10   Appearances.

(a) *Representation.* The parties may appear in person or by counsel. The term “counsel” means a member in good standing of the bar of a Federal Court or of the highest court of any State or Territory of the United States. 


(b) *Failure to appear.* In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the party who is present shall have an election to present his evidence in whole or such portion thereof sufficient to make a prima facie case before the hearing examiner. Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the hearing examiner's decision and to file exceptions thereto.
