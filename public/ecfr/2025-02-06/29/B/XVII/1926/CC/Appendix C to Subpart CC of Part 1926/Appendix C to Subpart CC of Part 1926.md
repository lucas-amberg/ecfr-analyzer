(4) How to review operation plans with supervisors and other workers (such as the signal person), including how to determine working height, boom length, load radius, and travel clearance.


(5) How to determine if there is adequate room for extension of crawlers or outriggers/stabilizers and counterweights.


(c) Operations.


(1) How to pick, carry, swing and place the load smoothly and safely on rubber tires and on outriggers/stabilizers or crawlers (where applicable).


(2) How to communicate at the site with supervisors, the crew and the signal person.


(3) Proper procedures and methods of reeving wire ropes and methods of reeving multiple-part lines and selecting the proper load block and/or ball.


(4) How to react to changes in conditions that affect the safe operation of the equipment.


(5) How to shut down and secure the equipment properly when leaving it unattended.


(6) Know how to apply the manufacturer's specifications for operating in various weather conditions, and understand how environmental conditions affect the safe operation of the equipment.


(7) How to properly level the equipment.


(8) How to verify the weight of the load and rigging prior to initiating the lift.


(9) How to determine where the load is to be picked up and placed and how to verify the radii.


(10) Know basic rigging procedures.


(11) How to carry out the shift inspection required in this subpart.


(12) Know that the following operations require specific procedures and skill levels:
