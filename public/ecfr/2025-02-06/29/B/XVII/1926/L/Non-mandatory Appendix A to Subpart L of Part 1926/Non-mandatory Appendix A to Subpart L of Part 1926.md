# (Non-mandatory) Appendix A to Subpart L of Part 1926—Scaffold Specifications


This appendix provides non-mandatory guidelines to assist employers in complying with the requirements of subpart L of this part. An employer may use these guidelines and tables as a starting point for designing scaffold systems. However, the guidelines do not provide all the information necessary to build a complete system, and the employer is still responsible for designing and assembling these components in such a way that the completed system will meet the requirements of § 1926.451(a). Scaffold components which are not selected and loaded in accordance with this Appendix, and components for which no specific guidelines or tables are given in this appendix (e.g., joints, ties, components for wood pole scaffolds more than 60 feet in height, components for heavy-duty horse scaffolds, components made with other materials, and components with other dimensions, etc.) must be designed and constructed in accordance with the capacity requirements of § 1926.451(a), and loaded in accordance with § 1926.451(d)(1).

(e) *Bricklayers' square scaffolds.*

(f) Horse scaffolds.


(g) *Form scaffolds and carpenters' bracket scaffolds.* (1) Brackets shall consist of a triangular-shaped frame made of wood with a cross-section not less than 2 inches by 3 inches, or of 1
1/4 inch × 1
1/4 inch × 
1/8 inch structural angle iron.


(2) Bolts used to attach brackets to structures shall not be less than 
5/8 inches in diameter.


(3) Maximum bracket spacing shall be 8 feet on centers.

(p) *Two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds.* (1) In addition to direct connections to buildings (except window cleaners' anchors) acceptable ways to prevent scaffold sway include angulated roping and static lines. Angulated roping is a system of platform suspension in which the upper wire rope sheaves or suspension points are closer to the plane of the building face than the corresponding attachment points on the platform, thus causing the platform to press against the face of the building. Static lines are separate ropes secured at their top and bottom ends closer to the plane of the building face than the outermost edge of the platform. By drawing the static line taut, the platform is drawn against the face of the building.


(2) On suspension scaffolds designed for a working load of 500 pounds, no more than two employees shall be permitted on the scaffold at one time. On suspension scaffolds with a working load of 750 pounds, no more than three employees shall be permitted on the scaffold at one time.

1/8 inches in diameter, with 
7/8 inch tenons mortised into the side stringers at least 
7/8 inch. The stringers shall be tied together with tie rods not less than 
1/4 inch in diameter, passing through the stringers and riveted up tight against washers on both ends. The flooring strips shall be spaced not more than 
5/8 inch apart, except at the side rails where the space may be 1 inch. Ladder-type platforms shall be constructed in accordance with the following table:


(4) Plank-Type Platforms. Plank-type platforms shall be composed of not less than nominal 2 × 8 inch unspliced planks, connected together on the underside with cleats at intervals not exceeding 4 feet, starting 6 inches from each end. A bar or other effective means shall be securely fastened to the platform at each end to prevent the platform from slipping off the hanger. The span between hangers for plank-type platforms shall not exceed 10 feet.


(5) Beam-Type Platforms. Beam platforms shall have side stringers of lumber not less than 2 × 6 inches set on edge. The span between hangers shall not exceed 12 feet when beam platforms are used. The flooring shall be supported on 2 × 6 inch cross beams, laid flat and set into the upper edge of the stringers with a snug fit, at intervals of not more than 4 feet, securely nailed to the cross beams. Floor-boards shall not be spaced more than 
1/2 inch apart.


(q)(1) *Multi-point adjustable suspension scaffolds and stonesetters' multi-point adjustable suspension scaffolds.* No specific guidelines or tables are given for these scaffolds.


(2) *Masons' multi-point adjustable suspension scaffolds.* Maximum intended load—50 lb/ft
2. Each outrigger beam shall be at least a standard 7 inch, 15.3 pound steel I-beam, at least 15 feet long. Such beams shall not project more than 6 feet 6 inches beyond the bearing point.

3/4 inch plywood, equivalent in rating to American Plywood Association Grade B-B, Group I, Exterior.


(3) Bearers shall be made from 2 × 4 inch, or 1 × 10 inch rough lumber. They shall be free of knots and other flaws.


(4) Ropes shall be equivalent in strength to at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter first grade manila rope.


(t) *Interior hung scaffolds.*

(u) *Needle beam scaffolds.*

(1) Ropes shall be attached to the needle beams by a scaffold hitch or an eye splice. The loose end of the rope shall be tied by a bowline knot or by a round turn and a half hitch.


(2) Ropes shall be equivalent in strength to at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter first grade manila rope.


(v) *Multi-level suspension scaffolds.* No additional guidelines or tables are being given for these scaffolds.


(w) *Mobile Scaffolds.* Stability test as described in the ANSI A92 series documents, as appropriate for the type of scaffold, can be used to establish stability for the purpose of § 1926.452(w)(6).


(x) *Repair bracket scaffolds.* No additional guidelines or tables are being given for these scaffolds.

(3) A taut wire or synthetic rope supported on the scaffold brackets shall be installed at the scaffold plank level between the innermost edge of the scaffold platform and the curved plate structure of the tank shell to serve as a safety line in lieu of an inner guardrail assembly where the space between the scaffold platform and the tank exceeds 12 inches (30.48 cm). In the event the open space on either side of the rope exceeds 12 inches (30.48 cm), a second wire or synthetic rope appropriately placed, or guardrails in accordance with § 1926.451(g)(4), shall be installed in order to reduce that open space to less than 12 inches (30.48 cm).


(4) Scaffold planks of rough full-dimensioned 2-inch (5.1 cm) × 12-inch (30.5 cm) Douglas Fir or Southern Yellow Pine of Select Structural Grade shall be used. Douglas Fir planks shall have a fiber stress of at least 1900 lb/in
2 (130,929 n/cm
2) and a modulus of elasticity of at least 1,900,000 lb/in
2 (130,929,000 n/cm
2), while Yellow Pine planks shall have a fiber stress of at least 2500 lb/in
2 (172,275 n/cm
2) and a modulus of elasticity of at least 2,000,000 lb/in
