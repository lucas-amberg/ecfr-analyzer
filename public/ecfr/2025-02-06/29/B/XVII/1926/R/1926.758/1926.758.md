# § 1926.758   Systems-engineered metal buildings.

(a) All of the requirements of this subpart apply to the erection of systems-engineered metal buildings except §§ 1926.755 (column anchorage) and 1926.757 (open web steel joists). 


(b) Each structural column shall be anchored by a minimum of four anchor rods (anchor bolts). 


(c) Rigid frames shall have 50 percent of their bolts or the number of bolts specified by the manufacturer (whichever is greater) installed and tightened on both sides of the web adjacent to each flange before the hoisting equipment is released. 


(d) Construction loads shall not be placed on any structural steel framework unless such framework is safely bolted, welded or otherwise adequately secured. 


(e) In girt and eave strut-to-frame connections, when girts or eave struts share common connection holes, at least one bolt with its wrench-tight nut shall remain connected to the first member unless a manufacturer-supplied, field-attached seat or similar connection device is present to secure the first member so that the girt or eave strut is always secured against displacement. 


(f) Both ends of all steel joists or cold-formed joists shall be fully bolted and/or welded to the support structure before: 


(1) Releasing the hoisting cables; 


(2) Allowing an employee on the joists; or 


(3) Allowing any construction loads on the joists. 


(g) Purlins and girts shall not be used as an anchorage point for a fall arrest system unless written approval is obtained from a qualified person. 


(h) Purlins may only be used as a walking/working surface when installing safety systems, after all permanent bridging has been installed and fall protection is provided. 


(i) Construction loads may be placed only within a zone that is within 8 feet (2.5 m) of the center-line of the primary support member.
