# Appendix F to Subpart R of Part 1926—Perimeter Columns: Non-Mandatory Guidelines for Complying With § 1926.756(

In multi-story structures, when holes in the column web are used for perimeter safety cables, the column splice must be placed sufficiently high so as not to interfere with any attachments to the column necessary for the column splice. Column splices are recommended to be placed at every other or fourth levels as design allows. Column splices at third levels are detrimental to the erection process and should be avoided if possible.
