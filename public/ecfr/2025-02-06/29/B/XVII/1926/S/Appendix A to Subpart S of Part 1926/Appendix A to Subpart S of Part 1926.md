# Appendix A to Subpart S of Part 1926â€”Decompression Tables


1. *Explanation.* The decompression tables are computed for working chamber pressures from 0 to 14 pounds, and from 14 to 50 pounds per square inch gauge inclusive by 2-pound increments and for exposure times for each pressure extending from one-half to over 8 hours inclusive. Decompressions will be conducted by two or more stages with a maximum of four stages, the latter for a working chamber pressure of 40 pounds per square inch gauge or over.


Stage 1 consists of a reduction in ambient pressure ranging from 10 to a maximum of 16 pounds per square inch, but in no instance will the pressure be reduced below 4 pounds at the end of stage 1. This reduction in pressure in stage 1 will always take place at a rate not greater than 5 pounds per minute.


Further reduction in pressure will take place during stage 2 and subsequent stages as required at a slower rate, but in no event at a rate greater than 1 pound per minute.


Decompression Table No. 1 indicates in the body of the table the total decompression time in minutes for various combinations of working chamber pressure and exposure time.


Decompression Table No. 2 indicates for the same various combinations of working chamber pressure and exposure time the following:


a. The number of stages required;


b. The reduction in pressure and the terminal pressure for each required stage;


c. The time in minutes through which the reduction in pressure is accomplished for each required stage;


d. The pressure reduction rate in minutes per pound for each required stage;
