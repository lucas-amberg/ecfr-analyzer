# § 1926.950   General.

(a) *Application*—(1) *Scope.* (i) This subpart, except for paragraph (a)(3) of this section, covers the construction of electric power transmission and distribution lines and equipment. As used in this subpart, the term “construction” includes the erection of new electric transmission and distribution lines and equipment, and the alteration, conversion, and improvement of existing electric transmission and distribution lines and equipment.


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, this subpart does not apply to electrical safety-related work practices for unqualified employees.


(2) *Other part 1926 standards.* This subpart applies in addition to all other applicable standards contained in this part 1926. Employers covered under this subpart are not exempt from complying with other applicable provisions in part 1926 by the operation of § 1910.5(c) of this chapter. Specific references in this subpart to other sections of part 1926 are provided for emphasis only.


(3) *Applicable part 1910 requirements.* (i) Line-clearance tree trimming performed for the purpose of clearing space around electric power generation, transmission, or distribution lines or equipment and on behalf of an organization that operates, or that controls the operating procedures for, those lines or equipment shall comply with § 1910.269 of this chapter.


(ii) Work involving electric power generation installations shall comply with § 1910.269 of this chapter.


(b) *Training*—(1) *All employees.* (i) Each employee shall be trained in, and familiar with, the safety-related work practices, safety procedures, and other safety requirements in this subpart that pertain to his or her job assignments.


(ii) Each employee shall also be trained in and familiar with any other safety practices, including applicable emergency procedures (such as pole-top and manhole rescue), that are not specifically addressed by this subpart but that are related to his or her work and are necessary for his or her safety.


(iii) The degree of training shall be determined by the risk to the employee for the hazard involved.


(2) *Qualified employees.* Each qualified employee shall also be trained and competent in:


(i) The skills and techniques necessary to distinguish exposed live parts from other parts of electric equipment,


(ii) The skills and techniques necessary to determine the nominal voltage of exposed live parts,


(iii) The minimum approach distances specified in this subpart corresponding to the voltages to which the qualified employee will be exposed and the skills and techniques necessary to maintain those distances,


(iv) The proper use of the special precautionary techniques, personal protective equipment, insulating and shielding materials, and insulated tools for working on or near exposed energized parts of electric equipment, and


(v) The recognition of electrical hazards to which the employee may be exposed and the skills and techniques necessary to control or avoid these hazards.


(3) *Supervision and annual inspection.* The employer shall determine, through regular supervision and through inspections conducted on at least an annual basis, that each employee is complying with the safety-related work practices required by this subpart.


(4) *Additional training.* An employee shall receive additional training (or retraining) under any of the following conditions:


(i) If the supervision or annual inspections required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section indicate that the employee is not complying with the safety-related work practices required by this subpart, or


(ii) If new technology, new types of equipment, or changes in procedures necessitate the use of safety-related work practices that are different from those which the employee would normally use, or


(iii) If he or she must employ safety-related work practices that are not normally used during his or her regular job duties.


(5) *Type of training.* The training required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be of the classroom or on-the-job type.


(6) *Training goals.* The training shall establish employee proficiency in the work practices required by this subpart and shall introduce the procedures necessary for compliance with this subpart.


(7) *Demonstration of proficiency.* The employer shall ensure that each employee has demonstrated proficiency in the work practices involved before that employee is considered as having completed the training required by paragraph (b) of this section.


(c) *Information transfer*—(1) *Host employer responsibilities.* Before work begins, the host employer shall inform contract employers of:


(i) The characteristics of the host employer's installation that are related to the safety of the work to be performed and are listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section;


(ii) Conditions that are related to the safety of the work to be performed, that are listed in paragraphs (d)(6) through (d)(8) of this section, and that are known to the host employer;


(iii) Information about the design and operation of the host employer's installation that the contract employer needs to make the assessments required by this subpart; and


(iv) Any other information about the design and operation of the host employer's installation that is known by the host employer, that the contract employer requests, and that is related to the protection of the contract employer's employees.


(2) *Contract employer responsibilities.* (i) The contract employer shall ensure that each of its employees is instructed in the hazardous conditions relevant to the employee's work that the contract employer is aware of as a result of information communicated to the contract employer by the host employer under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(ii) Before work begins, the contract employer shall advise the host employer of any unique hazardous conditions presented by the contract employer's work.


(iii) The contract employer shall advise the host employer of any unanticipated hazardous conditions found during the contract employer's work that the host employer did not mention under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The contract employer shall provide this information to the host employer within 2 working days after discovering the hazardous condition.


(3) *Joint host- and contract-employer responsibilities.* The contract employer and the host employer shall coordinate their work rules and procedures so that each employee of the contract employer and the host employer is protected as required by this subpart.


(d) *Existing characteristics and conditions.* Existing characteristics and conditions of electric lines and equipment that are related to the safety of the work to be performed shall be determined before work on or near the lines or equipment is started. Such characteristics and conditions include, but are not limited to:


(1) The nominal voltages of lines and equipment,


(2) The maximum switching-transient voltages,


(3) The presence of hazardous induced voltages,


(4) The presence of protective grounds and equipment grounding conductors,


(5) The locations of circuits and equipment, including electric supply lines, communication lines, and fire-protective signaling circuits,


(6) The condition of protective grounds and equipment grounding conductors,


(7) The condition of poles, and


(8) Environmental conditions relating to safety.
