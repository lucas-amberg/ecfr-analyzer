(b) *First-aid training.* In addition to the requirements of ยง 1926.50, when employees are performing work on, or associated with, exposed lines or equipment energized at 50 volts or more, persons with first-aid training shall be available as follows:


(1) *Field work.* For field work involving two or more employees at a work location, at least two trained persons shall be available.


(2) *Fixed work locations.* For fixed work locations such as substations, the number of trained persons available shall be sufficient to ensure that each employee exposed to electric shock can be reached within 4 minutes by a trained person.
