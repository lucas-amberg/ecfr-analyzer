# § 1952.1   South Carolina.

(a) The South Carolina State plan received initial approval on December 6, 1972.


(b) The South Carolina State plan received final approval on December 18, 1987.


(c) Under the terms of the 1978 Court Order in *AFL-CIO* v. *Marshall,* compliance officer staffing levels (benchmarks) necessary for a “fully effective” enforcement program were required to be established for each State operating an approved State plan. In September 1984, South Carolina, in conjunction with OSHA, completed a reassessment of the staffing levels initially established in 1980 and proposed revised compliance staffing benchmarks of 17 safety and 12 health compliance officers. After opportunity for public comment and service on the AFL-CIO, the Assistant Secretary approved these revised staffing requirements on January 17, 1986.


(d) The plan covers all private-sector employers and employees, with several notable exceptions, as well as State and local government employers and employees, within the State.
