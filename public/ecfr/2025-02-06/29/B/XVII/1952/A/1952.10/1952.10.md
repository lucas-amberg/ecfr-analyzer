# § 1952.10   Tennessee.

(a) The Tennessee State plan received initial approval on July 5, 1973.


(b) The Tennessee State plan received final approval on July 22, 1985.


(c) Under the terms of the 1978 Court Order in *AFL-CIO* v. *Marshall,* compliance staffing levels (benchmarks) necessary for a “fully effective” enforcement program were required to be established for each State operating an approved State plan. In September 1984 Tennessee, in conjunction with OSHA, completed a reassessment of the levels initially established in 1980 and proposed revised compliance staffing benchmarks of 22 safety and 14 health compliance officers. After opportunity for public comment and service on the AFL-CIO, the Assistant Secretary approved these revised staffing requirements on July 22, 1985.


(d) The plan covers all private-sector employers and employees, with several notable exceptions, as well as State and local government employers and employees, within the State.
