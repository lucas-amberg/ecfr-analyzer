# § 1952.17   Indiana.

(a) The Indiana State plan received initial approval on March 6, 1974.


(b) The Indiana State plan received final approval on September 26, 1986.


(c) Under the terms of the 1978 Court Order in *AFL-CIO* v. *Marshall,* compliance staffing levels (benchmarks) necessary for a “fully effective” enforcement program were required to be established for each State operating an approved State plan. In September 1984 Indiana, in conjunction with OSHA, completed a reassessment of the levels initially established in 1980 and proposed revised compliance staffing benchmarks of 47 safety and 23 health compliance officers. After opportunity for public comment and service on the AFL-CIO, the Assistant Secretary approved these revised staffing requirements on January 17, 1986.


(d) The plan covers all private-sector employers and employees, with several notable exceptions, as well as State and local government employers and employees, within the State.
