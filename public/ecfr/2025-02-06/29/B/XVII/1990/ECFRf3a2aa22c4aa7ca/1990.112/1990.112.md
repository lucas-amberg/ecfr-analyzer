# § 1990.112   Classification of potential carcinogens.

The following criteria for identification, classification and regulation of potential occupational carcinogens will be applied, unless the Secretary considers evidence under the provisions of §§ 1990.143, 1990.144 and 1990.145 and determines that such evidence warrants an exception to these criteria. 


(a) *Category I Potential Carcinogens.* A substance shall be identified, classified, and regulated as a Category I Potential Carcinogen if, upon scientific evaluation, the Secretary determines that the substance meets the definition of a potential occupational carcinogen in (1) humans, or (2) in a single mammalian species in a long-term bioassay where the results are in concordance with some other scientifically evaluated evidence of a potential carcinogenic hazard, or (3) in a single mammalian species in an adequately conducted long-term bioassay, in appropriate circumstances where the Secretary determines the requirement for concordance is not necessary. Evidence of concordance is any of the following: positive results from independent testing in the same or other species, positive results in short-term tests, or induction of tumors at injection or implantation sites. 


(b) *Category II Potential Carcinogens.* A substance shall be identified, classified, and regulated as a Category II Potential Carcinogen if, upon scientific evaluation, the Secretary determines that:


(1) The substance meets the criteria set forth in § 1990.112(a), but the evidence is found by the Secretary to be only “suggestive”; or


(2) The substance meets the criteria set forth in § 1990.112(a) in a single mammalian species without evidence of concordance.
