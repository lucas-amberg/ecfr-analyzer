# § 2200.23   Appearances and withdrawals.

(a) *Entry of appearance*—(1) *General.* A representative of a party or intervenor shall enter an appearance by signing the first document filed on behalf of the party or intervenor in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section or subsequently by filing an entry of appearance in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(2) *Appearance in first document or pleading.* If the first document filed on behalf of a party or intervenor is signed by a representative, the representative shall be recognized as representing that party. No separate entry of appearance by the representative is necessary, provided the document contains the information required by § 2200.6.


(3) *Subsequent appearance.* Where a representative has not previously appeared on behalf of a party or intervenor, the representative shall file an entry of appearance with the Executive Secretary, or Judge if the case has been assigned. The entry of appearance shall be signed by the representative and contain the information required by § 2200.6.


(b) *Withdrawal of counsel.* Any counsel or representatives of record desiring to withdraw their appearance, or any parties desiring to withdraw the appearance of their counsel or representatives of record, must file a motion conforming with § 2200.40 with the Commission or the Judge requesting leave to withdraw, showing that prior notice of the motion has been given by the counsel or representative or party to the client or counsel or representative, as the case may be, and providing current contact information for the client, including street address, email address, and phone number. The motion of counsel to withdraw may, in the discretion of the Commission or the Judge, be denied where it is necessary to avoid undue delay or prejudice to the rights of a party or intervenor.
