(b) *Prehearing conference.* In addition to the prehearing procedures set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16, the Judge may, upon the Judge's own initiative or on the motion of a party, direct the parties to confer among themselves to consider settlement, stipulation of facts, or any other matter that may expedite the hearing.
