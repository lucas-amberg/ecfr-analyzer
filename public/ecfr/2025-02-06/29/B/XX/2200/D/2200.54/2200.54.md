# § 2200.54   Request for admissions.

(a) *Scope and procedure*—(1) *Scope.* Any time after the filing of the first responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such as a motion to dismiss, a party may serve on any other party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any matters within the scope of § 2200.52(b) relating to:


(i) Facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and


(ii) The genuineness of any described documents.


(2) *Form; copy of a document.* Each matter must be separately stated. The number of requested admissions shall not exceed 25, including subparts, except upon the agreement of the parties or by order of the Commission or the Judge. A request to admit the genuineness of a document must be accompanied by a copy of the document unless it is, or has been, otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying.


(3) *Time to respond; effect of not responding.* A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its representative. A shorter or longer time for responding may be provided by written stipulation of the parties or by order of the Commission or the Judge.


(4) *Answer.* If a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the matter; and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny the rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.


(5) *Objections.* The grounds for objecting to a request must be stated. A party must not object solely on the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for hearing.


(6) *Motion regarding the sufficiency of an answer or objection.* The requesting party may move to determine the sufficiency of an answer or objection. Unless an objection is sustained, the Commission or the Judge must order that an answer be served. On finding that an answer does not comply with this rule, the Commission or the Judge may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The Commission or the Judge may defer the final decision until a prehearing conference or a specified time before hearing.


(b) *Effect of admission; withdrawal or modification.* A matter admitted under paragraph (a) of this section is conclusively established unless the Commission or the Judge on motion permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. The Commission or the Judge may permit withdrawal or modification if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the case and if the Commission or the Judge is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the case on the merits. An admission under paragraph (a) of this section is not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding.
