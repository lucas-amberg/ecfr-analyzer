A motion for postponement shall state the position of the other parties, either by a joint motion or by a representation of the moving party.

(c) *When motion must be received.* A motion to postpone a hearing must be received at least 10 days prior to the hearing. A motion for postponement received less than 10 days prior to the hearing will generally be denied unless good cause is shown for late filing.


(d) *Postponement in excess of 60 days.* No postponement in excess of 60 days shall be granted without the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The original of any motion seeking a postponement in excess of 60 days shall be filed with the Judge and a copy sent to the Chief Administrative Law Judge.
