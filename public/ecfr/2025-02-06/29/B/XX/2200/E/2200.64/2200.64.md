# ยง 2200.64   Failure to appear.

(a) *Attendance at hearing.* The failure of a party to appear in person or by a duly authorized representative at the hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. A failure of the Secretary to appear constitutes abandonment of the case. A failure of the Respondent to appear is deemed an admission of the facts alleged and consent to the relief sought in the Complaint (or, in Simplified Proceedings, the citation and notification of proposed penalty). The Judge may default the non-appearing party without further proceeding or notice.


(b) *Requests for reinstatement.* Requests for reinstatement must be made, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, within 7 days after the scheduled hearing date. See ยง 2200.90(c).


(c) *Rescheduling hearing.* The Commission or the Judge, upon a showing of good cause, may excuse such failure to appear. In such event, the hearing will be rescheduled as expeditiously as possible from the issuance of the Judge's order.
