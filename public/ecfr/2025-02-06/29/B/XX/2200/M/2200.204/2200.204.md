# ยง 2200.204   Discontinuance of Simplified Proceedings.

(a) *Procedure.* If it becomes apparent at any time that a case is not appropriate for Simplified Proceedings, the Judge assigned to the case may, upon motion by any party or upon the Judge's own motion, discontinue Simplified Proceedings and order the case to continue under conventional rules. Before discontinuing Simplified Proceedings, the Judge will consult with the Chief Administrative Law Judge.


(b) *Party motion.* At any time during the proceedings any party may request that Simplified Proceedings be discontinued and that the matter continue under conventional procedures. A motion to discontinue must conform to ยง 2200.40 and explain why the case is inappropriate for Simplified Proceedings. Responses to such motions shall be filed within the time specified by ยง 2200.40. Joint motions to return a case to conventional proceedings shall be granted by the Judge and do not require a showing of good cause, except that the Judge may deny such a motion that is filed less than 30 days before a scheduled hearing date.


(c) *Ruling.* If Simplified Proceedings are discontinued, the Judge may issue such orders as are necessary for an orderly continuation under conventional rules.
