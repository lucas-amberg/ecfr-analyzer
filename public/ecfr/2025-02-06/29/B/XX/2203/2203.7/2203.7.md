# ยง 2203.7   Transcripts, recordings and minutes of closed meetings.

(a) *Record of meeting.* The Commission will make a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public. However, if all or part of a meeting is closed under paragraph (b)(8), (9)(i) or (10) of ยง 2203.3, the Commission shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes. Such minutes will fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and will provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons for the actions. The minutes will also include a description of each of the views expressed on any item and a record of any roll call vote (reflecting the vote of each Commissioner on the question). In addition, the minutes will identify all documents considered in connection with any action.


(b) *Public access to records.* The Commission will make promptly available to the public, at its national office, the transcript, electronic recording, or minutes of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or of any testimony of any witness received at the meeting, except for such item or items of such discussion or testimony as the Commission determines to contain information which may be withheld under ยง 2203.3(b). Copies of the transcript, the minutes, or a transcription of the recording disclosing the identity of each speaker, with the deletions noted in the preceding sentence, will be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription. Requests to inspect or to have copies made of any transcript, electronic recording or set of minutes of any meeting, or any item(s) on the agenda of any meeting, should be made in writing to the General Counsel at the Office of the General Counsel, Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, Room 941, One Lafayette Centre, 1120-20th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036-3457. The request should identify the time, date, and place of the meeting and briefly describe the items sought. The Commission will maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each closed meeting, or closed portion of a meeting, for a period of at least two years after the meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any Commission proceeding with respect to which all or part of the meeting was held, whichever occurs later.
