(a) In accordance with section 508 and the standards published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board at 36 CFR part 1194, the agency shall ensure, absent an undue burden, that the electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by the agency allows:


(1) Individuals with disabilities who are agency employees or applicants to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by agency employees who are individuals without disabilities; and


(2) Individuals with disabilities who are members of the public seeking information or services from the agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by such members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.


(b) When development, procurement, maintenance, or use of electronic and information technology that meets the standards at 36 CFR part 1194 would impose an undue burden, the agency shall provide individuals with disabilities covered by this section with the information and data involved by an alternative means of access that allows the individuals to use the information and data.
