# § 2520.103-14   Contents of the annual report for defined contribution group (DCG) reporting arrangements.

(a) *General.* A defined contribution group reporting arrangement as described in § 2520.104-51(c) (“DCG reporting arrangement” or “DCG”) that files a consolidated annual report pursuant to § 2520.104-51 shall include in such report the items set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Contents of the annual report for DCG reporting arrangement.* (1) A Form 5500 “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan” and any statements or schedules required to be attached to the form, completed in accordance with the instructions for the form, including Schedule A (Insurance Information), Schedule C (Service Provider Information), Schedule D (DFE/Participating Plan Information), Schedule DCG (Individual Plan Information), Schedule G (Financial Transaction Schedules), Schedule H (Financial Information), and other applicable financial schedules referred to in § 2520.103-10, completed in accordance with the instructions for the form.


(2) Where some or all of the assets of plans participating in the DCG are held in a pooled separate account maintained by an insurance carrier, or in a common or collective trust maintained by a bank, trust company or similar institution, a copy of the annual statement of assets and liabilities of such account or trust for the fiscal year of the account or trust which ends with or within the plan year for which the DCG's annual report is made is required to be furnished by such account or trust under § 2520.103-5(c). Although the statement of assets and liabilities referred to in § 2520.103-5(c) shall be considered part of the DCG's consolidated annual report, such statement of assets and liabilities need not be filed with the DCG's annual report. See §§ 2520.103-3 and 2520.103-4 for reporting requirements for plans some or all of the assets of which are held in a pooled separate account maintained by an insurance company, or a common or collective trust maintained by a bank or similar institution; and see § 2520.104-51(b)(2) for when the term “DCG reporting arrangement” or “DCG” shall be used in place of the term “plan.”


(3)(i) Except for employee pension benefit plans that cover fewer than 100 participants at the beginning of the plan year that meet the conditions for being eligible for a waiver of the audit and accountant opinion requirements in section 103(a)(3)(A) of the Act pursuant to § 2520.104-46, the Schedule DCG for each participating plan shall include:


(A) A report of an independent qualified public accountant for the participating plan that meets the requirements in § 2520.103-1(a)(5).


(B) Separate financial statements meeting the requirements of § 2520.103-1(b)(2) if such financial statements and schedules are prepared in order for the independent qualified public accountant to form the opinion required by section 103(a)(3)(A) of the Act and this paragraph.


(C) Notes to the financial statements described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, which contain the information set forth in § 2520.103-1(b)(3).


(ii) For purposes of this section, an employee pension benefit plan described in § 2520.103-1(d) will be treated as a plan that covers fewer than 100 participants as of the beginning of the plan year.


(c) *Electronic filing requirement.* See § 2520.104a-2 and the instructions for the Form 5500 “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan” for electronic filing requirements. The common plan administrator for each plan whose reporting obligations are satisfied by a DCG filing under this section must maintain an original copy of the DCG filing, with all required signatures, as part of each plan's records. A single copy of the DCG consolidated Form 5500 filing, that includes all schedules and attachments maintained by the common plan administrator on behalf of all the plans will satisfy this requirement.
