# § 2570.33   Applications the Department will not ordinarily consider.

(a) The Department ordinarily will not consider an application that fails to include all the information required by §§ 2570.34 and 2570.35 (or fails to include current information) or otherwise fails to conform to the requirements in this subpart.


(b) An application for an individual exemption relating to a specific exemption transaction or transactions ordinarily will not be considered if the Department has under consideration a class exemption relating to the same type of transaction or transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Department may consider such an application if the issuance of the final class exemption is not imminent, and the Department determines that time constraints necessitate consideration of the exemption transaction on an individual basis.


(c) If a party, excluding a Federal, state, or other governmental entity, designates any information submitted in connection with its exemption application as confidential, the Department will not process the application unless and until the applicant withdraws its claim of confidentiality. By submitting an exemption application, an applicant consents to public disclosure of the entire administrative record pursuant to § 2570.51.


(d) The Department will not engage a pre-submission applicant or its representative, whether through written correspondence or a conference, if the pre-submission applicant does not:


(1) Identify and fully describe the exemption transaction; and


(2) Set forth the prohibited transactions that the applicant believes are applicable.
