# ยง 2570.43   Notification of interested persons by applicant.

(a) If a notice of proposed exemption is published in the _Federal Register_ in accordance with ยง 2570.42, the applicant must notify interested persons of the pendency of the exemption in the manner and within the time period specified in the application. If the Department determines that this notification would be inadequate, the applicant must obtain the Department's consent as to the manner and time period of providing the notice to interested persons. Any such notification must include:


(1) A copy of the notice of proposed exemption as published in the _Federal Register_; and


(2) A supplemental statement in the following form:


(b) The method used by an applicant to furnish notice to interested persons must be reasonably calculated to ensure that interested persons actually receive the notice. In all cases, personal delivery and delivery by first-class mail will be considered reasonable methods of furnishing notice. If the applicant elects to furnish notice electronically, they must provide satisfactory proof that the entire class of interested persons will be able to receive the notice.


(c) After furnishing the notification described in paragraph (a) of this section, an applicant must provide the Department with a written statement confirming that notice was furnished in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. This statement must be accompanied by a certification that the information provided in the statement and signed by a person qualified under ยง 2570.34(b)(6) to sign such a declaration is true and correct. No exemption will be granted until the applicant furnishes such a certification to the Department.


(d) In addition to the provision of notification required by paragraph (a) of this section, the Department, in its sole discretion, may also require an applicant to furnish interested persons with a brief summary of the proposed exemption (Summary of Proposed Exemption), written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average recipient, which objectively describes:


(1) The exemption transaction and the parties in interest thereto;


(2) Why the exemption transaction would violate the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code, and/or FERSA from which relief is sought;


(3) The reasons why the plan seeks to engage in the exemption transaction; and


(4) The conditions and safeguards proposed to protect the plan and its participants and beneficiaries from potential abuse or unnecessary risk of loss in the event the Department grants the exemption.


(e) Applicants who are required to provide interested persons with the Summary of Proposed Exemption described in paragraph (d) of this section shall furnish the Department with a copy of such summary for review and approval before its distribution to interested persons. Such applicants shall also provide confirmation to the Department that the Summary of Proposed Exemption was furnished to interested persons as part of the written statement and declaration required of exemption applicants by paragraph (c) of this section.
