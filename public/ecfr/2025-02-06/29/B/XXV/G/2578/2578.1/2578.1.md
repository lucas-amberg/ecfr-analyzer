(b) *Finding of abandonment.* (1) A qualified termination administrator (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) may find an individual account plan to be abandoned when:


(i) Either: (A) No contributions to, or distributions from, the plan have been made for a period of at least 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the date on which the determination is being made; or


(B) Other facts and circumstances (such as communications from participants and beneficiaries regarding distributions) known to the qualified termination administrator suggest that the plan is or may become abandoned by the plan sponsor; and


(ii) Following reasonable efforts to locate or communicate with the plan sponsor, the qualified termination administrator determines that the plan sponsor:


(A) No longer exists;


(B) Cannot be located; or


(C) Is unable to maintain the plan.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a qualified termination administrator may not find a plan to be abandoned if, at any time before the plan is deemed terminated pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the qualified termination administrator receives an objection from the plan sponsor regarding the finding of abandonment and proposed termination.


(3) A qualified termination administrator shall, for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, be deemed to have made a reasonable effort to locate or communicate with the plan sponsor if the qualified termination administrator sends to the last known address of the plan sponsor, and, in the case of a plan sponsor that is a corporation, to the address of the person designated as the corporation's agent for service of legal process, by a method of delivery requiring acknowledgement of receipt, the notice described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.


(4) If receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section is not acknowledged pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the qualified termination administrator shall be deemed to have made a reasonable effort to locate or communicate with the plan sponsor if the qualified termination administrator contacts known service providers (other than itself) of the plan and requests the current address of the plan sponsor from such service providers and, if such information is provided, the qualified termination administrator sends to each such address, by a method of delivery requiring acknowledgement of receipt, the notice described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

(vii) The following statement: “The U.S. Department of Labor requires that you be informed that, as a fiduciary or plan administrator or both, you may be personally liable for costs, civil penalties, excise taxes, etc. as a result of your acts or omissions with respect to this plan. The termination of this plan will not relieve you of your liability for any such costs, penalties, taxes, etc.”; and


(viii) A statement that the plan sponsor may contact the U.S. Department of Labor for more information about the federal law governing the termination and winding-up process for abandoned plans and the telephone number of the appropriate Employee Benefits Security Administration contact person.


(c) *Deemed termination.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a qualified termination administrator finds (pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that an individual account plan has been abandoned, or if a plan is considered abandoned due to the entry of an order for relief under chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) of this section), the plan shall be deemed to be terminated on the ninetieth (90th) day following the date of the letter from the Employee Benefits Security Administration acknowledging receipt of the notice described in paragraph (c)(3) or (j)(6) of this section.


(2) If, prior to the end of the 90-day period described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Department notifies the qualified termination administrator that it—

(B) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a qualified termination administrator shall not have failed to make reasonable and diligent efforts to update plan records because the administrator determines in good faith that updating the records is either impossible or involves significant cost to the plan in relation to the total assets of the plan.


(ii) *Calculate benefits.* Use reasonable care in calculating the benefits payable to each participant or beneficiary based on plan records described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. A qualified termination administrator shall not have failed to use reasonable care in calculating benefits payable solely because the qualified termination administrator—

(*2*) Allocates expenses on a pro rata basis (proportionately in the ratio that each individual account balance bears to the total of all individual account balances) or on a per capita basis (allocated equally to all accounts).


(iii) *Report delinquent contributions.* (A) Notify the Department of any known contributions (either employer or employee) owed to the plan in conjunction with the filing of the notification required in paragraphs (c)(3) or (d)(2)(ix) of this section.


(B) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(7)(i) of this section, nothing in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section or any other provision of the Act shall be construed to impose an obligation on the qualified termination administrator to collect delinquent contributions on behalf of the plan, provided that the qualified termination administrator satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.


(iv) *Engage service providers.* Engage, on behalf of the plan, such service providers as are necessary for the qualified termination administrator to wind up the affairs of the plan and distribute benefits to the plan's participants and beneficiaries in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(B) Expenses of plan administration shall be considered reasonable solely for purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section if:


(*1*) Such expenses are for services necessary to wind up the affairs of the plan and distribute benefits to the plan's participants and beneficiaries,


(*2*) Such expenses: 


(*i*) Are consistent with industry rates for such or similar services, based on the experience of the qualified termination administrator; and


(*ii*) Are not in excess of rates ordinarily charged by the qualified termination administrator (or affiliate) for the same or similar services provided to customers that are not plans terminated pursuant to this section, if the qualified termination administrator (or affiliate) provides the same or similar services to such other customers, and


(*3*) The payment of such expenses would not constitute a prohibited transaction under the Act or is exempted from such prohibited transaction provisions pursuant to section 408(a) of the Act.


(vi) *Notify participants.* (A) Furnish to each participant or beneficiary of the plan a notice written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and containing the following:

(*3*)(*i*) A statement of the participant's or beneficiary's account balance and the date on which it was calculated by the qualified termination administrator, and


(*ii*) The following statement: “The actual amount of your distribution may be more or less than the amount stated in this letter depending on investment gains or losses and the administrative cost of terminating your plan and distributing your benefits.”;


(*4*) A description of the distribution options available under the plan and a request that the participant or beneficiary elect a form of distribution and inform the qualified termination administrator (or designee) of that election;


(*5*) A statement explaining that, if a participant or beneficiary fails to make an election within 30 days from receipt of the notice, the qualified termination administrator will distribute the account balance of the participant or beneficiary directly:

(*ii*) To an inherited individual retirement plan described in § 2550.404a-3(d)(1)(ii) of this chapter (in the case of a distribution on behalf of a distributee other than a participant or spouse),

(*iv*) To an annuity provider in any case where the qualified termination administrator determines that the survivor annuity requirements in sections 401(a)(11) and 417 of the Internal Revenue Code (or section 205 of ERISA) prevent a distribution under paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(B)(*1*) of this section;


(*6*) In the case of a distribution to an individual retirement plan (described in § 2550.404a-3(d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this chapter) a statement explaining that the account balance will be invested in an investment product designed to preserve principal and provide a reasonable rate of return and liquidity;

(*2*) If a qualified termination administrator determines that the survivor annuity requirements in sections 401(a)(11) and 417 of the Internal Revenue Code (or section 205 of ERISA) prevent a distribution under paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(B)(*1*) of this section, in any manner reasonably determined to achieve compliance with those requirements.


(C) For purposes of distributions pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(B) of this section, the qualified termination administrator may designate itself (or an affiliate) as the transferee of such proceeds, and invest such proceeds in a product in which it (or an affiliate) has an interest, only if such designation and investment is exempted from the prohibited transaction provisions under the Act pursuant to section 408(a) of the Act.


(viii) *Special Terminal Report for Abandoned Plans.* File the Special Terminal Report for Abandoned Plans in accordance with § 2520.103-13 of this chapter.

(D) A statement that plan expenses were paid out of plan assets by the qualified termination administrator in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(v) or (j)(7)(iv) of this section;


(E) If fees and expenses paid by the plan exceed by 20 percent or more the estimate required by paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B) or (j)(6)(vi)(B) of this section, a statement that actual fees and expenses exceeded estimated fees and expenses and the reasons for such additional costs;

(3) If assets of an abandoned plan are held by a person other than the qualified termination administrator, such person shall not be treated as in violation of section 404(a) of the Act solely on the basis that the person cooperated with and followed the directions of the qualified termination administrator in carrying out its responsibilities under this section with respect to such plan, provided that, in advance of any transfer or disposition of any assets at the direction of the qualified termination administrator, such person confirms with the Department of Labor that the person representing to be the qualified termination administrator with respect to the plan is the qualified termination administrator recognized by the Department of Labor.


(4) If the qualified termination administrator is an eligible designee described in § 2578.1(j)(4) of this chapter, designated by a bankruptcy trustee described in § 2578.1(j)(3) of this chapter, both the bankruptcy trustee and the eligible designee shall be treated as the qualified termination administrator for purposes of paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (e)(2) and (f) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph (e)(4) shall serve to relieve the bankruptcy trustee from its obligations under or limit its liability for a failure to comply with paragraph (j)(5).

(3) *Qualified termination administrator.* For a plan deemed abandoned under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the definition of “qualified termination administrator” in paragraph (g) of this section does not apply and only the bankruptcy trustee in the case, or an eligible designee (as defined in paragraph (j)(4) of this section), may be the qualified termination administrator.

(i) The term “de minimis” in paragraph (j)(7)(i) of this section means:


(A) Any amount that is equal to or less than $2,000; or


(B) Any amount greater than $2,000 if the property from which to collect delinquent contributions is a realizable value that is equal to or less than $2,000 net of all enforceable liens and applicable exemptions.


(ii) Prior to designating an eligible designee, a bankruptcy trustee must make reasonable and diligent efforts to determine whether the plan is owed any contributions (employer and employee) and the amount thereof. If the amount of contributions owed to the plan is more than a de minimis amount (as defined under paragraph (j)(5) of this section), the bankruptcy trustee shall designate an eligible designee (as defined in paragraph (j)(4) of this section) to be the qualified termination administrator for all purposes under this section.


(iii) The bankruptcy trustee shall at the time of the designation notify the eligible designee of its findings on the amount of delinquent contributions (employer and employee).

(v) The bankruptcy trustee shall be responsible for the selection and monitoring of the eligible designee in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.

(iv) *Fiduciary breaches.* Any information the qualified termination administrator believes may be evidence of other fiduciary breaches described in paragraph (j)(7)(ii) of this section.


(v) *Plan asset information.* (A) The estimated value of the plan's assets as of the date of the entry of an order for relief,

(7) *Winding up the affairs of the plan.* The qualified termination administrator shall comply with paragraph (d) of this section except as follows:


(i) *Delinquent contributions.* Except for qualified termination administrators of plans that are owed no more than a de minimis amount of contributions (employer and employee), the qualified termination administrator of a plan described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section shall, consistent with the duties of a fiduciary under section 404(a)(1) of the Act, take reasonable steps to collect delinquent contributions on behalf of the plan, taking into account the value of the plan assets involved, the likelihood of a successful recovery, and the expenses expected to be incurred in connection with collection.


(ii) *Report fiduciary breaches.* The qualified termination administrator must report delinquent contributions (employer and employee) owed to the plan, and any activity that the qualified termination administrator believes may be evidence of other fiduciary breaches that involve plan assets by a prior plan fiduciary.
