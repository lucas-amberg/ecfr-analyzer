# § 2700.6   Signing of documents.

(a) *Signature*—(1) *Documents not filed by electronic transmission.* A party or representative of the party shall sign a document by handwriting his signature.


(2) *Documents filed by electronic transmission.* (i) A party or representative of the party may sign a document by including the notation “/s/” followed by the typewritten name of the party or representative of the party filing the document.


(ii) A party or representative of the party may sign a document by including a graphical duplicate of his handwritten signature.


(b) *Meaning of signature.* A document or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form. When a party or representative of the party signs a document in the manner described in paragraph (a) of this section, that person's signature shall constitute his certificate:


(1) That under the provisions of the law, including these rules and all federal conflict of interest statutes, he is authorized and qualified to represent the particular party in the matter; and


(2) That he has read the document; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
