(a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel representing the Secretary of Labor may file an answer to the application. Unless counsel requests an extension of time for filing, files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b), or a proceeding is stayed pursuant to ยง 206(b), failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.

The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the administrative law judge upon request by counsel for the Secretary and the applicant.


(c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the position of the Secretary of Labor.
