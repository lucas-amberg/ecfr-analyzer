(a) Approved conveyor belts will be subject to periodic audits by MSHA to determine conformity with the technical requirements upon which the approval was based.

Upon request to MSHA, the approval holder may obtain any final report resulting from the audit.


(b) No more than once a year, except for cause, the approval holder, at MSHA's request, must make 3 samples of an approved conveyor belt of the size specified in ยง 14.5 available at no cost to MSHA for an audit. If a product is not available because it is not currently in production, the manufacturer will notify MSHA when it is available. Representatives of the applicant and other persons agreed upon by MSHA and the applicant may be present during audit tests and evaluations. MSHA will also consider requests by others to observe tests.


(c) A conveyor belt will be subject to audit for cause at any time MSHA believes the approval holder product is not in compliance with the technical requirements of the approval.
