To retain “permissibility” of this equipment the following conditions shall be satisfied: 


1. *General safety.* Frequent inspection shall be made. All electrical parts, including the portable cable and wiring, shall be kept in a safe condition. There shall be no openings into the casings of the electrical parts. A permissible distribution box shall be used for connection to the power circuit unless connection is made in fresh intake air. To maintain the overload protection on direct-current machines, the ungrounded conductor of the portable cable shall be connected to the proper terminal. The machine frame shall be effectively grounded. The power wires shall not be used for grounding except in conjunction with diode(s) or equivalent. The operating voltage should match the voltage rating of the motor(s). 


2. *Servicing.* Explosion-proof enclosures shall be restored to the state of original safety with respect to all flame arresting paths, lead entrances, etc., following disassembly for repair or rebuilding, whether by the owner or an independent shop. 


3. *Fastenings.* All bolts, nuts, screws, and other means of fastening, and also threaded covers, shall be in place, properly tightened and secured. 


4. *Renewals and repairs.* Inspections, repairs, or renewals of electrical parts shall not be made unless the portable cable is disconnected from the circuit furnishing power, and the cable shall not be connected again until all parts are properly reassembled. Special care shall be taken in making renewals or repairs. Leave no parts off. Use replacement parts exactly like those furnished by the manufacturer. When any lead entrance is disturbed, the original leads or exact duplicates thereof shall be used and stuffing boxes shall be repacked in the approved manner. 


5. *Cable requirements.* A flame-resistant portable cable bearing a MSHA assigned identification number, adequately protected by an automatic circuit-interrupting device shall be used. Special care shall be taken in handling the cable to guard against mechanical injury and wear. Splices in portable cables shall be made in a workmanlike manner, mechanically strong, and well insulated. Not more than five temporary splices are permitted in a portable cable regardless of length. Connections and wiring to the outby end of the cable shall be in accordance with recognized standards of safety.
