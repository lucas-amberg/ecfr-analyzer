(a) Cast or welded enclosures shall be designed to withstand a minimum internal pressure of 150 pounds per square inch (gage). Castings shall be free from blowholes. 


(b) Pneumatic field testing of explosion-proof enclosures shall be conducted by determining: 


(1) Leak performance with a peak dynamic or static pressure of 150 pounds per square inch (gage); or 


(2) A pressure rise and rate of decay consistent with unyielding components during a pressure-time history as derived from a series of oscillograms. 


(c) Welded joints forming an enclosure shall have continuous gastight welds.
