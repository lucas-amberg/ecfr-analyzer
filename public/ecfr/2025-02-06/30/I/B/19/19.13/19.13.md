# ยง 19.13   Instructions for handling future changes in lamp design.

All approvals are granted with the understanding that the manufacturer will make his lamp according to the drawings which he has submitted to MSHA and which have been considered and included in the approval.

With this letter the manufacturer should submit a revised drawing or drawings showing the changes in detail, and one of each of the changed lamp parts. 


(2) Where the applicant for approval has used an independent laboratory under part 6 of this chapter to perform, in whole or in part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval of changes to an approved product under this part, the applicant must provide to MSHA as part of the approval application: 


(i) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization; 


(ii) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements; 


(iii) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and 


(iv) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by this part.
