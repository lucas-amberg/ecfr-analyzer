# ยง 19.8   Protection against bodily hazard.

This hazard is chiefly due to the possible burning of the wearer by electrolyte spilled from the battery. MSHA therefore requires that: 


(a) *Spilling of electrolyte.* The lamp shall be so designed and constructed that, when properly filled, the battery will neither leak nor spill electrolyte under actual service conditions. Lamps passing a laboratory spilling test will be considered satisfactory in this respect, contingent upon satisfactory performance in service. 


(b) *Corrosion of battery container.* The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of use.
