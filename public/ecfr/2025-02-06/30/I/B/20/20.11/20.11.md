# ยง 20.11   Material required for MSHA records.

In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, detailed records are kept covering each investigation. These include drawings and actual equipment, as follows: 


(a) *Drawings.* The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before approval is granted, to show the details of the lamp as approved, are retained. These drawings are used to identify the lamp and its parts in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer. 


(b) *Equipment.* (1) If MSHA so desires, parts of the lamps which are used in the tests will be retained as a permanent record of the investigation and of the lamps submitted. 


(2) If the lamp is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer, as soon as his first manufactured lamps are available, to submit one complete lamp, with the approval plate attached, as a record of his commercial product.
