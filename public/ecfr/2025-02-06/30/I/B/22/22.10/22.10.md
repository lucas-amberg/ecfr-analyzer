# ยง 22.10   Approval plate.

(a) *Attachment to be made by manufacturers.* (1) Manufacturers shall attach, stamp, or mold an approval plate on each permissible methane detector. The plate shall bear the emblem of the Mines Safety and Health Administration and be inscribed as follows: 


(2) When deemed necessary, an appropriate caution statement shall be added. The size and position of the approval plate shall be satisfactory to MSHA. 


(b) *Purpose of approval plate.* The approval plate is a label that identifies the device so that anyone can tell at a glance whether it is of the permissible type or not. By the plate, the manufacturer can point out that his detector complies with MSHA's requirements and that it has been approved for use in gassy mines. 


(c) *Use of approval plate.* Permission to place MSHA's approval plate on his detector obligates the manufacturer to maintain the quality of his product and to see that each detector is constructed according to the drawings that have been accepted by MSHA and are in MSHA's files. Detectors exhibiting changes in design that have not been approved are not permissible and must not bear MSHA's approval plate. 


(d) *Withdrawal of approval.* MSHA reserves the right to rescind for cause at any time any approval granted under this part.
