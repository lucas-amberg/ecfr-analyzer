# ยง 22.8   Material required for MSHA records.

In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, it keeps detailed records covering each investigation. These records include drawings and actual equipment as follows: 


(a) *Drawings.* The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before the approval is granted to show the details of the detector as approved, are retained. These drawings are used to identify the detector in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer. 


(b) *Actual equipment.* If MSHA so desires, parts of the detectors that are used in the tests will be retained as records of the equipment submitted. If the detector is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer to submit one of his detectors, with the approval plate attached, as a record of his commercial product.
