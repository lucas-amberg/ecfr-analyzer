# ยง 22.9   How approvals are granted.

All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A detector will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers have judged that it has met the requirements of the schedule and MSHA's records are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the detector as it is to be commercially made. No verbal reports of the investigation will be given and no informal approvals will be granted. As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval, he shall be free to advertise his detector as permissible.
