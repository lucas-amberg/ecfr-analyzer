# ยง 27.2   Definitions.

As used in this part: 


(a) *MSHA* means the United States Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration.


(b) *Applicant* means an individual, partnership, company, corporation, association, or other organization that designs, manufactures, or assembles and that seeks certification or preliminary testing of a methane-monitoring system or component. 


(c) *Methane-monitoring system* means a complete assembly of one or more methane detectors and all other components required for measuring and signalling the presence of methane in the atmosphere of a mine, tunnel, or other underground workings, and shall include a power-shutoff component. 


(d) *Methane detector* means a component for a methane-monitoring system that functions in a gassy mine, tunnel, or other underground workings to sample the atmosphere continuously and responds to the presence of methane. 


(e) *Power-shutoff component* means a component of a methane-monitoring system, such as a relay, switch, or switching mechanism, that will cause a control circuit to deenergize a machine, equipment, or power circuit when actuated by the methane detector. 


(f) *Flammable mixture* means a mixture of a gas, such as methane, natural gas, or similar hydrocarbon gas with normal air, that can be ignited. 


(g) *Gassy mine or tunnel* means a mine, tunnel, or other underground workings in which a flammable mixture has been ignited, or has been found with a permissible flame safety lamp, or has been determined by air analysis to contain 0.25 percent or more (by volume) of methane in any open workings when tested at a point not less than 12 inches from the roof, face, or rib. 


(h) *Letter of certification* means a formal document issued by MSHA stating that a methane-monitoring system or subassembly or component thereof: 


(1) Has met the requirements of this part, and


(2) Is certified for incorporation in or with permissible or approved equipment that is used in gassy mines and tunnels. 


(i) *Component* means a part of a methane-monitoring system that is essential to its operation as a certified methane-monitoring system. 


(j) *Explosion-proof* means that a component or group of components (subassembly) is so constructed and protected by an enclosure with or without a flame arrester(s) that, if a flammable mixture of gas is ignited within the enclosure, it will withstand the resultant pressure without damage to the enclosure and/or flame arrester(s). Also the enclosure and/or flame arrester(s) shall prevent the discharge of flame from within either the enclosure or the flame arrester, or the ignition of any flammable mixture that surrounds the enclosure and/or flame arrester. 
1

(k) *Normal operation* means that performance of each component as well as of the entire assembly of the methane-monitoring system is in conformance with the functions for which it was designed and for which it was tested by MSHA. 


(l) *Flame arrester* means a device so constructed that it will prevent propagation of flame or explosion from within the unit of which it is part to a surrounding flammable mixture. 


(m) *Intrinsically safe equipment and circuitry* means equipment and circuitry that are incapable of releasing enough electrical or thermal energy under normal or abnormal conditions to cause ignition of a flammable mixture of the most easily ignitable composition. 


(n) *Fail safe* means that the circuitry of a methane-monitoring system shall be so designed that electrical failure of a component which is critical in MSHA's opinion will result in deenergizing the methane-monitoring system and the machine or equipment of which it is a part.
