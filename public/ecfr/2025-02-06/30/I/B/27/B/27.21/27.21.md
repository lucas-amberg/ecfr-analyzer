# § 27.21   Methane-monitoring system.

(a) A methane-monitoring system shall be so designed that any machine or equipment, which is controlled by the system, cannot be operated unless the electrical components of the methane-monitoring system are functioning normally. 


(b) A methane-monitoring system shall be rugged in construction so that its operation will not be affected by vibration or physical shock, such as normally encountered in mining operations. 


(c) Insulating materials that give off flammable or explosive gases when decomposed shall not be used within enclosures where they might be subjected to destructive electrical action. 


(d) An enclosure shall be equipped with a lock, seal, or acceptable equivalent when MSHA deems such protection necessary for safety. 


(e) A component or subassembly of a methane-monitoring system shall be constructed as a package unit or otherwise in a manner acceptable to MSHA. Such components or subassemblies shall be readily replaceable or removable without creating an ignition hazard. 


(f) The complete system shall “fail safe” in a manner acceptable to MSHA.
