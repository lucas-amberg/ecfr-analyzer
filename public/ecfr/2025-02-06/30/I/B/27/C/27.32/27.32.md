# § 27.32   Tests to determine performance of the system.

(a) *Laboratory tests for reliability and durability.* Five hundred successful consecutive tests 
2 for gas detection, alarm action, and power shutoff in natural gas-air mixtures 
3 shall be conducted to demonstrate acceptable performance as to reliability and durability of a methane-monitoring system. The tests shall be conducted as follows: 


(1) The methane detector component shall be placed in a test gallery into which natural gas shall be made to enter at various rates with sufficient turbulence for proper mixing with the air in the gallery. To comply with the requirements of this test, the detector shall provide an impulse to actuate an alarm at a predetermined percentage of gas and also provide an impulse to actuate a power shutoff at a second predetermined percentage of gas. (See §§ 27.21, 27.22, 27.23, and 27.24.)

(b) *Field tests.* MSHA reserves the right to conduct tests, similar to those stated in paragraph (a) of this section, in underground workings to verify reliability and durability of a methane-monitoring system installed in connection with a piece of mining equipment.
