# ยง 33.33   Allowable limits of dust concentration.

(a) The concentration of dust determined by the control sample shall be subtracted from the average concentration of dust determined by the test samples collected at each drill operator's position, and the difference shall be designated as the net concentration of airborne dust. Calculations of the average concentration of dust determined from the test samples shall be based upon the results of not less than 80 percent of each set of test samples. 


(b) Under each prescribed test condition, the net concentration of airborne dust at each drill operator's position shall not exceed 10 million particles (5 microns or less in diameter) per cubic foot of air when determined in accordance with the method given in ยง 33.32(a).
