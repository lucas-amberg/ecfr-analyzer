# § 35.20   Autogenous-ignition temperature test.

(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of this test, referred to hereinafter as the ignition-temperature test, is to determine the lowest autogenous-ignition temperature of a hydraulic fluid at atmospheric pressure when using the syringe-injection method. 


(b) *Description of apparatus*—(1) *Test flask.* The test flask, which is heated and into which the test sample is injected, shall be a commercial 200 ml. borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flask. 


(2) *Thermocouples.* Calibrated thermocouples—iron-constantan or chromelalumel—and a potentiometer shall be used for all temperature measurements. 


(3) *Syringe.* A hypodermic syringe (0.25 or 1 cc. capacity) equipped with a 2-inch No. 18 stainless steel needle and calibrated in hundredths of a cubic centimeter (0.01 cc.) shall be used to inject samples into the heated test flask. 


(4) *Timer.* An electric timer or stopwatch calibrated in not more than 0.2 second intervals shall be used to determine the time lag before ignition. 


(5) *Furnace.* The furnace in which the ignition-temperature test is conducted shall consist of a refractory (alundum or equivalent) cylinder 5 inches in internal diameter and 5 inches in height; a transite-ring top and a transite-disk bottom, each of which is attached to a metal cylinder. The furnace is heated by three elements as follows: (i) A circumferential heater embedded in the refractory cylinder; (ii) a top or toroidal-neck heater that surrounds the neck of the test flask; and (iii) a flat base heater on which the test flask rests. The temperature of each heating element shall be controlled independently by an autotransformer. Means shall be provided for applying thermocouples at the neck, mid-section, and base of the test flask, which shall be inserted upright in the furnace. 


(c) *Test procedures*—(1) *Temperature control.* Each autotransformer shall be so adjusted that the temperature at the neck, mid-section, and base of the test flask is uniform within ±2 °F. of the desired test temperature. 


(2) *Sample injection and timing.* A 0.07 cc. test sample shall be injected into the heated test flask with the hypodermic syringe, and the syringe shall be withdrawn immediately. Measurement of time shall start at the instant the sample is injected. 


(3) *Observations.* (i) If flame does not result in 5 minutes or more after injection of the test sample, the sample shall be considered nonflammable at the test temperature, and the timer shall be stopped. The test flask shall then be flushed well with clean dry air and, after a lapse of 15 minutes or more, the test shall be repeated with the test flask temperature raised 50 °F. ±2 °F. above the first test temperature. 


(ii) If ignition (flame) is observed in 5 minutes or less after the injection of the test sample (0.07 cc.), the time lag (time interval) shall be noted. After an ignition occurs the temperature of the test flask shall be reduced 5 °F., and the test procedure repeated in decrements of 5 °F. until ignition no longer occurs and this temperature shall be noted as the first nonignition test temperature for the 0.07 cc. sample. 


(iii) The temperature shall be increased 50 °F. ±2 °F. above the first nonignition test temperature, and the ignition-temperature test procedure shall be repeated with a 0.10 cc. test sample injected into the heated test flask. 


(iv) If the lowest temperature at which ignition occurs with the 0.10 cc. sample (in decrements of 5 °F.) is lower than that obtained with the 0.07 cc. sample, the ignition-temperature test procedure shall be repeated using a test sample of 0.12 cc., then 0.15 cc., and so on by increments of 0.03 cc. until the lowest ignition temperature is obtained. 


(v) If the lowest temperature at which ignition is obtained with the 0.10 cc. sample is greater than that obtained with the 0.07 cc. sample, the ignition temperature test procedure shall be repeated by reducing the test sample to 0.05 cc. and then to 0.03 cc. until the lowest ignition temperature is obtained. 


(d) *Appraisal of test.* A fluid shall be considered fire-resistant, according to the test requirements of this section: *Provided,* That in no instance of the ignition-temperature test procedure, as stated in this section, shall the ignition temperature of the test sample be less than 600 °F.
