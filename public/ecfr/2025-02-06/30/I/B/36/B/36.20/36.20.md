(a) MSHA will test only equipment that in the opinion of its qualified representatives is constructed of suitable materials, is of good quality workmanship, based on sound engineering principles, and is safe for its intended use. Since all possible designs, arrangements, or combinations of components and materials cannot be foreseen, MSHA reserves the right to modify the construction and design requirements of subassemblies or components and tests thereof to obtain the same degree of protection as provided by the tests described in Subpart C of this part.
