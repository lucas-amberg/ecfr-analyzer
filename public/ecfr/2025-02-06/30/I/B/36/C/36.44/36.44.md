# ยง 36.44   Maximum allowable fuel:air ratio.

(a) When an engine is delivered to MSHA with the fuel-injection system adjusted by the applicant and tests of the exhaust-gas composition (see ยง 36.43) show not more than 0.30 percent, by volume, of carbon monoxide, the applicant's adjustment of the fuel-injection system shall be accepted. The maximum fuel:air ratio determined from the exhaust-gas composition shall be designated as the maximum allowable fuel:air ratio. The maximum liquid fuel rate (pounds per hour) that produces the maximum allowable fuel:air ratio shall be designated as the maximum allowable fuel rate for operating the equipment at elevations not exceeding 1,000 feet above sea level. 


(b) When the carbon monoxide content of the exhaust exceeds 0.30 percent, by volume, only near maximum power output, the maximum fuel:air ratio at which carbon monoxide does not exceed 0.30 percent shall be calculated and designated as the maximum allowable fuel:air ratio. The corresponding calculated liquid fuel rate shall be designated as the maximum allowable fuel rate at elevations not exceeding 1,000 feet above sea level. 


(c) The maximum allowable fuel:air ratio and maximum liquid fuel rates shall be used to calculate a liquid fuel rate-altitude table that shall govern the liquid fuel rate of engines operated at elevations exceeding 1,000 feet above sea level.
