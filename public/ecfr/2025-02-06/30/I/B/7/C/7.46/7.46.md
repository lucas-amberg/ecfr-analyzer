# § 7.46   Impact test.

(a) *Test procedures.* (1) Prepare four covers for testing by conditioning two covers at −13 °F (−25 °C) and two covers at 122 °F (50 °C) for a period of 48 hours.


(2) Mount the covers on a battery box of the same design with which the covers are to be approved, including any support blocks, with the battery cells completely assembled. If used, support blocks must contact only the filler material or partitions between the individual cells. At the test temperature range of 65 °F-80 °F (18.3 °C-26.7 °C), apply a dynamic force of 200 ft. lbs. to the following areas using a hemispherical weight with a 6″ maximum radius:


(i) The center of the two largest unsupported areas;


(ii) The areas above at least two support blocks, if used;


(iii) The areas above at least two intercell connectors, one cell, and one filler cap; and


(iv) Areas on at least two corners. If the design consists of both inside and outside corners, test one of each.


(3) Record the condition of the covers, supports, intercell connectors, filler caps, cell covers, and filler material.


(b) *Acceptable performance.* Impact tests of any of the four covers shall not result in any of the following:


(1) Bent intercell connectors.


(2) Cracked or broken filler caps, except plastic tabs which extend from the body of the filler caps.


(3) Cracks in the cell cover, cells, or filler material.


(4) Cracked or bent supports.


(5) Cracked or splintered battery covers.
