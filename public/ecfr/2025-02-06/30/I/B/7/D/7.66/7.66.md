# § 7.66   Output energy test.

(a) *Test procedures.* The blasting unit shall be tested by firing into each of the following resistive loads, within a tolerance of ±1%:


(1) The maximum blasting circuit resistance.


(2) Any resistive load between 3 ohms and the maximum blasting circuit resistance.


(3) One ohm.


(b) *Acceptable performance.* (1) The voltage shall be zero at the firing line terminals 10 milliseconds after operation of the firing switch.


(2) The electric current from the blasting unit shall be:


(i) Less than 50 milliamperes except during firing of the blasting unit.


(ii) Available only through the firing line terminals.


(iii) At least an average of 2 amperes during the first 5 milliseconds following operation of the firing switch.


(iv) Not exceed an average of 100 amperes during the first 10 milliseconds following operation of the firing switch.
