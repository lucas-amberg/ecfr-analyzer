# § 7.102   Exhaust gas cooling efficiency test.

(a) *Test procedures.* (1) Follow the procedures specified in § 7.101(a). 


(2) Install a temperature measuring device to measure the exhaust gas temperature at discharge from the exhaust conditioner. The temperature measuring device shall be accurate to ±4 °F (±2 °C). 


(3) Determine the exhaust gas temperature at discharge from the exhaust conditioner before the exhaust gas is diluted with air. 


(b) *Acceptable performance.* (1) The exhaust gas temperature at discharge from a wet exhaust conditioner before the exhaust gas is diluted with air shall not exceed 170 °F (76 °C). 


(2) The exhaust gas temperature at discharge from a dry exhaust conditioner before the gas is diluted with air shall not exceed 302 °F (150 °C).
