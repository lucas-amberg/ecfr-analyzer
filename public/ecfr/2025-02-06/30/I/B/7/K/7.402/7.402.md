# ยง 7.402   Definitions.

The following definitions apply in this subpart.


*Component.* Any material in a cable splice kit which becomes part of a splice.


*Conductor.* A bare or insulated wire or combination of wires not insulated from one another, suitable for carrying an electric current.


*Electric Cable.* An assembly of one or more insulated conductors of electric current under a common or integral jacket. A cable may also contain one or more uninsulated conductors.


*Jacket.* A nonmetallic abrasion-resistant outer covering of a cable or splice.


*Power Conductor.* An insulated conductor of a cable assembly through which the primary electric current or power is transmitted.


*Signaling Cable.* A fiber optic cable, or a cable containing electric conductors of a cross-sectional area less than #14 AWG used where the circuit cannot deliver currents which would increase conductor temperatures beyond that established for the current-carrying capacity of the conductors.


*Splice.* The mechanical joining of one or more severed conductors in a single length of a cable including the replacement of insulation and jacket.


*Splice Kit.* A group of materials and related instructions which clearly identify all components and detail procedures used in safely making a flame-resistant splice in an electric cable.
