Written comments received by the operator from miners or their representatives shall be submitted to the District Manager. Miners or their representatives may submit written comments directly to the District Manager.


(e) All training required by the training plan submitted to and approved by the District Manager as required by this subpart B shall be subject to evaluation by the District Manager to determine the effectiveness of the training programs.

Operators shall indicate in training plans submitted for approval whether they want to have instructors approved based on monitored performance. The District Manager shall consider such factors as the size of the mine, the number of employees, the mine safety record and remoteness from a training facility when determining whether instructor approval based on monitored performance is appropriate.
