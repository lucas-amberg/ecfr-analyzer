# § 56.4600   Extinguishing equipment.

(a) When welding, cutting, soldering, thawing, or bending—


(1) With an electric arc or with an open flame where an electrically conductive extinguishing agent could create an electrical hazard, a multipurpose dry-chemical fire extinguisher or other extinguisher with at least a 2-A:10-B:C rating shall be at the worksite.


(2) With an open flame in an area where no electrical hazard exists, a multipurpose dry-chemical fire extinguisher or equivalent fire extinguishing equipment for the class of fire hazard present shall be at the worksite.


(b) Use of halogenated fire extinguishing agents to meet the requirements of this standard shall be limited to Halon 1211 (CBrClF_2_) and Halon 1301 (CBrF_3_). When these agents are used in confined or unventilated areas, precautions based on the manufacturer's use instructions shall be taken so that the gases produced by thermal decompostion of the agents are not inhaled.
