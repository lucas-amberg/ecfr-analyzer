# § 56.6602   Static electricity dissipation during loading.

When explosive material is loaded pneumatically into a blasthole in a manner that generates a static electricity hazard—


(a) An evaluation of the potential static electricity hazard shall be made and any hazard shall be eliminated before loading begins; 


(b) The loading hose shall be of a semiconductive type, have a total of not more than 2 megohms of resistance over its entire length and not less than 1000 ohms of resistance per foot; 


(c) Wire-countered hoses shall not be used; 


(d) Conductive parts of the loading equipment shall be bonded and grounded and grounds shall not be made to other potential sources of extraneous electricity; and 


(e) Plastic tubes shall not be used as hole liners if the hole contains an electric detonator.
