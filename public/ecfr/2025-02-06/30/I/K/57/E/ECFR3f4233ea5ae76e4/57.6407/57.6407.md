(1) Continuity of each electric detonator in the blasthole prior to stemming and connection to the blasting line; 


(2) Resistance of individual series or the resistance of multiple balanced series to be connected in parallel prior to their connection to the blasting line; 


(3) Continuity of blasting lines prior to the connection of electric or electronic detonator series; and 


(4) Total blasting circuit resistance prior to connection to the power source. 


(b) In underground operations—
