(1) The hoist operator shall be notified; and 


(2) Hoisting in adjacent shaft compartments, except for empty conveyances or counterweights, shall be stopped until transportation of the explosive material is completed. 


(b) Explosive material transported in hoist conveyances shall be placed within a container which prevents shifting of the cargo that could cause detonation of the container by impact or by sparks. The manufacturer's container may be used if secured to a nonconductive pallet. When explosives are transported, they shall be secured so as not to contact any sparking material.
