# § 57.19000   Application.

(a) The hoisting standards in this subpart apply to those hoists and appurtenances used for hoisting persons. However, where persons may be endangered by hoists and appurtenances used solely for handling ore, rock, and materials, the appropriate standards should be applied.


(b) Standards 57.19021 through 57.19028 shall apply to wire ropes in service used to hoist—


(1) Persons in shafts and slopes underground;


(2) Persons with an incline hoist on the surface; or


(3) Loads in shaft or slope development when persons work below suspended loads. 


(4) These standards do not apply to wire ropes used for elevators.


(c) Emergency hoisting facilities should conform to the extent possible to safety requirements for other hoists, and should be adequate to remove the persons from the mine with a minimum of delay.
