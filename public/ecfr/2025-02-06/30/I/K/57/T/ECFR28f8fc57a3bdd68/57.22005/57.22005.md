(1) The request for a hearing;


(2) The Administrator's determination; and


(3) All information upon which the Administrator's determination was based.


(e) The hearing shall be regulated and conducted by an Administrative Law Judge in accordance with 29 CFR part 18, entitled, “Rules of Practice and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges.” Once the Administrative Law Judge has made an initial decision and served each party, the decision shall be final on the 30th day after service, unless discretionary review is undertaken by the Assistant Secretary or an appeal is filed by the mine operator or representative of the miners under paragraph (f) of this section.


(f) Within 30 days after service of an initial decision of an Administrative Law Judge, the Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health may undertake a discretionary review of the initial decision, or the mine operator, or representative of the miners may appeal the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge to the Assistant Secretary.


(1) The Assistant Secretary shall give notice of discretionary review to the mine operator and representative of the miners. The mine operator or representative of the miners shall give notice of an appeal to the other party. The notice shall specify the suggested changes and refer to the specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, and terms of the initial decision to be reviewed or appealed. The Assistant Secretary shall fix a time for filing any objections to the suggested changes and supporting reasons.


(2) The Assistant Secretary shall promptly notify the Administrative Law Judge of a discretionary review or an appeal. The entire record of the proceedings shall be transmitted to the Assistant Secretary for review.


(3) The Assistant Secretary shall make the final decision based upon consideration of the record of the proceedings. The final decision may affirm, modify, or set aside in whole or in part, the findings and conclusions contained in the initial decision. A statement of reasons for the action taken shall be included in the final decision. The final decision shall be served upon the mine operator and representative of the miners.


(g) Unless a decision by the Administrator for Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health, or the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge, is appealed within 30 days, it becomes final, and is not subject to judicial review for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704.
