*Respirable crystalline silica* means quartz, cristobalite, and/or tridymite contained in airborne particles that are determined to be respirable by a sampling device designed to meet the characteristics for respirable-particle-size-selective samplers that conform to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7708:1995: Air Quality—Particle Size Fraction Definitions for Health-Related Sampling.


*Specialist* means an American Board-Certified Specialist in Pulmonary Disease or an American Board-Certified Specialist in Occupational Medicine.
