# § 72.800T   Single, full-shift measurement of respirable coal mine dust.

The Secretary will use a single, full-shift measurement of respirable coal mine dust to determine the average concentration on a shift since that measurement accurately represents atmospheric conditions to which a miner is exposed during such shift. As of April 14, 2025, noncompliance with the respirable dust standard, in accordance with this subchapter, is demonstrated when a single, full-shift measurement taken by MSHA meets or exceeds the applicable ECV in table 1 to § 70.208, table 1 to § 70.209, table 1 to § 71.206, or table 1 to § 90.207 of this chapter that corresponds to the particular sampling device used. Upon issuance of a citation for a violation of the standard, and for MSHA to terminate the citation, the mine operator shall take the specified actions in this subchapter.
