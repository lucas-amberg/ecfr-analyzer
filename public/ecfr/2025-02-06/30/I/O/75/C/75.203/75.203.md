(d) A working face shall not be mined through into an unsupported area of active workings, except when the unsupported area is inaccessible. 


(e) Additional roof support shall be installed where— 


(1) The width of the opening specified in the roof control plan is exceeded by more than 12 inches; and 


(2) The distance over which the excessive width exists is more than 5 feet.
