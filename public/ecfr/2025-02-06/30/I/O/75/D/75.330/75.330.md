# § 75.330   Face ventilation control devices.

(a) Brattice cloth, ventilation tubing and other face ventilation control devices shall be made of flame-resistant material approved by MSHA. 


(b)(1) Ventilation control devices shall be used to provide ventilation to dilute, render harmless, and to carry away flammable, explosive, noxious, and harmful gases, dusts, smoke, and fumes—


(i) To each working face from which coal is being cut, mined, drilled for blasting, or loaded; and 


(ii) To any other working places as required by the approved ventilation plan. 


(2) These devices shall be installed at a distance no greater than 10 feet from the area of deepest penetration to which any portion of the face has been advanced unless an alternative distance is specified and approved in the ventilation plan. Alternative distances specified shall be capable of maintaining concentrations of respirable dust, methane, and other harmful gases, in accordance with the levels specified in the applicable sections of this chapter. 


(c) When the line brattice or any other face ventilation control device is damaged to an extent that ventilation of the working face is inadequate, production activities in the working place shall cease until necessary repairs are made and adequate ventilation is restored.
