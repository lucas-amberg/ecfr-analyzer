(a)(1) MSHA approved methane monitors shall be installed on all face cutting machines, continuous miners, longwall face equipment, loading machines, and other mechanized equipment used to extract or load coal within the working place. 


(2) The sensing device for methane monitors on longwall shearing machines shall be installed at the return air end of the longwall face. An additional sensing device also shall be installed on the longwall shearing machine, downwind and as close to the cutting head as practicable. An alternative location or locations for the sensing device required on the longwall shearing machine may be approved in the ventilation plan. 


(3) The sensing devices of methane monitors shall be installed as close to the working face as practicable.

(iii) Retain the record of calibration tests for 1 year from the date of the test. Records shall be retained at a surface location at the mine and made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners. 


(b)(1) When the methane concentration at any methane monitor reaches 1.0 percent the monitor shall give a warning signal. 


(2) The warning signal device of the methane monitor shall be visible to a person who can deenergize electric equipment or shut down diesel-powered equipment on which the monitor is mounted. 


(c) The methane monitor shall automatically deenergize electric equipment or shut down diesel-powered equipment on which it is mounted when— 


(1) The methane concentration at any methane monitor reaches 2.0 percent; or 


(2) The monitor is not operating properly.
