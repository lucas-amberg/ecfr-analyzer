# ยง 75.900-2   Approved circuit schemes.

The following circuit schemes will be regarded as providing the necessary protection to the circuit required by ยง 75.900: 


(a) Ground check relays may be used for undervoltage protection if the relay coils are designed to trip the circuit breaker when line voltage decreases to 40 to 60 percent of the nominal line voltage. 


(b) One undervoltage device installed in the main secondary circuit at the source transformer may be used to provide undervoltage protection for each circuit that receives power from that transformer. 


(c) One circuit breaker may be used to protect two or more branch circuits if the circuit breaker is adjusted to afford overcurrent protection for the smallest conductor. 


(d) Circuit breakers with shunt trip, series trip or undervoltage release devices may be used if the tripping elements of such devices are selected or adjusted in accordance with the settings listed in the tables of the National Electric Code, 1968.
