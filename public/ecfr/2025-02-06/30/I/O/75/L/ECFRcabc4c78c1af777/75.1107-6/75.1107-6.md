# ยง 75.1107-6   Capacity of fire suppression devices; location and direction of nozzles.

(a) Each fire suppression device shall be: 


(1) Adequate in size and capacity to extinguish potential fires in or on the equipment protected; and 


(2) Suitable for the atmospheric conditions surrounding the equipment protected (e.g., air velocity, type, and proximity of adjacent combustible material); and 


(3) Rugged enough to withstand rough usage and vibration when installed on mining equipment. 


(b) The extinguishant-discharge nozzles of each fire suppression device shall, where practicable, be located so as to take advantage of mine ventilation air currents. The fire suppression device may be of the internal injection, inundating, or combination type. Where fire control is achieved by internal injection, or combination of internal injection and inundation, hazardous locations shall be enclosed to minimize runoff and overshoot of the extinguishing agent and the extinguishing agent shall be directed onto: 


(1) Cable reel compartments and electrical cables on the equipment which are subject to flexing or to external damage; and 


(2) All hydraulic components on the equipment which are exposed directly to or located in the immediate vicinity of electrical cables which are subject to flexing or to damage.
