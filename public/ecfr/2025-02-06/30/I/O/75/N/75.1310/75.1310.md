(b) Black blasting powder, aluminum-cased detonators, aluminum-alloy-cased detonators, detonators with aluminum leg wires, and safety fuses shall not be taken or used underground.


(c) Explosives shall be fired only with a permissible blasting unit used in a manner consistent with its approval. Blasting units approved by MSHA that have approval labels specifying use with short-delay detonators with delay periods between 25-500 milliseconds are accepted to fire short-delay detonators up to 1,000 milliseconds, instantaneous detonators and long period delay detonators for anthracite mines.
