For the purpose of this part 77, the term: 


(a) *Active workings* means any place in a coal mine where miners are normally required to work or travel; 


(b) *American Table of Distances* means the current edition of “The American Table of Distances for Storage of Explosives” published by the Institute of Makers of Explosives; 


(c) *Barricaded* means to obstruct passage of persons, vehicles, or flying materials; 


(d) *Berm* means a pile or mound of material capable of restraining a vehicle; 


(e) *Blasting agent* means any material consisting of a mixture of a fuel and oxidizer which—


(1) Is used or intended for use in blasting; 


(2) Is not classed as an explosive by the Department of Transportation; 


(3) Contains no ingredient classed as an explosive by the Department of Transportation; and, 


(4) Cannot be detonated by a No. 8 blasting cap when tested as recommended in Bureau of Mines Information Circular 8179. 


(f) *Blasting area* means the area near blasting operations in which concussion or flying material can reasonably be expected to cause injury. 


(g) *Blasting cap* means a detonator containing a charge of detonating compound, which is ignited by electric current, or the spark of a fuse. Used for detonating explosives. 


(h) *Blasting circuit* means electric circuits used to fire electric detonators or to ignite an igniter cord by means of an electric starter. 


(i) *Blasting switch* means a switch used to connect a power source to a blasting circuit. 


(j) *Box-type magazine* means a small, portable magazine used to store limited quantities of explosives or detonators for short periods of time in locations at the mine which are convenient to the blasting sites at which they will be used. 


(k) *Capped fuse* means a length of safety fuse to which a detonator has been attached. 


(l) *Capped primer* means a package or cartridge of explosives which is specifically designed to transmit detonation to other explosives and which contains a detonator. 


(m) *Certified* or *registered,* as applied to any person means a person certified or registered by the State in which the coal mine is located to perform duties prescribed by this Part 77, except that, in a State where no program of certification or registration is provided or where the program does not meet at least minimum Federal standards established by the Secretary, such certification or registration shall be by the Secretary. 


(n) *Detonating cord* or *detonating fuse* means a flexible cord containing a core of high explosive. 


(o) *Detonator* means a device containing a small detonating charge that is used for detonating an explosive, including, but not limited to blasting caps, exploders, electric detonators, and delay electric blasting caps. 


(p) *Electrical grounding* means to connect with the ground to make the earth part of the circuit. 


(q) *Explosive* means any chemical compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion. Explosives include, but are not limited to black powder, dynamite, nitroglycerin, fulminate, ammonium nitrate when mixed with a hydrocarbon, and other blasting agents. 


(r) *Flash point* means the minimum temperature at which sufficient vapor is released by a liquid or solid to form a flammable vapor-air mixture at atmospheric pressure. 


(s) *Low voltage* means up to and including 660 volts, *medium voltage* means voltages from 661 to 1,000 volts, and *high voltage* means more than 1,000 volts. 


(t) *Misfire* means the complete or partial failure of a blasting charge to explode as planned. 


(u) *Primer* or *Booster* means a package or cartridge of explosive which is designed specifically to transmit detonation to other explosives and which does not contain a detonator. 


(v) *Qualified person* means, as the context requires, (1) An individual deemed qualified by the Secretary and designated by the operator to make tests and examinations required by this Part 77; and, 


(2) An individual deemed, in accordance with the minimum requirements to be established by the Secretary, qualified by training, education, and experience, to perform electrical work, to maintain electrical equipment, and to conduct examinations and make tests of all electrical equipment. 


(w) *Roll protection* means a framework, safety canopy, or similar protection for the operator when equipment overturns. 


(x) *Safety can* means an approved container, of not over 5 gallons capacity, having a spring-closing lid and spout cover. 


(y) *Safety fuse* means a train of powder enclosed in cotton, jute yarn, and waterproofing compounds, which burns at a uniform rate; used for firing a cap containing the detonating compound which in turn sets off the explosive charge. 


(z) *Safety switch* means a sectionalizing switch that also provides shunt protection in blasting circuits between the blasting switch and the shot area. 


(aa) *Secretary* means the Secretary of Labor or his delegate.
