(a) Light and power circuits shall be disconnected or removed from the blasting area before charging and blasting.

(f) Where it is impracticable to prepare primers in the blasting area, primers may be prepared on the surface and carried into the shaft in specially constructed, insulated, covered containers. 


(g) No other development operation shall be conducted in a shaft or at the face of a slope while drill holes are being charged and until after all shots have been fired. 


(h) The sides of the slope or shaft between the overhead platform and the bottom where men are working shall be examined after each blast and loose material removed. 


(i) Loose rock and other material shall be removed from timbers and platforms after each blast before men are lowered to the shaft bottom.
