The record shall be certified by the mine foreman or equivalent mine official, no later than the end of the mine foreman's or equivalent official's next regularly scheduled working shift. The record shall be made in a secure book that is not susceptible to alteration or electronically in a computer system so as to be secure and not susceptible to alteration. Such records shall be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least 1 year and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the part 90 miner.

(1) Make approved respiratory equipment available to the affected part 90 miner in accordance with § 72.700 of this subchapter.


(2) Immediately take corrective action to lower the concentration of respirable dust to below the standard. If the corrective action involves:


(i) Reducing the respirable dust levels in the work position of the part 90 miner identified in the citation, the operator shall implement the proposed corrective actions and begin sampling the affected miner within 8 calendar days after the date the citation is issued, until five valid representative samples are taken.
