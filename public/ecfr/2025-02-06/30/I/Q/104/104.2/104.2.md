# ยง 104.2   Pattern criteria.

(a) At least once each year, MSHA will review the compliance and accident, injury, and illness records of mines to determine if any mines meet the pattern of violations criteria. MSHA's review to identify mines with a pattern of S&S violations will include:


(1) Citations for S&S violations;


(2) Orders under section 104(b) of the Mine Act for not abating S&S violations;


(3) Citations and withdrawal orders under section 104(d) of the Mine Act, resulting from the mine operator's unwarrantable failure to comply;


(4) Imminent danger orders under section 107(a) of the Mine Act;


(5) Orders under section 104(g) of the Mine Act requiring withdrawal of miners who have not received training and who MSHA declares to be a hazard to themselves and others;


(6) Enforcement measures, other than section 104(e) of the Mine Act, that have been applied at the mine;


(7) Other information that demonstrates a serious safety or health management problem at the mine, such as accident, injury, and illness records; and


(8) Mitigating circumstances.


(b) MSHA will post the specific pattern criteria on its Web site.
