# ยง 203.53   What relief will BSEE grant?

(a) If we approve your application and you meet certain conditions, we will reduce the pre-application effective royalty rate by one-half on production up to the relief volume amount. If you produce more than the relief volume amount:


(1) We will impose a royalty rate equal to 1.5 times the effective royalty rate on your additional production up to twice the relief volume amount; and


(2) We will impose a royalty rate equal to the effective rate on all production greater than twice the relief volume amount.


(b) Regardless of the level of production or prices (see ยง 203.54), royalty payments due under end-of-life relief will not exceed the royalty obligations that would have been due at the effective royalty rate.


(1) The effective royalty rate is the average lease rate paid on production during the 12 qualifying months.


(2) The relief volume amount is the average monthly BOE production for the 12 qualifying months.
