# § 203.86   What is in a G&G report?

This report supports the reserve and resource estimates used in the economic evaluation and must contain each of the following elements.


(a) Seismic data which includes:


(1) Non-interpreted 2D/3D survey lines reflecting any available state-of-the-art processing technique in a format readable by BSEE and specified by the deep water royalty relief guidelines;


(2) Interpreted 2D/3D seismic survey lines reflecting any available state-of-the-art processing technique identifying all known and prospective pay horizons, wells, and fault cuts;


(3) Digital velocity surveys in the format of the GOM region's letter to lessees of 10/1/90;


(4) Plat map of “shot points;” and


(5) “Time slices” of potential horizons.


(b) Well data which includes:


(1) Hard copies of all well logs in which—


(i) The 1-inch electric log shows pay zones and pay counts and lithologic and paleo correlation markers at least every 500-feet,


(ii) The 1-inch type log shows missing sections from other logs where faulting occurs,


(iii) The 5-inch electric log shows pay zones and pay counts and labeled points used in establishing resistivity of the formation, 100 percent water saturated (R_o_) and the resistivity of the undisturbed formation (R_t_), and


(iv) The 5-inch porosity logs show pay zones and pay counts and labeled points used in establishing reservoir porosity or labeled points showing values used in calculating reservoir porosity such as bulk density or transit time;


(2) Digital copies of all well logs spudded before December 1, 1995;


(3) Core data, if available;


(4) Well correlation sections;


(5) Pressure data;


(6) Production test results;


(7) Pressure-volume-temperature analysis, if available; and


(8) A table listing the wells and completions, and indicating which sands and fault blocks will be targeted for completion or recompletion.


(c) Map interpretations which includes for each reservoir in the field:


(1) Structure maps consisting of top and base of sand maps showing well and seismic shot point locations;


(2) Isopach maps for net sand, net oil, net gas, all with well locations;


(3) Maps indicating well surface and bottom hole locations, location of development facilities, and shot points; and


(4) An explanation for excluding the reservoirs you are not planning to develop.


(d) Reservoir-specific data which includes:


(1) Probability of reservoir occurrence with hydrocarbons;


(2) Probability the hydrocarbon in the reservoir is all oil and the probability it is all gas;


(3) Distributions or point estimates (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for the parameters used to estimate reservoir size, *i.e.,* acres and net thickness;


(4) Most likely values for porosity, salt water saturation, volume factor for oil formation, and volume factor for gas formation;


(5) Distributions or point estimates (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for recovery efficiency (in percent) and oil or gas recovery (in stock-tank-barrels per acre-foot or in thousands of cubic feet per acre foot);


(6) A gas/oil ratio distribution or point estimate (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for each reservoir;


(7) A yield distribution or point estimate (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for each gas reservoir; and


(8) Reserve or resource distribution by reservoir.


(e) Aggregated reserve and resource data which includes:


(1) The aggregated distributions for reserves and resources (in BOE) and oil fraction for your field computed by the resource module of our RSVP model;


(2) A description of anticipated hydrocarbon quality (*i.e.,* specific gravity); and


(3) The ranges within the aggregated distribution for reserves and resources that define the development and production scenarios presented in the engineering and production reports. Typically there will be three ranges specified by two positive reserve and resource points on the aggregated distribution. The range at the low end of the distribution will be associated with the conservative development and production scenario; the middle range will be related to the most likely development and production scenario; and, the high end range will be consistent with the optimistic development and production scenario.
