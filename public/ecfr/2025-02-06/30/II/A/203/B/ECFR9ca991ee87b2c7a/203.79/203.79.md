# ยง 203.79   How do I appeal BSEE's decisions related to royalty relief for a deepwater lease or a development or expansion project?

(a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can request reconsideration by sending the BSEE Director a letter within 15 days that also states your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.


(b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty under ยง 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under ยง 203.69 are final agency actions.


(c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in ยง 203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing the BSEE Director and stating your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.


(d) We will notify you of all final agency actions by certified mail, return receipt requested. Final agency actions are not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290 and 43 CFR part 4. They are judicially reviewable under section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 702) *only* if you file an action within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.
