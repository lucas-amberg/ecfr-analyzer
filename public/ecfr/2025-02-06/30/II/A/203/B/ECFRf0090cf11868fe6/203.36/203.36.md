# ยง 203.36   Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?

(a) You must pay the Office of Natural Resources Revenue royalties on all gas production to which an RSV otherwise would be applied under ยง 203.33 for any calendar year in which the average daily closing New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the following table.


(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by:


(1) Determining the percentage of change during the year in the Department of Commerce's implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product; and


(2) Adjusting the threshold price for the previous year by that percentage.


(c) The following examples illustrate how this section applies.


(d) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.


(e) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this section count as part of your RSV.
