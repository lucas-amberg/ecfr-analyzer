BSEE will determine if your operating performance is unacceptable. BSEE will refer a determination of unacceptable performance to BOEM, who may disapprove or revoke your designation as operator on a single facility or multiple facilities. We will give you adequate notice and opportunity for a review by BSEE officials before making a determination that your operating performance is unacceptable.
