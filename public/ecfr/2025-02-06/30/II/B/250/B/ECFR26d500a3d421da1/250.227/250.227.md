# ยง 250.227   What must the Project Conceptual Plan contain?

In the Project Conceptual Plan, you must explain the basis of design that you will use to develop the field. You must include the following information:


(a) An overview of the development concept(s);


(b) The system control type (*i.e.,* direct hydraulic or electro-hydraulic);


(c) The estimated distance from each of the wells to the host platform, and umbilical length(s);


(d) A statement that the subsea production safety system will be designed to comply with Subpart H of this part;


(e) For a new facility, a description of the type of facility you plan to install (*e.g.* spar, tension leg platform (TLP), FPSO, etc.);


(f) For a subsea tie back to an existing facility:


(1) A description of known structural modifications that you will need to make to accommodate the tieback, including a statement about whether these accommodations constitute minor or major modifications,


(2) The BSEE-approved service life of the existing facility, and


(3) A description of how you will evaluate whether the modifications may affect the BSEE-approved service life.


(g) A statement regarding whether the host facility will be manned or unmanned;


(h) A schedule of development activities, including well completion, facility installation, and date of first oil;


(i) Schematics, including:


(1) A proposed well location plat,


(2) A conceptual subsea field schematic depicting the planned development infrastructure that contains (as applicable) the wells, pipelines, manifolds, subsea booster pumps, high integrity pressure protection system, riser systems, umbilical(s), and facility footprint,


(3) The surface or subsea tree, and


(4) A proposed wellbore and completion schematic for a typical well (including Surface Controlled Subsurface Safety Valve (SCSSV) location and chemical injection points; and depiction or description of gas zones, if any, behind the production casing or production liner and how those gas zones will be isolated).


(j) A description of the drilling and completion systems;


(k) The estimated shut-in tubing pressure for the proposed well(s), including the calculation used to arrive at the estimate, specifying true vertical depth (TVD), reservoir pressure, and the fluid gradient used, or a brief discussion of the pressure volume temperature (PVT) data used for estimation;


(l) The wellbore static bottomhole temperature and the estimated flowing temperature at the tree;


(m) The pressure and temperature rating of the tree and wellhead;


(n) Whether there will be corrosive production (*e.g.,* hydrogen sulfide (H_2_S), Carbon dioxide (CO_2_), Mercury (Hg) or injection fluids (*e.g.,* acid)), including concentrations;


(o) Whether any of the proposed equipment will be re-furbished and re-certified;


(p) Whether enhanced recovery is planned for the early life of the project;


(q) Whether any new or unusual technology will be used to develop your project involving the following: drilling, completion, injection, production, risers, pipelines, or platforms;


(r) Whether the well(s) will include smart completion technology;


(s) A list of requests for any alternate procedures or equipment in accordance with ยง 250.141 and request for departures in accordance with ยง 250.142 associated with your applicable Conceptual Plans; and


(t) Documentation demonstrating payment of the service fee listed in ยง 250.125.
