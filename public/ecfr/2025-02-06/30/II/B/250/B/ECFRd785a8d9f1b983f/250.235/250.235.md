# ยง 250.235   When and how must I submit the DWOP?

(a) You must submit the DWOP to the Regional Supervisor after BSEE has approved your Project Conceptual Plan and you have substantially completed system design, and before you conduct installation activities post-well completion for:


(1) A deepwater development project;


(2) A project that will use subsea tieback development technology in any water depth; or


(3) An HPHT development project, any project that uses Category 1 or 2 new or unusual technology barrier equipment, or any project that uses new or unusual technology that may impact the safety critical function of Category 1 or 2 barrier equipment regardless of the water depth.


(b) You may install subsea systems and associated pipelines after you have received applicable BSEE permit(s) and Conceptual Plan approvals. However, you may not begin production from the well until BSEE approves your DWOP.
