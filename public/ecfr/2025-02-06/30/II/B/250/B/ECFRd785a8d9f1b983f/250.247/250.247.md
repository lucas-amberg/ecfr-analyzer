# ยง 250.247   When must I supplement my DWOP?

You must supplement your DWOP to reflect additions or changes in your development project that:


(a) Physically alter the equipment or systems upstream of your boarding shut down valve, approved in your DWOP. If a Supplemental DWOP includes the addition of a well or wells (*e.g.,* a new subsea field) not approved in your original DWOP, you may not complete or produce from the new well(s) until BSEE approves the Supplemental DWOP; or


(b) Involves the addition of any new or unusual technology to your project that was not previously covered under the New or Unusual Technology Conceptual Plan, New or Unusual Technology Barrier Equipment Conceptual Plan, or DWOP. You may not install any new or unusual technology until BSEE approves the applicable Conceptual Plan and Supplemental DWOP.
