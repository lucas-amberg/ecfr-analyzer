# ยง 250.431   What are the diverter design and installation requirements?

You must design and install your diverter system to:


(a) Use diverter spool outlets and diverter lines that have a nominal diameter of at least 10 inches for surface wellhead configurations and at least 12 inches for floating drilling operations;


(b) Use dual diverter lines arranged to provide for downwind diversion capability;


(c) Use at least two diverter control stations. One station must be on the drilling floor. The other station must be in a readily accessible location away from the drilling floor;


(d) Use only remote-controlled valves in the diverter lines. All valves in the diverter system must be full-opening. You may not install manual or butterfly valves in any part of the diverter system;


(e) Minimize the number of turns (only one 90-degree turn allowed for each line for bottom-founded drilling units) in the diverter lines, maximize the radius of curvature of turns, and target all right angles and sharp turns;


(f) Anchor and support the entire diverter system to prevent whipping and vibration; and


(g) Protect all diverter-control instruments and lines from possible damage by thrown or falling objects.
