# § 250.415   What must my casing and cementing programs include?

Your casing and cementing programs must include:


(a) The following well design information:


(1) Hole sizes;


(2) Bit depths (including measured and true vertical depth (TVD));


(3) Casing information, including sizes, weights, grades, collapse and burst values, types of connection, and setting depths (measured and TVD) for all sections of each casing interval; and


(4) Locations of any installed rupture disks (indicate if burst or collapse and rating);


(b) Casing design safety factors for tension, collapse, and burst with the assumptions made to arrive at these values;


(c) Type and amount of cement (in cubic feet) planned for each casing string;


(d) In areas containing permafrost, setting depths for conductor and surface casing based on the anticipated depth of the permafrost. Your program must provide protection from thaw subsidence and freezeback effect, proper anchorage, and well control;


(e) A statement of how you evaluated the best practices included in API RP 65, Recommended Practice for Cementing Shallow Water Flow Zones in Deep Water Wells (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), if you drill a well in water depths greater than 500 feet and are in either of the following two areas:


(1) An “area with an unknown shallow water flow potential” is a zone or geologic formation where neither the presence nor absence of potential for a shallow water flow has been confirmed.


(2) An “area known to contain a shallow water flow hazard” is a zone or geologic formation for which drilling has confirmed the presence of shallow water flow; and


(f) A written description of how you evaluated the best practices included in API Standard 65—Part 2, Isolating Potential Flow Zones During Well Construction, Second Edition (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). Your written description must identify the mechanical barriers and cementing practices you will use for each casing string (reference API Standard 65—Part 2, Sections 4 and 5).
