# § 250.470   What additional information must I submit with my APD for Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations?

In addition to complying with all other applicable requirements included in this part, you must provide with your APD all of the following information pertaining to your proposed Arctic OCS exploratory drilling:


(a) A detailed description of:


(1) The environmental, meteorological, and oceanic conditions you expect to encounter at the well site(s);


(2) How you will prepare your equipment, materials, and drilling unit for service in the conditions identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and how your drilling unit will be in compliance with the requirements of § 250.713.


(b) A detailed description of all operations necessary in Arctic OCS conditions to transition the rig from being under way to conducting drilling operations and from ending drilling operations to being under way, as well as any anticipated repair and maintenance plans for the drilling unit and equipment. You should include, among other things, a description of how you plan to:


(1) Recover the subsea equipment, including the marine riser and the lower marine riser package;


(2) Recover the BOP;


(3) Recover the auxiliary sub-sea controls and template;


(4) Lay down the drill pipe and secure the drill pipe and marine riser;


(5) Secure the drilling equipment;


(6) Transfer the fluids for transport or disposal;


(7) Secure ancillary equipment like the draw works and lines;


(8) Refuel or transfer fuel;


(9) Offload waste;


(10) Recover the Remotely Operated Vehicles;


(11) Pick up the oil spill prevention booms and equipment; and


(12) Offload the drilling crew.


(c) A description of well-specific drilling objectives, timelines, and updated contingency plans for temporary abandonment of the well, including but not limited to the following:


(1) When you will spud the particular well (*i.e.,* begin drilling operations at the well site) identified in the APD;


(2) How long you will take to drill the well;


(3) Anticipated depths and geologic targets, with timelines;


(4) When you expect to set and cement each string of casing;


(5) When and how you would log the well;


(6) Your plans to test the well;


(7) When and how you intend to abandon the well, including specifically addressing your plans for how to move the rig off location and how you will meet the requirements of § 250.720(c);


(8) A description of what equipment and vessels will be involved in the process of temporarily abandoning the well due to ice; and


(9) An explanation of how you will integrate these elements into your overall program.


(d) A detailed description of your weather and ice forecasting capability for all phases of the drilling operation, including:


(1) How you will ensure your continuous awareness of potential weather and ice hazards at, and during transition between, wells;


(2) Your plans for managing ice hazards and responding to weather events; and


(3) Verification that you have the capabilities described in your BOEM-approved EP.


(e) A detailed description of how you will comply with the requirements of § 250.472.


(f) A statement that you own, or have a contract with a provider for, source control and containment equipment (SCCE), which is capable of controlling and/or containing a worst case discharge, as described in your BOEM-approved EP, when proposing to use a MODU to conduct exploratory drilling operations on the Arctic OCS. The following information must be included in your SCCE submittal:


(1) A detailed description of your or your contractor's SCCE capability to stop or contain flow from an out-of-control well, including your operating assumptions and limitations; your access to and ability to deploy, in accordance with § 250.471, all necessary SCCE; and your ability to evaluate the performance of the well design to determine how you can achieve a full shut-in without having reservoir fluids discharged into the environment;


(2) An inventory of the local and regional SCCE, supplies, and services that you own or for which you have a contract with a provider. You must identify each supplier of such equipment and services and provide their locations and telephone numbers;


(3) Where applicable, proof of contracts or membership agreements with cooperatives, service providers, or other contractors who will provide you with the necessary SCCE or related supplies and services if you do not possess them. The contract or membership agreement must include provisions for ensuring the availability of the personnel and/or equipment on a 24-hour per day basis while you are drilling below or working below the surface casing;


(4) A detailed description of the procedures you plan to use to inspect, test, and maintain your SCCE; and


(5) A detailed description of your plan to ensure that all members of your operating team, who are responsible for operating the SCCE, have received the necessary training to deploy and operate such equipment in Arctic OCS conditions and demonstrate ongoing proficiency in source control operations. You must also identify and include the dates of prior and planned training.


(g) Where it does not conflict with other requirements of this subpart, and except as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) through (11) of this section, you must comply with the requirements of API RP 2N, Third Edition “Planning, Designing, and Constructing Structures and Pipelines for Arctic Conditions” (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198), and provide a detailed description of how you will utilize the best practices included in API RP 2N during your exploratory drilling operations. You are not required to incorporate the following sections of API RP 2N into your drilling operations:


(1) Sections 6.6.3 through 6.6.4;


(2) The foundation recommendations in Section 8.4;


(3) Section 9.6;


(4) The recommendations for permanently moored systems in Section 9.7;


(5) The recommendations for pile foundations in Section 9.10;


(6) Section 12;


(7) Section 13.2.1;


(8) Sections 13.8.1.1, 13.8.2.1, 13.8.2.2, 13.8.2.4 through 13.8.2.7;
