# ยง 250.524   How long do I keep records of casing pressure and diagnostic tests?

Records of casing pressure and diagnostic tests must be kept at the field office nearest the well for a minimum of 2 years. The last casing diagnostic test for each casing or riser must be retained at the field office nearest the well until the well is abandoned.
