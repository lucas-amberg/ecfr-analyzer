Prior to engaging in well operations, personnel must be instructed in:

The date and time of safety meetings must be recorded and available at the facility for review by BSEE representatives.


(b) *Well control.* You must prepare a well-control plan for each well. Each well-control plan must contain instructions for personnel about the use of each well-control component of your BOP, procedures that describe how personnel will seal the wellbore and shear pipe before maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP) conditions are exceeded, assignments for each crew member, and a schedule for completion of each assignment.
