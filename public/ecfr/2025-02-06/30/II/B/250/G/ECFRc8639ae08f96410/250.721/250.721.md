# ยง 250.721   What are the requirements for pressure testing casing and liners?

(a) You must test each casing string that extends to the wellhead according to the following table:


(b) You must test each drilling liner and liner-top to a pressure at least equal to the anticipated leak-off pressure of the formation below that liner shoe, or subsequent liner shoes if set. You must conduct this test before you continue operations in the well.


(c) You must test each production liner and liner-top to a minimum of 500 psi above the formation fracture pressure at the casing shoe into which the liner is lapped.


(d) The District Manager may approve or require other casing test pressures as appropriate under the circumstances to ensure casing integrity.


(e) If you plan to produce a well, you must:


(1) For a well that is fully cased and cemented, pressure test the entire well to maximum anticipated shut-in tubing pressure, not to exceed 70% of the burst rating limit of the weakest component before perforating the casing or liner; or


(2) For an open-hole completion, pressure test the entire well to maximum anticipated shut-in tubing pressure, not to exceed 70% of the burst rating limit of the weakest component before you drill the open-hole section.


(f) You may not resume operations until you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in a 30-minute test, or if there is another indication of a leak, you must submit to the District Manager for approval your proposed plans to re-cement, repair the casing or liner, or run additional casing/liner to provide a proper seal. Your submittal must include a PE certification of your proposed plans.


(g) You must perform a negative pressure test on all wells that use a subsea BOP stack or wells with mudline suspension systems.


(1) You must perform a negative pressure test on your final casing string or liner. This test must be conducted after setting your second barrier just above the shoe track, but prior to conducting any completion operations.


(2) You must perform a negative pressure test prior to unlatching the BOP at any point in the well. The negative pressure test must be performed on those components, at a minimum, that will be exposed to the negative differential pressure that will occur when the BOP is disconnected.


(3) The District Manager may require you to perform additional negative pressure tests on other casing strings or liners (e.g., intermediate casing string or liner) or on wells with a surface BOP stack as appropriate to demonstrate casing or liner integrity.


(4) You must submit for approval with your APD or APM, test procedures and criteria for a successful negative pressure test. If any of your test procedures or criteria for a successful test change, you must submit for approval the changes in a revised APD or APM.


(5) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.


(6) If you have any indication of a failed negative pressure test, such as, but not limited to, pressure buildup or observed flow, you must immediately investigate the cause. If your investigation confirms that a failure occurred during the negative pressure test, you must:


(i) Correct the problem and immediately notify the appropriate District Manager; and


(ii) Submit a description of the corrective action taken and receive approval from the appropriate District Manager for the retest.


(7) You must have two barriers in place, as described in ยง 250.420(b)(3), at any time and for any well, prior to performing the negative pressure test.


(8) You must include documentation of the successful negative pressure test in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).
