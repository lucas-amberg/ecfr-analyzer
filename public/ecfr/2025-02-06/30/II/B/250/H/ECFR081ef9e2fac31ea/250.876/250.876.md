No later than September 7, 2018, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, you must have qualified third-party inspect, and then you must repair or replace, as needed, the fire tube for tube-type heaters that are equipped with either automatically controlled natural or forced draft burners installed in either atmospheric or pressure vessels that heat hydrocarbons and/or glycol.

You must document the inspection results, retain such documentation for at least 5 years, and make the documentation available to BSEE upon request.
