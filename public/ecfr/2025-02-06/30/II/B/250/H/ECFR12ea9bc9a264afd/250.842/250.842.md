The application must include the design documentation prescribed as follows:


(b) You must develop and maintain the following design documents and make them available to BSEE upon request:


(c) In the production safety system application, you must also certify the following:


(1) That all electrical systems were designed according to API RP 14F or API RP 14FZ, as applicable (incorporated by reference in § 250.198);


(2) That the design documents for the mechanical and electrical systems that you are required to submit under paragraph (a) of this section are sealed by a licensed professional engineer.

You must certify in an accompanying letter that the as-built design documents have been reviewed for compliance with applicable regulations and accurately represent the new or modified system as installed. The drawings must be clearly marked “as-built.”


(e) You must maintain approved and supporting design documents required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section at your offshore field office nearest the OCS facility or at other locations conveniently available to the District Manager. These documents must be made available to BSEE upon request and must be retained for the life of the facility. All approved designs are subject to field verifications.
