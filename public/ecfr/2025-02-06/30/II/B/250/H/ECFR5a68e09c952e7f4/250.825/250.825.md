# § 250.825   Subsea tree subsurface safety devices—general.

(a) For wells using subsea (wet) trees or for which you intend to install subsea trees, you must equip all tubing installations open to hydrocarbon-bearing zones with subsurface safety devices that will shut off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency. You must also install flow couplings above and below the subsurface safety devices. For instances where the well at issue is incapable of natural flow, you may seek District Manager approval for using alternative procedures or equipment, if you propose to use a subsea safety system that is not capable of shutting off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency. Subsurface safety devices include the following and any associated safety valve lock and landing nipple:


(1) A surface-controlled SSSV;


(2) An injection valve;


(3) A tubing plug; and


(4) A tubing/annular subsurface safety device.


(b) After installing the subsea tree, but before the rig or installation vessel leaves the area, you must test all valves and sensors to ensure that they are operating as designed and meet all the conditions specified in this subpart.
