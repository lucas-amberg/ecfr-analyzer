# § 250.828   Design, installation, and operation of SSSVs—subsea trees.

You must design, install, and operate (including repair, maintain, and test) an SSSV to ensure its reliable operation.


(a) You must install the SSSV at a depth at least 100 feet below the mudline. When warranted by conditions, such as unstable bottom conditions, permafrost, hydrate formation, or paraffin problems, the District Manager may approve an alternate setting depth on a case-by-case basis.


(b) The well must not be open to flow while an SSSV is inoperable, unless specifically approved by the District Manager in an APM.


(c) You must design, install, maintain, inspect, repair, and test all SSSVs in accordance with your Deepwater Operations Plan (DWOP) and ANSI/API RP 14B (incorporated by reference in § 250.198). For additional SSSV testing requirements, refer to § 250.880.
