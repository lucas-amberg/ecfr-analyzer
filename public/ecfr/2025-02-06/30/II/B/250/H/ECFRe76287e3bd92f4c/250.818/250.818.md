# § 250.818   Additional safety equipment—dry trees.

(a) You must equip all tubing installations that have a wireline- or pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device with a landing nipple, with flow couplings or other protective equipment above and below it to provide for the setting of the device.


(b) The control system for all surface-controlled SSSVs must be an integral part of the platform emergency shutdown system (ESD).


(c) In addition to the activation of the ESD by manual action on the platform, the system may be activated by a signal from a remote location. Surface-controlled SSSVs must close in response to shut-in signals from the ESD and in response to the fire loop or other fire detection devices.
