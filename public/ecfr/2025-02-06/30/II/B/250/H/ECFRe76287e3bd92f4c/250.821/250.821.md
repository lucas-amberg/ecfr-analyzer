# § 250.821   Emergency action and safety system shutdown—dry trees.

(a) If your facility is impacted or will potentially be impacted by an emergency situation (e.g., an impending National Weather Service-named tropical storm or hurricane, ice events, or post-earthquake), you must:


(1) Properly install a subsurface safety device on any well that is not yet equipped with a subsurface safety device and that is capable of natural flow, as soon as possible, with due consideration being given to personnel safety.


(2) You must shut-in (by closing the SSV and the surface-controlled SSSV) the following types of wells:


(i) All oil wells, and


(ii) All gas wells requiring compression.


(b) Closure of the SSV must not exceed 45 seconds after automatic detection of an abnormal condition or actuation of an ESD. The surface-controlled SSSV must close within 2 minutes after the shut-in signal has closed the SSV. The District Manager must approve any alternative design-delayed closure time of greater than 2 minutes based on the mechanical/production characteristics of the individual well.
