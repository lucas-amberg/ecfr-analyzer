(b) You must follow the requirements contained in the documents listed under paragraph (a) of this section insofar as they do not conflict with other provisions of 30 CFR part 250. You may use applicable provisions of these documents, as approved by the Regional Supervisor, for the design, fabrication, and installation of platforms such as spars, since standards specifically written for such structures do not exist. You may also use alternative codes, rules, or standards, as approved by the Regional Supervisor, under the conditions enumerated in § 250.141.


(c) For information on the standards mentioned in this section, and where they may be obtained, see § 250.198 of this part.


(d) The following chart summarizes the applicability of the industry standards listed in this section for fixed and floating platforms:
