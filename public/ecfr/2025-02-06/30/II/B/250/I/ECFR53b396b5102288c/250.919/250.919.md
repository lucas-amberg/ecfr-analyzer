(4) The overall structural condition of each platform, including a corrosion protection evaluation; and


(5) A summary of the inspection results indicating what repairs, if any, were needed.


(b) If any of your structures have been exposed to a natural occurrence (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, or tropical storm), the Regional Supervisor may require you to submit an initial report of all structural damage, followed by subsequent updates, which include the following:


(1) A list of affected structures;


(2) A timetable for conducting the inspections described in section 14.4.3 of API RP 2A-WSD (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198); and
