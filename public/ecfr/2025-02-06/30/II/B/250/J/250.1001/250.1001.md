# § 250.1001   Definitions.

Terms used in this subpart shall have the meanings given below:


*DOI pipelines* include:


(1) Producer-operated pipelines extending upstream (generally seaward) from each point on the OCS at which operating responsibility transfers from a producing operator to a transporting operator;


(2) Producer-operated pipelines extending upstream (generally seaward) of the last valve (including associated safety equipment) on the last production facility on the OCS that do not connect to a transporter-operated pipeline on the OCS before crossing into State waters;


(3) Producer-operated pipelines connecting production facilities on the OCS;


(4) Transporter-operated pipelines that DOI and DOT have agreed are to be regulated as DOI pipelines; and


(5) All OCS pipelines not subject to regulation under 49 CFR parts 192 and 195.


*DOT pipelines* include:


(1) Transporter-operated pipelines currently operated under DOT requirements governing design, construction, maintenance, and operation;


(2) Producer-operated pipelines that DOI and DOT have agreed are to be regulated under DOT requirements governing design, construction, maintenance, and operation; and


(3) Producer-operated pipelines downstream (generally shoreward) of the last valve (including associated safety equipment) on the last production facility on the OCS that do not connect to a transporter-operated pipeline on the OCS before crossing into State waters and that are regulated under 49 CFR parts 192 and 195.


*Lease term pipelines* are those pipelines owned and operated by a lessee or operator and are wholly contained within the boundaries of a single lease, unitized leases, or contiguous (not cornering) leases of that lessee or operator.


*Out-of-service pipelines* are those pipelines that have not been used to transport oil, natural gas, sulfur, or produced water for more than 30 consecutive days.


*Pipelines* are the piping, risers, and appurtenances installed for the purpose of transporting oil, gas, sulphur, and produced water. (Piping confined to a production platform or structure is covered in Subpart H, Production Safety Systems, and is excluded from this subpart.)


*Production facilities* means OCS facilities that receive hydrocarbon production either directly from wells or from other facilities that produce hydrocarbons from wells. They may include processing equipment for treating the production or separating it into its various liquid and gaseous components before transporting it to shore.


*Right-of-way pipelines* are those pipelines which—


(1) Are contained within the boundaries of a single lease or group of unitized leases but are not owned and operated by the lessee or operator of that lease or unit,


(2) Are contained within the boundaries of contiguous (not cornering) leases which do not have a common lessee or operator,


(3) Are contained within the boundaries of contiguous (not cornering) leases which have a common lessee or operator but are not owned and operated by that common lessee or operator, or


(4) Cross any portion of an unleased block(s).
