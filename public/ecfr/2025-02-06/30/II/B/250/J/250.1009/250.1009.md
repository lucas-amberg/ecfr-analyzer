# § 250.1009   Requirements to obtain pipeline right-of-way grants.

(a) In addition to applicable requirements of §§ 250.1000 through 250.1008 and other regulations of this part, regulations of the Department of Transportation, Department of the Army, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), when a pipeline qualifies as a right-of-way pipeline, the pipeline shall not be installed until a right-of-way has been requested and granted in accordance with this subpart. The right-of-way grant is issued pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 1334(e) and may be acquired and held only by citizens and nationals of the United States; aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20); private, public, or municipal corporations organized under the laws of the United States or territory thereof, the District of Columbia, or of any State; or associations of such citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or private, public, or municipal corporations, States, or political subdivisions of States.


(b) A right-of-way shall include the site on which the pipeline and associated structures are to be situated, shall not exceed 200 feet in width unless safety and environmental factors during construction and operation of the associated right-of-way pipeline require a greater width, and shall be limited to the area reasonably necessary for pumping stations or other accessory structures.
