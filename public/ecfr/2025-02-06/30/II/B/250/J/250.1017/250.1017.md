# § 250.1017   Requirements for construction under pipeline right-of-way grants.

(a) Failure to construct the associated right-of-way pipeline within 5 years of the date of the granting of a right-of-way shall cause the grant to expire.


(b)(1) A right-of-way holder shall ensure that the right-of-way pipeline is constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the right-of-way as granted.


(2) If, after constructing the right-of-way pipeline, it is determined that a deviation from the proposed right-of-way as granted has occurred, the right-of-way holder shall—


(i) Notify the operators of all leases and holders of all right-of-way grants in which a deviation has occurred, and within 60 days of the date of the acceptance by the Regional Supervisor of the completion of pipeline construction report, provide the Regional Supervisor with evidence of such notification; and


(ii) Relinquish any unused portion of the right-of-way.


(3) Substantial deviation of a right-of-way pipeline as constructed from the proposed right-of-way as granted may be grounds for forfeiture of the right-of-way.


(c) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a significant change in conditions has occurred subsequent to the granting of a right-of-way but prior to the commencement of construction of the associated pipeline, the Regional Supervisor may suspend or temporarily prohibit the commencement of construction until the right-of-way grant is modified to the extent necessary to address the changed conditions.
