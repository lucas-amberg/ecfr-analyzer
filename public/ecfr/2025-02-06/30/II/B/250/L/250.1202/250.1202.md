You must use the average of the five accepted runs to compute the meter factor.


(2) If you use a master meter, you must record proof runs until three consecutive runs produce a total meter factor difference of no greater than 0.0005. The flow rate through the meters during the proving must be within 10 percent of the rate at which the line meter will operate. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter factors of the three runs;


(3) If you use a tank prover, you must record proof runs until two consecutive runs produce a meter factor difference of no greater than .0005. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter factors of the two runs; and

(i) Remove the meter from service and inspect it for damage or wear;


(ii) Adjust or repair the meter, and reprove it;


(iii) Apply the average of the malfunction factor and the previous factor to the production measured through the meter between the date of the previous factor and the date of the malfunction factor; and


(iv) Indicate that a meter malfunction occurred and show all appropriate remarks regarding subsequent repairs or adjustments on the proving report.


(2) If a meter fails to register production, you must:


(i) Remove the meter from service, repair and reprove it;


(ii) Apply the previous meter factor to the production run between the date of that factor and the date of the failure; and


(iii) Estimate and report unregistered production on the run ticket.
