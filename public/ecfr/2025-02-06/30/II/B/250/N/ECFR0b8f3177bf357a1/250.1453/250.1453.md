# ยง 250.1453   What if I do not correct the violation?

(a) We may send you a Notice of Civil Penalty if you do not correct all of the violations identified in the Notice of Noncompliance within 20 days after you receive the Notice of Noncompliance (or within a longer time period specified in that Notice). The Notice of Civil Penalty will tell you how much penalty you must pay for each day, beginning with the date of the Notice of Noncompliance, for each violation identified in the Notice of Noncompliance for as long as you do not correct the violation. The maximum civil penalty amount for each day of such an uncorrected violation is as specified in 30 CFR 1241.52(a)(2).


(b) If you do not correct all of the violations identified in the Notice of Noncompliance within 40 days after you receive the Notice of Noncompliance (or 20 days following the expiration of a longer time period specified in that Notice), we may increase the penalty for each day, beginning with the date of the Notice of Noncompliance, for each violation for as long as you do not correct the violations. The maximum civil penalty amount for each day of such an uncorrected violation is as specified in 30 CFR 1241.52(b).
