You determine the frequency of the training you provide your employees. You must do all of the following:


(a) Provide periodic training to ensure that employees maintain understanding of, and competency in, well control, deepwater well control, or production safety practices;


(b) Establish procedures to verify adequate retention of the knowledge and skills that employees need to perform their assigned well control, deepwater well control, or production safety duties; and


(c) Ensure that your contractors' training programs provide for periodic training and verification of well control, deepwater well control, or production safety knowledge and skills.
