BSEE or its authorized representative may test your employees or contract personnel at your worksite or at an onshore location. You and your contractors must:


(a) Allow BSEE or its authorized representative to administer written or oral tests; and


(b) Identify personnel by current position, years of experience in present position, years of total oil field experience, and employer's name (e.g., operator, contractor, or sub-contractor company name).
