# ยง 250.1708   How will BSEE enforce accrued decommissioning obligations against predecessors?

(a) When BSEE issues an order to predecessors to perform accrued decommissioning obligations, the order recipients must, unless otherwise specified in the order:


(1) Within 30 days of receiving the order, begin maintaining and monitoring, through a single entity identified to BSEE, any facility, including wells and pipelines, as identified by BSEE in the order and in accordance with applicable requirements under this part (including, but not limited to, testing safety valves and sensors, draining vessels, and performing pollution inspections);


(2) Within 90 days of receiving the order, designate a single entity to serve as operator or agent for the decommissioning operations;


(3) Within 150 days of receiving the order, submit through the entity identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section a decommissioning plan for approval by the Regional Supervisor that includes the scope of work and a reasonable decommissioning schedule for all wells, platforms and other facilities, pipelines, and site clearance, as identified in the order; and


(4) Perform the required decommissioning in the time and manner specified by BSEE in its decommissioning plan approval.


(b) Failure to comply with the obligations under paragraph (a) of this section to maintain and monitor a facility or to submit a decommissioning plan may result in a Notice of Incident of Noncompliance and potentially other enforcement actions, including civil penalties and disqualification as an operator.


(c) BSEE's issuance of orders to any predecessors will not relieve any current lessee or grant holder, or any other predecessor, of its obligations to comply with any prior decommissioning order or to satisfy any accrued decommissioning obligations.


(d) A pending appeal, pursuant to 30 CFR part 290, of any decommissioning order does not preclude BSEE from proceeding against any or all predecessors other than the appellant.
