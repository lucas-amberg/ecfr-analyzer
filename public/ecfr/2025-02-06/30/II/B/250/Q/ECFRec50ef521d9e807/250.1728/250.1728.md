# ยง 250.1728   To what depth must I remove a platform or other facility?

(a) Unless the Regional Supervisor approves an alternate depth under paragraph (b) of this section, you must remove all platforms and other facilities (including templates and pilings) to at least 15 feet below the mud line.


(b) The Regional Supervisor may approve an alternate removal depth if:


(1) The remaining structure would not become an obstruction to other users of the seafloor or area, and geotechnical and other information you provide demonstrate that erosional processes capable of exposing the obstructions are not expected; or


(2) You determine, and BSEE concurs, that you must use divers and the seafloor sediment stability poses safety concerns; or


(3) The water depth is greater than 800 meters (2,624 feet).
