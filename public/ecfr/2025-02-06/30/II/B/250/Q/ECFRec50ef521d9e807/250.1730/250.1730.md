# ยง 250.1730   When might BSEE approve partial structure removal or toppling in place?

The Regional Supervisor may grant a departure from the requirement to remove a platform or other facility by approving partial structure removal or toppling in place for conversion to an artificial reef if you meet the following conditions:


(a) The structure becomes part of a State artificial reef program, and the responsible State agency acquires a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and accepts title and liability for the structure; and


(b) You satisfy any U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) navigational requirements for the structure.
