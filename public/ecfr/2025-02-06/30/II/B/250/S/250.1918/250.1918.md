# ยง 250.1918   What criteria for emergency response and control must be in my SEMS program?

Your SEMS program must require that emergency response and control plans are in place and are ready for immediate implementation. These plans must be validated by drills carried out in accordance with a schedule defined by the SEMS training program (ยง 250.1915). The SEMS emergency response and control plans must include:


(a) Emergency Action Plan that assigns authority and responsibility to the appropriate qualified person(s) at a facility for initiating effective emergency response and control, addressing emergency reporting and response requirements, and complying with all applicable governmental regulations;


(b) Emergency Control Center(s) designated for each facility with access to the Emergency Action Plans, oil spill contingency plan, and other safety and environmental information (ยง 250.1910); and


(c) Training and Drills incorporating emergency response and evacuation procedures conducted periodically for all personnel (including contractor's personnel), as required by the SEMS training program (ยง 250.1915). Drills must be based on realistic scenarios conducted periodically to exercise elements contained in the facility or area emergency action plan. An analysis and critique of each drill must be conducted to identify and correct weaknesses.
