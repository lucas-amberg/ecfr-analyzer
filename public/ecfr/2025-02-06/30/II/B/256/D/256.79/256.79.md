(a) All regulations in this part, insofar as they are applicable, shall supersede the provisions of any lease which is maintained under section 6(a) of the Act. However, the provisions of a lease relating to area, minerals, rentals, royalties (subject to sections 6(a) (8) and (9) of the Act), and term (subject to section 6(a)(10) of the Act and, as to sulfur, subject to section 6(b)(2) of the Act) shall continue in effect, and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, shall take precedence over these regulations.


(b) A lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act shall also be subject to all operating and conservation regulations applicable to the OCS. In addition, the regulations relating to geophysical and geological exploratory operations and to pipeline rights-of-way are applicable, to the extent that those regulations are not contrary to or inconsistent with the lease provisions relating to area, the minerals, rentals, royalties and term. The lessee shall comply with any provision of the lease as validated, the subject matter of which is not covered in the regulations in this part.
