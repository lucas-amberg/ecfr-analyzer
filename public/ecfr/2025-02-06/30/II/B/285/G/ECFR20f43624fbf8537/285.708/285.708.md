# § 285.708   What are the CVA's or project engineer's primary duties for fabrication and installation review?

(a) The CVA or project engineer must do all of the following:


(1) Use good engineering judgment and practice in conducting an independent assessment of the fabrication and installation activities and of the commissioning of Critical Safety Systems and Equipment;


(2) Monitor the fabrication and installation of the facility and the commissioning of Critical Safety Systems and Equipment as required by paragraph (b) of this section;


(3) Make periodic onsite inspections while fabrication is in progress and verify the items required by § 285.709;


(4) Make periodic onsite inspections while installation is in progress and satisfy the requirements of § 285.710;


(5) Certify in Project Verification Reports that project components are fabricated and installed in accordance with accepted engineering practices and to a nationally or internationally recognized quality assurance standard or to an equivalent alternate means of quality assurance considered on a case-by-case basis, your BOEM-approved SAP, COP, or GAP (as applicable), and your FIR. If multiple CVAs are involved in your project, the general project CVA must submit the final report containing such certification for the project. The Project Verification Report must identify the location of all records pertaining to facility fabrication and installation as required in § 285.714(c);


(6) Provide records documenting that Critical Safety Systems and Equipment are commissioned in accordance with the procedures identified in § 285.702(a)(8); and

(b) To comply with paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, the CVA or project engineer must monitor the fabrication and installation of the facility and the commissioning of Critical Safety Systems and Equipment to certify that they have been built and installed according to your FDRs and FIRs.


(1) If the CVA or project engineer finds that either fabrication and installation procedures or Critical Safety Systems and Equipment commissioning procedures, or both, have been changed or design specifications have been modified, the CVA or project engineer must inform you and BSEE; and


(2) If you accept the modifications, you must also inform BSEE.
