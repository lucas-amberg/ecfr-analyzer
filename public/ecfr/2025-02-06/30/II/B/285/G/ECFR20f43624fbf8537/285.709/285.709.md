# ยง 285.709   When conducting onsite fabrication inspections, what must the CVA or project engineer verify?

(a) To comply with ยง 285.708(a)(3), the CVA or project engineer must make periodic onsite inspections while fabrication is in progress and must verify the following fabrication items, as appropriate:


(1) Quality control by lessee (or grant holder) and builder;


(2) Fabrication site facilities;


(3) Material quality and identification methods;


(4) Fabrication procedures specified in your FIRs and adherence to such procedures;


(5) Welder and welding procedure qualification and identification;


(6) Structural tolerances specified, and adherence to those tolerances;


(7) Nondestructive examination requirements and evaluation results of the specified examinations;


(8) Destructive testing requirements and results;


(9) Repair procedures;


(10) Installation of corrosion-protection systems and splash-zone protection;


(11) Erection procedures to ensure that overstressing of structural members does not occur;


(12) Alignment procedures;


(13) Dimensional check of the overall structure, including any turrets, turret-and-hull interfaces, any mooring line and chain and riser tensioning line segments, and tendon or tethering systems; and


(14) Status of quality-control records at various stages of fabrication.


(b) For any floating facility, the CVA or project engineer must also verify that any requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard for structural integrity and stability (e.g., verification of center of gravity) have been met. The CVA or project engineer must also consider:


(1) Foundations, foundation pilings and templates, and anchoring systems; and


(2) Mooring, tendon, or tethering systems.
