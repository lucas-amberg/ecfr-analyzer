# § 285.714   What records relating to FDRs, FIRs, and Project Modification and Repair Reports must I keep?

(a) Until BOEM releases your financial assurance under 30 CFR 585.534, you must compile, retain, and make available to BSEE, within the time specified by BSEE, all of the following:


(1) The as-built drawings;


(2) The design assumptions and analyses;


(3) A summary of the fabrication and installation examination records;


(4) The records of the commissioning of Critical Safety Systems and Equipment;


(5) The inspection results from the inspections and assessments required by §§ 285.820 through 285.825; and


(6) Records of repairs not covered in the inspection report submitted under § 285.824(b)(3).


(b) You must record and retain the original material test results of all primary structural materials during all stages of construction until BOEM releases your financial assurance under 30 CFR 585.534. Primary material is material that, should it fail, would lead to a significant reduction in facility safety, structural reliability, or operating capabilities. Items such as steel brackets, deck stiffeners and secondary braces or beams would not generally be considered primary structural members (or materials).


(c) You must provide BSEE with the location of these records, as required in §§ 285.701(c) and (d), 285.702(c) and (d), 285.703(b), and 285.708(a)(5) and (7).
