# ยง 285.811   Am I required to obtain a certification of my SMS?

You are not required to obtain a certification that your SMS meets acceptable health and safety standards (*e.g.,* ANSI/ASSP Z10.0, API RP 75, ISO 45001) from a recognized accreditation organization. However, BSEE will consider such certification in determining the frequency and scope of SMS-related inspections that it conducts under this subpart, as well as the scope and nature of its oversight over any audit-induced corrective actions.
