# ยง 291.115   How do I exhaust administrative remedies?

(a) If the BSEE Director issues a decision under this part but does not expressly make the decision effective upon issuance, you must appeal the decision to the IBLA under 43 CFR part 4 to exhaust administrative remedies. Such decision will not be effective during the time in which a person adversely affected by the BSEE Director's decision may file a notice of appeal with the IBLA, and the timely filing of a notice of appeal will suspend the effect of the decision pending the decision on appeal.


(b) This section does not apply if a decision was made effective by:


(1) The BSEE Director; or


(2) The Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.
