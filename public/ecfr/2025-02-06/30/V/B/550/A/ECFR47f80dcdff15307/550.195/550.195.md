# ยง 550.195   What must I do if I discover a potential archaeological resource while conducting operations on the lease or right-of-way area?

(a) If you discover any unanticipated archaeological resources while conducting operations on the lease or right-of-way area, you must immediately halt seafloor disturbing operations within at least 305 meters (1,000 feet) of the area of the discovery and report the discovery to the Regional Director within 72 hours.


(b) If BOEM determines that the resource may be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places in accordance with the applicable regulations, the Regional Director will specify measures you must take to protect the resource during operations and activities.


(c) For activities and operations under BSEE jurisdiction, BOEM will refer the discovery to BSEE to determine if the resource may have been adversely impacted by your operations and activities prior to or during its discovery in paragraph (a). The Regional Director of BSEE will specify measures you must take to either demonstrate that no adverse impacts have occurred or to document the extent of adverse impacts that have occurred. BSEE may further specify measures you must take to remediate adverse impacts to any archaeological resources resulting from your operations and activities and will relay to BOEM both the results of its investigation and any further measures it has imposed to remediate the adverse impacts that may have occurred.
