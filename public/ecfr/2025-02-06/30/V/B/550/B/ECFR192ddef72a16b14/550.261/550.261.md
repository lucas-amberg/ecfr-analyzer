# ยง 550.261   What environmental impact analysis (EIA) information must accompany the DPP or DOCD?

The following EIA information must accompany your DPP or DOCD:


(a) *General requirements.* Your EIA must:


(1) Assess the potential environmental impacts of your proposed development and production activities;


(2) Be project specific; and


(3) Be as detailed as necessary to assist the Regional Supervisor in complying with the NEPA of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.*) and other relevant Federal laws such as the ESA and the MMPA.


(b) *Resources, conditions, and activities.* Your EIA must describe those resources, conditions, and activities listed below that could be affected by your proposed development and production activities, or that could affect the construction and operation of facilities or structures or the activities proposed in your DPP or DOCD.


(1) Meteorology, oceanography, geology, and shallow geological or manmade hazards;


(2) Air and water quality;


(3) Benthic communities, marine mammals, sea turtles, coastal and marine birds, fish and shellfish, and plant life;


(4) Threatened or endangered species and their critical habitat;


(5) Sensitive biological resources or habitats such as essential fish habitat, refuges, preserves, special management areas identified in coastal management programs, sanctuaries, rookeries, and calving grounds;


(6) Archaeological resources;


(7) Socioeconomic resources (including the approximate number, timing, and duration of employment of persons engaged in onshore support and construction activities), population (including the approximate number of people and families added to local onshore areas), existing offshore and onshore infrastructure (including major sources of supplies, services, energy, and water), types of contractors or vendors that may place a demand on local goods and services, land use, subsistence resources and harvest practices, recreation, recreational and commercial fishing (including seasons, location, and type), minority and lower income groups, and CZMA programs;


(8) Coastal and marine uses such as military activities, shipping, and mineral exploration or development; and


(9) Other resources, conditions, and activities identified by the Regional Supervisor.


(c) *Environmental impacts.* Your EIA must:


(1) Analyze the potential direct and indirect impacts (including those from accidents, cooling water intake structures, and those identified in relevant ESA biological opinions such as, but not limited to, those from noise, vessel collisions, and marine trash and debris) that your proposed development and production activities will have on the identified resources, conditions, and activities;


(2) Describe the type, severity, and duration of these potential impacts and their biological, physical, and other consequences and implications;


(3) Describe potential measures to minimize or mitigate these potential impacts;


(4) Describe any alternatives to your proposed development and production activities that you considered while developing your DPP or DOCD, and compare the potential environmental impacts; and


(5) Summarize the information you incorporate by reference.


(d) *Consultation.* Your EIA must include a list of agencies and persons with whom you consulted, or with whom you will be consulting, regarding potential impacts associated with your proposed development and production activities.


(e) *References cited.* Your EIA must include a list of the references that you cite in the EIA.
