# ยง 550.282   Do I have to conduct post-approval monitoring?

After approving your EP, DPP, or DOCD, the Regional Supervisor may direct you to conduct monitoring programs, including monitoring in accordance with the ESA and the MMPA. You must retain copies of all monitoring data obtained or derived from your monitoring programs and make them available to the BOEM upon request. The Regional Supervisor may require you to:


(a) *Monitoring plans.* Submit monitoring plans for approval before you begin the work; and


(b) *Monitoring reports.* Prepare and submit reports that summarize and analyze data and information obtained or derived from your monitoring programs. The Regional Supervisor will specify requirements for preparing and submitting these reports.
