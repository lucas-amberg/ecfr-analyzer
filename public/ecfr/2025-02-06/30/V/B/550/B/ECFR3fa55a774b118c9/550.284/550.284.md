(a) *Periodic review.* The Regional Supervisor will periodically review the activities you conduct under your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD and may require you to submit updated information on your activities. The frequency and extent of this review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities in your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD.


(b) *Results of review.* The Regional Supervisor may require you to revise your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD based on this review. In such cases, the Regional Supervisor will inform you of the reasons for the decision.
