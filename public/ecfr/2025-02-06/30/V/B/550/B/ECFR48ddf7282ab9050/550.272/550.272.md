# ยง 550.272   If a State objects to the DPP's or DOCD's coastal zone consistency certification, what can I do?

If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency certification accompanying your proposed or disapproved DPP or DOCD, you may do one of the following:


(a) *Amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD.* Amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD to accommodate the State's objection and submit the amendment or resubmittal to the Regional Supervisor for approval. The amendment or resubmittal needs to only address information related to the State's objections.


(b) *Appeal.* Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of Commerce using the procedures in 15 CFR part 930, subpart H. The Secretary of Commerce will either:


(1) Grant your appeal by finding under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C.1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in detail in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security; or


(2) Deny your appeal, in which case you may amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Withdraw your DPP or DOCD.* Withdraw your DPP or DOCD if you decide not to conduct your proposed development and production activities.
