# § 550.273   How do I submit a modified DPP or DOCD or resubmit a disapproved DPP or DOCD?

(a) *Modified DPP or DOCD.* If the Regional Supervisor requires you to modify your proposed DPP or DOCD under § 550.270(b)(2), you must submit the modification(s) to the Regional Supervisor in the same manner as for a new DPP or DOCD. You need submit only information related to the proposed modification(s).


(b) *Resubmitted DPP or DOCD.* If the Regional Supervisor disapproves your DPP or DOCD under § 550.270(b)(3), and except as provided in § 550.271(b)(3), you may resubmit the disapproved DPP or DOCD if there is a change in the conditions that were the basis of its disapproval.


(c) *BOEM review and timeframe.* The Regional Supervisor will use the performance standards in § 550.202 to either approve, require you to further modify, or disapprove your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 60 calendar days after the Regional Supervisor deems your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD to be submitted, or receives the last amendment to your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD, whichever occurs later.
