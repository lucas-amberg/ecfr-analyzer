# ยง 550.217   What solid and liquid wastes and discharges information and cooling water intake information must accompany the EP?

The following solid and liquid wastes and discharges information and cooling water intake information must accompany your EP:


(a) *Projected wastes.* A table providing the name, brief description, projected quantity, and composition of solid and liquid wastes (such as spent drilling fluids, drill cuttings, trash, sanitary and domestic wastes, and chemical product wastes) likely to be generated by your proposed exploration activities. Describe:


(1) The methods you used for determining this information; and


(2) Your plans for treating, storing, and downhole disposal of these wastes at your drilling location(s).


(b) *Projected ocean discharges.* If any of your solid and liquid wastes will be discharged overboard, or are planned discharges from manmade islands:


(1) A table showing the name, projected amount, and rate of discharge for each waste type; and


(2) A description of the discharge method (such as shunting through a downpipe, *etc.*) you will use.


(c) *National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.* (1) A discussion of how you will comply with the provisions of the applicable general NPDES permit that covers your proposed exploration activities; or


(2) A copy of your application for an individual NPDES permit. Briefly describe the major discharges and methods you will use for compliance.


(d) *Modeling report.* The modeling report or the modeling results (if you modeled the discharges of your projected solid or liquid wastes when developing your EP), or a reference to such report or results if you have already submitted it to the Regional Supervisor.


(e) *Projected cooling water intake.* A table for each cooling water intake structure likely to be used by your proposed exploration activities that includes a brief description of the cooling water intake structure, daily water intake rate, water intake through screen velocity, percentage of water intake used for cooling water, mitigation measures for reducing impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms, and biofouling prevention measures.
