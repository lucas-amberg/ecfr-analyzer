# ยง 550.227   What environmental impact analysis (EIA) information must accompany the EP?

The following EIA information must accompany your EP:


(a) *General requirements.* Your EIA must:


(1) Assess the potential environmental impacts of your proposed exploration activities;


(2) Be project specific; and


(3) Be as detailed as necessary to assist the Regional Supervisor in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.*) and other relevant Federal laws such as the ESA and the MMPA.


(b) *Resources, conditions, and activities.* Your EIA must describe those resources, conditions, and activities listed below that could be affected by your proposed exploration activities, or that could affect the construction and operation of facilities or structures, or the activities proposed in your EP.


(1) Meteorology, oceanography, geology, and shallow geological or manmade hazards;


(2) Air and water quality;


(3) Benthic communities, marine mammals, sea turtles, coastal and marine birds, fish and shellfish, and plant life;


(4) Threatened or endangered species and their critical habitat as defined by the Endangered Species Act of 1973;


(5) Sensitive biological resources or habitats such as essential fish habitat, refuges, preserves, special management areas identified in coastal management programs, sanctuaries, rookeries, and calving grounds;


(6) Archaeological resources;


(7) Socioeconomic resources including employment, existing offshore and coastal infrastructure (including major sources of supplies, services, energy, and water), land use, subsistence resources and harvest practices, recreation, recreational and commercial fishing (including typical fishing seasons, location, and type), minority and lower income groups, and coastal zone management programs;


(8) Coastal and marine uses such as military activities, shipping, and mineral exploration or development; and


(9) Other resources, conditions, and activities identified by the Regional Supervisor.


(c) *Environmental impacts.* Your EIA must:


(1) Analyze the potential direct and indirect impacts (including those from accidents, cooling water intake structures, and those identified in relevant ESA biological opinions such as, but not limited to, those from noise, vessel collisions, and marine trash and debris) that your proposed exploration activities will have on the identified resources, conditions, and activities;


(2) Analyze any potential cumulative impacts from other activities to those identified resources, conditions, and activities potentially impacted by your proposed exploration activities;


(3) Describe the type, severity, and duration of these potential impacts and their biological, physical, and other consequences and implications;


(4) Describe potential measures to minimize or mitigate these potential impacts; and


(5) Summarize the information you incorporate by reference.


(d) *Consultation.* Your EIA must include a list of agencies and persons with whom you consulted, or with whom you will be consulting, regarding potential impacts associated with your proposed exploration activities.


(e) *References cited.* Your EIA must include a list of the references that you cite in the EIA.
