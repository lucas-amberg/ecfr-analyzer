# ยง 550.298   How long will BOEM take to evaluate and make a decision on the CID?

(a) The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 150 calendar days of receiving your CID. If BOEM does not act within 150 calendar days, your CID is considered approved.


(b) BOEM may suspend the 150-calendar-day evaluation period if there is missing, inconclusive, or inaccurate data, or when a well reaches total depth during the evaluation period. BOEM may also suspend the evaluation period when a well penetrating a hydrocarbon-bearing structure reaches total depth during the evaluation period and the data from that well is needed for the CID. You will receive written notification from the Regional Supervisor describing the additional information that is needed, and the evaluation period will resume once BOEM receives the requested information.


(c) The Regional Supervisor will approve or deny your CID request based on your commitment to develop economically producible reservoirs according to sound conservation, engineering, and economic practices.
