# ยง 550.234   How do I submit a modified EP or resubmit a disapproved EP, and when will BOEM make a decision?

(a) *Modified EP.* If the Regional Supervisor requires you to modify your proposed EP under ยง 550.233(b)(2), you must submit the modification(s) to the Regional Supervisor in the same manner as for a new EP. You need submit only information related to the proposed modification(s).


(b) *Resubmitted EP.* If the Regional Supervisor disapproves your EP under ยง 550.233(b)(3), you may resubmit the disapproved EP if there is a change in the conditions that were the basis of its disapproval.


(c) *BOEM review and timeframe.* The Regional Supervisor will use the performance standards in ยง 550.202 to either approve, require you to further modify, or disapprove your modified or resubmitted EP. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 30 calendar days after the Regional Supervisor deems your modified or resubmitted EP to be submitted, or receives the last amendment to your modified or resubmitted EP, whichever occurs later.
