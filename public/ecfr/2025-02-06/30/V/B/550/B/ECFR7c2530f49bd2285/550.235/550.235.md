# ยง 550.235   If a State objects to the EP's coastal zone consistency certification, what can I do?

If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency certification accompanying your proposed EP within the timeframe prescribed in ยง 550.233(a) or ยง 550.234(c), you may do one of the following:


(a) *Amend your EP.* Amend your EP to accommodate the State's objection and submit the amendment to the Regional Supervisor for approval. The amendment needs to only address information related to the State's objection.


(b) *Appeal.* Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of Commerce using the procedures in 15 CFR part 930, subpart H. The Secretary of Commerce will either:


(1) Grant your appeal by finding, under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)), that each activity described in detail in your EP is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of National security; or


(2) Deny your appeal, in which case you may amend your EP as described in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Withdraw your EP.* Withdraw your EP if you decide not to conduct your proposed exploration activities.
