# ยง 550.1154   How do I determine if my reservoir is sensitive?

(a) You must determine whether each reservoir is sensitive. You must classify the reservoir as sensitive if:


(1) Under initial conditions it is an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap;


(2) At any time there are near-critical fluids; or


(3) The reservoir is undergoing enhanced recovery.


(b) For the purposes of this subpart, near-critical fluids are:


(1) Those fluids that occur in high temperature, high-pressure reservoirs where it is not possible to define the liquid-gas contact; or


(2) Fluids in reservoirs that are near bubble point or dew point conditions.


(c) The Regional Supervisor may reclassify a reservoir when available information warrants reclassification.


(d) If available information indicates that a reservoir previously classified as non-sensitive is now sensitive, you must submit a request to the Regional Supervisor to reclassify the reservoir. You must include supporting information, as listed in the table in ยง 550.1167, with your request.


(e) If information indicates that a reservoir previously classified as sensitive is now non-sensitive, you may submit a request to the Regional Supervisor to reclassify the reservoir. You must include supporting information, as listed in the table in ยง 550.1167, with your request.
