# § 550.1463   Does my request for a hearing on the record affect the penalties?

(a) If you do not correct the violations identified in the Notice of Noncompliance regarding violations without a period to correct, the penalties will continue to accrue even if you request a hearing on the record.


(b) You may ask the Hearings Division (Departmental) to stay the accrual of penalties pending the hearing on the record and a decision by the Administrative Law Judge under § 550.1472.


(1) You must file your petition within 45 calendar days after you receive the Notice of Noncompliance.


(2) To stay the accrual of penalties, you must post a bond or other surety instrument, or demonstrate financial solvency, using the standards and requirements as prescribed in §§ 550.1490 through 550.1497, for the principal amount of any unpaid amounts due that are the subject of the Notice of Noncompliance, including interest thereon, plus the amount of any penalties accrued before the date a stay becomes effective.


(3) The Hearings Division will grant or deny the petition under 43 CFR 4.21(b).
