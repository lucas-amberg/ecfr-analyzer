(1) An accurate and complete record of all geological (including geochemical) data and information describing each operation of analysis, processing, and interpretation;

(3) Copies of well logs or charts in a digital format, if available;


(4) Results and data obtained from formation fluid tests;


(5) Analyses of core or bottom samples and/or a representative cut or split of the core or bottom sample;

(d) *Obligations when geological data and information collected under permit are obtained by a third party.* A third party may obtain geological data and information from a permittee, or from another third party, by sale, trade, license agreement, or other means. If this happens:


(1) The third party recipient of the data and information assumes the obligations under this section, except for the notification provisions of paragraph (a)(1), and is subject to the penalty provisions of 30 CFR part 550, subpart N; and


(2) A permittee or third party that sells, trades, licenses, or otherwise provides data and information to a third party must advise the recipient, in writing, that accepting these obligations is a condition precedent of the sale, trade, license, or other agreement; and


(3) Except for license agreements, a permittee or third party that sells, trades, or otherwise provides data and information to a third party must advise the Regional Director, in writing and within 30 days, of the sale, trade, or other agreement, including the identity of the recipient of the data and information; or
