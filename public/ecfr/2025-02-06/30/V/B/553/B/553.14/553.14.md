# § 553.14   How do I determine the worst case oil-spill discharge volume?

(a) To calculate the amount of OSFR you must demonstrate for a facility under § 553.13(b), you must use the worst case oil-spill discharge volume that you determined under whichever of the following regulations applies:


(1) 30 CFR part 254—Response Plans for Facilities Located Seaward of the Coast Line, except that the volume of the worst case oil-spill discharge for a well must be four times the uncontrolled flow volume that you estimate for the first 24 hours.


(2) 40 CFR part 112—Oil Pollution Prevention; or


(3) 49 CFR part 194—Response Plans for Onshore Oil Pipelines.


(b) If you are a designated applicant and you choose to demonstrate $150 million in OSFR, you are not required to determine any worst case oil-spill discharge volumes, since that is the maximum amount of OSFR required under this part.
