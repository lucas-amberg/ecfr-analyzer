# ยง 553.26   What information must I submit to support my unencumbered assets demonstration?

You must support your unencumbered assets evaluation with the information required by ยง 553.23(a) and a list of reserved, unencumbered, and unimpaired U.S. assets whose value will not be affected by an oil discharge from a COF. The assets must be plant, property, or equipment held for use. You must submit a letter signed by your treasurer:


(a) Identifying which assets are reserved;


(b) Certifying that the assets are unencumbered, including contingent encumbrances;


(c) Promising that the identified assets will not be sold, subjected to a security interest, or otherwise encumbered throughout the specified fiscal year; and


(d) Specifying:


(1) The State or the country of incorporation;


(2) The total amount of the stockholders'/owners' equity listed on the balance sheet;


(3) The identification and location of the reserved U.S. assets; and


(4) The value of the reserved U.S. assets less accumulated depreciation and amortization, using the same valuation method used in your audited annual financial statement and expressed in U.S. dollars. The net value of the reserved assets must be at least two times the self-insurance amount requested for demonstration.
