# § 556.403   Under what circumstances may I be disqualified from acquiring a lease or an interest in a lease on the OCS?

You may be disqualified from acquiring a lease or an interest in a lease on the OCS if:


(a) You or your principals are excluded or disqualified from participating in a transaction covered by Federal non-procurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR parts 180 and 1400), unless the Department explicitly approves an exception for a transaction pursuant to the regulations in those parts;


(b) The Secretary finds, after notice and hearing, that you or your principals (including in the meaning of “you,” for purposes of this subparagraph, a bidder or prospective bidder) fail to meet due diligence requirements or to exercise due diligence under section 8(d) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1337(d)) on any OCS lease; or


(c) BOEM disqualifies you from acquiring a lease or an interest in a lease on the OCS based on your unacceptable operating performance. BOEM will give you adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing before imposing a disqualification, unless BSEE has already provided such notice and opportunity for a hearing.
