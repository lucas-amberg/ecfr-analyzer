# ยง 556.404   What do the non-procurement debarment rules require that I do?

You must comply with the Department's non-procurement debarment regulations at 2 CFR parts 180 and 1400.


(a) You must notify BOEM if you know that you or your principals are excluded, disqualified, have been convicted or are indicted of a crime as described in 2 CFR part 180, subpart C. You must make this notification before you sign a lease, sublease, or an assignment of record title interest or operating rights interest, or become a lease or unit operator. This paragraph does not apply if you have previously provided a statement disclosing this information, and you have received an exception from the Department, as described in 2 CFR 180.135 and 2 CFR 1400.137.


(b) If you wish to enter into a covered transaction with another person at a lower tier, as described in 2 CFR 180.200, you must first:


(1) Verify that the person is not excluded or disqualified under 2 CFR part 180; and


(2) Require the person to:


(i) Comply with 2 CFR part 180, subpart C; and


(ii) Include the obligation to comply with 2 CFR part 180, subpart C in its contracts and other transactions.


(c) After you enter into a covered transaction, you must immediately notify BOEM in writing if you learn that:


(1) You failed to disclose pertinent information earlier; or


(2) Due to changed circumstances, you or your principals now meet any of the criteria in 2 CFR 180.800.
