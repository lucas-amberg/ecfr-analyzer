# ยง 556.701   How do I seek approval of an assignment of the record title interest in my lease, or a severance of operating rights from that record title interest?

(a) The Regional Director will provide the form to record an assignment of record title interest in a Federal OCS oil and gas or sulfur lease, or a severance of operating rights from that record title interest. You must submit to BOEM two originals of each instrument that transfers ownership of record title within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument. You must pay the service fee listed in ยง 556.106 with your request and your submission must include evidence of payment via *pay.gov.*

(b) Before BOEM approves an assignment or transfer, it must consult with, and consider the views of, the Attorney General. The Secretary may act on an assignment or transfer if the Attorney General has not responded to a request for consultation within 30 days of said request.


(c) A new record title owner or sublessee must file a designation of operator, in accordance with ยง 550.143 of this chapter, along with the request for the approval of the assignment.
