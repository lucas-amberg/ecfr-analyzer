# ยง 556.703   What is the effect of the approval of the assignment of 100 percent of the record title in a particular aliquot(s) of my lease and of the resulting lease segregation?

(a) The financial assurance requirements of subpart I of this part apply separately to each segregated lease.


(b) The royalty, minimum royalty, and rental provisions of the original lease will apply separately to each segregated lease.


(c) BOEM will allocate among the segregated leases, on a basis that is equitable under the circumstances, any remaining unused royalty suspension volume or other form of royalty suspension or royalty relief that had been granted to the original lease, not to exceed in aggregate the total remaining amount.


(d) Each segregated lease will continue in full force and effect for the primary term of the original lease and so long thereafter as each segregated lease meets the requirements outlined in ยง 556.601. A segregated lease that does not meet the requirements of ยง 556.601 does not continue in force even if another segregated lease, which was part of the original lease, continues to meet those requirements.
