# ยง 556.711   What is the effect of a record title holder's sublease of operating rights on the record title holder's liability?

(a) A record title holder who subleases operating rights remains liable for all obligations of the lease, including those obligations accruing after BOEM's approval of the sublease, subject to ยง 556.604(e) and (f).


(b) Neither the sublease of operating rights, nor subsequent assignment of those rights by the original sublessee, nor by any subsequent assignee of the operating rights, alters in any manner the liability of the record title holder for nonmonetary obligations.


(c) Upon approval of the sublease of the operating rights, the sublessee and subsequent assignees of the operating rights become primarily liable for monetary obligations, but the record title holder remains secondarily liable for them, as prescribed in 30 U.S.C. 1712(a) and ยง 556.604(f)(2).
