# ยง 556.716   What must I do with respect to the designation of operator on a lease when a transfer of record title is submitted?

(a) If a transfer of ownership of the record title interest only changes the percentage ownership of the record title, no new parties or new aliquots are involved in the transaction, and no change of designated operator is made, you will not need to submit a new designation of operator form.


(b) In all cases other than that in paragraph (a) of this section, you must submit new designation of operator forms in accordance with ยง 550.143 of this chapter. In the event that you are transferring multiple record title interests, you must comply with this requirement for each interest that does not fall within paragraph (a) of this section.
