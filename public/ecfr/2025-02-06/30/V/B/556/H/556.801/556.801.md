# ยง 556.801   How do I seek approval of an assignment of my operating rights?

(a) The Regional Director will provide the form to document the assignment of an operating rights interest. You must request approval of each assignment of operating rights and submit to BOEM two originals of each instrument that transfers ownership of operating rights within 90 days after the last party executes the transfer instrument. You must pay the service fee listed in ยง 556.106 with your request and your submission must include evidence of payment via *pay.gov.*

(b) A new operating rights owner must file a designation of operator, in accordance with ยง 550.143, along with the request for the approval of the assignment.


(c) If an operating rights owner assigns an undivided ownership interest in its operating rights, that assignment creates a joint ownership in the operating rights.


(d) Before BOEM approves a sublease or re-assignment of operating rights, BOEM may consult with and consider the views of the Attorney General.
