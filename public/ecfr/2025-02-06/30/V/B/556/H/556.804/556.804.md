# ยง 556.804   What if I want to assign my operating rights interest in a lease to multiple parties?

You may assign your operating rights interest in one lease to multiple parties using the same instrument. That instrument must be submitted in duplicate originals, accompanied by a cover letter executed by one of the parties to the transfer (or an authorized agent thereof). In such a multiple transfer of interests using a single instrument, a separate fee applies to each individual transfer of interest and evidence of payment via *pay.gov* must accompany the instrument.
