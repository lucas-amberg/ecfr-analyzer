# § 556.901   Base and supplemental financial assurance.

(a) You must provide the following financial assurance before commencing any lease exploration activities.


(1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director $200,000 in lease exploration financial assurance that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by the earliest of:


(ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $200,000 lease exploration bond after you submit an EP, but before approval of drilling activities under the EP.


(iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph (a) by providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.


(2) A $200,000 lease exploration bond pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section need not be submitted and maintained if the lessee either:


(i) Furnishes and maintains an areawide bond in the sum of $1 million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulfur leases held by the lessee on the OCS for the area in which the lease is situated; or


(ii) Furnishes and maintains a bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(b) This paragraph (b) explains what financial assurance you must provide before lease development and production activities commence.


(1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director $500,000 in lease development financial assurance that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by the earliest of:


(A) The date you submit a proposed development and production plan (DPP) or development operations coordination document (DOCD) for approval; or


(B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of a lease on which a DPP or DOCD has been approved.


(ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $500,000 lease development bond after you submit a DPP or DOCD, but before he/she approves the installation of a platform or the commencement of drilling activities under the DPP or DOCD.


(iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph by providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.


(2) You need not submit and maintain a $500,000 lease development bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section if you furnish and maintain an areawide bond in the sum of $3 million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulfur leases you hold on the OCS for the area in which the lease is located.




(c) If you can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that you can satisfy your decommissioning and other lease obligations for less than the amount of financial assurance required under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Director may accept financial assurance in an amount less than the prescribed amount but not less than the amount of the cost for decommissioning.


(d) The Regional Director may determine that supplemental financial assurance (*i.e.,* financial assurance above the amounts prescribed in §§ 550.166(a) and 550.1011(a) of this subchapter, § 556.900(a), or paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) is required to ensure compliance with your lease obligations, including decommissioning obligations; the regulations in this chapter; and the regulations in chapters II and XII of this title. The Regional Director may require you to provide supplemental financial assurance if you do not meet at least one of the following criteria:


(1) You have an investment grade credit rating. If any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as that term is defined in section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provides a credit rating for you that differs from that of any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization, BOEM will apply the highest rating for purposes of determining your financial assurance requirements.


(2) You have a proxy credit rating determined by the Regional Director that they determine reflects creditworthiness equivalent to an investment grade credit rating, which must be based on audited financial information for the most recent fiscal year (which must include an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and the auditor's certificate).


(i) The audited financial information for your most recent fiscal year must cover a continuous twelve-month period within the twenty-four-month period prior to your receipt of the Regional Director's determination that you must provide supplemental financial assurance.


(ii) In determining your proxy credit rating, the Regional Director may include the total value of the offshore decommissioning liabilities associated with any lease(s) or grants in which you have an ownership interest. Upon the request of the Regional Director, you must provide the information that the Regional Director determines is necessary to properly evaluate the total value of your offshore decommissioning liabilities, including joint ownership interests and liabilities associated with your OCS leases and grants.


(3) Your co-lessee or co-grant holder has an issuer credit rating or proxy credit rating that meets the criterion set forth in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. However, the presence of such co-lessee or co-grant holder will allow the Regional Director to not require financial assurance from you only to the extent that you and that co-lessee or co-grant holder share accrued liabilities, and the Regional Director may require you to provide supplemental financial assurance for decommissioning obligations for which such co-lessee or co-grant holder is not liable.


(4) There are proved oil and gas reserves on the lease, unit, or field, as defined by the SEC Regulation S-X at 17 CFR 210.4-10 and SEC Regulation S-K at 17 CFR 229.1200, the discounted value of which exceeds three times the estimated undiscounted cost of the decommissioning associated with the production of those reserves, and that value must be based on proved reserve reports submitted to the Regional Director and reported on a per-lease, unit, or field basis. BOEM will determine the decommissioning costs associated with the production of your reserves, and will use the following undiscounted decommissioning cost estimates:


(i) Where BSEE-generated probabilistic estimates are available, BOEM will use the estimate at the level at which there is a 70 percent probability that the actual cost of decommissioning will be less than the estimate (P70).


(ii) If there is no BSEE probabilistic estimate available, BOEM will use the BSEE-generated deterministic estimate.


(e) You may satisfy the Regional Director's demand for supplemental financial assurance by increasing the amount of your existing financial assurance or providing additional surety bonds or other types of acceptable financial assurance.


(f) The Regional Director will use the BSEE P70 decommissioning probabilistic estimate to determine the amount of supplemental financial assurance required to guarantee compliance when there is no lessee or co-lessee that meets the criterion in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. In making this determination, the Regional Director will also consider your potential underpayment of royalty and cumulative decommissioning obligations. Note that BOEM will use these P-values only in the context of determining how much financial assurance is required, and not in the context of bond forfeiture. Regardless of whether you are required to provide supplemental financial assurance at the P70 level, you remain liable for the full costs of decommissioning, and your surety remains liable for the full amount of decommissioning up to the limit of assurance provided.






(g) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities either increase or decrease, the Regional Director may adjust the amount of supplemental financial assurance required.


(1) If the Regional Director proposes an adjustment, the Regional Director will:


(i) Notify you and your financial assurance provider of any proposed adjustment to the amount of financial assurance required; and


(ii) Give you an opportunity to submit written or oral comment on the adjustment.


(2) If you request a reduction of the amount of supplemental financial assurance required, or oppose the amount of a proposed adjustment, you must submit evidence to the Regional Director demonstrating that the projected amount of royalties due to the United States Government and the estimated costs of decommissioning are less than the required financial assurance amount. Upon review of your submission, the Regional Director may reduce the amount of financial assurance required.


(h) During the first 3 years from June 24, 2024, you may, upon receipt of a demand letter for supplemental financial assurance under this section, request that the Regional Director allow you to provide, in three equal installments payable according to the schedule provided under this paragraph (h), the full amount of supplemental financial assurance required.


(1) If the Regional Director allows you to provide the amount required on such a phased basis, you must comply with the following:


(i) You must provide the initial one-third of the total supplemental financial assurance required within the timeframe specified in the demand letter or, if no timeframe is specified, within 60 calendar days of the date of receipt of the demand letter.


(ii) You must provide the second one-third of the required supplemental financial assurance to BOEM within 24 months of the date of receipt of the demand letter.


(iii) You must provide the final one-third of the required supplemental financial assurance to BOEM within 36 months of the date of receipt of the demand letter.


(2) If the Regional Director allows you to meet your supplemental financial assurance requirement in a phased manner, as set forth in this section, and you fail to timely provide the required supplemental financial assurance to BOEM, the Regional Director will notify you of such failure. You will no longer be eligible to meet your supplemental financial assurance requirement in the manner prescribed in this paragraph (h), and the remaining amount due will become due 10 calendar days after such notification is received.
