# ยง 560.103   What is BOEM's authority to collect information?

(a) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires us to inform you that we may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collection under 30 CFR part 560 is either exempt from the PRA (5 CFR 1320.4(a)(2), (c)) or refers to requirements covered under 30 CFR parts 203 and 556.


(b) You may send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.
