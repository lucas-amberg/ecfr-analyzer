# § 560.220   How does royalty suspension apply to leases issued in a sale held after November 2000?

We may issue leases with suspension of royalties for a period, volume or value of production, as authorized in section 303 of the Act. For purposes of this section and §§ 560.121 through 560.124:


(a) Any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing under the lease or the regulations (e.g., fuel gas) do not count against royalty suspension volumes; and


(b) Production includes volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement.
