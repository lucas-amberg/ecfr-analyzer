# ยง 560.221   When does a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000 get a royalty suspension?

(a) We will specify any royalty suspension for your RS lease in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the _Federal Register_ for the sale in which you acquire the RS lease and will repeat it in the lease document. In addition:


(1) Your RS lease may produce royalty-free the royalty suspension we specify for your lease, even if the field to which we assign it is producing.


(2) The royalty suspension we specify in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale for your lease does not apply to any other leases in the field to which we assign your RS lease.


(b) You may apply for a supplemental royalty suspension for a project under 30 CFR part 203, if your lease is located:


(1) In the Gulf of Mexico, in water 200 meters or deeper, and wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; or


(2) Offshore of Alaska.


(c) Your RS lease retains the royalty suspension with which we issued it even if we deny your application for more relief.
