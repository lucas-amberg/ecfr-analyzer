# ยง 560.223   How do I measure natural gas production for a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000?

You must measure natural gas production subject to the royalty suspension volume for your lease as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured according to 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.
