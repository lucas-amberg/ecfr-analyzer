# ยง 580.11   What must I do before I may conduct scientific research?

You may conduct G&G scientific research activities related to hard minerals on the OCS only after you obtain a BOEM-approved permit or file a notice.


(a) *Permit.* You must obtain a permit if the research activities you want to conduct involve:


(1) Using solid or liquid explosives;


(2) Drilling a deep stratigraphic test; or


(3) Developing data and information for proprietary use or sale.


(b) *Notice.* If you conduct research activities (including federally funded research) not covered by paragraph (a) of this section, you must file a notice with the regional director at least 30 days before you begin. If you cannot file a 30-day notice, you must provide oral notification before you begin and follow up in writing. You must also inform BOEM in writing when you conclude your work.
