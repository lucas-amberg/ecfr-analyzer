# ยง 580.23   How must I cooperate with inspection activities?

(a) You must allow our representatives to inspect your G&G prospecting or any scientific research activities that are being conducted under a permit. They will determine whether operations are adversely affecting the environment, aquatic life, archaeological resources, or other uses of the area.


(b) BOEM will reimburse you for food, quarters, and transportation that you provide for our representatives if you send in your reimbursement request to the region that issued the permit within 90 days of the inspection.
