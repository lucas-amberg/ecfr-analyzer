(b) Paleontological reports identifying by depth any microscopic fossils collected, including the reference datum to which paleontological sample depths are related and, if the Regional Director requests, washed samples, that you maintain for paleontological determinations;


(c) Copies of well logs or charts in a digital format, if available;


(d) Results and data obtained from formation fluid tests;


(e) Analyses of core or bottom samples and/or a representative cut or split of the core or bottom sample;
