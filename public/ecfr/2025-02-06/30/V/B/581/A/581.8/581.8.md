(7) Sand and gravel deposits which are identified in the leasing notice as being reserved; and


(8) Source materials essential to production of fissionable materials which are reserved pursuant to section 12(a) of the Act.


(b) When an OCS mineral lease issued under this part limits the minerals to which rights are granted, such lease shall include rights to minerals produced in direct association with the OCS mineral specified in the lease but not the rights to minerals specifically reserved.
