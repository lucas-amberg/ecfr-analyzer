(d) The Secretary may cancel a lease in accordance with the following:


(1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines after a hearing that:

(ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and


(iii) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of continuing such lease in force;


(2) Cancellation shall not occur unless and until operations under such lease shall have been under suspension or temporary prohibition by the Secretary, with due extension of any lease term continuously for a period of 5 years, or for a lesser period upon request of the lessee; and


(3) Cancellation shall entitle the lessee to receive such compensation as is shown to the Secretary as being equal to the lesser of:


(i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the lease and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all applicable regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs or damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the lease, or


(ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease (plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or parties and be issued the lease in question.


(iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:


(A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to section (5)(d) of the Act;


(B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because of the lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of applicable Federal Law; or
