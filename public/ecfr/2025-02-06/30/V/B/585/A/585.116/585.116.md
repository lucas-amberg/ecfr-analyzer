# ยง 585.116   Requests for information.

BOEM may publish a request for information (RFI) in the _Federal Register_ for the following reasons:


(a) To solicit information from industry, federally recognized Tribes, State and local agencies, and other interested entities for evaluating the offshore renewable energy industry, including the identification of potential challenges or obstacles to its continued development. An RFI may relate to the identification of environmental, technical, regulatory, or economic matters that promote or detract from continued development of renewable energy technologies on the OCS. BOEM may use the information received to refine its renewable energy program, including to facilitate OCS renewable energy development in a safe and environmentally responsible manner and to ensure a fair return to the United States for use of the OCS.


(b) To assess interest in leasing all or part of the OCS for activities authorized in this part.


(c) To determine whether there is competitive interest in a specific OCS renewable energy proposal received by BOEM, such as an unsolicited request for a lease under ยง 585.231(b) or a RUE or ROW grant under ยง 585.307(a).


(d) To seek other information that BOEM needs for this program.
