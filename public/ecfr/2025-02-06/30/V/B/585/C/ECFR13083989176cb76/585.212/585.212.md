# ยง 585.212   What is area identification?

(a) Area identification is the process by which BOEM delineates one or more OCS areas for leasing consideration and environmental analysis if the areas appear appropriate for renewable energy development. This process is based on an area's relevant attributes, such as other uses of the area, environmental factors or characteristics, stakeholder comments, industry nominations, feasibility for development, and other relevant information. BOEM consults with interested parties during this process as specified in ยง 585.210(b)(2).


(b) BOEM may consider areas nominated by respondents to a Call and other areas determined appropriate for leasing.


(c) For the identified areas, BOEM will evaluate:


(1) The potential effects of leasing the identified areas on the human, marine, and coastal environments;


(2) The feasibility of development; and


(3) Potential measures, including lease stipulations, to mitigate potential adverse impacts. Such measures are identified and refined through the area identification process, as well as through environmental review and consultations and published for comment in the Proposed Sale Notice.


(d) BOEM may hold public hearings on the environmental analyses associated with leasing the identified areas, after appropriate notice.


(e) At the end of the area identification, BOEM may offer selected areas for leasing.
