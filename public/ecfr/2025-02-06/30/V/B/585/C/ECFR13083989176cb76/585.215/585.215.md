# § 585.215   What may BOEM do to assess whether competitive interest for a lease area still exists before the auction?

(a) At any time BOEM has reason to believe that competitive interest in any lease area no longer exists before the area's auction, BOEM may issue a notice in the _Federal Register,_ as described in § 585.116, requesting information regarding competitive interest in that area. BOEM will consider respondents' comments to determine whether competitive interest in that area remains. BOEM may decide to end the competitive process for any area if it determines that competitive interest no longer exists.


(b) If BOEM determines after considering respondents' comments to such a notice that competitive interest remains, BOEM will continue with the competitive process set forth in §§ 585.210 through 585.226.


(c) If BOEM determines at any time before the auction that only a single party remains interested in a lease area, BOEM may proceed either with the auction or with the noncompetitive process set forth in § 585.231(d) through (j) following payment by that party of the acquisition fee specified in § 585.502(a).
