# § 585.231   Will BOEM issue leases noncompetitively?

(a) BOEM will consider unsolicited requests for a lease on a case-by-case basis and may issue a lease noncompetitively in accordance with this part. BOEM will issue a lease noncompetitively only if it has determined after public notice that no competitive interest exists. BOEM will not consider an unsolicited request for a lease under this part that is proposed in a lease area that is scheduled for a lease auction under this part.


(b) At BOEM's discretion, BOEM may issue an RFI under § 585.116 relating to your unsolicited lease request and will consider comments received to determine if competitive interest exists. If BOEM decides not to issue an RFI and, therefore, not to continue processing your unsolicited lease request, it will refund your acquisition fee.


(c) If BOEM determines that competitive interest exists in the lease area:


(1) BOEM will proceed with the competitive process set forth in §§ 585.210 through 585.226;


(2) If you submit a bid for the lease area in a competitive lease sale, your acquisition fee will be applied to the deposit for your bonus bid; and


(3) If you do not submit a bid for the lease area in a competitive lease sale, BOEM will not refund your acquisition fee.


(d) If BOEM determines that there is no competitive interest in a lease and that further investigation of the area is in the public interest, it will:


(1) Publish in the _Federal Register_ a determination of no competitive interest.


(2) Prepare and provide you with a written estimate of the proposed fee to pay for the processing costs under § 585.112, including any environmental review that BOEM may require before lease issuance.


(3) Conduct environmental reviews required by Federal law and consult with affected Federal agencies, federally recognized Indian Tribes, and State and local governments.


(e) The following deadlines apply after issuance of a determination of no competitive interest:


(1) Within 90 calendar days of receiving the written estimate of the fee, or longer (as determined at BOEM's discretion), you must pay the fee for any environmental review under § 585.112. Failure to pay the required fee may result in withdrawal of the determination of no competitive interest.


(2) A determination of no competitive interest expires two years after its publication, unless BOEM determines that it should be extended for good cause. BOEM reserves the right to withdraw a determination of no competitive interest before it expires if BOEM determines that you have failed to exercise due diligence in obtaining a lease.


(f) After BOEM publishes the determination of no competitive interest, you will be responsible for submitting any consistency certification and necessary data and information in a timely manner to the applicable State CZMA agencies and BOEM pursuant to 15 CFR part 930, subpart D.


(g) After completing its review of your lease request, BOEM may offer you a noncompetitive lease.


(h) If you accept the terms and conditions of the lease, BOEM will issue the lease. You must comply with the terms and conditions of your lease and the applicable provisions of this part. If BOEM issues you a lease, BOEM will send you an electronic copy of the lease form.


(1) Within 10 business days after you receive the lease you must:


(i) Execute and return the lease; and


(ii) File financial assurance as required under §§ 585.516 through 585.529.


(2) You must pay the first 12 months' rent no later than 45 calendar days after you receive your copy of the executed lease from BOEM under § 585.503(a)(1).


(i) BOEM will publish in the _Federal Register_ a notice announcing the issuance of your lease.


(j) If you do not accept the terms and conditions in a timely manner, BOEM will not issue a lease. Additionally, if you do not comply with the requirements for financial assurance, BOEM may decide not to issue a lease. If BOEM does not issue a lease due to your noncompliance or non-acceptance, BOEM will not refund your acquisition fee, or any fees paid under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
