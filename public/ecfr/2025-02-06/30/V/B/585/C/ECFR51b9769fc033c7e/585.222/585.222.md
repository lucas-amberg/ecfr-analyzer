# § 585.222   What other auction rules must bidders follow?

(a) Bidders must submit a deposit to participate in an auction under § 585.501(a), unless otherwise specified in the FSN. A provisional winner's bid deposit will be credited toward the balance due on its bid.


(b) Only bidders qualified by BOEM under §§ 585.107 and 585.108 are permitted to bid during an auction.


(c) Only an authorized agent may act on a bidder's behalf during an auction. Bidders must submit the names of their authorized agents to BOEM before the auction, as prescribed in the FSN.


(d) Each bidder must follow the auction process specified in the FSN and may not take any action to disrupt or alter the process beyond its intended function.


(e) A bidder is responsible for immediately contacting BOEM if it is unable to submit its bid for any reason during an auction. If a bidder fails to timely notify BOEM of its inability to bid, it may not dispute the auction or lease award on that basis. If a bidder timely notifies BOEM of its inability to submit a bid, BOEM, in its discretion, may suspend the auction, continue the auction using an alternative method, or continue the auction without the participation of the affected bidder.
