# ยง 585.303   How long will my ROW grant or RUE grant remain in effect?

The periods within the term of your grant are defined as follows:


(a) Each ROW or RUE grant has a preliminary period of 12 months from the effective date of the ROW or RUE grant within which to submit a GAP. The preliminary period begins on the effective date of the grant. You must submit a GAP no later than the end of the preliminary period for your grant to remain in effect. However, you may submit a GAP before the issuance of your ROW or RUE grant.


(b) Each ROW or RUE grant has an operations period as set by BOEM (if the grant is issued competitively) or negotiated with the applicant (if the grant is issued noncompetitively). In either case, the duration of the operations period will depend on the intended use of the grant. The operations period begins on the date that we approve your GAP.


(c) You may request an extension of any of the grant periods outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for good cause. In its discretion, BOEM may approve your request.
