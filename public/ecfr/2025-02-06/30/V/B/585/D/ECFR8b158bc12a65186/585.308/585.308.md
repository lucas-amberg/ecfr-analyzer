# § 585.308   How will BOEM conduct an auction for ROW grants and RUE grants?

(a) If BOEM determines that there is competitive interest, we will:


(1) Publish a notice of each grant auction in the _Federal Register_ describing auction procedures, allowing interested persons 30 days to comment; and


(2) Conduct a competitive auction for issuing the ROW grant or RUE grant. The auction process for ROW grants and RUE grants will be conducted following the same process for leases set forth in §§ 585.210 through 585.226.


(b) If you are the successful bidder in an auction, you must pay the first year's rent, as provided in § 585.316.
