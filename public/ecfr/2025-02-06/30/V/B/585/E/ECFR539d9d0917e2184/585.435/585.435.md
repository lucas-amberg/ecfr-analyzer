# ยง 585.435   How can I relinquish a lease or a grant or parts of a lease or grant?

(a) You may surrender a lease or grant, or a designated subdivision thereof, by filing with BOEM a properly completed official relinquishment form available on the BOEM website. A relinquishment takes effect on the date BOEM receives your completed form, subject to the continued obligation of the lessee or grant holder and the surety to:


(1) Make all payments due on the lease or grant, including any accrued rent and deferred bonuses;


(2) Decommission all facilities on the relinquished lease or grant (or portion thereof) to BSEE's satisfaction; and


(3) Perform any other outstanding obligations under the lease or grant.


(b) After you submit a completed relinquishment form for a lease or grant, ONRR will bill you for any outstanding payments that have accrued from obligations arising under the relinquished lease or grant.
