You may request renewal of the operations period of your lease or the original authorized period of your grant. BOEM, at its discretion, may approve a renewal request to conduct substantially similar activities as were originally authorized under the lease or grant. BOEM will not approve a renewal request that involves development of a type of renewable energy not originally authorized in the lease or grant. BOEM may revise or adjust payment terms of the original lease, as a condition of lease renewal.
