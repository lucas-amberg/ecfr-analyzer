# ยง 585.420   What effect does a suspension order have on my payments?

(a) While BOEM evaluates your request for a suspension under ยง 585.416, you must continue to fulfill your payment obligation until the end of the original term of your lease or grant. If our evaluation goes beyond the end of the original term of your lease or grant, the term of your lease or grant will be extended for the period of time necessary for BOEM to complete its evaluation of your request, but you will not be required to make payments during the time of the extension.


(b) If BOEM approves your request for a suspension under ยง 585.416, or orders a suspension under ยง 585.417, BOEM may waive or defer your payment obligations during the suspension. BOEM's decision to waive or defer payments will depend on the reasons for the suspension, including your responsibility for the circumstances necessitating a suspension.
