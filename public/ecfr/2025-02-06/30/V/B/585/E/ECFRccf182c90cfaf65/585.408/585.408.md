# ยง 585.408   May I assign my lease or grant interest?

(a) You may assign all or part of your lease or grant interest, including record title, to one or more parties, subject to BOEM approval under this subpart. Each instrument that creates or transfers an interest must describe the entire tract or describe by officially designated subdivisions the interest you propose to create or transfer. Your application to assign a lease or grant may include a request to modify the existing lease or grant period schedule consistent with ยง 585.235(d).


(b) If you submit an application to assign a lease or grant, you will continue to be responsible for payments that are or become due on the lease or grant until the date BOEM approves the assignment.


(c) The assignment takes effect on the first day of the month following the date on which BOEM approves your request, unless you request an earlier effective date and BOEM approves that earlier date, but such earlier effective date, if prior to the date of BOEM's approval, does not relieve you of your obligations accrued between that earlier effective date and the date of approval.


(d) You do not need to request an assignment for business mergers, name changes, or changes of business form. You must notify BOEM of these events under ยง 585.110.
