# ยง 585.525   What general requirements must a financial assurance instrument meet?

(a) Any bond or other acceptable financial assurance instrument that you provide must:


(1) Be payable to BOEM upon demand; and


(2) Guarantee compliance of all lessees, grant holders, operators, and payors with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant, any subsequent approvals and authorizations, and all applicable regulations.


(b) All bonds and other forms of financial assurance must be on or in a form approved by BOEM. You may submit this on an approved form that you have reproduced or generated by use of a computer. If the document you submit omits any terms and conditions that are included on the BOEM-approved form, your bond is deemed to contain the omitted terms and conditions.


(c) Surety bonds must be issued by an approved surety listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, as required by 31 CFR 223.16. You may obtain a copy of Circular 570 from the Treasury website at *https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/surety-bonds/circular-570.html*.


(d) Your surety bond cannot exceed the underwriting limit listed in the current Treasury Circular 570, except as permitted therein.


(e) You and a qualified surety must execute your bond. When the surety is a corporation, an authorized corporate officer must sign the bond and attest to it over the corporate seal.


(f) You may not terminate the period of liability of your bond or cancel your bond, except as provided in this subpart. Bonds must continue in full force and effect even though an event has occurred that could diminish or terminate a surety's obligation under State law.


(g) Your surety must notify you and BOEM within 5 business days after:


(1) It initiates any judicial or administrative proceeding alleging its insolvency or bankruptcy; or


(2) The Treasury decertifies the surety.
