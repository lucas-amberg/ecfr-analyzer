# § 585.526   What instruments other than a surety bond may I use to meet the financial assurance requirement?

(a) You may use other types of security instruments, if BOEM determines that such security protects BOEM to the same extent as the surety bond. BOEM will consider pledges of the following:


(1) U.S. Department of Treasury securities identified in 31 CFR part 225;


(2) A pledge of cash, in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the financial assurance, to be deposited and maintained in a Federal depository account of the U.S. Treasury;


(3) Certificates of deposit or savings accounts in a bank or financial institution organized or authorized to transact business in the United States with:


(i) Minimum net assets of $500,000,000; and


(ii) Minimum *Bankrate.com* Safe & Sound rating of 3 Stars, and Capitalization, Assets, Equity and Liquidity (CAEL) rating of 3 or less;


(4) Negotiable U.S. Government, State, and municipal securities or bonds having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of BOEM;


(5) Investment-grade rated securities having a Standard and Poor's rating of AAA or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized securities rating service having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of BOEM;


(6) Insurance, if its form and function is such that the funding or enforceable pledges of funding are used to guarantee performance of regulatory obligations in the event of default on such obligations by the lessee. Insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “superior” or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized insurance rating service;


(7) Letters of credit, subject to the following conditions:


(i) The letter of credit provider must have an issuer credit rating from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) greater than or equal to investment grade from either Standard & Poor's Ratings Service or Moody's Investor Service, or a proxy credit rating determined by BOEM based on audited financial information (including an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and the auditor's certificate) greater than or equal to investment grade from either Standard & Poor's Ratings Service or Moody's Investor Service;


(ii) The letter of credit must grant BOEM full authority to demand immediate payment in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions of a lease or regulatory obligations;


(iii) The letter of credit must be irrevocable during its term and will be subject to collection by BOEM if not replaced by another letter of credit or other form of financial assurance at least 30 calendar days before its expiration date;


(iv) The expiration date of the letter of credit must not be less than 90 days following the date it becomes effective;


(v) The letter of credit must contain a provision for automatic renewal for periods of not less than 1 year in the absence of notice of cancellation to BOEM at least 90 calendar days before the expiration date; and


(vi) The letter of credit must contain a venue provision, which requires any disputes to be adjudicated in a U.S. Federal court that is mutually agreed upon by BOEM and the issuers of the letter of credit;


(8) Another form of security approved by BOEM in its discretion; or


(9) A combination of security instruments described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.


(b) If you use a Treasury security:


(1) You must post 115 percent of your financial assurance amount;


(2) You must monitor the collateral value of your security. If the collateral value of your security as determined in accordance with 31 CFR part 203, Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at *https://www.treasurydirect.gov*), falls below the required level of coverage, you must pledge additional security to provide 115 percent of the required amount; and


(3) You must include with your pledge authority for us to sell the security and use the proceeds if we determine that you have failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions of your lease or grant, any subsequent approval or authorization, or applicable regulations.


(c) If you use the instruments described in paragraph (a)(4) or (5) of this section, you must provide BOEM by the end of each calendar year a certified statement describing the nature and market value of the instruments maintained in that account, and including any current statements or reports furnished by the brokerage firm to the lessee concerning the asset value of the account.
