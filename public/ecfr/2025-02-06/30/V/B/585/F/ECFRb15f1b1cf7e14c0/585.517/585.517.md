(a) BOEM determines the amount of your supplemental financial assurance based on the estimated costs to meet all accrued lease obligations, including:


(1) The projected amount of annual rent and other payments due to the United States over the next 12 months, to the extent that amount is not covered in the initial financial assurance provided in ยง 585.516(a)(1);


(2) Any past due rent and other payments;


(3) Other monetary obligations; and


(4) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning, as required by 30 CFR part 285, subpart I.


(b) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities increase or decrease, we may adjust the amount of the supplemental financial assurance.


(1) If we propose adjusting your financial assurance amount, we will notify you of the proposed adjustment and give you an opportunity to comment; and


(2) We may approve a reduced financial assurance amount if you request it and if the reduced amount that you request is sufficient to cover your obligations and liabilities calculated under paragraph (a) of this section.
