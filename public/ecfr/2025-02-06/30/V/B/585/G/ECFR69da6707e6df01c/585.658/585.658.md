# ยง 585.658   Can my cable or pipeline construction deviate from my approved COP or GAP?

(a) You must make every effort to ensure that all cables and pipelines are constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the approved plan under your lease or grant.


(b) If BOEM determines that a significant change in conditions has occurred that would necessitate an adjustment to your ROW, RUE, or lease before the commencement of construction of the cable or pipeline on the grant or lease, BOEM will consider modifications to your ROW grant, RUE grant, or your lease addendum for a project easement in connection with your COP or GAP.


(c) If, after construction, it is determined that a deviation from the approved plan has occurred, you must:


(1) Notify the operators of all leases (including mineral leases issued under this subchapter) and holders of all ROW grants or RUE grants (including all grants issued under this subchapter) which include the area where a deviation has occurred and provide BOEM with evidence of such notification;


(2) Relinquish any unused portion of your lease or grant; and


(3) Submit a revised plan for BOEM approval as necessary.


(d) Construction of a cable or pipeline that substantially deviates from the approved plan may be grounds for cancellation of the lease or grant.
