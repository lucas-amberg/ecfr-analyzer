(a) Your SAP must contain detailed information and analysis to assist BOEM in complying with NEPA and other applicable laws.


(b) When proposing site assessment activities in an area where BOEM has no previous experience, your SAP must contain information about resources, conditions, and activities listed in the following table that your proposed activities may significantly affect or that may have a significant effect on your proposed activities (including where the potential significance of the effect is unknown) and must contain any other information required by law.


(c) When proposing site assessment activities in an area BOEM previously considered, BOEM will review your SAP to determine if its impacts are consistent with those previously considered. If the anticipated effects of your proposed SAP activities are significantly different than those previously anticipated, we may determine that additional NEPA and other relevant Federal reviews are required. In that case, BOEM will notify you of such determination, and you must submit information required in paragraph (b) of this section as appropriate.
