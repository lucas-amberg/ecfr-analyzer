# ยง 590.4   How do I file an appeal?

For your appeal to be filed, BOEM must receive all of the following within 60 days after you receive the decision or order:


(a) A written Notice of Appeal, together with a copy of the decision or order you are appealing, in the office of the BOEM officer that issued the decision or order. You cannot extend the 60-day period for that office to receive your Notice of Appeal; and


(b) A nonrefundable processing fee of $150 paid with the Notice of Appeal.


(1) You must pay electronically through the *Fees for Services* page on the BOEM Web site at *http://www.boem.gov,* and you must include a copy of the *Pay.gov* confirmation receipt page with your Notice of Appeal.


(2) You cannot extend the 60-day period for payment of the processing fee.


(c) You may file an appeal of a BOEM supplemental financial assurance demand with the IBLA. However, if you request that the IBLA stay the demand pending a final ruling on your appeal, you must post an appeal surety bond equal to the amount of the demand that you seek to stay before any such stay is effective.
