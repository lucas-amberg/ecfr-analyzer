(a) Except as otherwise provided, computation of time under this chapter is based on calendar days.

The last day of the period is included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday on which the regulatory authority is not open for business, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.


(c) Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation when the period of prescribed time is 7 days or less.
