(a)(1) Any person who plans to commence or continue coal extraction after April 1, 1990, under a Federal program or on Indian lands, or after the effective date of counterpart provisions in a State program, in reliance on the incidental mining exemption shall file a complete application for exemption with the regulatory authority for each mining area.


(2) Following incorporation of an exemption application approval process into a regulatory program, a person may not commence coal extraction based upon the exemption until the regulatory authority approves such application, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

Coal extraction may not continue after such 60-day period unless that person files an administratively complete application for exemption with the regulatory authority. If an administratively complete application is filed within 60 days, the person may continue extracting coal in reliance on the exemption beyond the 60-day period until the regulatory authority makes an administrative decision on such application.

(2) The determination of exemption shall be based upon information contained in the application and any other information available to the regulatory authority at that time.


(3) If the regulatory authority fails to provide an applicant with the determination as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an applicant who has not begun may commence coal extraction pending a determination on the application unless the regulatory authority issues an interim finding, together with reasons therefor, that the applicant may not begin coal extraction.
