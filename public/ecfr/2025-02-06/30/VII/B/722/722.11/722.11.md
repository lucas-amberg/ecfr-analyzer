# § 722.11   Imminent dangers and harms.

(a) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim regulatory program, which create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, the authorized representative shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or that portion of the operation relevant to the condition, practice, or violation.


(b) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim regulatory program, which are causing, or can reasonably be expected to cause, significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the authorized representative shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or that portion of the operation relevant to the condition, practice, or violation.


(c) Surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted by any person without a valid surface coal mining permit required by this subchapter constitute a condition or practice which causes or can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, unless such operations are an integral, uninterrupted extension of previously permitted operations, and the person conducting such operations has filed a timely and complete application for a permit to conduct such operations.


(d) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall impose affirmative obligations on an operator which the authorized representative deems necessary to abate the condition, practice, or violation if—


(1) A cessation order is issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section; and


(2) The cessation of mining or reclamation activities will not completely abate the imminent danger or harm or eliminate the practices or conditions that contributed to the imminent danger or harm.


(e) When imposing affirmative obligations under this section, the authorized representative of the Secretary shall require abatement of the imminent danger or harm in the most expeditious manner physically possible. The affirmative obligation shall include a time by which abatement shall be accomplished and may include, among other things, the use of existing or additional personnel and equipment.


(f) Reclamation operations not directly the subject of the order or affirmative obligation shall continue during any cessation order.


(g) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall terminate a cessation order issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section by written notice when the authorized representative determines that the conditions or practices or violations that contributed to the imminent danger to life or the environment have been eliminated.
