# § 722.16   Pattern of violations.

(a) The regulations of this section set forth the procedures governing the suspension or revocation of State permits and rights to mine under this Act based on a pattern of violations arising during Federal inspections during the initial regulatory program.


(b) *Definitions.* As used in this section—


(1) *Violations of the same or related requirements of the Act, regulations or permit conditions* means noncompliance with any single section of parts 715, 716, or 717 of this chapter.


(2) *Violations of different requirements of the Act, regulations, or permit conditions* means noncompliance with different sections of parts 715, 716, or 717 of this chapter.


(3) *Unwarranted failure to comply* means the failure of a permittee to prevent the occurrence of any violation of his permit or any requirement of the Act or these regulations due to indifference, lack of diligence, lack of reasonable care; or the failure to abate any violation of such permit, the Act or regulations due to indifference, lack of diligence, or lack of reasonable care.


(4) *Willful violation* means an intentional action or omission which violates the Act, regulations or permit conditions required under the Act.


(5) *Inspection* as used in this section means any visit to the mine.


(c) *Order to show cause.* (1) If the Director determines that a pattern of violations of any requirements of the Act, the regulations, or a permit condition imposed under the Act or regulations exists, or has existed, and that such violations are caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee or were willful violations, the Director shall issue an order to the permittee to show cause why the permit should not be suspended or revoked.


(2) The Director may determine that a pattern of violations exists or has existed, after considering the circumstances, including—


(i) The number of willful violations or violations caused by unwarranted failure to comply with the same or related requirements of the Act, regulations, or permit conditions during two or more Federal inspections;


(ii) The number of willful violations or violations caused by unwarranted failure to comply with different requirements of the Act, regulations, or permit conditions; and


(iii) The extent to which the violations were isolated departures from lawful conduct.


(3) Violations of the same or related requirements of the Act, regulations, or permit conditions required by the Act during three or more Federal inspections within any 12-month period which were either caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee to comply with the Act, the regulations or permit conditions required by the Act, or were willful violations, shall constitute a pattern of violations. A show cause order shall issue unless the Director finds that it would not further enforcement of the performance standards of the Act.


(d) *Suspension or revocation of permit.* (1) The order to show cause shall be issued and a public hearing, if requested, shall be conducted under the procedures of 43 CFR part 4.


(2) If the Secretary finds that a pattern of violations exists or has existed, the permit and right to mine under this Act shall be either suspended or revoked and the permittee directed to complete necessary corrective measures and reclamation operations.


(e) Whenever a permittee fails to abate a violation contained in a notice of violation or cessation order within the abatement period set in the notice or order or as subsequently extended, the Director shall review the permittee's history of violations to determine whether a pattern of violations exists pursuant to this section, and shall issue an order to show cause as appropriate pursuant to 30 CFR 723.15(b)(2).
