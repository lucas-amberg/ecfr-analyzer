# ยง 730.12   Requirements for regulatory programs in States.

(a) Not later than January 3, 1981, for each State in which coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations are or may be conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian land, either a State program or a Federal program adopted under this subchapter shall be in effect. However, the inability of a State to take any action the purpose of which is to prepare, submit or enforce a State program, or any part thereof, because the action is enjoined by the issuance of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction shall not result in the imposition of a Federal program for regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations covered or to be covered by the State program subject to an injunction shall be conducted by the State pursuant to section 502 of the Act until such time as the injunction terminates or for one year from issuance of the injunction, whichever is shorter, at which time the requirements of sections 503 and 504 shall again be fully applicable. States in which no coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations are in existence or planned on January 3, 1981, on non-Federal and non-Indian lands but in which such exploration or operations may occur at some later date, shall have a State or Federal program in effect before commencement of any such exploration or operations. 


(b) The State shall notify the Director of the issuance of any injunction which prevents or prohibits the State from preparing, submitting or enforcing a State program or portion thereof.
