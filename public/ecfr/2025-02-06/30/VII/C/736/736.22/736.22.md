# § 736.22   Contents of a Federal program.

(a) In promulgating or revising any Federal program for a State, the Director shall— 


(1) Consider the nature of that State's soils, topography, climate, and biological, chemical, geological, hydrological, agronomic, and other relevant physical conditions; 


(2) Include any provisions that are necessary to implement the requirements of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 531 *et seq.*), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 661-666c), the National Historic and Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470), the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 469a), and other relevant Federal laws imposing duties upon the Secretary; and 


(3) Include, if required pursuant to 30 CFR 736.23, any performance standards for the regulation of coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations more stringent than those otherwise provided for by this chapter and the Act. 


(b)(1) Any Federal program for a State, including appropriate portions of a partial Federal program which is promulgated or revised by the Director, shall provide for Federal regulation of coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands within the State in accordance with the requirements of the Act and this Chapter, including, at a minimum, the following provisions: Parts 700, 701, 707, 761, 762, 764, 842, 843, 845, subchapters G, J, K, and M.


(2) An exception to these requirements may be made where there is exploration but no mining in the State. In such a case, the Federal program which is promulgated must regulate coal exploration, but not mining, and shall include, at a minimum, the applicable sections of the following provisions: Parts 700, 701, 761, 762, 764, 772, 773, 775, 815, 842, 843 and 845.


(c) For the purpose of avoiding duplication, the Federal program shall include a process for coordinating the review and issuance of permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under the Federal program with any other Federal, State, or local planning or permit process applicable to the operations in the jurisdiction involved, including, but not limited to— 


(1) The Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401 *et seq.*); Clean Water Act, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1251 *et seq.*); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 3251 *et seq.*); and 


(2) Plans approved by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under sections 208 or 303(c) of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1288, 1313(c)).
