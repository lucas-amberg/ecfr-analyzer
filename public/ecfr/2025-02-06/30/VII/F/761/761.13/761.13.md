# § 761.13   Procedures for compatibility findings for surface coal mining operations on Federal lands in national forests.

(a) If you intend to rely upon the exception provided in § 761.11(b) to conduct surface coal mining operations on Federal lands within a national forest, you must request that we obtain the Secretarial findings required by § 761.11(b).


(b) You may submit a request to us before preparing and submitting an application for a permit or boundary revision. If you do, you must explain how the proposed operation would not damage the values listed in the definition of “significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values incompatible with surface coal mining operations” in § 761.5. You must include a map and sufficient information about the nature of the proposed operation for the Secretary to make adequately documented findings. We may request that you provide any additional information that we determine is needed to make the required findings.


(c) When a proposed surface coal mining operation or proposed boundary revision for an existing surface coal mining operation includes Federal lands within a national forest, the regulatory authority may not issue the permit or approve the boundary revision before the Secretary makes the findings required by § 761.11(b).
