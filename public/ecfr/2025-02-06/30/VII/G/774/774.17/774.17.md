(b) *Application requirements.* An applicant for approval of the transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights shall—


(1) Provide the regulatory authority with an application for approval of the proposed transfer, assignment, or sale including—


(i) The name and address of the existing permittee and permit number or other identifier;


(ii) A brief description of the proposed action requiring approval; and


(iii) The legal, financial, compliance, and related information required by part 778 of this chapter for the applicant for approval of the transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights.


(2) Advertise the filing of the application in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the operations involved, indicating the name and address of the applicant, the permittee, the permit number or other identifier, the geographic location of the permit, and the address to which written comments may be sent;


(3) Obtain appropriate performance bond coverage in an amount sufficient to cover the proposed operations, as required under subchapter J of this chapter.


(c) *Public participation.* Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by a decision on the transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights, including an official of any Federal, State, or local government agency, may submit written comments on the application to the regulatory authority within a time specified by the regulatory authority.


(d) *Criteria for approval.* The regulatory authority may allow a permittee to transfer, assign, or sell permit rights to a successor, if it finds in writing that the successor—


(1) Is eligible to receive a permit in accordance with §§ 773.12 and 773.14 of this chapter;


(2) Has submitted a performance bond or other guarantee, or obtained the bond coverage of the original permittee, as required by subchapter J of this chapter; and
