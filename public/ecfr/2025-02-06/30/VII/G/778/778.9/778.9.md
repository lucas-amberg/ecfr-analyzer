# § 778.9   Certifying and updating existing permit application information.

In this section, “you” means the applicant and “we” or “us” means the regulatory authority. 


(a) If you have previously applied for a permit and the required information is already in AVS, then you may update the information as shown in the following table. 


(b) You must swear or affirm, under oath and in writing, that all information you provide in an application is accurate and complete. 


(c) We may establish a central file to house your identity information, rather than place duplicate information in each of your permit application files. We will make the information available to the public upon request. 


(d) After we approve an application, but before we issue a permit, you must update, correct, or indicate that no change has occurred in the information previously submitted under this section and §§ 778.11 through 778.14 of this part.
