(b) In situ processing activities shall be planned and conducted to minimize disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance by: 


(1) Avoiding discharge of fluids into holes or wells, other than as approved by the regulatory authority;

(4) Preventing discharge of process fluid into surface waters. 


(c) Each person who conducts in situ processing activities shall submit for approval as part of the application for permit under 30 CFR 785.22, and follow after approval, a plan that ensures that all acid-forming, toxic-forming, or radioactive gases, solids, or liquids constituting a fire, health, safety, or environmental hazard and caused by the mining and recovery process are promptly treated, confined, or disposed of, in a manner that prevents contamination of ground and surface waters, damage to fish, wildlife and related environmental values, and threats to the public health and safety.

(1) Horizontally beyond the affected area identified in the permit; and 


(2) Vertically into overlying or underlying aquifers.
