# § 872.35   When will OSM reduce the amount of prior balance replacement funds or certified in lieu funds distributed to you?

(a) In any fiscal year in which the amount of Treasury funds required to be transferred under §§ 872.30 and 872.33 of this chapter and under section 402(i)(1) of SMCRA exceeds the maximum annual limit of $490 million, we will adjust the amount of these payments to reduce them to the level of the cap.
