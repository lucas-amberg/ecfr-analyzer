The purpose of all projects is to prevent injury and loss of life, protect public health, conserve natural resources, or protect public and private property. Federal funds cannot be used to fund projects in privately owned operating coal mines. Further, any such cooperative agreement that is entered into under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 with an AML State eligible to receive funds from the Appalachian Regional Development Commission is not subject to review by that Commission.
