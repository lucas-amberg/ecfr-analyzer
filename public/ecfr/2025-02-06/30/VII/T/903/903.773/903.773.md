(1) Any person applying for a permit must submit at least five copies of the application to OSM's Western Support Center (WSC) in Denver, Colorado.


(2) WSC shall review an application for administrative completeness and acceptability for further review, and notify the applicant in writing of the findings. WSC may:


(i) Reject a flagrantly deficient application, notifying the applicant of the findings;


(ii) Request additional information required for completeness, stating specifically what information must be supplied; or


(iii) Determine the application administratively complete and acceptable for further review.


(3) When WSC determines the application to be administratively complete, it will notify the applicant. Upon such notification, the applicant must publish the public notice required by § 773.6(a)(1) of this chapter.


(4) A representative of WSC may visit the proposed permit area if necessary to determine whether the operation and reclamation plans are consistent with actual site conditions. WSC will provide the applicant advance notice of the time of the visit.


(5) In determining the completeness of an application, WSC will consider whether the information provided in the application is adequate for OSM to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4322. If necessary, WSC may require specific additional information from the applicant as any environmental review progresses.


(e) In addition to the information required by subchapter G of this chapter, WSC may require an applicant to submit supplemental information to ensure compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations other than the Act and 30 CFR chapter VII.


(f) In making a decision on an application, the regulatory authority shall review any written comments or objections it has received and the records of any informal conference or hearing it has held on the application. The regulatory authority shall issue a written decision in accordance with the timeframes in the following table:


(g) OSM will consider withholding information from public disclosure under § 773.6(d) of this chapter if the applicant labels the information confidential and submits it separately from the rest of the application.


(1) If the applicant submits information identified as confidential, the notice required by § 773.6(a)(1) of this chapter shall state this and identify the type of information that the applicant has submitted.


(2) OSM shall determine the qualification of any application information labeled confidential within 10 days of the last publication of the notice required under § 773.6(a)(1) of this chapter, unless additional time is necessary to obtain public comment or in the event of unforeseen circumstances.
