If you produce gas from an Indian lease subject to this subpart, you must determine and pay royalties on gas production as specified in this section.


(a) *Royalty rate.* You must calculate your royalty using the royalty rate in the lease.


(b) *Payment in value or in kind.* You must pay royalty in value unless:


(1) The Tribal lessor requires payment in kind; or 


(2) You have a lease on allotted lands and ONRR requires payment in kind.


(c) *Royalty calculation.* You must use the following calculations to determine royalty due on the production from or attributable to your lease.


(1) When paid in value, the royalty due is the unit value of production for royalty purposes, determined under 30 CFR part 1206, multiplied by the volume of production multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.


(2) When paid in kind, the royalty due is the volume of production multiplied by the royalty rate.


(d) *Reduced royalty rate.* The Indian lessor and the Secretary may approve a request for a royalty rate reduction. In your request you must demonstrate economic hardship.
