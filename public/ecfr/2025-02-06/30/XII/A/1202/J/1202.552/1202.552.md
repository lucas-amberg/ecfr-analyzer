# ยง 1202.552   How do I determine how much royalty I must pay if my lease is in an approved Federal unit or communitization agreement (AFA)?

You must pay royalties each month on production allocated to your lease under the terms of an AFA. To determine the volume and the value of your production, you must follow these three steps:


(a) You must determine the volume of your entitled share of production allocated to your lease under the terms of an AFA. This may include production from more than one AFA.


(b) You must value the production you take using 30 CFR part 1206. If you take more than your entitled share of production, see ยง 1202.553 for information on how to value this production. If you take less than your entitled share of production, see ยง 1202.554 for information on how to value production you are entitled to but do not take.
