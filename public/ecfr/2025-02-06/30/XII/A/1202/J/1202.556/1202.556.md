# ยง 1202.556   How do I determine the value of avoidably lost, wasted, or drained gas?

If BLM determines that a volume of gas was avoidably lost or wasted, or a volume of gas was drained from your Indian lease for which compensatory royalty is due, then you must determine the value of that volume of gas under 30 CFR part 1206.
