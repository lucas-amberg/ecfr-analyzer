# ยง 1204.3   What alternatives are available for marginal properties?

If you have production from a marginal property, ONRR and the State may allow you the following options:


(a) *Prepay royalty.* ONRR and the State may allow you to make a lump-sum advance payment of royalties instead of monthly royalty payments for the remainder of the lease term. See subpart B for prepayment of royalty requirements.


(b) *Take accounting and auditing relief.* ONRR and the State may allow various accounting and auditing relief options to encourage you to continue to produce and develop your marginal property. See subpart C for accounting and auditing relief requirements.
