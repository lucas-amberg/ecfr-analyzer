# ยง 1204.5   What statutory requirements must I meet to obtain royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief?

(a) ONRR and the State may allow royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief for your marginal property production if ONRR and the State jointly determine that the prepayment or accounting and auditing relief is in the best interests of the Federal Government and the State to:


(1) Promote production;


(2) Reduce the administrative costs of ONRR and the State; and


(3) Increase net receipts to the Federal Government and the State.


(b) At any time, if ONRR and the State determine that either prepayment or accounting and auditing relief no longer meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, ONRR, with the State's concurrence, may discontinue any prepayment or accounting and auditing relief options granted for production from any marginal property.


(1) ONRR will provide you written notice of the decision to discontinue relief.


(i) If you took the cumulative reports and payments relief option under ยง 1204.202, your relief will terminate at the end of the calendar year in which you received the notice.


(ii) If you were approved for prepayment relief under subpart B of this part or other relief under ยง 1204.203, ONRR's notice will tell you when your relief terminates.


(2) ONRR's decision to discontinue relief is not subject to administrative appeal.
