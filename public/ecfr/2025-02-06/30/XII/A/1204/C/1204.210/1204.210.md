# § 1204.210   What if a property is approved as part of a nonqualifying agreement?

If the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or BOEM retroactively approves a marginal property that qualified for relief for inclusion as part of an agreement that does not qualify for relief under this subpart, the property no longer qualifies for relief under this subpart then:


(a) ONRR will not retroactively rescind the marginal property relief for production from your property under § 1204.211;


(b) Your marginal property relief terminates as of December 31 of the calendar year that you receive the BLM or BOEM approval of your marginal property as part of a nonqualifying agreement; and


(c) For the calendar year in which you receive the BLM or BOEMRE approval, and for any previous period affected by the approval, the volumes on which you report and pay royalty for your lease must be amended to reflect all volumes produced on or allocated to your lease under the nonqualifying agreement as modified by BLM or BOEM. Report and pay royalties for your production using the procedures in § 1204.202(b).


(d) If you owe additional royalties based on the retroactive agreement approval and do not pay your royalty by the date due in § 1204.202(b), you will owe late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date your payment was due under § 1204.202 (b)(2) until the date ONRR receives it.
