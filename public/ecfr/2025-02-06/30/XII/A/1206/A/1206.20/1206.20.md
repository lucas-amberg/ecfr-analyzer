*Affiliate* means a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For the purposes of this subpart:


(1) Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting securities, or instruments of ownership or other forms of ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 10 percent constitutes a presumption of non-control that ONRR may rebut.


(2) If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 percent of the voting securities or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person, ONRR will consider each of the following factors to determine if there is control under the circumstances of a particular case:


(i) The extent to which there are common officers or directors.


(ii) With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of ownership or other forms of ownership: The percentage of ownership or common ownership, the relative percentage of ownership or common ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons, if a person is the greatest single owner, or if there is an opposing voting bloc of greater ownership.


(iii) Operation of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility.


(iv) The extent of others owners' participation in operations and day-to-day management of a lease, plant, or other facility.


(v) Other evidence of power to exercise control over or common control with another person.


(3) Regardless of any percentage of ownership or common ownership, relatives, either by blood or marriage, are affiliates.

*Payor* means any person who reports and pays royalties under a lease, regardless of whether that person also is a lessee.


*Person* means any individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a separate entity).


*Processing* means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing. The use of a Joule-Thomson (JT) unit to remove NGLs from gas is considered processing regardless of where the JT unit is located, provided that you market the NGLs as NGLs.

*Prompt month* means the nearest month of delivery for which NYMEX futures prices are published during the trading month.


*Quality differential* means an amount paid or received under an exchange agreement (whether in money or in barrels of oil) that results from differences in API gravity, sulfur content, viscosity, metals content, and other quality factors between oil delivered and oil received in the exchange.

*Rocky Mountain Region* means the States of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, except for those portions of the San Juan Basin and other oil-producing fields in the โFour Cornersโ area that lie within Colorado and Utah.


*Roll* means an adjustment to the NYMEX price that is calculated as follows: Roll = .6667 ร (P_0_โP_1_) + .3333 ร (P_0_โP_2_), where: P_0_ = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the prompt month that is the same as the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; P_1_ = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the month following the month of production, published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; and P_2_ = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the second month following the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month. Calculate the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices using only the days on which such prices are published (excluding weekends and holidays).


(1) *Example 1. Prices in Out Months are Lower Going Forward:* The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is December. December was the prompt month (for year 2011) from October 21 through November 18. January was the first month following the month of production, and February was the second month following the month of production. P_0,_ therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. P_1_ is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. P_2_ is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during February published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. In this example, assume that P_0_ = $95.08 per bbl, P_1_ = $95.03 per bbl, and P_2_ = $94.93 per bbl. In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 ร ($95.08โ$95.03) + .3333 ร ($95.08โ$94.93) = $0.03 + $0.05 = $0.08. You add this number to the NYMEX price.


(2) *Example 2. Prices in Out Months are Higher Going Forward:* The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is November. November was the prompt month (for year 2012) from September 21 through October 22. December was the first month following the month of production, and January was the second month following the month of production. P_0,_ therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during November published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P_1_ is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P_2_ is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. In this example, assume that P_0_ = $91.28 per bbl, P_1_ = $91.65 per bbl, and P_2_ = $92.10 per bbl. In this example (a rising market), Roll = .6667 ร ($91.28โ$91.65) + .3333 ร ($91.28โ$92.10) = (โ$0.25) + (โ$0.27) = (โ$0.52). You add this negative number to the NYMEX price (effectively, a subtraction from the NYMEX price).


*Sale* means a contract between two persons where:


(1) The seller unconditionally transfers title to the oil, gas, or gas plant product to the buyer and does not retain any related rights, such as the right to buy back similar quantities of oil, gas, or gas plant product from the buyer elsewhere;


(2) The buyer pays money or other consideration for the oil, gas, or gas plant product; and


(3) The parties' intent is for a sale of the oil, gas, or gas plant product to occur.


*Section 6 lease* means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.


*Spot price* means the price under a spot sales contract where:


(1) A seller agrees to sell to a buyer a specified amount of oil at a specified price over a specified period of short duration.


(2) No cancellation notice is required to terminate the sales agreement.


(3) There is no obligation or implied intent to continue to sell in subsequent periods.


*Trading month* means the period extending from the second business day before the 25th day of the second calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the second business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month) through the third business day before the 25th day of the calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the third business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month), unless the NYMEX publishes a different definition or different dates on its official website, *www.cmegroup.com*, in which case, the NYMEX definition will apply.


*Transportation allowance* means a deduction in determining royalty value for the reasonable, actual costs that the lessee incurs for moving:


(1) Oil to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.


(2) Unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area, or away from a processing plant. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.


*WTI differential* means the average of the daily mean differentials for location and quality between a grade of crude oil at a market center and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil at Cushing published for each day for which price publications perform surveys for deliveries during the production month, calculated over the number of days on which those differentials are published (excluding weekends and holidays). Calculate the daily mean differentials by averaging the daily high and low differentials for the month in the selected publication. Use only the days and corresponding differentials for which such differentials are published.
