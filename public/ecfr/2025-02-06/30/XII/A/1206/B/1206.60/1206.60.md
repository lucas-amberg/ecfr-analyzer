# ยง 1206.60   What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation allowances?

(a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on Form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under ยง 1218.54 of this chapter from the first day of the first month that you were authorized to deduct a transportation allowance to the date that you repay the difference.


(b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on Form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you may report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties without interest under ยง 1218.53 of this chapter.


(c) If you make an adjustment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, then you must submit a corrected Form ONRR-2014 to reflect actual costs, together with any payment, using instructions that ONRR provides.
