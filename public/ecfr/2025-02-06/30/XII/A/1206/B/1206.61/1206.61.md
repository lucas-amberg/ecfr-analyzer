# ยง 1206.61   How will ONRR determine if my royalty payments are correct?

(a)(1) ONRR may monitor, review, and audit the royalties that you report, and, if ONRR determines that your reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart, ONRR may direct you to use a different measure of royalty value.


(2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, you must pay any additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under ยง 1218.54 of this chapter, or you may report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties without interest under ยง 1218.53 of this chapter.


(b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds, in conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine if your or your affiliate's contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you or your affiliate for the oil. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, you must value the oil sold as the total consideration accruing to you or your affiliate.
