# ยง 1206.63   How do I determine royalty quantity and quality?

(a) You must calculate royalties based on the quantity and quality of oil as measured at the point of royalty settlement that BLM approves.


(b) If you determine the value of oil under ยง 1206.52, ยง 1206.53, or ยง 1206.54 based on a quantity and/or quality that is different from the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement that BLM approves for the lease, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.


(c) You may not make any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses incurred before the royalty settlement point unless BLM determines that any actual loss was unavoidable.
