# § 1206.102   How do I value oil not sold under an arm's-length contract?

This section explains how to value oil that you may not value under § 1206.101 or that you elect under § 1206.101(c)(1) to value under this section, unless ONRR decides to value your oil under 1206.105. First, determine if paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section applies to production from your lease, or if you may apply paragraph (d) or (e) of this section with ONRR's approval.


(a) *Production from leases in California or Alaska.* Value is the average of the daily mean ANS spot prices published in any ONRR-approved publication during the trading month most concurrent with the production month. For example, if the production month is June, calculate the average of the daily mean prices using the daily ANS spot prices published in the ONRR-approved publication for all of the business days in June.


(1) To calculate the daily mean spot price, you must average the daily high and low prices for the month in the selected publication.


(2) You must use only the days and corresponding spot prices for which such prices are published.


(3) You must adjust the value for applicable location and quality differentials, and you may adjust it for transportation costs, under § 1206.111.


(4) After you select an ONRR-approved publication, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or ONRR revokes its approval of the publication. If you must change publications, you must begin a new two-year period.


(b) *Production from leases in the Rocky Mountain Region.* This paragraph provides methods and options for valuing your production under different factual situations. You must consistently apply paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section to value all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease or a portion of the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that you cannot value under § 1206.101 or that you elect under § 1206.101(c)(1) to value under this section.


(1) You may elect to value your oil under either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section. After you select either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, you may not change to the other method more often than once every two years, unless the method you have been using is no longer applicable and you must apply the other paragraph. If you change methods, you must begin a new two-year period.


(2) Value is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds accruing to the seller under your or your affiliate's arm's-length contracts for the purchase or sale of production from the field or area during the production month.


(i) The total volume purchased or sold under those contracts must exceed 50 percent of your and your affiliate's production from both Federal and non-Federal leases in the same field or area during that month.


(ii) Before calculating the volume-weighted average, you must normalize the quality of the oil in your or your affiliate's arm's-length purchases or sales to the same gravity as that of the oil produced from the lease.


(3) Value is the NYMEX price (without the roll), adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.113.


(4) If you demonstrate to ONRR's satisfaction that paragraphs (b)(2) through (3) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, ONRR's Director may establish an alternative valuation method.


(c) *Production from leases not located in California, Alaska, or the Rocky Mountain Region.*

(1) Value is the NYMEX price, plus the roll, adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.113.


(2) If ONRR's Director determines that the use of the roll no longer reflects prevailing industry practice in crude oil sales contracts or that the most common formula that industry uses to calculate the roll changes, ONRR may terminate or modify the use of the roll under paragraph (c)(1) of this section at the end of each two-year period as of January 1, 2017, through a notice published in the _Federal Register_ not later than 60 days before the end of the two-year period. ONRR will explain the rationale for terminating or modifying the use of the roll in this notice.


(d) *Unreasonable value.* If ONRR determines that the NYMEX price or ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any particular case, ONRR may decide to value your oil under § 1206.105.


(e) *Production delivered to your refinery and the NYMEX price or ANS spot price is an unreasonable value.* If ONRR determines that the NYMEX price or ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any particular case, ONRR may decide to value your oil under § 1206.105.
