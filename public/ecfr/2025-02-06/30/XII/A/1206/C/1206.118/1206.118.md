(a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter from the date when you took the deduction to the date when you repay the difference.


(b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you are entitled to a credit plus interest.
