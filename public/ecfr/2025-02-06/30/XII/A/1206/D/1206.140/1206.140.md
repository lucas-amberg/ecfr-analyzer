# § 1206.140   What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?

(a) This subpart applies to all gas produced from Federal oil and gas leases onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It explains how you, as a lessee, must calculate the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.


(b) The terms “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to the lessee.


(c) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a(an): Federal statute; settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation; written agreement between the lessee and ONRR's Director establishing a method to determine the value of production from any lease that ONRR expects would at least approximate the value established under this subpart; express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this subpart, then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.


(d) ONRR may audit and order you to adjust all royalty payments.
