# ยง 1206.156   What are my reporting requirements under a non-arm's-length transportation contract?

(a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on non-arm's-length transportation costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).


(b)(1) For new non-arm's-length transportation facilities or arrangements, you must base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable transportation costs for the applicable period.


(2) You must use your or your affiliate's most recently available operations data for the transportation system as your estimate. If such data is not available, you must use estimates based on data for similar transportation systems.


(3) Section 1206.158 applies when you amend your report based on your actual costs.
