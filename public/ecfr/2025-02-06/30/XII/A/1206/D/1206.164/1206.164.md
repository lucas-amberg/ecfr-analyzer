# § 1206.164   What interest and penalties apply if I improperly report a processing allowance?

(a)(1) If ONRR determines that you took an unauthorized processing allowance, then you must pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.


(2) If you understated your processing allowance, you may be entitled to a credit, with interest.


(b) If you deduct a processing allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 66
2/3 percent of the value of a gas plant product, you must pay late payment interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date when that amount is taken until the date when you pay the additional royalties due.


(c) If you improperly net a processing allowance against the sales value of a gas plant product instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.
