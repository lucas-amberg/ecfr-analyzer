# § 1206.181   How do I establish processing costs for dual accounting purposes when I do not process the gas?

Where accounting for comparison (dual accounting) is required for gas production from a lease but neither you nor someone acting on your behalf processes the gas, and you have elected to perform actual dual accounting under § 1206.176, you must use the first applicable of the following methods to establish processing costs for dual accounting purposes:


(a) The average of the costs established in your current arm's-length processing agreements for gas from the lease, provided that some gas has previously been processed under these agreements.


(b) The average of the costs established in your current arm's-length processing agreements for gas from the lease, provided that the agreements are in effect for plants to which the lease is physically connected and under which gas from other leases in the field or area is being or has been processed.


(c) A proposed comparable processing fee submitted to either the tribe and ONRR (for tribal leases) or ONRR (for allotted leases) with your supporting documentation submitted to ONRR. If ONRR does not take action on your proposal within 120 days, the proposal will be deemed to be denied and subject to appeal to the ONRR Director under 30 CFR part 1290.


(d) Processing costs based on the regulations in §§ 1206.179 and 1206.180.
