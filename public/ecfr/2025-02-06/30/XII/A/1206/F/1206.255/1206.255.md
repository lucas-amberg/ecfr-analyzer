# ยง 1206.255   Point of royalty determination.

(a) For all leases subject to this subpart, royalty shall be computed on the basis of the quantity and quality of Federal coal in marketable condition measured at the point of royalty measurement as determined jointly by BLM and ONRR.


(b) Coal produced and added to stockpiles or inventory does not require payment of royalty until such coal is later used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. ONRR may ask BLM to increase the lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventory become excessive so as to increase the risk of degradation of the resource.


(c) The lessee shall pay royalty at a rate specified in the lease at the time the coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, unless otherwise provided for at ยง 1206.256(d).
