(a) When coal is subjected to washing, the washed coal must be allocated to the leases from which it was extracted.


(b) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from coal obtained from only one lease, the quantity of washed coal allocable to the lease will be based on the net output of the washing plant.


(c) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from coal obtained from more than one lease, unless determined otherwise by BLM, the quantity of net output of washed coal allocable to each lease will be based on the ratio of measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed from each lease compared to the total measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed.
