# ยง 1218.307   How do I pay royalties due for my existing leases that qualify for near-term production incentives under BLM regulations?

If you qualify for a production incentive under BLM regulations at 43 CFR subpart 3212, your royalty due on the production BLM determines to be qualified for a production incentive under 43 CFR 3212.23 and 3212.24 is 50 percent of the amount of the total royalty that would otherwise be due under 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.
