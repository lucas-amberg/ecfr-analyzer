# ยง 1218.704   What is ONRR's policy on interest and administrative costs?

(a) *Interest.* (1) The ONRR will assess interest on all delinquent debts as prescribed by applicable statutes and regulations.


(i) Interest will accrue on debts involving Federal and Indian oil and gas leases under 30 CFR 1218.54, 1218.102, and 1218.150.


(ii) Interest will accrue on debts involving Federal and Indian solid mineral and geothermal resource leases under 30 CFR 1218.202 and 1218.302.


(iii) Interest will accrue on civil penalties ONRR assesses under 30 CFR part 1241.


(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the payment was due unless otherwise specified by law or lease terms.


(b) *Penalties.* The ONRR will assess penalties under our authority in 30 U.S.C. 1719 and 1720a, and implementing regulations at 30 CFR part 1241.


(c) *Administrative costs.* The ONRR initially will assess $436 for administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a delinquent debt. We will publish a notice of any increase in administrative costs assessed under this section in the _Federal Register._ The ONRR also may assess $436 for administrative costs that continue to accrue during any appeal process if:


(1) The notice we provide you under 30 CFR 1218.703 grants you the right to appeal and you exercise that right; and


(2) Your appeal is denied and we refer the delinquent debt to Treasury under this subpart.


(d) *Allocation of payments.* The ONRR will apply a partial or installment payment you make on a delinquent debt sent to Treasury, first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.


(e) *Additional authority.* The ONRR may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory or regulatory authority.


(f) *Waiver.* The Director may decide to waive collection of all or part of the administrative costs under paragraph (c) of this section either in compromise of the delinquent debt or if the Director determines collection of this charge would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Government's best interest.


(g) The ONRR's decision whether to collect or waive collection of administrative costs under paragraph (f) of this section is the final decision for the Department and is not subject to administrative review.
