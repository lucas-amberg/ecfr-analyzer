# ยง 1219.410   What does this subpart contain?

(a) The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA) directs the Secretary of the Interior to disburse a portion of the rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums derived from certain Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) to the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively identified as the Gulf producing States); to eligible coastal political subdivisions (CPSs) within those States; and to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Shared GOMESA revenues are reserved for the following purposes:


(1) Projects and activities for the purpose of coastal protection, including conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and infrastructure directly affected by coastal wetland losses;


(2) Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources;


(3) Implementation of a federally-approved marine, coastal, or comprehensive conservation management plan;


(4) Mitigation of the impact of OCS activities through the funding of onshore infrastructure projects; and


(5) Planning assistance and administrative costs not-to-exceed 3 percent of the amounts received.


(b) This subpart sets forth the formula and methodology ONRR uses to determine the amount of revenues allocated and disbursed to each Gulf producing State and each eligible CPS for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2016. Leasing revenues disbursed under this subpart originate from leases issued on or after December 20, 2006, in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area and the 181 South Area, subject to restrictions identified in GOMESA. We collectively refer to the revenue sharing from these areas for these fiscal years as GOMESA Phase I revenue sharing.
