# ยง 1219.514   How will ONRR allocate the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) to coastal political subdivisions within the Gulf producing States?

(a) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, ONRR will allocate 25 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's population bears to the population of all CPSs in the State.


(b) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 25 percent based on the proportion that each CPS's miles of coastline bears to the total miles of coastline across all CPSs in the State. However, for the State of Louisiana, we will deem CPSs without a coastline to each have a coastline one-third the average length of the coastline of all CPSs within Louisiana that have a coastline.


(c)(1) Of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) allocated to a Gulf producing State's CPSs, we will allocate 50 percent in amounts that are inversely proportional to the respective distances between:


(i) The point in each CPS that is closest to the geographic center of the applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site; and


(ii) The geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site.


(2) However, we will exclude distances to an applicable leased tract (Phase II) from this calculation if any portion of the tract is located in a geographic area that was subject to a leasing moratorium on January 1, 2005, unless the leased tract was in production on that date.
