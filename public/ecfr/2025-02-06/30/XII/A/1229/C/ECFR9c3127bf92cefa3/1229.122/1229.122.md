# ยง 1229.122   Coordination of audit activities.

(a) Each State with a delegation of authority shall submit annually to the ONRR an audit workplan specifically identifying leases, resources, companies, and payors scheduled for audit. This workplan must be submitted 120 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. A State may request changes to its workplan (including the companies and leases to be audited) at the end of each quarter of each fiscal year. All requested changes are subject to approval by the ONRR and must be submitted in writing.


(b) When a State plans to audit leases of a lessee or royalty payor for which there is an ONRR or OIG resident audit team, all audit activities must be coordinated through the ONRR or OIG resident supervisor. Such activities include, but are not limited to, issuance of engagement letters, arranging for entrance conferences, submission of data requests, scheduling of audit activities including site visits, submission of issue letters, and closeout conferences.


(c) The State shall consult with the ONRR and/or OIG regarding resolution of any coordination problems encountered during the conduct of delegation activities.
