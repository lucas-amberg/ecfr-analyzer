# ยง 1241.50   What may ONRR do if I violate a statute, regulation, order, or lease term relating to a lease subject to this part?

If we determine that you have not followed any requirement of a statute, regulation, order, or a term of a lease subject to this part, we may serve you with a NONC explaining:


(a) What the violation is.


(b) How to correct the violation to avoid a civil penalty.


(c) That you have 20 days after the date on which you are served the NONC to correct the violation, unless the NONC specifies a longer period.
