(1) Requiring the lease surety, for an amount owed by a lessee, to pay the penalty.


(2) Deducting the amount of the penalty from any sum that the United States owes you.


(3) Referring the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection under 30 CFR part 1218, subpart J.


(4) Using the judicial process to compel your payment under 30 U.S.C. 1719(k).


(b) If ONRR uses the judicial process to compel your payment, or if you seek judicial review under 30 U.S.C. 1719(j), and the court upholds the assessment of a penalty, the court will have jurisdiction to award the penalty amount assessed plus interest from the date of the expiration of the 90-day period referred to in 30 U.S.C. 1719(j).
