# ยง 1243.8   When will ONRR suspend my obligation to comply with an order?

(a) *Federal leases.* Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, if you appeal an order regarding the payment and reporting of royalties and other payments due from Federal mineral leases onshore or on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), and:


(1) If the amount under appeal is less than $10,000 or does not require payment of a specified amount, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with the order. ONRR will use the lease surety posted with the Bureau of Land Management for onshore leases, and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for OCS leases, as collateral for the obligation; or


(2) If the amount under appeal is $10,000 or more, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with that order if you:


(i) Submit an ONRR-specified surety instrument under subpart B of this part within a time period ONRR prescribes; or


(ii) Demonstrate financial solvency under subpart C.


(b) *Indian leases.* Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, if you appeal an order regarding the payment and reporting of royalties and other payments due from Indian mineral leases subject to this part, and:


(1) If the amount under appeal is less than $1,000 or does not require payment, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with the order. ONRR will use the lease surety posted with the Bureau of Indian Affairs as collateral for the obligation; or


(2) If the amount under appeal is $1,000 or more, ONRR will suspend your obligation to comply with that order if you submit an ONRR-specified surety instrument under subpart B of this part within a time period ONRR prescribes.


(c) Nothing in this part prohibits you from paying any demanded amount or complying with any other requirement pending appeal. However, voluntarily paying any demanded amount or otherwise complying with any other requirement when suspension of an order is otherwise available under these rules does not create judicially reviewable final agency action under 5 U.S.C. 704.


(d) Regardless of the amount under appeal, ONRR may inform you that it will not suspend your obligation to comply with the order under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section because suspension would harm the interests of the United States or the Indian lessor.
