# ยง 1.1   Proactive disclosure of Department records.

(a) Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the Department's website, *http://www.treasury.gov,* and/or on the website of the component that maintains such records. The FOIA office of each component is responsible for determining which of the component's records are required to be made publicly available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting such records. Each component has a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating records particular to that component. A list of the Department's FOIA Public Liaisons is available at: *https://home.treasury.gov/footer/freedom-of-information-act.*

(b) When a component receives three or more requests for the same records, it shall make available for public inspection in an electronic format, any records released in response to those requests.
