# § 1.2   Requirements for making requests.

(a) *General information.* (1) Requests should be addressed to the FOIA office of the component that maintains the requested records. The appendices to this subpart list the addresses of each FOIA office and the methods for submitting requests to each component. Requesters are encouraged to submit requests online (through *FOIA.gov*, component web pages or by completing the “Submit an Online Request” form located at *https://home.treasury.gov/footer/freedom-of-information-act.*

(2) When a requester is unable to determine the appropriate Departmental component to which to direct a request, the requester may send the request to Freedom of Information Act Request, Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices (DO), Director, FOIA and Transparency, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20220. The FOIA and Transparency team will forward the request to the component(s) that it determines to be most likely to maintain the records that are sought.


(3) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in section 1.26 of subpart C of this part.


(4) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration by that individual made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or submitting proof that the individual is deceased (*e.g.,* a copy of a death certificate). As an exercise of its administrative discretion, each component can require a requester to supply additional information, if necessary, in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.


(b) *Description of records sought.* Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Requesters should refer to the Appendices of this subpart for additional component-specific requirements. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. If the requester fails to reasonably describe the records sought, the component shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is deficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component's designated FOIA contact or the FOIA Public Liaison. When a requester fails to provide sufficient detail after having been asked to clarify a request, the component shall notify the requester that the request has not been properly made and that the request will be administratively closed.
