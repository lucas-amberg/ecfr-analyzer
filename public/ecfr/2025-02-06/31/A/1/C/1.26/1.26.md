# § 1.26   Procedures for notification and access to records pertaining to individuals—Format and fees for request for access.

(a) *Procedures for notification and access.* Each component must, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), set forth in the appendix to this subpart applicable to such component procedures whereby an individual can be notified, in response to a request, if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to that individual. In addition, such procedures must set forth the requirements for access to such records. At a minimum, such procedures must specify the times during, and the places at which access will be afforded, together with such identification as may be required of the individual before access. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1), (2) and (3).)


(b) *Access.* Each component, in accordance with the procedures prescribed under paragraph (a) of this section, must allow an individual, upon request, to gain access to records or to any information pertaining to such individual which is contained in a system of records. Permit the individual to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion of the record in a comprehensible form. Also permit the individual to be accompanied by any person of the individual's choosing to review the record, except that the agency may require the individual to furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of that individual's record in the accompanying person's presence. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1).)


(c) *Exceptions.* Neither the procedures prescribed under paragraph (a) of this section nor the requirements for access under paragraph (b) of this section apply to:


(1) Systems of records exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k) and § 1.23(c);


(2) Information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (see 5 U.S.C. 552(d)(5)); or


(3) Information pertaining to an individual which is contained in, and inseparable from, another individual's record.


(d) *Format of request.* (1) A request for notification of whether a record exists must:


(i) Be made in writing and signed by the person making the request, who must be the individual about whom the record is maintained or such individual's duly authorized representative (*see* § 1.34);


(ii) State that it is made pursuant to the Privacy Act or the regulations in this subpart, or have “Privacy Act Request” written on both the request and on the envelope, if not submitted via a component-provided electronic method;


(iii) Give the name of the system or subsystem or categories of records to which access is sought, as specified in “Privacy Act Issuances” published by the Office of the Federal Register and referenced in the appendices to this subpart;


(iv) Describe the nature of the record sought, the date of the record or the period in which the record was compiled or otherwise describe the record in sufficient detail to enable Department personnel to locate the system of records containing the record with a reasonable amount of effort;


(v) Provide such identification of the requester as may be specified in the appropriate appendix to this subpart; and


(vi) Be addressed or delivered in person or by a component-provided electronic method to the office or officer of the component indicated for the particular system or subsystem or categories of records to which the individual seeks access, as specified in “Privacy Act Issuances” published by the Office of the Federal Register and referenced in the appendices to this subpart. As explained in appendix A to this subpart, requesters may send a written request to the Departmental Offices seeking assistance in identifying the appropriate component or in preparing a request for notification. Requesters seeking such assistance should submit a written request addressed to the Departmental Offices at the address specified in appendix A to this part.


(2) A request for access to records must, in addition to complying with paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section:


(i) State whether the requester wishes to inspect the records or desires to have a copy made and furnished without first inspecting them;


(ii) If a requester wants a copy of their records, they must clearly state in the request that they agree to pay the fees for duplication as ultimately determined in accordance with subpart A to this subpart (§ 1.7), unless such fees are waived under that section by the system manager or other appropriate official as indicated in the appropriate appendix to this subpart; and


(iii) Comply with any other requirement set forth in the applicable appendix to this subpart or the “System of Records Notice” applicable to the system in question. Any request for access which does not comply with the requirements in the preceding sentence and those set forth elsewhere in this subpart, will not be deemed subject to the time constraints of this section, unless and until amended to comply with all requirements in this subpart. Components must advise the requester of any specific deficiencies so the requester can amend the request so it can be processed. This section applies only to records maintained in a system of records that are also in the possession or control of the component. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) and (f).)


(e) *Requests for records not in control of component.* (1) Treasury employees must make reasonable efforts to assist an oral requester to learn to which office or officer a written request should be sent. When the request is for a record which is not in the possession or control of any Treasury component, the requester must be advised of this fact.


(2) Where the record requested originated with a Federal agency other than Treasury or its components and was classified (e.g., National Defense or Intelligence Information) or otherwise restrictively endorsed (e.g., Office of Personnel Management records of Federal Bureau of Investigation reports) by the originating agency, and a copy is in the possession of a Treasury component, the component will refer that portion of the request to the originating agency for determination of all Privacy Act issues. In the case of a referral to another agency under this paragraph (e)(2), the component will notify the requester that such portion of the request has been so referred and that the requester may expect to hear from that agency.


(3) When information sought from a system manager or other appropriate Treasury official includes information originating with other Federal agencies that is not classified or otherwise restrictively endorsed, the system manager or other appropriate Treasury official receiving the request must consult with the originating agency prior to making a decision to disclose or withhold the record. The system manager or other appropriate Treasury official maintaining the record must decide if disclosure is required. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) and (f).)


(f) *Date of receipt of request.* For purposes of this subpart, the date of receipt of a request for notification or access to records shall be the date on which the requester satisfied all the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. Requests for notification or access to records and any separate agreement to pay for copies must be stamped or endorsed with the date the receiving office/component received all information needed to satisfy the requirements in this section. The date of receipt of the last required document will be the date of receipt of the request for the purposes of this subpart. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) and (f).)


(g) *Notification of determination*—(1) *In general.* The component officers designated in the appendices to this subpart must send the requester any required notifications, including notices stating the component has responsive records and whether it will provide access to the records requested. The component will mail notification of the determination within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of the request, as determined in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. If it is not possible to respond within 30 days, the relevant component officer must inform the requester (prior to the expiration of the 30-day timeframe), stating the reason for the delay (e.g., volume of records requested, scattered location of the records, need to consult other agencies, or the difficulty of the legal issues involved) and when a response will be dispatched. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) and (f).)


(2) *Granting of access.* When the component determines that the request for access will be granted and the requester seeks a copy of the responsive records, the component must furnish such copy in a form comprehensible to the requester, together with a statement of the applicable duplication fees. If the requester indicates they want to exercise their right to inspect the responsive records, the component officer designated in the relevant appendix to this subpart must promptly notify the requester in writing of the determination, including when and where the requested records may be inspected. A requester seeking to inspect such records may be accompanied by another person of their choosing. The requester seeking access must sign a form indicating that Treasury is authorized to discuss the contents of the subject record in the accompanying person's presence. If, after making the inspection, the requester requests a copy of all or a portion of the requested records and pays the applicable fees for duplication, the component must provide a copy of the records in a form comprehensible to the requester. Fees to be charged are as prescribed by subpart A to this subpart (§ 1.7). Components may charge for processing requests under the Freedom of Information Act, under the provisions of this section, or may issue their own fee schedules, which must be consistent with the OMB Guidelines. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) and (f).)


(3) *Requirements for access to medical records.* When access is requested to medical records, including psychological records, the responsible official may determine that such release could have an adverse effect on the individual and that release will be made only to a health professional authorized in writing to have access to such records by the individual making the request. Upon receipt of the authorization, the health professional will be permitted to review the records or to receive copies of the records by mail, upon proper verification of identity. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) (3).)


(4) *Denial of request.* When a component makes a determination to deny a request for notification of whether a record exists or deny access to existing responsive records (whether in whole or part or subject to conditions or exceptions), the component must notify the requester of the denial by mail in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The letter of notification must specify the city or other location where the requested records are situated (if known), contain a statement of the reasons for not granting the request as made, set forth the name and title or position of the responsible official and advise the requester of the right to file suit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (g)(1)(B).


(5) *Prohibition against the use of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) exemptions.* A component may not invoke exemptions from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (subpart A to this part (§ 1.2 (c))), for the purpose of withholding from a requester any record which would otherwise be accessible to the requester under the Privacy Act and this subpart. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(t).)


(6) *Records exempt in whole or in part.* (i) If Treasury deems it necessary to assert an exemption in response to a request for notification of the existence of or access to records, it will neither confirm nor deny the existence of the records if the records were exempted from individual access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or were compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding in either a court or before an administrative tribunal. If Treasury asserts such an exemption, it must advise the requester only that it has identified no records available pursuant to the Privacy Act.


(ii) Process requests from individuals for access to records which Treasury exempted from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) as follows:


(A) Requests for information classified pursuant to Executive Order 12958, 13526, or successor or prior Executive orders require the responsible Treasury component to review the information to determine whether it continues to warrant classification pursuant to an Executive order. Information which no longer warrants classification under these criteria must be declassified and made available to the individual. If the information continues to warrant classification, the component must notify the requester that the information sought is classified, that it has been reviewed and continues to warrant classification, and that Treasury exempted it from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) and 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). Classified information maintained in records Treasury exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) must be reviewed as required by this paragraph (g)(6)(ii)(A), but the response to the individual must be in the form prescribed by paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section.


(B) Components must respond to requests for information maintained in records that Treasury exempted from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) in the manner provided in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section unless the requester shows that the component has used or is using the information to deny them any right, privilege, or benefit for which they are eligible or to which they would otherwise be entitled under Federal law. If the requester makes such a showing, the component must advise the requester of the existence of the records, extract any information from the records that would identify a confidential source, or provide a summary extract of the records to the requester in a manner which protects the source to the maximum degree possible.


(C) Information a component compiled in its records as part of an employee background investigation that Treasury exempted from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) must be made available to a requester unless the record identifies a confidential source(s). Information in the record that identifies confidential source(s) must be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source(s) to the maximum degree possible and the summary or extract must be provided to the requester.


(D) Testing or examination material that Treasury exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) must not be made available to a requester if disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process but may be made available if no such compromise possibility exists. (*See* 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5), (j), and (k).)
