(ii) *Authorized orders.* (A) Upon motion by a party or any other affected person, and for good cause shown, the Administrative Law Judge may make any order which justice requires to protect any person in the event disclosure of information is prohibited by law, privileged, confidential, or sensitive in some other way, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following—


(*1*) That disclosure of information be made only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;


(*2*) That a trade secret or other information not be disclosed, or be disclosed only in a designated way.
