(a) Whenever the Director has reason to believe that any former officer or employee of the Department has violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), he/she may reprimand such person or institute an administrative disciplinary proceeding for that person's suspension from practice before the Department or a separate statutory agency thereof.

(b) The Director shall coordinate proceedings under this part with the Department of Justice in cases where it initiates criminal prosecution.
