# ยง 15.737-29   Review by the General Counsel.

In my proceeding before the Department, if an initial decision is made with respect to the disqualification of a representative or attorney for a party on the grounds of 18 U.S.C. 207(a), (b) or (c), such decision may be appealed to the General Counsel, who will make the agency decision on the issue.
