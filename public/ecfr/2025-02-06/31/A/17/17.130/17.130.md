# § 17.130   General prohibitions against discrimination.

(a) No qualified individual with handicaps in the United States, shall, by reason of his or her handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.


(b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap—


(i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;


(ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;


(iii) Provide a qualified individual with handicaps with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;


(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits or services to individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with handicaps with aid, benefits or services that are as effective as those provided to others;


(v) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or


(vi) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.


(2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with handicaps and for nonhandicapped persons, but must afford individuals with handicaps equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs.


(3) Even if the agency is permitted, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, to operate a separate or different program for individuals with handicaps or for any class of individuals with handicaps, the agency must permit any qualified individual with handicaps who wishes to participate in the program that is not separate or different to do so.


(4) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would—


(i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap; or


(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with handicaps.


(5) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would—


(i) Exclude individuals with handicaps from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency; or


(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with handicaps.


(6) The agency, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.


(7) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part.


(c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with handicaps or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with handicaps from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by this part.


(d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps.
