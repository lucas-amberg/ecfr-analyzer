# ยง 19.310   What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

(a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate. 


(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the Department of the Treasury grants an exception under ยง 19.120.
