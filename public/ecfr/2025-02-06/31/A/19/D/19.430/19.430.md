# § 19.430   How do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

You check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified in two ways: 


(a) You as an agency official must check the *EPLS* when you take any action listed in § 19.425. 


(b) You must review information that a participant gives you, as required by § 19.335, about its status or the status of the principals of a transaction.
