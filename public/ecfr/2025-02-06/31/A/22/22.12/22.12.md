# ยง 22.12   Effect on other regulations, forms, and instructions.

(a) *Effect on other regulations.* All regulations, orders, or like directions issued before the effective date of this part by any officer of the Department of the Treasury which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue federal financial assistance to any applicant for a recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part may be considered to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction before the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, supersedes any of the following (including future amendments thereof):


(1) Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1965 Supp., p. 167) and regulations issued thereunder; or


(2) Any other orders, regulations, or instructions, insofar as such orders, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.


(b) *Forms and instructions.* The designated Agency official shall issue and promptly make available to all interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as applied to programs to which this part applies and for which the designated Agency official is responsible.


(c) *Supervision and coordination.* The designated Agency official may from time to time assign to officials of the Agency, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in ยง 22.10), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Agency and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the designated Agency official of the Department.
