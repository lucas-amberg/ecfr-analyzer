# ยง 22.2   Application.

(a) This part applies to any program for which federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department, including the types of federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part. It also applies to money paid, property transferred, or other federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of this part pursuant to an application approved before that effective date. This part does not apply to:


(1) Any federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts;


(2) Any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary; or


(3) Any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in ยง 22.4(c). The fact that a type of federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A to this part shall not mean, if Title VI is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to appendix A to this part.


(b) In any program receiving federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance, the nondiscrimination requirement of this part shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in that space.
