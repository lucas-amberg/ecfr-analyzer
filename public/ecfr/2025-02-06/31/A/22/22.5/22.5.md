# ยง 22.5   Assurances required.

(a) *General.* Either at the application stage or the award stage, federal agencies must ensure that applications for federal financial assistance or awards of federal financial assistance contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency official, that each program or activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which these Title VI regulations apply will be operated in compliance with these Title VI regulations.


(b) *Duration of obligation.* (1) In the case where the federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which federal financial assistance is extended to the program.


(2) In the case where federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interest therein, from the federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property or interest therein from the federal government is involved, but property is acquired or improved with federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. When the property is obtained from the federal government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the designated agency official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the designated agency official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as the designated agency official deems appropriate, to subordinate such right of reversion to the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance.


(c) *Continuing federal financial assistance.* Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing federal financial assistance to which this part applies (including the types of federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part) shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any federal financial assistance pursuant to the application:


(1) Contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part; and


(2) Provide, be accompanied by, or be covered by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the designated agency official to give reasonable guarantee that the applicant and all recipients of federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.


(d) *Assurance from institutions.* (1) In the case of any application for federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research, for special training projects, for student loans or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.


(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.


(e) *Form.* (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. This includes but is not limited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, *et seq.*

(2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
