# § 22.8   Procedure for effecting compliance.

(a) *General.* If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:


(1) A referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking; and


(2) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.


(b) *Noncompliance with § 22.5.* If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 22.5 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, federal financial assistance may be suspended, terminated, or refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Agency shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph. However, subject to § 22.12, the Agency shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application approved prior to the effective date of this part.


(c) *Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue federal financial assistance.* (1) No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue federal financial assistance shall become effective until:


(i) The designated Agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of the applicant's or recipient's failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;


(ii) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part;


(iii) The action has been approved by the designated Agency official pursuant to § 22.10(e); and


(iv) The expiration of 30 days after the designated Agency official has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.


(2) Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.


(d) *Other means authorized by law.* No action to effect compliance with Title VI by any other means authorized by law shall be taken by the Department of the Treasury until:


(1) The designated Agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;


(2) The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and


(3) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with the regulation and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
