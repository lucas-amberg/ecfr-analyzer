# ยง 23.2   What is the purpose of Treasury's age discrimination regulations?

The purpose of these regulations is to set out Treasury's policies and procedures under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and the general age discrimination regulations at 45 CFR part 90. The Act and the general regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act and the general regulations permit federally assisted programs and activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and factors other than age that meet the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations. These regulations do not apply to actions arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, Public Law 90-202, 29 U.S.C. 621 through 634 (ADEA), and do not in any way affect the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulations implementing the ADEA at 29 CFR 1625, 1626, and 1627.
