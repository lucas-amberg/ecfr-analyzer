(a) The Guaranty shall cease to be effective with respect to any Guaranteed Loan Amount or any Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or any Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent to the extent that:


(1) The Guaranteed Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, is separated at any time from the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, in any way, directly or through the issuance of any Guaranteed-Amount Equity Derivative or any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative; or


(2) Any holder of the Private Loan Note or any Private Loan Portion Note or any Derivative, as the case may be, having a claim to payments on the Private Loan receives more than 90 percent of any payment due to such holder from payments made under the Guaranty at any time during the term of the Private Loan.


(b) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is issued, the Guaranty shall not cease to be effective with respect to any Guaranteed Loan Amount or any Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or any Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, if both of the circumstances described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.


(1) A Borrower shall have delivered to the Secretary of the treasury evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury, that the Interest Rate Difference will be substantial.


(i) To be considered, the evidence must meet the following requirements:


(A) The Borrower must show that the Interest Rate Difference is directly attributable to paragraph (a) of this section being applied to the Private Loan, that is, that the Interest Rate Difference will exist even when all other financing terms of the Private Loan, including any collateralization of the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, are identical;


(B) When calculating the Interest Rate Difference, the Borrower must assume that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, will be collateralized by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, unless the Borrower is legally prohibited from so collateralizing the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, or the Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the Borrower is unable to so collateralize the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent;


(C) If the Borrower is legally prohibited from collateralizing the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Loan Guaranteed Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, with securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States or has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the Borrower is unable to so collateralize the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, then the Borrower may calculate the Interest Rate Difference using whatever collateralization assumptions the Borrower elects;


(D) If the Borrower delivers evidence to the Secretary of the Treasury respecting the Interest Rate Difference, which evidence assumes either that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, will not be collateralized at all or that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, will be collateralized, but not by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, then the Borrower must also deliver to the Secretary of the Treasury the written agreement of the Borrower, which agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury, that the Borrower will not collateralize the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, at any time during the term of the Private Loan in any way different from the assumptions used in calculating the Interest Rate Difference; and


(E) The Borrower must deliver to the Secretary of the Treasury the evidence pertaining to the Interest Rate Difference at the time that the Borrower submits to DSAA its plan for prepayment, if any, if no plan of prepayment is submitted, then no later than 10 days prior to the time that the Borrower submits to DSAA its prepayment application.


(ii) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the evidence submitted by the Borrower pertaining to the Interest Rate Difference is satisfactory in form and in substance, and that the Interest Rate Difference is substantial, a modified version of the Guaranty (deleting therefrom the provision that the Guaranty shall cease to be effective if any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is issued) will be attached to the Private Loan Note or the Private Loan Portion Notes, as the case may be.


(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall have determined, in the sole discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, that the respective Borrower's loan prepayment at par pursuant to subsection (a) of the Act through the issuance of any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is necessary to achieve the international economic policy interests of the United States.
