# § 29.341   General principle.

(a) Where service is creditable both before and after June 30, 1997, Federal Benefit Payments are computed under the rules of the applicable plan as though—


(1) The employee were eligible to retire effective July 1, 1997, under the same conditions as the actual retirement (that is, using the annuity computation formula that applies under the plan in effect on June 29, 1997, and the retirement age, including any applicable age reduction, based on the age at actual retirement);


(2) The service that became creditable after June 30, 1997, did not exist; and


(3) The average salary is the average salary at separation.


(b) Exceptions to the general principle apply where:


(1) Congress amends the terms of the District Retirement Program in effect on June 29, 1997. For example, see section 11012(e) & (f) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as amended by Public Laws 106-554, 107-290, and 108-133 (codified at D.C. Code section 1-803.02(e) and (f));


(2) The retirement is based on disability after June 30, 1997 (see 29.343); or


(3) The benefit is based on the death of an employee after June 30, 1997 and the survivor benefit is not based on years of service (see 29.344).
