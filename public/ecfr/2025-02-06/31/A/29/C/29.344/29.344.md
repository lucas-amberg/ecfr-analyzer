# ยง 29.344   Survivor benefits.

(a) The general rule that Federal Benefit Payments are calculated under the applicable retirement plan as though the employee were eligible for optional retirement and separated on June 30, 1997, applies to death benefits that are determined by length of service. In these cases, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated by multiplying the survivor's total benefit by the ratio of the deceased retiree or employee's Federal Benefit Payment to the deceased retiree or employee's total annuity. (See examples 13A and B of appendix A of this subpart.)


(b) The general rule that Federal Benefit Payments are calculated under the applicable retirement plan as though the employee were eligible for optional retirement and separated on June 30, 1997, does not apply to death benefits that are not determined by length of service. In these cases, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated by multiplying the survivor's total benefit by the deceased retiree or employee's number of full months of service through June 30, 1997, and then dividing by the retiree or employee's number of months of total service at retirement. (See examples 13C-F of appendix A of this subpart.)


(c) In cases involving a disability or early voluntary retiree who dies before reaching the age at which a Federal Benefit Payment is payable, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated as though the employee had not retired from service, but had separated from service with eligibility to receive a deferred annuity. (See examples 13G and 13H of appendix A of this subpart.)
