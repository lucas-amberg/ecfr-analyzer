(a) In cases in which the total annuity and the Federal Benefit Payment are equally impacted by a cost-of-living adjustment, the new Federal Benefit Payment is determined by applying the federal percentage of the total annuity to the new total annuity. (See examples 14A-G of appendix A of this subpart.)


(b) In cases in which the total annuity and the Federal Benefit Payment are not equally impacted by a change, such as a new plan provision or service-based adjustment, the Federal Benefit Payment is recalculated where applicable, and the federal percentage of the total annuity used to determine subsequent Federal Benefit Payments is recalculated. (See example 14H of appendix A of this subpart.)
