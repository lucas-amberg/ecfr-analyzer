(a) The Department of the Treasury may indemnify, in whole or in part, a Department employee (which for purposes of this regulation shall include a former employee) for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award rendered against such employee, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that (1) the conduct giving rise to such verdict, judgment or award was within the scope of his or her employment and (2) such indemnification is in the interest of the Department of the Treasury.


(b) The Department of the Treasury may pay for the settlement or compromise of a claim against a Department employee at any time, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that (1) the alleged conduct giving rise to the claim was within the scope of the employee's employment and (2) such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the Department of the Treasury.


(c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request to indemnify or to pay for settlement of a claim before entry of an adverse judgment, verdict or other determination.
