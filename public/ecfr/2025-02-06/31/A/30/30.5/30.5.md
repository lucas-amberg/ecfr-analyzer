# ยง 30.5   Q-5: How does a TARP recipient comply with the requirements under ยง 30.4 (Q-4) of this part that the compensation committee discuss, evaluate, and review the SEO compensation plans and employee compensation plans to ensure that the SEO compensation plans do not encourage the SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the TARP recipient, or that the employee compensation plans do not pose unnecessary risks to the TARP recipient?

At least every six months, the compensation committee must discuss, evaluate, and review with the TARP recipient's senior risk officers any risks (including long-term as well as short-term risks) that the TARP recipient faces that could threaten the value of the TARP recipient. The compensation committee must identify the features in the TARP recipient's SEO compensation plans that could lead SEOs to take these risks and the features in the employee compensation plans that pose risks to the TARP recipient, including any features in the SEO compensation plans and the employee compensation plans that would encourage behavior focused on short-term results and not on long-term value creation. The compensation committed is required to limit these features to ensure that the SEOs are not encouraged to take risks that are unnecessary or excessive and that the TARP recipient is not unnecessarily exposed to risks.
