# § 30.7   Q-7: How does a TARP recipient comply with the certification and disclosure requirements under § 30.4 (Q-4) of this part?

(a) *Certification.* The compensation committee must provide the certifications required by § 30.4 (Q-4) of this part stating that it has reviewed, with the TARP recipient's senior risk officers, the SEO compensation plans to ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks, the employee compensation plans to limit any unnecessary risks these plans pose to the TARP recipient, and the employee compensation plans to eliminate any features of these plans that would encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP recipient to enhance the compensation of any employee. For any period during which no obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding, the requirements under this paragraph shall be modified to be consistent with § 30.4(d) (Q-4(d)). Providing a statement similar to the following and in the manner provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as applicable, would satisfy this standard: “The compensation committee certifies that:


(1) It has reviewed with senior risk officers the senior executive officer (SEO) compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of [identify TARP recipient];


(2) It has reviewed with senior risk officers the employee compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to limit any unnecessary risks these plans pose to the [identify TARP recipient]; and


(3) It has reviewed the employee compensation plans to eliminate any features of these plans that would encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of [identify TARP recipient] to enhance the compensation of any employee.”


(b) *Disclosure.* At least once per TARP recipient fiscal year, the compensation committee must provide a narrative description identifying each SEO compensation plan and explaining how the SEO compensation plan does not encourage the SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the TARP recipient. The compensation committee must also identify each employee compensation plan, explain how any unnecessary risks posed by the employee compensation plan have been limited, and further explain how the employee compensation plan does not encourage the manipulation of reported earnings to enhance the compensation of any employee.


(c) *Location.* For TARP recipients with securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities law, the compensation committee must provide these certifications and disclosures in the Compensation Committee Report required pursuant to Item 407(e) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.407(e)) and to Treasury. These disclosures must be provided in the Compensation Committee Report for any disclosure pertaining to any fiscal year any portion of which is a TARP period (for a TARP recipient with an obligation), or for any disclosure pertaining to any fiscal year including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation). Within 120 days of the completion of a fiscal year during any part of which is a TARP period (for a TARP recipient with an obligation), or the completion of a fiscal year including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation), a TARP recipient that is a smaller reporting company must provide the certifications of the compensation committee to its primary regulatory agency and to Treasury.


(d) *Application to private TARP recipients.* The rules provided in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are also applicable to TARP recipients that do not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws. Within 120 days of the completion of the fiscal year during any part of which is a TARP period (for a TARP recipient with an obligation), or the completion of a fiscal year including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation), a private TARP recipient must provide the certification of the compensation committee (or board of directors, as applicable under § 30.4 (Q-4)) to its primary regulatory agency and to Treasury.
