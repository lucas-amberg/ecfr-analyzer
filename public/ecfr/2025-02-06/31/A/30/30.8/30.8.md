# § 30.8   Q-8: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with the standards established under section 111(b)(3)(B) of EESA (the “clawback” provision requirement)?

To comply with the standards established under section 111(b)(3)(B) of EESA, a TARP recipient must ensure that any bonus payment made to a SEO or the next twenty most highly compensated employees during the TARP period is subject to a provision for recovery or “clawback” by the TARP recipient if the bonus payment was based on materially inaccurate financial statements (which includes, but is not limited to, statements of earnings, revenues, or gains) or any other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria. Whether a financial statement or performance metric criteria is materially inaccurate depends on all the facts and circumstances. However, for this purpose, a financial statement or performance metric criteria shall be treated as materially inaccurate with respect to any employee who knowingly engaged in providing inaccurate information (including knowingly failing to timely correct inaccurate information) relating to those financial statements or performance metrics. Otherwise, with respect to a performance criteria, whether the inaccurate measurement of the performance or inaccurate application of the performance to the performance criteria is material depends on whether the actual performance or accurate application of the actual performance to the performance criteria is materially different from the performance required under the performance criteria or the inaccurate application of the actual performance to the performance criteria. The TARP recipient must exercise its clawback rights except to the extent it demonstrates that it is unreasonable to do so, such as, for example, if the expense of enforcing the rights would exceed the amount recovered. For the purpose of this section, a bonus payment is deemed to be made to an individual when the individual obtains a legally binding right to that payment.
