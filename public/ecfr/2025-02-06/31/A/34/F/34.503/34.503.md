Each Gulf Coast State, through its Governor or the Governor's designee, must submit a State Expenditure Plan to the Council for its approval that describes each activity for which the state seeks funding. The Council must develop requirements for these plans, including the requirements below.


(a) The State Expenditure Plan must be developed by:


(1) In Alabama, the Alabama Gulf Coast Recovery Council.


(2) In Florida, a consortium of local political subdivisions that includes, at a minimum, one representative of each county affected by the *Deepwater Horizon* oil spill.


(3) In Louisiana, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana, as approved by the Board.


(4) In Mississippi, the Office of the Governor or an appointee of the Office of the Governor.


(5) In Texas, the Office of the Governor or an appointee of the Office of the Governor.


(b) The State Expenditure Plan must describe how it takes into consideration the Comprehensive Plan and is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, the State Expenditure Plan must describe the processes used:


(1) To evaluate and select activities included in the plan;


(2) To assess the capability of third party entities that will implement activities in the plan;


(3) To prevent conflicts of interest in the development and implementation of the plan;


(4) To obtain public review and comment in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section; and


(5) To verify compliance with the requirements of § 34.203 and this subpart.


(c) For each activity in the State Expenditure Plan, the plan must include a narrative description demonstrating:


(1) The need for, purpose, and objectives of the activity;


(2) How the activity is eligible for funding and meets all requirements of § 34.203 and this subpart;


(3) Location of the activity;


(4) Budget for the activity;


(5) Milestones for the activity;


(6) Projected completion dates for the activity; and


(7) Criteria the applicant will use to evaluate the success of each activity in helping to restore and protect the Gulf Coast Region. Plans can be phased or incremental and may be modified with the Council's approval. If funding has been requested from other sources, including other components of the Act, the plan must identify the source, state how much funding was requested, and provide the current status of the request.


(d) The State Expenditure Plan must demonstrate how the activities in the plan will contribute to the overall economic and ecological recovery of the Gulf Coast, and how each activity that would restore and protect natural resources, ecosystems, fisheries, marine and wildlife habitats, beaches, coastal wetlands or the economy of the Gulf Coast is based on the best available science.


(e) The State Expenditure Plan must demonstrate that activities described in § 34.201(a) through (g) will be carried out in the Gulf Coast Region, as described in § 34.203(c).


(f) No more than 25 percent of funding under the Spill Impact Component is available to a Gulf Coast State under this subpart to pay for infrastructure, unless the Governor or the Governor's representative on the Council certifies that:


(1) The ecosystem restoration needs in the state will be addressed by the activities in the proposed plan; and


(2) Additional investment in infrastructure is required to mitigate the impacts of the *Deepwater Horizon* Oil Spill to the ecosystem or economy.


(g) Before being submitted to the Council for approval, a State Expenditure Plan must be available for public review and comment for a minimum of 45 days, in a manner calculated to obtain broad-based participation from individuals, businesses, Indian tribes, and non-profit organizations.


(h) If the Council disapproves a State Expenditure Plan, the Council must notify the impacted state in writing and consult with the state to address any identified deficiencies with the plan. If the Council fails to approve or take action within 60 days after the date on which the Council receives the plan, the state may obtain expedited judicial review within 90 days in a United States district court located in the state seeking the review.


(i) The Council must publish guidelines explaining when modifications to a State Expenditure Plan require the Council's approval. Material modifications to a State Expenditure Plan are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
