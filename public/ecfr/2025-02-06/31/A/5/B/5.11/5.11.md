# § 5.11   How will Treasury entities use tax refund offset to collect a Treasury debt?

(a) *Tax refund offset.* In most cases, the Financial Management Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Treasury debts by the offset of tax refunds and other Federal payments. *See* § 5.9(c) of this part. If not already transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 5.9 of this part, Treasury entities will refer to the Treasury Offset Program any past-due, legally enforceable debt for collection by tax refund offset. *See* 26 U.S.C. 6402(d), 31 U.S.C. 3720A and 31 CFR 285.2. 


(b) *Notice.* At least sixty (60) days prior to referring a debt to the Treasury Offset Program, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 5.4 of this part. Treasury entities will certify to the Financial Management Service's Treasury Offset Program, in writing, that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted and that the Treasury entities have made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt as described in 31 CFR 285.2(d). In addition, Treasury entities will certify their compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements described in this part and other Federal laws. *See* 31 U.S.C. 3720A(b) and 31 CFR 285.2. 


(c) *Administrative review.* The notice described in § 5.4 of this part shall provide the debtor with at least 60 days prior to the initiation of tax refund offset to request an administrative review as described in § 5.10(c) of this part. Treasury entities may suspend collection through tax refund offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of the debtor's dispute.
