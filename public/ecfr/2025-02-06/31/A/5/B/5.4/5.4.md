# § 5.4   What notice will Treasury entities send to a debtor when collecting a Treasury debt?

(a) *Notice requirements.* Treasury entities shall aggressively collect Treasury debts. Treasury entities shall promptly send at least one written notice to a debtor informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to pay or otherwise resolve a Treasury debt. The notice(s) shall be sent to the debtor at the most current address of the debtor in the records of the Treasury entity collecting the debt. Generally, before starting the collection actions described in §§ 5.5 and 5.9 through 5.17 of this part, Treasury entities will send no more than two written notices to the debtor. The purpose of the notice(s) is to explain why the debt is owed, the amount of the debt, how a debtor may pay the debt or make alternate repayment arrangements, how a debtor may review documents related to the debt, how a debtor may dispute the debt, the collection remedies available to Treasury entities if the debtor refuses to pay the debt, and other consequences to the debtor if the debt is not paid. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the written notice(s) shall explain to the debtor: 


(1) The nature and amount of the debt, and the facts giving rise to the debt; 


(2) How interest, penalties, and administrative costs are added to the debt, the date by which payment should be made to avoid such charges, and that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with 31 CFR 901.9 (*see* § 5.5 of this part); 


(3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid the enforced collection actions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

(i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing; 


(ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th business day following the date of the notice will stay the commencement of administrative wage garnishment, but not necessarily other collection procedures; and 


(iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a hearing should be sent. 


(11) How a debtor who is a Federal employee subject to Federal salary offset may request a hearing (*see* § 5.12(e) of this part), including: 


(i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing; 


(ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th calendar day following receipt of the notice will stay the commencement of salary offset, but not necessarily other collection procedures; 


(iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a hearing should be sent; 


(iv) That the Treasury entity will refer the debt to the debtor's employing agency or to the Financial Management Service to implement salary offset, unless the employee files a timely request for a hearing;
