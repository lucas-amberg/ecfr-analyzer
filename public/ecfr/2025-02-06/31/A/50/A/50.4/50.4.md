(ii) Property and casualty insurance losses resulting from the act, in the aggregate, do not exceed $5,000,000. For these purposes, property and casualty insurance losses include any amounts subject to payment under a property and casualty insurance policy, even if the policyholder declined to obtain terrorism risk insurance under the policy or is otherwise ultimately responsible for the payment.


(3) *Judicial review precluded.* The Secretary's certification of an act of terrorism, or determination not to certify an act as an act of terrorism, is final and is not subject to judicial review.


(c)(1) *Affiliate* means, with respect to an insurer, any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the insurer. An affiliate must itself meet the definition of insurer to participate in the Program.


(2)(i) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an insurer has control over another insurer for purposes of the Program if:


(A) The insurer directly or indirectly or acting through one or more other persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the other insurer;


(B) The insurer controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the other insurer; or


(C) The Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that an insurer directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the other insurer, even if there is no control as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section.


(ii) An entity, including any affiliate thereof, does not have control or exercise controlling influence over a reciprocal insurer under this section if, as of January 12, 2015, the entity, including any affiliate thereof, was acting as an attorney-in-fact for the reciprocal insurer, provided that the entity does not, for reasons other than activities it may perform under the attorney-in-fact relationship, have control over the reciprocal insurer as otherwise defined under this section.


(3) An insurer described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section is conclusively deemed to have control.


(4) For purposes of a determination of controlling influence under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section, if an insurer is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, the following rebuttable presumptions will apply:


(i) If an insurer controls another insurer under the laws of a state, and at least one of the factors listed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer that has control under state law exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the other insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.


(ii) If an insurer provides 25 percent or more of another insurer's capital (in the case of a stock insurer), policyholder surplus (in the case of a mutual insurer), or corporate capital (in the case of other entities that qualify as insurers), and at least one of the factors listed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer providing such capital, policyholder surplus, or corporate capital exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the receiving insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.


(iii) If an insurer, at any time during a calendar year, supplies 25 percent or more of the underwriting capacity for that year to an insurer that is a syndicate consisting of one or more incorporated or individual unincorporated underwriters, and at least one of the factors in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer exercises a controlling influence over the syndicate for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.


(iv) If paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section are not applicable, but two or more of the following factors apply to an insurer, with respect to another insurer, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the other insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section:


(A) The insurer is one of the two largest shareholders of any class of voting stock;


(B) The insurer holds more than 35 percent of the combined debt securities and equity of the other insurer;


(C) The insurer is party to an agreement pursuant to which the insurer possesses a material economic stake in the other insurer resulting from a profit-sharing arrangement, use of common names, facilities or personnel, or the provision of essential services to the other insurer;


(D) The insurer is party to an agreement that enables the insurer to influence a material aspect of the management or policies of the other insurer;


(E) The insurer would have the ability, other than through the holding of revocable proxies, to direct the votes of more than 25 percent of the other insurer's voting stock in the future upon the occurrence of an event;


(F) The insurer has the power to direct the disposition of more than 25 percent of a class of voting stock of the other insurer in a manner other than a widely dispersed or public offering;


(G) The insurer and/or the insurer's representative or nominee constitute more than one member of the other insurer's board of directors; or


(H) The insurer or its nominee or an officer of the insurer serves as the chairman of the board, chairman of the executive committee, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer or in any position with similar policymaking authority in the other insurer.


(5) An insurer that is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section may request a hearing in which the insurer may rebut a presumption of controlling influence under paragraph (c)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section or otherwise request a determination of controlling influence by presenting and supporting its position through written submissions to Treasury, and in Treasury's discretion, through informal oral presentations, in accordance with the procedure in § 50.7.


(6) An insurer's affiliates for a calendar year, for purposes of subpart H of this part, shall be determined in accordance with the timing requirements laid out in § 50.75 of this part.


(d) *Aggregate Federal share of compensation* means the aggregate amount paid by Treasury for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses in a calendar year.


(e) *Assessment period* means a period, established by Treasury, during which policyholders of property and casualty insurance policies must pay, and insurers must collect, the Federal terrorism policy surcharge for remittance to Treasury.


(f) *Attorney-in-fact* means a person or entity appointed by the subscribers or members of a reciprocal insurer to act for and bind the reciprocal insurer under relevant state law for the benefit of its subscribers or members.


(g) *Captive insurer* means an insurer licensed under the captive insurance laws or regulations of any state.


(h) *Direct earned premium* means direct earned premium for all property and casualty insurance issued by any insurer for insurance against all losses, including losses from an act of terrorism, occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.


(1) *State-licensed or admitted insurers.* For a state licensed or admitted insurer that reports to the NAIC, direct earned premium is the premium information for property and casualty insurance reported by the insurer on column 2 of the Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement (commonly known as Statutory Page 14).


(i) Premium information as reported to state regulators through the NAIC should be included in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program only to the extent it reflects premiums for property and casualty insurance issued by the insurer against losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.


(ii) Premiums for personal property and casualty lines of insurance (insurance primarily designed to cover personal, family or household risk exposures, with the exception of insurance written to insure 1 to 4 family rental dwellings owned for the business purpose of generating income for the property owner), or premiums for any other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of property and casualty insurance, should be excluded in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program.


(iii) Personal property and casualty lines of insurance coverage that includes incidental coverage for commercial purposes are primarily personal coverage, and therefore premiums may be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of this section, commercial coverage is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium is attributable to commercial coverage. Property and casualty insurance against losses occurring at locations other than the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, or other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of property and casualty insurance, but that includes incidental coverage for commercial risk exposures at such locations, is primarily not commercial, and therefore premiums for such insurance may also be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of this section, property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to coverage at such locations. Also for purposes of this section, coverage for commercial risk exposures is incidental if it is combined with coverages that otherwise do not meet the definition of property and casualty insurance and less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to the coverage for commercial risk exposures.


(iv) If an insurance policy covers both commercial and personal property and casualty exposures, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk between commercial and personal components in order to ascertain direct earned premium. If a policy includes insurance coverage that meets the definition of property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, but also includes other coverage, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk attributable to the components in order to ascertain direct earned premium.


(2) *Insurers that do not report to NAIC.* An insurer that does not report to the NAIC, but that is licensed or admitted by any state (such as certain farm or county mutual insurers), should use the guidance provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section to assist in ascertaining its direct earned premium.


(i) Direct earned premium may be ascertained by adjusting data maintained by such insurer or reported by such insurer to its state regulator to reflect a breakdown of premiums for commercial and personal property and casualty exposure risk as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and, if necessary, re-stated to reflect the accrual method of determining direct earned premium versus direct premium.


(ii) Such an insurer should consider other types of payments that compensate the insurer for risk of loss (contributions, assessments, etc.) as part of its direct earned premium.


(3) *Certain eligible surplus line carrier insurers.* An eligible surplus line carrier insurer listed on the NAIC Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers must ascertain its direct earned premium by pricing separately its premium for insurance that meets the definition of property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.


(4) *Federally approved insurers.* A federally approved insurer, defined under section 102(6)(A)(iii) of the Act, should use a methodology similar to that specified for eligible surplus line carrier insurers in paragraph (h)(3) of this section to calculate its direct earned premium. Such calculation should be adjusted to reflect the limitations on scope of insurance coverage under the Program (*i.e.,* to the extent of Federal approval of property and casualty insurance in connection with maritime, energy or aviation activities).


(i) *Direct written premium* means the premium information for property and casualty insurance that is included by an insurer in column 1 of the Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement or in an equivalent reporting requirement. The Federal terrorism policy surcharge is not included in amounts reported as direct written premium.


(j) *Discretionary recoupment amount* means such amount of the aggregate Federal share of compensation in excess of the mandatory recoupment amount that the Secretary has determined will be recouped pursuant to section 103(e)(7)(D) of the Act.


(k) *Federal Insurance Office* means the Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury.


(l) *Federal terrorism policy surcharge* means the amount established by Treasury under subpart J of this part that is imposed as a policy surcharge on property and casualty insurance policies, expressed as a percentage of the written premium.


(m) *Insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount* means an amount for a calendar year as calculated under section 103(e)(6) of the Act.


(1) For calendar years beginning with 2015 through 2019, such amount is the lesser of the aggregate amount, for all insurers, of insured losses once there has been a Program Trigger Event during the calendar year and:


(i) For calendar year 2015: $29,500,000,000;


(ii) For calendar year 2016: $31,500,000,000;


(iii) For calendar year 2017: $33,500,000,000;


(iv) For calendar year 2018: $35,500,000,000; and


(v) For calendar year 2019: $37,500,000,000.


(2) For calendar years beginning with 2020 and any calendar year thereafter as may be necessary, such amount is the lesser of the aggregate amount, for all insurers, of insured losses once there has been a Program Trigger Event during the calendar year and the annual average of the sum of insurer deductibles for all insurers for the prior 3 years, to be calculated by taking:


(i) The total amount of direct earned premium reported by insurers to Treasury pursuant to § 50.51 in the three calendar years prior to the calendar year in question, and then dividing that figure by three; and


(ii) Multiplying the resulting three-year average figure by 20%.


(3) For calendar year 2020 and each subsequent calendar year, Treasury shall publish in the _Federal Register_ the insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount no later than December 31 of the prior calendar year.


(n) *Insured loss.* (1) The term insured loss means any loss resulting from an act of terrorism (including an act of war, in the case of workers' compensation) that is covered by primary or excess property and casualty insurance issued by an insurer if the loss:


(i) Occurs within the United States;


(ii) Occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), or to a United States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), regardless of where the loss occurs; however, to the extent a loss occurs to such an air carrier or vessel outside the United States, the insured loss does not include losses covered by third party insurance contracts that are separate from the insurance coverage provided to the air carrier or vessel; or


(iii) Occurs at the premises of any United States mission.


(2) The term insured loss includes reasonable loss adjustment expenses, incurred by an insurer in connection with insured losses, that are allocated and identified by claim file in insurer records, including expenses incurred in the investigation, adjustment, and defense of claims, but excluding staff salaries, overhead, and other insurer expenses that would have been incurred notwithstanding the insured loss.


(3) The term insured loss does not include:


(i) Punitive or exemplary damages awarded or paid in connection with the Federal cause of action specified in section 107(a)(1) of the Act. The term “punitive or exemplary damages” means damages that are not compensatory but are an award of money made to a claimant solely to punish or deter; or


(ii) Extra-contractual damages awarded against, or paid by, an insurer; or


(iii) Payments by an insurer in excess of policy limits; or


(iv) Amounts paid by a policyholder as required under the terms and conditions of property and casualty insurance issued by an insurer.

(*1*) Have gone through a process of being licensed or admitted to engage in the business of providing primary or excess insurance that is administered by the state's insurance regulator, which process generally applies to insurance companies or is similar in scope and content to the process applicable to insurance companies;


(*2*) Be generally subject to State insurance regulation, including financial reporting requirements, applicable to insurance companies within the State; and

(E) As determined by the Secretary, it falls within any of the classes or types of captive insurers or other self-insurance arrangements by municipalities and other entities.

(2) For an insurer that has not had a full year of operations during the immediately preceding calendar year, the insurer deductible will be based on data for direct earned premiums for the applicable calendar year multiplied by 20 percent. If the insurer does not have a full year of operations during the applicable calendar year, the direct earned premiums for the applicable calendar year will be annualized to determine the insurer deductible.


(q) *Mandatory recoupment amount* means the difference between the insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount for a calendar year and the uncompensated insured losses during such calendar year.
