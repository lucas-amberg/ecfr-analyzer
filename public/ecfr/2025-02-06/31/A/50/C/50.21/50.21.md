# § 50.21   Make available.

(a) *General.* The requirement to make available coverage as provided in § 50.20 applies at the time an insurer makes the initial offer of coverage as well as at the time an insurer makes an initial offer of renewal of an existing policy.


(b) *Offer consistent with definition of act of terrorism.* An insurer must make available coverage for insured losses in a policy of property and casualty insurance consistent with the definition of an act of terrorism as defined in § 50.4(b).


(c) *Changes negotiated subsequent to initial offer.* If an insurer satisfies the requirement to make available coverage as described in § 50.20 by first making an offer with coverage for insured losses that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism, which the policyholder or prospective policyholder declines, the insurer may negotiate with the policyholder or prospective policyholder an option of partial coverage for insured losses at a lower amount of coverage if permitted by any applicable state law. An insurer is not required by the Act to offer partial coverage if the policyholder or prospective policyholder declines full coverage. See § 50.23.


(d) *Demonstrations of compliance.* If an insurer makes an offer of insurance but no contract of insurance is concluded, the insurer may demonstrate that it has satisfied the requirement to make available coverage as described in § 50.20 through use of appropriate systems and normal business practices that demonstrate a practice of compliance.
