(1) The insurer is an entity, including an affiliate thereof, that meets the requirements of § 50.4(o);


(2) The insurer's insured losses, as defined in § 50.4(n) and limited by paragraph (d) of this section (including the allocated dollar value of the insurer's proportionate share of insured losses from a state residual market insurance entity or a state workers' compensation fund as described in § 50.33), have exceeded its insurer deductible as defined in § 50.4(p);


(3) The insurer has paid or is prepared to pay an insured loss, based on a filed claim for the insured loss;

(5) The insurer has provided a clear and conspicuous disclosure as required by §§ 50.10 through 50.14 and a cap disclosure as required by § 50.15;


(6) The insurer offered coverage for insured losses and the offer was accepted by the insured prior to the act which results in the insured loss;


(7) The insurer took all steps reasonably necessary to properly and carefully investigate the insured loss and otherwise processed the insured loss using practices appropriate for the business of insurance;


(8) The insured loss is within the scope of coverage issued by the insurer under the terms and conditions of one or more policies for commercial property and casualty insurance as defined in § 50.4(w); and


(9) The procedures specified in this Subpart have been followed and all conditions for payment have been met.


(d) *Adjustments.* Treasury may subsequently adjust, including requiring repayment of, any payment made under paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with its authority under the Act.


(e) *Suspension of payment for other insured losses.* Upon a determination by Treasury that an insurer has failed to meet any of the requirements for payment specified in paragraph (c) of this section for a particular insured loss, Treasury may suspend payment of the Federal share of compensation for all other insured losses of the insurer pending investigation and audit of the insurer's insured losses.


(f) *Aggregate industry losses.* Treasury will determine the amount of aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism. If aggregate industry insured losses in a calendar year resulting from one or more certified acts of terrorism exceed the applicable Program Trigger amounts specified in paragraph (b) of this section, Treasury will publish a document in the _Federal Register_ of a Program Trigger Event.
