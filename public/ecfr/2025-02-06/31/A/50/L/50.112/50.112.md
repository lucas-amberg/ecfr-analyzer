# § 50.112   Determination of 

(a) *Pro rata loss percentage (PRLP)* is the percentage determined by the Secretary to be applied by an insurer against the amount that would otherwise be paid by the insurer under the terms and conditions of an insurance policy providing property and casualty insurance under the Program if there were no cap on annual liability under section 103(e)(2)(A) of the Act.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if Treasury estimates that aggregate insured losses may exceed the cap on annual liability for a calendar year, then Treasury will determine a PRLP. The PRLP applies to insured loss payments by insurers for insured losses incurred in the subject calendar year, as specified in § 50.113, from the effective date of the PRLP, as established by Treasury, until such time as Treasury provides notice that the PRLP is revised. Treasury will determine the PRLP based on the following considerations:


(1) Estimates of insured losses from insurance industry statistical organizations;


(2) Any data calls issued by Treasury (see § 50.114);


(3) Expected reliability and accuracy of insured loss estimates and likelihood that insured loss estimates could increase;


(4) Estimates of insured losses and expenses not included in available statistical reporting;


(5) Such other factors as the Secretary considers important.


(c) Treasury shall provide notice of the determination of the PRLP through publication in the _Federal Register,_ or in another manner Treasury deems appropriate, based upon the circumstances of the act of terrorism under consideration.


(d) As appropriate, Treasury will determine any revision to a PRLP based on the same considerations listed in paragraph (b) of this section, and will provide notice for its application to insured loss payments.


(e) If Treasury estimates based on an initial act of terrorism or subsequent act of terrorism within a calendar year that aggregate insured losses may exceed the cap on annual liability, but an appropriate PRLP cannot yet be determined, Treasury will provide notification advising insurers of this circumstance and, after consulting with the relevant state authorities, may initiate the action described in either paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section.


(1) *Hiatus in payments.* Call a hiatus in insurer loss payments for insured losses of up to two weeks. In such a circumstance, Treasury will determine a PRLP as quickly as possible. The PRLP, as later determined, will be effective retroactively as of the start of the hiatus. Any insured losses submitted in support of an insurer's claim for the Federal share of compensation will be reviewed for the insurer's compliance with *pro rata* payments in accordance with the effective date of the PRLP.


(2) *Determine an interim PRLP.* (i) An interim PRLP is an amount determined without the availability of information necessary for consideration of all factors listed in § 50.112(b). It is a conservatively low percentage amount determined in order to facilitate initial partial claim payments by insurers after an act of terrorism and prior to the time that information becomes available to determine a PRLP based on consideration of the factors listed in § 50.112(b).


(ii) In such a circumstance, Treasury will determine a PRLP to replace the interim PRLP as quickly as possible. The PRLP, as later determined, will be effective retroactively as of the effective date of the interim PRLP. Any insured losses submitted in support of an insurer's claim for the Federal share of compensation will be reviewed for the insurer's compliance with *pro rata* payments in accordance with the effective date of the interim PRLP, or as later replaced by the PRLP as appropriate.
