# ยง 6.5   Standards for awards.

(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the *final* disposition of a proceeding, unless (1) the position of the agency was substantially justified, or (2) special circumstances make the award unjust. No presumption arises that the agency's position was not substantially justified simply because the agency did not prevail.


(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
