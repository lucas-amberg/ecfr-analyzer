# ยง 92.11   Purpose.

(a) The procedures in this subpart implement the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 333(c), which authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to assess a civil penalty against any person who has misused the words, titles, abbreviations, initials, symbols, emblems, seals, or badges of the United States Mint in violation of 31 U.S.C. 333(a).


(b) The procedures in this subpart do not apply to the extent that the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the United States Mint, or their authorized designees have specifically granted to the person express permission, in writing, to manufacture, produce, sell, possess, or use the words, titles, abbreviations, initials, symbols, emblems, seals, or badges in a contract, agreement, license, letter, memorandum, or similar document.


(c) The procedures in this subpart are limited to actions initiated by the United States Mint to enforce the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 333. The procedures herein do not affect the provisions of 31 CFR part 27. Therefore, this subpart shall not be construed as the exclusive means for the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce 31 U.S.C. 333 insofar as a covered misuse affects the United States Mint.
