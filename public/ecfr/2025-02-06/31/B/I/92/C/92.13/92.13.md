# § 92.13   Assessment of civil penalties.

(a) *General rule.* The assessing official may impose a civil penalty on any person when the following two conditions are met:


(1) That person uses in connection with, or as a part of, any advertisement, solicitation, business activity, or product, whether alone or with other words, letters, symbols, or emblems—


(i) The words “Department of the Treasury,” “United States Mint,” or “U.S. Mint”;


(ii) The titles “Secretary of the Treasury,” “Treasurer of the United States,” “Director of the United States Mint,” or “Director of the U.S. Mint”;


(iii) The abbreviations or initials of any entity or title referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section;


(iv) Any symbol, emblem, seal, or badge of an entity referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (including the design of any envelope, stationery, or identification card used by such an entity); or


(v) Any colorable imitation of any such words, titles, abbreviations, initials, symbols, emblems, seals, or badges; and


(2) That person's use is in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted or construed as conveying the false impression that such advertisement, solicitation, business activity, or product is in any manner approved, endorsed, sponsored, authorized by, or associated with the United States Mint, or any officer, or employee thereof.


(b) *Disclaimers.* Any determination of whether a person has violated the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall be made without regard to any use of a disclaimer of affiliation with the United States Government or any particular agency or instrumentality thereof.


(c) *Civil penalty.* The assessing official may impose a civil penalty on any person who violates the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The amount of a civil penalty shall not exceed $5,000 for each and every use of any material in violation of paragraph (a) of this section, except that such penalty shall not exceed $25,000 for each and every use if such use is in a broadcast or telecast.


(d) *Time limitations.* (1) Civil penalties imposed under the procedures in this subpart must be assessed before the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of offense.


(2) The assessing official may commence a civil action to recover or enforce any civil penalty imposed in a Final Notice of Assessment issued pursuant to § 92.17 at any time before the end of the two-year period beginning on the date of the Final Notice of Assessment. If judicial review of the Final Notice of Assessment is sought, the two-year period begins to run from the date that a final and unappealable court order is issued.


(e) *Criminal Proceeding.* No civil penalty may be imposed under the procedures in this subpart with respect to any violation of paragraph (a) of this section after a criminal proceeding on the same violation has been commenced by indictment or information under 31 U.S.C. 333(d).
