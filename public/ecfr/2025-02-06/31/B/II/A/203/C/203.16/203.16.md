# ยง 203.16   Retainer and investor depositaries.

(a) *Credit to TIP main account balance.* On the business day that the TSC receives an AOC from a retainer or investor depositary, the TSC will credit the depositary's TIP main account balance for the amount reported on the AOC unless there isn't sufficient capacity. In that case, any amount in excess of the capacity will be debited to the reserve account and credited to the TGA.


(b) *Late delivery of AOC.* If an AOC does not arrive at the TSC before the designated cutoff time for receipt, the TSC will credit the amount of funds to the depositary's TIP main account balance as of the date of receipt of the AOC. However, the date on which funds will begin to earn interest for Treasury is the next business day after the AOC date.
