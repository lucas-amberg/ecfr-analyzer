# ยง 205.10   How do you document funding techniques?

The Treasury-State agreement must include a concise description for each funding technique that a State will use. The description must include the following: 


(a) What constitutes a timely request for funds; 


(b) How the State determines the amount of funds to request; 


(c) What procedures are used to project or reconcile estimates with actual and immediate cash needs; 


(d) What constitutes the timely receipt of funds; and 


(e) Whether a State or Federal interest liability accrues when the funding technique, including any associated procedure for projection or reconciliation, is properly applied.
