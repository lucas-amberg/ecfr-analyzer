# ยง 206.5   Collection and deposit procedure exceptions.

(a) The following collection and deposit timeframe requirements are to be followed in exception cases where EFT mechanisms are not utilized:


(1) An agency will achieve same-day deposit of monies. Where same day deposit is not cost-effective or is impracticable, next day deposit of monies must be achieved except in those cases covered by I TFM 6-8000.


(2) Deposits will be made at a time of the day prior to the depositary's specified cutoff time, but as late as possible in order to maximize daily deposit amounts.


(3) When cost-beneficial to the Government, an agency may make multiple deposits.


(b) Any additional exceptions to the above policies are listed in I TFM 6-8000.
