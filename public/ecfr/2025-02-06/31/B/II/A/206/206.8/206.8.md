# § 206.8   Appeals.

(a) An agency that chooses to file an appeal must submit the appeal in writing to the Commissioner within 45 days of the date of the Notice of Deficiency. In the event of an appeal, the charge imposed under Notice of Deficiency will be deferred pending the results of the appeal. If an appeal is not submitted (*i.e.*, received by the Commissioner) within 45 days, the amount indicated in the Notice of Deficiency will be charged per § 206.9(a).


(b) The appeal will contain the elements and follow the submission procedures specified in I TFM 6-8000. The appeal will include the background leading to the Notice of Deficiency, the basis of the appeal, and the action requested by an agency. An agency should state its disagreements with the Notice of Deficiency which may include cost-benefit factors, the amount of the charge, and other items.


(c) An agency must state what action it requests in its appeal. An agency may request that the Notice of Deficiency be completely overturned for cost-benefit or other considerations. Alternatively, an agency may request a reduced charge, deferral of the charge, an alternative solution to cash management improvement, or a combination of these actions.


(d) *Appeals Board.* The Commissioner will refer the appeal to an Appeals Board. The Appeals Board will consist of three members—two permanent members and one temporary member. The permanent members will be the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Department of the Treasury, and the Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance, of the Service. The temporary board member will be a cash management official from an agency other than the agency appealing the Notice of Deficiency. The Board will be convened on an as-needed basis. The order of agency assignment to the Board will be published by Treasury in Volume I, Chapter 6-8000 of the TFM. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Department of the Treasury, the Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance, and the designated agency cash management official may delegate their responsibility to a staff subordinate having sufficient experience in cash management matters. The Assistant Commissioner's designee may be from any area other than that which issued the Notice of Deficiency.


(e) *Appeal review process.* The Appeals Board will review the Notice of Deficiency, any additional information submitted by the Service, and the written appeal from an agency. Based on this review, the Board may decide additional investigation is required. The Board may request an agency and/or the Service to meet with the Board as part of the review process.


(f) *Appeal finding.* A written majority decision will be rendered by the Appeals Board within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. The Board may extend this period for an additional period, not to exceed 30 days, if required. The Appeals Board will notify the Commissioner and the agency of the decision. The decision of the Board whether to uphold the Notice of Deficiency, to overturn the Notice of Deficiency, or to mandate some other action will be stated in the finding. Other action mandated may include a reduced charge, a deferral of the charge, an alternate solution to cash management improvement, or a combination of these actions. The basis of the decision, the amount of the charge, and the effective date of the charge will be stated in the finding. The effective date of the charge may be retroactive to the date indicated in the Notice of Deficiency.


(g) Any terms related to charge deferral shall be stated; the Service and an agency will be required to submit evidence of compliance to such terms at a future specified date. At this future time, the Appeals Board will review the evidence of compliance. Based on this evidence, the Board will decide whether to impose a charge.
