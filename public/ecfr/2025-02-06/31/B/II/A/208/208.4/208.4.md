# § 208.4   Waivers.

(a) Payment by electronic funds transfer is not required in the following cases:


(1) Where an individual:


(i) Was born prior to May 1, 1921, and was receiving payment by check on March 1, 2013;


(ii) Receives a type of payment for which Treasury does not offer delivery to a Treasury-sponsored account. In such cases, those payments are not required to be made by electronic funds transfer, unless and until such payments become eligible for deposit to a Treasury-sponsored account. However, if Treasury provides an agency with an option to begin delivering a type of Federal benefit payment to a Treasury-sponsored account, the agency must file a waiver request with Treasury to make Federal benefit payments of that type by any means other than by electronic funds transfer;


(iii) Is ineligible for a Treasury-sponsored account because of suspension or cancellation of the individual's Treasury-sponsored account by the Financial Agent;


(iv) Has filed a waiver request with Treasury certifying that payment by electronic funds transfer would impose a hardship because of the individual's inability to manage an account at a financial institution or a Treasury-sponsored account due to a mental impairment, and Treasury has not rejected the request; or


(v) Has filed a waiver request with Treasury certifying that payment by electronic funds transfer would impose a hardship because of the individual's inability to manage an account at a financial institution or a Treasury-sponsored account due to the individual living in a remote geographic location lacking the infrastructure to support electronic financial transactions, and Treasury has not rejected the request;


(2) Where the political, financial, or communications infrastructure in a foreign country does not support payment by electronic funds transfer;


(3) Where the payment is in a foreign currency and Treasury does not support electronic payment in that currency.


(4) Where the payment is to a recipient within an area designated by the President or an authorized agency administrator as a disaster area. This waiver is limited to payments made within 120 days after the disaster is declared. An agency must file a waiver request with Treasury (which must be approved by Treasury) to extend this waiver beyond 120 days after the disaster is declared.


(5) Where either:


(i) A military operation is designated by the Secretary of Defense in which uniformed services undertake military actions against an enemy; or


(ii) A call or order to, or retention on, active duty of members of the uniformed services is made during a war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress;


(6) Where a threat may be posed to national security, the life or physical safety of any individual may be endangered, or a law enforcement action may be compromised;


(7) Where the agency does not expect to make multiple payments to the same recipient within a one-year period on a regular, recurring basis but only if the payments are made to an individual or a small business concern where “small business concern” has the meaning given the term in section 3 of the Small Business Act at 15 U.S.C. 632 and its implementing regulations; and


(8) Where an agency's need for goods and services is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than electronic funds transfer; or, where there is only one source for goods or services and the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than electronic funds transfer. An agency must file a waiver request with Treasury (which must be approved by Treasury) to utilize this waiver.


(b) An individual who requests a waiver under paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (v) or an agency who requests a waiver under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (a)(4), or (a)(8) of this section shall provide, in writing, to Treasury a certification supporting that request, in such form that Treasury may prescribe. The individual shall attest to the certification before a notary public, or otherwise file the certification in such form that Treasury may prescribe. Treasury reserves the right to reject any waiver request it receives.


(c) If application of an agency's waiver, together with any waiver request previously granted under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (a)(4), or (a)(8), would, in Treasury's determination, lead to the agency initiating an unusually large number or proportion of payments by means other than electronic funds transfer, Treasury reserves the right to nullify the waiver in this class of cases and require the agency to work with Treasury to identify and implement ways to make the payments by electronic funds transfer.
