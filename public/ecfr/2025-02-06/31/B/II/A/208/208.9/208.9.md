(a) Treasury will monitor agencies' compliance with this part. Treasury may require agencies to provide information about their progress in converting payments to electronic funds transfer.


(b) If an agency fails to make payment by electronic funds transfer as prescribed under this part, Treasury will consider that payment to be not timely pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3335, as electronic funds transfer payments are processed, disbursed, and settled more quickly than checks and, accordingly, Treasury may assess a charge to the agency pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3335.
