(a) It is hereby determined that postal, transportation or banking facilities in general or local conditions in the Republic of Cuba and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) are such that there is not a reasonable assurance that a payee in those areas will actually receive checks or warrants drawn against funds of the United States, or agencies or instrumentalities thereof, and be able to negotiate the same for full value.


(b) A check or warrant intended for delivery in any of the areas named in paragraph (a) of this section shall be withheld unless the check or warrant is specifically released by the Secretary of the Treasury.
