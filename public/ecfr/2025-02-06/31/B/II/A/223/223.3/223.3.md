# ยง 223.3   Issuance of certificates of authority.

(a) In determining whether to issue or renew a certificate of authority, Treasury will evaluate the whole application package under ยง 223.2, the financial condition of the company as determined under ยง 223.9, the history of the company, and any further evidence or information that Treasury may, in its discretion, require the company to submit.


(b) A certificate of authority will be effective for a term that expires on the last day of the next July. All statutory requirements and regulatory requirements under this part are continuing obligations, and any certificate issued is expressly subject to continuing compliance with such requirements. The certificate of authority will be renewed annually on the first day of August, *provided that* the company remains qualified under the law, the regulations in this part, and other relevant Treasury requirements, and the company submits the fee required under ยง 223.22 by March 1st of each year.


(c) If a company meets the requirements for a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds in all respects except that it is limited to reinsurance business only, it may be issued a certificate of authority as a reinsuring company on Federal bonds. The fees for initial application and renewal of a certificate as a reinsuring company are the same as the fees for an initial application and renewal of a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds.
