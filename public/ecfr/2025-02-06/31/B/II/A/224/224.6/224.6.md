# ยง 224.6   Where can I find a sample power of attorney form?

The Surety Bond Branch provides a sample form on its Web page located at: *http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/c570.* While use of the sample form is not required, any power of attorney provided should be substantially the same as the sample form.
