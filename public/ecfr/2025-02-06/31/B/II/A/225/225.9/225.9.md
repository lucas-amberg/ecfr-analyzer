(a) *General.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section or as otherwise provided in this part, the bond official will return the Government obligations, and any interest retained therefrom, to the obligor, without written application from the obligor, when the bond official determines that the Government obligations are no longer required under the terms of the bond.


(b) *Miller Act payment bonds.* The bond official will not return Government obligations to an obligor who has furnished to the bond official a payment bond if:


(1) A person, who supplied the obligor with labor or materials and whom the obligor has not paid, files with the United States Government the application and affidavit provided for in the Miller Act (Act), as amended (40 U.S.C. 270a-270d), and the time provided in the Act for the person to commence suit against the obligor on the payment bond has not expired; or


(2) A person commences a suit against the obligor within the time provided for in the Act, in which case the bond official will hold the Government obligations subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction of the suit; or


(3) The bond official has actual knowledge of a claim against the obligor on the basis of the payment bond, in which case the bond official may return the Government obligations to the obligor when the bond official deems it appropriate.


(c) *Claim of the United States unaffected.* Nothing in this section shall affect or impair the priority of any claim of the United States against Government obligations, or any right or remedy granted by the Miller Act or by this part to the United States in the event of an obligor's default on any term, condition, or stipulation of a bond.


(d) *Return of definitive Government obligations; risk of loss.* Definitive Government obligations to be returned to the obligor will be forwarded at the obligor's risk and expense, either by the bond official, or by a custodian upon receipt of a bond official's authenticated instructions.
