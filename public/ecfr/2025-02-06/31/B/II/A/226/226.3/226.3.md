# § 226.3   Application—termination.

(a) Every Insurance Organization applying for recognition as a qualified insurer of financial institutions designated as Treasury tax and loan depositaries shall address a written request to the Assistant Commissioner, Comptroller, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20226, who will notify the applicant of the data which is necessary to make application. If the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that:


(1) One or more institutions insured by the applicant otherwise meet the Secretary's requirements for designation as a Treasury tax and loan depositary or Federal tax depositary,


(2) The insurance provided by the applicant covers public money of the United States, and


(3) The insurance coverage provided affords adequate security to the Government's deposits, the Secretary shall recognize the applicant as a qualified insurer of financial institutions designated as Treasury tax and loan depositaries.


(b) If and when the Secretary of the Treasury determines that a qualified insurance organization's financial condition is such that it no longer provides adequate security or that it is not complying with the regulations of this part, the Secretary will notify the Insurance Organization of the facts or conduct which cause him to make such determination, and in those cases where the safety of the Government's funds allows, provide the Insurance Organization with an opportunity to correct the deficiency. When any deficiency has not been corrected to his satisfaction or, where the safety of Government funds makes immediate revocation imperative, the Secretary will revoke the recognition previously granted.
