# ยง 250.5   Manner of payment.

Payment will be made by check drawn on the United States Treasury. Checks will be mailed to the payee at the address indicated on the voucher application, unless subsequent to the issue of the voucher application the Treasury Department receives a written request from the payee to deliver the check to him at some other address. Where the award has been entered in favor of more than one person, only one check will be drawn in making payment unless the payees specify the share of each and request separate checks.
