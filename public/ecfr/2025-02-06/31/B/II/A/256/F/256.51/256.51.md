# ยง 256.51   Does Fiscal Service report Judgment Fund payments to the IRS as income to the payee on IRS Form 1099?

No, Fiscal Service does not report Judgment Fund payments as potential taxable income to the IRS. Fiscal Service does not have sufficient information about the payment to determine if a Form 1099 must be issued or to prepare such a form when required. To the extent any Form 1099 needs to be issued, it is the responsibility of the agency submitting the payment request to do so.
