# ยง 281.6   Withdrawals from Treasury accounts.

Foreign exchange shall be withdrawn from accounts of the Secretary on the books of accountable officers or from the foreign exchange accounts carried with depositaries in the name of the United States Treasury, only for the purpose of sale for dollars or transfer to agencies for authorized purposes, without reimbursement to the Treasury, as provided by or pursuant to law. Such transfers, as well as transfers between foreign exchange accounts of the Secretary and between foreign exchange accounts in the name of the United States Treasury, shall be made only by direction of the Secretary. An agency requiring foreign exchange from the Treasury Department shall make request of the Secretary, indicating the amount of exchange required, in units of foreign currency, and the name and location of the accountable officer to receive the exchange. To the extent practicable and desirable, standing authorizations will be given for withdrawals from accounts of the Secretary. The following conditions apply to the sale of foreign exchange and to the requisition of foreign exchange without dollar payment:


(a) *Sales.* With respect to the sale of foreign exchange held in accounts of the Secretary, the payment in dollars shall be calculated at the rate of exchange that would otherwise be available to the United States for the acquisition of the foreign exchange for its official disbursements unless otherwise determined by the Treasury Department in consultation with the agencies concerned. When the rate that would otherwise be available to the United States is not readily ascertainable, the Treasury Department shall be consulted. The dollar proceeds realized from the sale of exchange shall be credited to the appropriate receipt, appropriation or refund account on the books of the Treasury. The dollar payment for foreign exchange purchased shall not be charged as an appropriation expenditure until the foreign exchange is disbursed.


(b) *Transfers without reimbursement.* When foreign exchange is to be obtained from the Treasury Department without payment of dollars, the agency concerned shall furnish written certification that the exchange may be used without reimbursement to the Treasury, citing the relevant legal authority. In cases where international agreements or Bureau of the Budget allocations specify the programs for which foreign exchange may be used, the Secretary may transfer exchange to agencies without requiring a certification.
