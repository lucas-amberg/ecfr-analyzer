# § 306.25   Presentation and surrender.

(a) *General.* Securities, whether in registered or bearer form, are payable in regular course of business at maturity unless called for redemption before maturity in accordance with their terms, in which case they will be payable in regular course of business on the date of call. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide for the exchange of maturing or called securities, or in advance of call or maturity, may afford owners the opportunity of exchanging a security for another security pursuant to a prerefunding or an advance refunding offer. Registered and bearer securities should be presented and surrendered for redemption to the Bureau. No assignments or evidence in support of assignments will be required by or on behalf of the registered owner or assignee for redemption for his or its account, or for redemption-exchange, or exchange pursuant to a prerefunding or an advance refunding offer, if the new securities are to be registered in exactly the same names and forms as appear in the registrations or assignments of the securities surrendered. To the extent appropriate, these rules also apply to securities registered in the title of public officers who are official custodians of public funds.


(b) *“Overdue” securities.* If a bearer security or a registered security assigned in blank, or to bearer, or so assigned as to become in effect payable to bearer, is presented and surrendered for redemption after it has become overdue, the Secretary of the Treasury will ordinarily require satisfactory proof of ownership. (Form PD 1071 may be used.) A security shall be considered to be overdue after the lapse of the following periods of time from its face maturity:


(1) One month for securities issued for a term of 1 year or less.


(2) Three months for securities issued for a term of more than 1 year but not in excess of 7 years.


(3) Six months for securities issued for a term of more than 7 years.
