# § 315.84   Payment to certain institutions.

A bond registered in the name of a church, hospital, home, school, or similar institution, without reference in the registration to the manner in which it is organized or governed or to the manner in which title to its property is held, will be paid upon a request for payment signed on behalf of such institution by an authorized representative. A request for payment signed by a pastor of a church, superintendent of a hospital, president of a college, or by any official generally recognized as having authority to conduct the financial affairs of the particular institution will ordinarily be accepted without further proof of authority. The signature to the request should be in the form, for example, “Shriners' Hospital for Crippled Children, St. Louis, MO, by William A. Smith, Superintendent”, or “St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Albany, NY, by the Rev. John Smyth, Pastor”.
