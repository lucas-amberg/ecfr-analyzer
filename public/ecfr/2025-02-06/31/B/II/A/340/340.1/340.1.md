# § 340.1   Public notice—description of bonds—terms of offer.

When bonds are offered for sale through competitive bidding, bids therefor will be invited through the form of a public notice or notices issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. The notice or notices will either fix the coupon rate of interest to be borne by the bonds or prescribe the conditions under which bidders may specify the rate and will set forth the terms and conditions of the bonds, including maturities, call features, if any, and the terms and conditions of the offer, including the amount of the issue for which bids are invited, the date and closing hour for receipt of bids, and the date on which the bonds will be delivered and payment for any accepted bid must be completed. When so specified in the public notice, it shall be a condition of each bid that, if accepted by the Secretary of the Treasury, the bidder will make a bona fide reoffering to the investing public.
