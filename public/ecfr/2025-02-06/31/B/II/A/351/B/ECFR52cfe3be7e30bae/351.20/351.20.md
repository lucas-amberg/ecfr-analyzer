# § 351.20   What is the investment yield (interest) during the original maturity period of Series EE savings bonds with issue dates from January 1, 1980, through April 1, 1995?

The redemption value of a bond on a given interest accrual date during original maturity will be the higher of the value produced using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the value produced using the appropriate market-based variable investment yield. 


(a) *Guaranteed minimum investment yield*—(1) *Bonds bearing issue dates prior to November 1, 1982.* You may obtain the guaranteed minimum investment yields on bonds bearing issue dates prior to November 1, 1982, by downloading from our website at *www.savingsbonds.gov,* contacting us by email at *savbonds@bpd.treas.gov,* or by writing us at the following address: Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328. 


(2) *Bonds bearing issue dates of November 1, 1982, through April 1, 1995*—(i) *Prior to 5 years from issue date.* You may download the guaranteed minimum investment yields prior to 5 years from issue date at our website at *www.savingsbonds.gov,* by contacting us by email at *savbonds@bpd.treas.gov,* or writing to the following address: Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328. 


(ii) *On or after 5 years from issue date.* The guaranteed minimum investment yield of a bond from its issue date to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after 5 years from issue up to original maturity will be as follows, compounded semiannually: 


(b) *Market-based variable investment yield.* If a bond is held for a period of 5 years after its first semiannual interest accrual period, occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, its market-based variable investment yield for such period, and to each successive semiannual interest accrual date up to its original maturity, will be determined as follows: 


(1) For each 6-month period, starting with the period beginning on May 1, 1982, we will determine the average market yield on outstanding marketable Treasury securities with a remaining term to maturity of approximately 5 years during such period. 


(2) For bonds bearing an issue date prior to May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to its first semiannual interest accrual date 5 years thereafter will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1 percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the ten 6-month periods starting with the 6-month period that most recently ended before such issue date, whichever is later. 


(3) For bonds bearing issue dates of May 1, 1989, through April 1, 1995, the market-based variable investment yield from the issue date to the semiannual interest accrual date 5 years thereafter will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the ten 6-month periods starting with the 6-month period that most recently ended before such issue date. 


(4) In determining the market-based variable investment yield for a bond from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to each successive semiannual interest accrual date occurring after 5 years from issue up to original maturity, the average market yield for each additional 6-month period will be included in the computation.
