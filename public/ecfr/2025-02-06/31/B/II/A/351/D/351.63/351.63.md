# ยง 351.63   How are redemption payments made for my redeemed book-entry Series EE savings bonds?

We will make payments electronically by direct deposit, using the ACH method, to your designated account at a United States depository financial institution. You may also direct that a payment be used to purchase a certificate of indebtedness to be held in your New Treasury Direct account.
