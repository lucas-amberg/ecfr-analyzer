# ยง 351.71   How can I find out what my book-entry Series EE savings bonds are worth?

(a) *Redemption values.* You may access redemption values for your book-entry bonds through your New Treasury Direct account.


(b) *Redemption penalty.* Redemption values shown in your New Treasury Direct account for bonds that are within 5 years from issue date reflect the three-month interest penalty applied to bonds redeemed prior to five years from the issue date.
