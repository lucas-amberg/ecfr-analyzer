# ยง 351.82   Does Fiscal Service prohibit the issuance of Series EE savings bonds in a chain letter scheme?

We do not permit bonds to be issued in a chain letter or pyramid scheme. We authorize an issuing agent to refuse to issue a bond or accept a purchase order if there is reason to believe that a purchase is connected with a chain letter. The agent's decision is final.
