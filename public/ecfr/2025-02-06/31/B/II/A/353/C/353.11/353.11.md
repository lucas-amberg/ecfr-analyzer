(1) All bonds registered in the name of that person alone;


(2) All bonds registered in the name of the representative of the estate of that person; and


(3) All bonds registered in the name of that person as first-named coowner.


(c) *Bonds excluded from computation.* In computing the purchases for each person, the following are excluded:
