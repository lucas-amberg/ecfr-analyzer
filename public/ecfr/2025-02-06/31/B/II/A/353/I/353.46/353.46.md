# ยง 353.46   Effective date of request for reissue.

The Department of the Treasury will treat the receipt by: (a) A Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or (b) the Bureau of the Fiscal Service of a bond and an acceptable request for reissue as determining the date upon which the rights of the parties are fixed for the purpose of reissue. For example, if the owner or either coowner of a bond dies after the bond has been surrendered for reissue, the bond will be regarded as having been reissued in the decedent's lifetime.
