(b) A bond on which a minor is named as beneficiary or coowner may be reissued in the name of a custodian for the minor under a statute authorizing gifts to minor upon the request of the adult whose name appears on the bond as owner or coowner.


(c) A minor coowner for whose estate no representative has been appointed, may be named sole owner upon the request of the competent coowner.
