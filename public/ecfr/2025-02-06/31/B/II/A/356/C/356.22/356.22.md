# ยง 356.22   Does the Treasury have any limitations on auction awards?

(a) *Awards to noncompetitive bidders.* The maximum award to any noncompetitive bidder is $10 million. This limit does not apply to bidders bidding solely through a request to reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held directly with Treasury.


(b) *Awards to competitive bidders.* The maximum award is 35 percent of the offering amount less the bidder's net long position as reportable under ยง 356.13. For example, in a note auction with a $10 billion offering amount, and therefore a maximum award of $3.5 billion, a bidder with a reported net long position of $1 billion could receive a maximum auction award of $2.5 billion. When the bids and net long positions of more than one person or entity must be combined, as is the case with investment advisers and controlled accounts (See ยง 356.15(c).), we will use this combined amount for the purpose of this 35 percent award limit.
