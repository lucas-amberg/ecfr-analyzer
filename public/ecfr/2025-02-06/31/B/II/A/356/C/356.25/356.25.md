# § 356.25   How does the settlement process work?

Securities bought in the auction must be paid for by the issue date. The payment amount for awarded securities will be the settlement amount as defined in § 356.2. (See formulas in appendix B.) There are several ways to pay for securities:


(a) *Payment by debit entry to a deposit account.* If you are paying by debit entry to a deposit account as provided for in § 356.17(b), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified account on the issue date.


(b) *Payment by authorized charge to a funds account.* Where the submitter's method of payment is an authorized charge to the funds account of a depository institution as provided for in § 356.17(c), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified funds account on the issue date.


(c) *Payment through a certificate of indebtedness.* If you are paying with the redemption proceeds of your certificate of indebtedness as provided for in § 356.17(b), we will redeem the certificate of indebtedness for the settlement amount of the security and apply the proceeds on the issue date.
