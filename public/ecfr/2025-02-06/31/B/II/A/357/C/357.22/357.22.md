# § 357.22   Transfers.

(a) *General.* A security may be transferred only as authorized by this part. A security may be transferred from an account in Legacy Treasury Direct® to an account in the commercial book-entry system or to an account in TreasuryDirect®. A security may also be transferred between accounts in *Legacy Treasury Direct.* The Department may delay transfer of a newly purchased security from a Legacy Treasury Direct account to an account in commercial book entry or TreasuryDirect for a period not to exceed (30) calendar days from the date of issue. This provides time for the investor to become aware of any unauthorized debits.


(1) *Identification of securities to be transferred.* The owner must identify the securities to be transferred, in the manner required by the transaction request. If such identification is not provided, the request will not be processed and will be returned.


(2) *Denominational amounts.* A security may be transferred from an account only in a denominational amount authorized by the offering under which the security was issued. Any security remaining in the securities portfolio after the transfer must also be in an authorized denominational amount.


(3) *When transfer effective*—(i) *Transfer within Legacy Treasury Direct.* A transfer of a security within Legacy Treasury Direct is effective when an appropriate entry is made in the name of the transferee on the Legacy Treasury Direct records.


(ii) *Transfer from Legacy Treasury Direct to the commercial book-entry system.* A transfer of a security from Legacy Treasury Direct to the commercial book-entry system is effective as provided in subpart B. If a transfer cannot be completed, and the security is sent back to Legacy Treasury Direct, the Department will redeposit the security in the original account.


(iii) *Transfer from Legacy Treasury Direct to TreasuryDirect.* A transfer of a security from Legacy Treasury Direct to TreasuryDirect is effective as provided in 31 CFR part 363. If the transfer cannot be completed, the Department will redeposit the security in the original account.


(b) *Transfer upon death of an owner*—(1) *Right of survivorship.* If a security is registered in beneficiary form or a form which provides for a right of survivorship, upon the death of an owner, the beneficiary or survivor shall be the sole and absolute owner, notwithstanding any purported testamentary disposition by the decedent and notwithstanding any State or other law to the contrary. The Department will honor a transaction request by a beneficiary or a survivor (in the case of a security registered in the form described in § 357.21(b)(2)(i)(B)) only upon proof of death of an owner.


(2) *Succession under law of domicile.* If a security is registered in a form that does not provide for a right of survivorship, succession shall be determined in accordance with the applicable law of the deceased owner's domicile at the time of death.


(c) *Representative succession.* If a security is registered in the name of a representative who has died, resigned, or been removed, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the document under which the representative was acting.


(d) *Organizational succession*—(1) *Corporation and unincorporated association.* If a security is registered in the name of a corporation or an unincorporated association that has been dissolved, merged or consolidated into another organization, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the documents by which the dissolution, merger, or consolidation was effected.


(2) *Partnership.* If a partnership is dissolved or terminated, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the partnership agreement.


(e) *Succession of governmental officer.* If a security is registered in the name and title of a governmental officer who has died, resigned, or has been removed, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law.
