# ยง 359.19   How is interest calculated?

We base all calculations of interest on a $25 unit. We use the value of this unit to determine the value of bonds in higher denominations. The effect of rounding off the value of the $25 unit increases at higher denominations. This can work to your slight advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether we round the value up or down.
