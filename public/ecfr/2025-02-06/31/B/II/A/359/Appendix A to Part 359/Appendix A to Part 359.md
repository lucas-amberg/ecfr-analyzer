# Appendix A to Part 359â€”Redemption Value Calculations 


Interest on savings bonds is subject to taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The bonds are exempt from taxation by any State or political subdivision of a State, except for estate or inheritance taxes. (See 31 U.S.C. 3124.)


Assume a New Treasury Direct par investment amount in a book-entry Series I savings bonds of $34.59, with an issue date of May, 2001, and a redemption date of December, 2001. The published CRV for a definitive $100 Series I savings bonds issued May, 2001 and redeemed December, 2001 = $101.96.
