# ยง 359.28   Are taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) required for the registration of definitive Series I savings bonds?

The registration of a definitive Series I savings bond must include the TIN of the owner or first-named coowner. If the bond was purchased as a gift or award and the owner's TIN is not known, the TIN of the purchaser must be included in the registration of the bond.
