# ยง 360.20   General.

(a) The Department of the Treasury will not recognize a judicial determination that gives effect to an attempted voluntary inter vivos transfer of a bond, or a judicial determination that impairs the rights of survivorship conferred by the regulations in this part upon a coowner or beneficiary. All provisions of this subpart are subject to these restrictions, except as provided in ยง 360.24.


(b) The Department of the Treasury will recognize a claim against an owner of a savings bond and conflicting claims of ownership of, or interest in, a bond between coowners or between the registered owner and the beneficiary, if established by valid, judicial proceedings specifically listed in this subpart. Escheat proceedings will not be recognized under this subpart. Section 360.23 specifies evidence required to establish the validity of judicial proceedings.

(c) The Department of the Treasury and the agencies that issue, reissue, or redeem savings bonds will not accept a notice of an adverse claim or notice of pending judicial proceedings, nor undertake to protect the interests of a litigant not in possession of a savings bond.
