# § 360.65   Reissue.

A bond on which a minor or other person under legal disability is named as the owner or coowner, or in which he or she has an interest, may be reissued under the following conditions, but only in accordance with subpart H of this part:


(a) A minor for whose estate no representative has been appointed may request reissue if the minor is of sufficient competency to sign his or her name to the request and to understand the nature of the transaction.


(b) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a) of this section, reissue will be restricted to a form of registration which does not adversely affect the existing ownership or interest of a minor or other person under legal disability. Requests for reissue should be executed by the person authorized to request payment under §§ 360.60 and 360.63, or the person who may request recognition as voluntary guardian under § 360.64.
