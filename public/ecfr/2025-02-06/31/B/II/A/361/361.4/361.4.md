# ยง 361.4   Preparation of shipment.

Each shipment shall be inspected and verified by two responsible employees of a consignor before final preparation (*i.e.*, before sealing, locking, etc.) for delivery to the carrier. The shipment shall be finally prepared for delivery in the presence of the two employees and before leaving their immediate control. If strict compliance herewith is impossible or impracticable, administrative officers of the consignor shall make adequate provision, through the establishment of accounting controls or otherwise, for the maintenance of basic records which will enable them to prove, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, the extent of loss, destruction, or damage in connection with a claim against the Fund. The requirements of this section shall apply irrespective of the carrier or method of transportation employed in making shipments.
