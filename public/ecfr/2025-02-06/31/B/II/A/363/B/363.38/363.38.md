# § 363.38   What happens if my financial institution returns an ACH debit?

If your designated financial institution returns an ACH debit, we reserve the right to reinitiate the debit at our option. We also reserve the right to reverse the transaction, thereby removing the security from your TreasuryDirect ® account. If the ACH return occurs after the security has been redeemed, transferred, or has matured and the proceeds paid, we reserve the right to reverse previously processed security transactions. We are not responsible for any fees your financial institution may charge relating to returned ACH debits.
