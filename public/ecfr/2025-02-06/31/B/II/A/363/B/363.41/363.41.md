# § 363.41   What happens if an ACH payment is returned to Fiscal Service?

We will notify you electronically of the returned payment. We will hold your payment until you provide us with instructions. Returned payments will not earn interest. We reserve the right to redirect a returned payment to the bank account at a financial institution that you have designated in your TreasuryDirect ® account as your primary bank account, if that account is different from the one that returned the payment to us. We are not responsible for any fees your financial institution may charge relating to returned ACH payments.
