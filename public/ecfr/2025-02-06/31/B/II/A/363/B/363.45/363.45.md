# § 363.45   What are the rules for judicial and administrative actions involving securities held in TreasuryDirect ®?

(a) *Notice of adverse claim or pending judicial proceedings.* We are not subject to and will not accept a notice of an adverse claim or notice of pending judicial proceedings involving a security held in TreasuryDirect.


(b) *Competing claims to a security.* The Department of the Treasury, Fiscal Service, and the Federal Reserve Banks are not proper defendants in a judicial proceeding involving competing claims to a security held in TreasuryDirect.


(c) *Divorce decree.* We will recognize a divorce decree that either disposes of a security held in TreasuryDirect or ratifies a property settlement agreement disposing of a security that is the property of either of the parties. If the divorce decree does not set out the terms of the property settlement agreement, we will require a certified copy of the agreement.


(d) *Final court order.* We will recognize a final order entered by a court that affects ownership rights in a security held in TreasuryDirect only to the extent that the order is consistent with the provisions of this part. The owner of the security must be a party to the proceedings.


(e) *Levy to satisfy money judgment.* We will honor a transaction request submitted by a person appointed by a court and having authority under an order of a court to dispose of a security held in TreasuryDirect pursuant to a money judgment against the owner of the security, as owner is defined in § 363.6 of this part. In the case of savings bonds, we will only make payment pursuant to the court order to the extent of the money judgment. We will not transfer the savings bonds.


(f) *Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levy.* We will honor an IRS notice of levy under section 6331 of the Internal Revenue Code:


(1) Against the owner, as owner is defined in § 363.6 of this part, including a levy against the owner in the capacity of nominee, transferee, or alter ego;


(2) Against a secondary owner, if the secondary owner has the right to conduct transactions in a security at the date and time the notice of levy is delivered to Fiscal Service; or


(3) Against an owner's property to which a federal tax lien is attached.


(g) *Trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer.* We will honor a transaction request submitted by a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer, if the original court order is against the owner, as owner is defined in § 363.6 of this part. In the case of savings bonds, we will only make payment. We will not transfer the savings bonds.


(h) *Court order that attempts to defeat or impair survivorship rights.* We will not recognize a court order that attempts to defeat or impair the survivorship rights of a beneficiary, secondary owner, coowner of a converted savings bond, or the registered owner of an undelivered gift security held in TreasuryDirect.
