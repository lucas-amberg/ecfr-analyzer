# § 363.165   What happens when I convert a savings bond that is registered in my name as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with a beneficiary, or an entity?

(a) *Unmatured savings bond.* When the conversion is approved, an unmatured savings bond that is registered in the name of the TreasuryDirect ® account owner as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with beneficiary, or an entity, will be released to the account owner's conversion linked account.


(b) *Matured savings bond.* A savings bond that has reached final maturity and is registered in the name of the TreasuryDirect account owner as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with beneficiary, or an entity, will be converted to a book-entry savings bond and automatically redeemed. The redemption proceeds will be used to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness in the account owner's name in the primary account.
