# ยง 370.13   Can time limits for taking an action on a credit entry be extended?

If we or your financial institution are delayed beyond applicable time limits in taking any action with respect to a credit entry because of circumstances beyond our control, then the time for taking that action will be extended as necessary until the cause of the delay ends.
