# ยง 370.45   What is the status of a security if the remittance cannot be collected?

If we cannot promptly collect all of the remittance for a security, we may in our discretion cancel the security unless it has been legally transferred for value to a third person who had no knowledge of the improper debit entry at the time of the transfer.
