# ยง 370.46   Are there any situations in which the Bureau of the Fiscal Service may waive these regulations?

We reserve the right, in our discretion, to waive any provision of these regulations in any case or class of cases. We may do so if such action is not inconsistent with law and will not subject the United States to substantial expense or liability.
