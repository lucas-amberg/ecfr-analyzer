(d) *Conflicts of interest*—(1) *Conflict of interest in representation.* No individual shall appear as representative for a respondent in a proceeding conducted pursuant to this subpart if it reasonably appears that such representation may be materially limited by that representative's responsibilities to a third person, or by that representative's own interests. 


(2) *Corrective measures.* An Administrative Law Judge may take corrective measures at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.
