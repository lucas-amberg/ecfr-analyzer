# § 501.807   Procedures governing delisting from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or any other list of sanctioned persons or property maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

A person may submit a petition for administrative reconsideration pursuant to the procedures outlined below in order to seek removal of a person or property (e.g., a vessel) from the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC):


(a) A person blocked under the provisions of any part of this chapter, including a specially designated national, specially designated terrorist, specially designated narcotics trafficker, or a person otherwise subject to sanctions pursuant to the provisions of any part of this chapter (each, a “sanctioned person”), or a person owning a majority interest in property (e.g., a vessel) that is blocked or otherwise subject to sanctions may submit arguments or evidence that the person believes establishes that insufficient basis exists for the sanction or that the circumstances resulting in the sanction no longer apply. The sanctioned person also may propose remedial steps on the person's part, such as corporate reorganization, resignation of persons from positions in a blocked entity, or similar steps, which the person believes would negate the basis for the sanction. A person owning a majority interest in property (e.g., a vessel) that is blocked or otherwise subject to sanctions may propose the sale of the vessel, with the proceeds to be placed into a blocked interest-bearing account after deducting the costs incurred while the vessel was blocked and the costs of the sale. This submission must be made via email to *OFAC.Reconsideration@treasury.gov.*

(b) For purposes of reconsideration petitions relating to persons or property sanctioned by OFAC:


(1) The information submitted by the person seeking removal of a person or property from the SDN List or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by OFAC will be reviewed by OFAC, which may request clarifying, corroborating, or other additional information.


(2) A person seeking removal of a person or property from the SDN List or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by OFAC may request a meeting with OFAC; however, such meetings are not required, and the office may, at its discretion, decline to conduct such meetings prior to completing a review pursuant to this section.


(3) After OFAC has conducted a review of the request for reconsideration, it will provide a written decision to the person seeking the removal of a person or property from the SDN List or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by OFAC.
