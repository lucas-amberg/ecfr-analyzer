(1) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license, by or with the Government of North Korea, the Workers' Party of Korea, or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 510.201(a);


(2) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license, involving a debit to a blocked account or a transfer of blocked property; or


(3) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license, with a foreign financial institution that is subject to sanctions pursuant to § 510.210 when the transaction is one that is prohibited by § 510.210.


(b) For example, a license authorizing a person to complete a securities sale involving Company A, whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 510.201(a), also authorizes other persons to engage in activities that are ordinarily incident and necessary to complete the sale, including transactions by the buyer, broker, transfer agents, and banks, provided that such other persons are not themselves persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 510.201(a).
