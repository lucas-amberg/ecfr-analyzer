# ยง 566.404   Significant transactions; significant financial services.

In determining, for purposes of paragraph (a) of ยง 566.201, whether a transaction(s) or financial service(s) is significant, the Secretary of the Treasury may consider the totality of the facts and circumstances. As a general matter, the Secretary may consider some or all of the following factors:


(a) *Size, number, and frequency.* The size, number, and frequency of transaction(s) or financial service(s) performed over a period of time, including whether the transaction(s) or financial service(s) is increasing or decreasing over time and the rate of increase or decrease.


(b) *Nature.* The nature of the transaction(s) or financial service(s), including the type, complexity, and commercial purpose of the transaction(s) or financial service(s).


(c) *Level of awareness; pattern of conduct.* (1) Whether the transaction(s) or financial service(s) is performed with the involvement or approval of management or only by clerical personnel; and


(2) Whether the transaction(s) or financial service(s) is part of a pattern of conduct or the result of a business development strategy.


(d) *Nexus.* The proximity between the foreign financial institution engaging in the transaction(s) or providing the financial service(s) and Hizballah or a blocked person described in paragraph (a)(2) of ยง 566.201. For example, a transaction or financial service in which a foreign financial institution provides brokerage or clearing services to, or maintains an account or makes payments for, Hizballah or such a blocked person generally would be of greater significance than a transaction or financial service a foreign financial institution conducts for or provides to Hizballah or such a blocked person indirectly or in a tertiary relationship.


(e) *Impact.* The impact of the transaction(s) or financial service(s) on the objectives of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015, including:


(1) The economic or other benefit conferred or attempted to be conferred on Hizballah or a blocked person described in paragraph (a)(2) of ยง 566.201; and


(2) Whether and how the transaction(s) or financial service(s) contributes to support for international terrorism.


(f) *Deceptive practices.* Whether the transaction(s) or financial service(s) involves an attempt to obscure or conceal the actual parties or true nature of the transaction(s) or financial service(s) to evade sanctions.


(g) *Other relevant factors.* Such other factors that the Secretary deems relevant on a case-by-case basis in determining the significance of a transaction(s) or financial service(s).
