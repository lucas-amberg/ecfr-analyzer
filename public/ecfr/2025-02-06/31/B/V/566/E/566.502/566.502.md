# ยง 566.502   Effect of license or other authorization.

(a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or otherwise issued by OFAC, authorizes or validates any transaction or financial service effected prior to the issuance of such license or other authorization, unless specifically provided in such license or authorization.


(b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any transaction or financial service prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license is issued by OFAC and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to authorize any transaction or financial services prohibited by any other part of this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically refers to such part.


(c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any transaction or financial service otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property that would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.


(d) Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to supersede the requirements established under any other provision of law or to relieve a person from any requirement to obtain a license or other authorization from another department or agency of the U.S. Government in compliance with applicable laws and regulations subject to the jurisdiction of that department or agency.
