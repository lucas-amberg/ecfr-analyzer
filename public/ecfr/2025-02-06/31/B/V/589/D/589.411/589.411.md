# § 589.411   Entities owned by one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked or who are subject to § 589.202, § 589.203, § 589.204, or § 589.205.

(a) Persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 589.201 have an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which such persons directly or indirectly own, whether individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 589.201, regardless of whether the name of the entity is incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List).


(b) Persons subject to § 589.202, § 589.203, § 589.204, or § 589.205 have an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which such persons directly or indirectly own, whether individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are also subject to § 589.202, § 589.203, § 589.204, or § 589.205, regardless of whether the name of the entity is incorporated into OFAC's Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List.
