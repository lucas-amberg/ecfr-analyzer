# ยง 597.203   Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; investment and reinvestment.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. financial institution holding funds subject to ยง 597.201(b) shall hold or place such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account which is in the name of the foreign terrorist organization or its agent and which is located in the United States.


(b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term *interest-bearing account* means a blocked account:


(i) in a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates which are commercially reasonable for the amount of funds in the account or certificate of deposit; or


(ii) with a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury Bills.


(2) Funds held or placed in a blocked interest-bearing account pursuant to this paragraph may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account or sub-account, the name of the account party on each account must be the same and must clearly indicate the foreign terrorist organization or agent having an interest in the accounts.


(c) Blocked funds held as of the effective date in the form of stocks, bonds, debentures, letters of credit, or instruments which cannot be negotiated for the purpose of placing the funds in a blocked interest-bearing account pursuant to paragraph (a) may continue to be held in the form of the existing security or instrument until liquidation or maturity, provided that any dividends, interest income, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with the requirements of this section.


(d) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or reinvested in a manner in which an immediate financial or economic benefit or access accrues to the foreign terrorist organization or its agent.
