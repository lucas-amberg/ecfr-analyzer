# ยง 598.405   Transactions incidental to a licensed transaction.

Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and necessary to give effect to the licensed transaction is also authorized by the license. Except as specifically authorized by the terms of a license, prohibited transactions by specially designated narcotics traffickers and debits to accounts blocked pursuant to ยง 598.202 are not considered incidental to a licensed transaction and therefore remain prohibited.
