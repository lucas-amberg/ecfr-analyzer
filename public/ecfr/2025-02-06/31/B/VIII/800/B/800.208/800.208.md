(a) The term *control* means the power, direct or indirect, whether or not exercised, through the ownership of a majority or a dominant minority of the total outstanding voting interest in an entity, board representation, proxy voting, a special share, contractual arrangements, formal or informal arrangements to act in concert, or other means, to determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting an entity; in particular, but without limitation, to determine, direct, take, reach, or cause decisions regarding the following matters, or any other similarly important matters affecting an entity:


(1) The sale, lease, mortgage, pledge, or other transfer of any of the tangible or intangible principal assets of the entity, whether or not in the ordinary course of business;


(2) The reorganization, merger, or dissolution of the entity;


(3) The closing, relocation, or substantial alteration of the production, operational, or research and development facilities of the entity;


(4) Major expenditures or investments, issuances of equity or debt, or dividend payments by the entity, or approval of the operating budget of the entity;


(5) The selection of new business lines or ventures that the entity will pursue;


(6) The entry into, termination, or non-fulfillment by the entity of significant contracts;


(7) The policies or procedures of the entity governing the treatment of non-public technical, financial, or other proprietary information of the entity;


(8) The appointment or dismissal of officers or senior managers or, in the case of a partnership, the general partner;


(9) The appointment or dismissal of employees with access to critical technology or other sensitive technology or classified U.S. Government information; or


(10) The amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, constituent agreement, or other organizational documents of the entity with respect to the matters described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (9) of this section.


(b) In examining questions of control in situations where more than one foreign person has an ownership interest in an entity, consideration will be given to factors such as whether the foreign persons are related or have formal or informal arrangements to act in concert, whether they are agencies or instrumentalities of the national or subnational governments of a single foreign state, and whether a given foreign person and another person that has an ownership interest in the entity are both controlled by any of the national or subnational governments of a single foreign state.


(c) The following minority shareholder protections shall not in themselves be deemed to confer control over an entity:


(1) The power to prevent the sale or pledge of all or substantially all of the assets of an entity or a voluntary filing for bankruptcy or liquidation;


(2) The power to prevent an entity from entering into contracts with majority investors or their affiliates;


(3) The power to prevent an entity from guaranteeing the obligations of majority investors or their affiliates;


(4) The right to purchase an additional interest in an entity to prevent the dilution of an investor's pro rata interest in that entity in the event that the entity issues additional instruments conveying interests in the entity;


(5) The power to prevent the change of existing legal rights or preferences of the particular class of stock held by minority investors, as provided in the relevant corporate documents governing such shares; and


(6) The power to prevent the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, constituent agreement, or other organizational documents of an entity with respect to the matters described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.


(d) The Committee will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether minority shareholder protections other than those listed in paragraph (c) of this section do not confer control over an entity.


(e) Examples:


(1) *Example 1.* Corporation A is a U.S. business. A U.S. investor owns 50 percent of the voting interest in Corporation A, and the remaining voting interest is owned in equal shares by five unrelated foreign investors. The foreign investors jointly financed their investment in Corporation A and vote as a single block on matters affecting Corporation A. The foreign investors have an informal arrangement to act in concert with regard to Corporation A, and, as a result, the foreign investors control Corporation A.


(2) *Example 2.* Same facts as the example in paragraph (e)(1) of this section with regard to the composition of Corporation A's shareholders. The foreign investors in Corporation A have no contractual or other commitments to act in concert, and have no informal arrangements to do so. Assuming no other relevant facts, the foreign investors do not control Corporation A.


(3) *Example 3.* Corporation A, a foreign person, is a private equity fund that routinely acquires equity interests in companies and manages them for a period of time. Corporation B is a U.S. business. In addition to its acquisition of seven percent of Corporation B's voting shares, Corporation A acquires the right to terminate significant contracts of Corporation B. Corporation A controls Corporation B.


(4) *Example 4.* Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a nine percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. As part of the transaction, Corporation A also acquires certain veto rights that determine important matters affecting Corporation B, including the right to veto the dismissal of senior executives of Corporation B. Corporation A controls Corporation B.


(5) *Example 5.* Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a 13 percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business, and the right to appoint one member of Corporation B's seven-member board of directors. Corporation A receives minority shareholder protections listed in paragraph (c) of this section but receives no other positive or negative rights with respect to Corporation B. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not control Corporation B.


(6) *Example 6.* Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a 20 percent interest in the shares of Corporation B, a U.S. business. Corporation A has negotiated an irrevocable passivity agreement that completely precludes it from controlling Corporation B. Corporation A does, however, receive the right to prevent Corporation B from entering into contracts with majority investors or their affiliates and to prevent Corporation B from guaranteeing the obligations of majority investors or their affiliates. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A does not control Corporation B.


(7) *Example 7.* Limited Partnership A comprises two limited partners, each of which holds 49 percent of the interest in the partnership, and a general partner, which holds two percent of the interest. The general partner has sole authority to determine, direct, and decide all important matters affecting the partnership and a fund operated by the partnership. The general partner alone controls Limited Partnership A and the fund.


(8) *Example 8.* Same facts as the example in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, except that each of the limited partners has the authority to veto major investments proposed by the general partner and to choose the fund's representatives on the boards of the fund's portfolio companies. The general partner and the limited partners each have control over Limited Partnership A and the fund.
