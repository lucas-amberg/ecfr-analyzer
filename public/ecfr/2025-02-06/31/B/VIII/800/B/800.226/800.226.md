# ยง 800.226   Identifiable data.

The term *identifiable data* means data that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, including through the use of any personal identifier. Aggregated data or anonymized data is identifiable data if any party to the transaction has, or as a result of the transaction will have, the ability to disaggregate or de-anonymize the data, or if the data is otherwise capable of being used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity. Identifiable data does not include encrypted data, unless the U.S. business that maintains or collects the encrypted data has the means to de-encrypt the data so as to distinguish or trace an individual's identity.
