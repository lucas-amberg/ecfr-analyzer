# § 800.243   Solely for the purpose of passive investment.

(a) Ownership interests are held or acquired *solely for the purpose of passive investment* if the person holding or acquiring such interests does not plan or intend to exercise control and—


(1) Is not afforded any rights that if exercised would constitute control;


(2) Does not acquire any access, rights, or involvement specified § 800.211(b);


(3) Does not possess or develop any purpose other than passive investment; and


(4) Does not take any action inconsistent with holding or acquiring such interests solely for the purpose of passive investment. (See § 800.302(b).)


(b) Example: Corporation A, a foreign person, acquires a voting interest in Corporation B, a U.S. business. In addition to the voting interest, Corporation A negotiates the right to appoint a member of Corporation B's board of directors. The acquisition by Corporation A of a voting interest in Corporation B is not solely for the purpose of passive investment.
