# ยง 800.245   Substantive decisionmaking.

(a) The term *substantive decisionmaking* means the process through which decisions regarding significant matters affecting an entity are undertaken, including, as applicable:


(1) Pricing, sales, and specific contracts, including the license, sale, or transfer of sensitive personal data to any third party, including pursuant to a customer, vendor, or joint venture agreement;


(2) Supply arrangements;


(3) Corporate strategy and business development;


(4) Research and development, including location and budget allocation;


(5) Manufacturing locations;


(6) Access to critical technologies, covered investment critical infrastructure, material nonpublic technical information, or sensitive personal data, including pursuant to a customer, vendor, or joint venture agreement;


(7) Physical and cyber security protocols, including the storage and protection of critical technologies, covered investment critical infrastructure, or sensitive personal data;


(8) Practices, policies, and procedures governing the collection, use, or storage of sensitive personal data, including:


(i) The establishment or maintenance of, or changes to, the architecture of information technology systems and networks used in collecting or maintaining sensitive personal data; or


(ii) Privacy policies and agreements for individuals from whom sensitive personal data is collected setting forth parameters regarding whether and how sensitive personal data may be collected, maintained, accessed, or disseminated; or


(9) Strategic partnerships.


(b) The term *substantive decisionmaking* does not include strictly administrative decisions.


(c) Examples:


(1) *Example 1.* Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. Corporation B is an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that operates a container terminal at a strategic seaport within the National Port Readiness Network (Terminal B). Pursuant to the terms of the investment, Corporation A will have approval rights over which customers may utilize Terminal B. The proposed investment therefore affords Corporation A involvement in substantive decisionmaking of Corporation B regarding the management, operation, manufacture, or supply of covered investment critical infrastructure.


(2) *Example 2.* Same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that instead of customer approval rights, Corporation A has the right to decide whether to claim certain tax credits with respect to Terminal B on its own income tax filing, which prevents Corporation B from claiming such credits. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed investment does not afford Corporation A involvement in substantive decisionmaking of Corporation B regarding the management, operation, manufacture, or supply of covered investment critical infrastructure.
