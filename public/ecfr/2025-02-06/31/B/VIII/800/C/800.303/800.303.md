# § 800.303   Transactions that are covered investments.

Transactions that are covered investments include:


(a) A transaction that meets the requirements of § 800.211 irrespective of the percentage of voting interest acquired. (See the examples in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.)


(b) A transaction that meets the requirements of § 800.211, irrespective of the fact that the Committee concluded all action under section 721 for a previous covered investment by the same foreign person in the same TID U.S. business, where such transaction involves the acquisition of access, rights, or involvement specified in § 800.211 in addition to those notified to the Committee in the transaction for which the Committee previously concluded action. (See the example in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.)


(c) A transaction that meets the requirements of § 800.211, irrespective of the fact that the critical technology produced, designed, tested, manufactured, fabricated, or developed by the TID U.S. business became controlled under section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 after February 13, 2020, unless any of the criteria set forth in § 800.104(b) are satisfied with respect to the transaction prior to the critical technology becoming controlled. (See the example in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.)


(d) Examples:


(1) *Example 1.* Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B, an entity in which Corporation A has no voting interests or any rights. Corporation B is a U.S. business that manufactures a critical technology. Corporation B is therefore an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. Pursuant to the terms of the investment, a designee of Corporation A will have the right to observe the meetings of the board of directors of Corporation B. The proposed transaction is a covered investment.


(2) *Example 2.* Same facts as the example in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that, pursuant to the terms of the investment, instead of observer rights, Corporation A has consultation rights with respect to Corporation B's licensing of a critical technology to third parties. Corporation A is therefore involved in substantive decisionmaking with respect to Corporation B, and the proposed transaction is a covered investment.


(3) *Example 3.* Corporation A is a foreign person that is an excepted investor. Corporation B, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, owns a three percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation A. Corporation A proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation C, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. Pursuant to the terms of the investment in Corporation C and Corporation A's governance documents, Corporation A and Corporation B will each have access to material nonpublic technical information in Corporation C's possession. The transaction is a covered investment because Corporation B is making an investment that will result in access to material nonpublic technical information under § 800.211(b).


(4) *Example 4.* The Committee concludes all action under section 721 with respect to a covered investment by Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, in which Corporation A acquires a four percent, non-controlling equity interest with access to material non-public information in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. One year later, Corporation A proposes to acquire an additional five percent equity interest in Corporation B, resulting in Corporation A holding a nine percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B. Pursuant to the terms of the additional investment, Corporation A will receive the right to appoint a member to the board of directors of Corporation B. The proposed transaction is a covered investment because the transaction involves both an acquisition of an equity interest in an unaffiliated TID U.S. business and a new right under § 800.211.


(5) *Example 5.* Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, has executed a binding written agreement establishing the material terms of a proposed non-controlling investment in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business. The proposed investment will afford Corporation A access to material nonpublic technical information in the possession of Corporation B. The only controlled technology produced, designed, tested, manufactured, fabricated, or developed by Corporation B became controlled under section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 after February 13, 2020, but prior to the date upon which the binding written agreement establishing the material terms of the investment was executed. The proposed transaction is a covered investment.
