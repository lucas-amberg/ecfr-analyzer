(j) Examples:


(1) *Example 1.* Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor and in which no foreign government has a substantial interest, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that manufactures a critical technology. Under the terms of the investment, a designee of Corporation A will have the right to observe the meetings of the board of directors of Corporation B. Corporation B manufactures the critical technology for commercial off-the-shelf use by businesses in various industries, including some identified in appendix B to this part. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is a covered investment, but is not subject to a mandatory declaration or notice under § 800.401 because Corporation B does not produce, design, test, manufacture, fabricate, or develop the critical technology specifically for use in one or more industries identified in appendix B to this part.


(2) *Example 2.* Investment Fund A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, acquires a 10 percent equity interest in Corporation A, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business, and the right to appoint one member of Corporation A's board of directors. Corporation A is manufacturing critical technologies utilized in Corporation A's activity in one or more industries identified in appendix B to this part. Investment Fund A satisfies the requirements under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Investment Fund A's investment in Corporation A is a covered investment, but the transaction is not subject to the mandatory declaration requirement.


(3) *Example 3.* Same facts as the example in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, except that in connection with Investment Fund A's transaction, Limited Partner X, a limited partner of Investment Fund A and a foreign national that is not an excepted investor, receives access to the material non-public technical information of Corporation A. Limited Partner X's indirect investment in Corporation A is a covered investment. While Investment Fund A's direct investment is not subject to a mandatory declaration, Limited Partner X's indirect investment in Corporation A is subject to a mandatory declaration.


(4) *Example 4.* Corporation A, a foreign entity with its principal place of business in Country F, acquires 100 percent of the interests of Corporation Y, a U.S. business that manufactures a critical technology controlled under the EAR. A foreign national of Country G owns 25 percent of the voting shares of Corporation A. Under the EAR, a license is required to export the critical technology to Country G but not Country F. Assuming no other relevant facts, the acquisition of Corporation Y is subject to a mandatory declaration.


(5) *Example 5.* Corporation B, a foreign entity with its principal place of business in Country G, makes a covered investment in Corporation Z, a U.S. business that designs a critical technology controlled under the EAR. Under the EAR, a license is required to export the critical technology to Country G. The license exception at 15 CFR 740.4 authorizes Corporation Z to export the critical technology to Country G without a license. Assuming no other relevant facts, the covered investment is subject to a mandatory declaration.


(6) *Example 6.* Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation B, a U.S. business, execute a binding written agreement pursuant to which Corporation A will acquire a 10 percent equity interest in Corporation B and will be afforded the right to appoint two members of Corporation B's board of directors. As of the date of the agreement, none of the items that Corporation B manufactures constitutes a critical technology. After the agreement is executed, but prior to the completion of the transaction, a product manufactured by Corporation B is included as a defense article on the USML. Assuming no other relevant facts, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the transaction is not subject to a requirement to submit a declaration to the Committee. However for purposes of § 800.211, the transaction may be a covered investment.
