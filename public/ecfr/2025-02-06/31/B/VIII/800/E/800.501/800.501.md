# § 800.501   Procedures for notices.

(a) Except as otherwise prohibited under paragraph (j) of this section, a party or parties to a proposed or completed transaction may file a voluntary notice of the transaction with the Committee. Voluntary notice to the Committee is filed by sending an electronic copy of the notice that includes, in English, the information set out in § 800.502, including the certification required under paragraph (l) of that section, and paying the fee required under subpart K of this part. For electronic submission instructions, see the Committee's section of the Department of the Treasury website.


(b)(1) If the Committee determines that a transaction for which no voluntary notice or declaration has been submitted under this part, and with respect to which the Committee has not informed the parties in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721, may be a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations, the Staff Chairperson, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, may request the parties to the transaction or other persons to provide to the Committee information necessary to determine whether the transaction is a covered transaction, whether the transaction may raise national security considerations, or, as appropriate, whether the transaction is a transaction for which a submission is or was required under § 800.401.


(2) If the Committee determines that a transaction referred to under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations, the Staff Chairperson, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, may request the parties to file a notice of such covered transaction under paragraph (a) of this section.




(c) With respect to any transaction:


(1) Any member of the Committee, or his or her designee at or above the Under Secretary or equivalent level, may, subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, file an agency notice to the Committee through the Staff Chairperson regarding a transaction if:


(i) That member has reason to believe that the transaction is a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations and:


(A) The Committee has not informed the parties to such transaction in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721 with respect to such transaction; and


(B) The President has not announced a decision not to exercise the President's authority under section 721(d) with respect to such transaction; or


(ii) The transaction is a covered transaction and:


(A) The Committee has informed the parties to such transaction in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721 with respect to such transaction or determined that such transaction is not a covered transaction, or the President has announced a decision not to exercise the President's authority under section 721(d) with respect to such transaction; and


(B) Either:


(*1*) A party to such transaction submitted false or misleading material information to the Committee in connection with the Committee's consideration of such transaction or omitted material information, including material documents, from information submitted to the Committee; or


(*2*) A party to or the entity resulting from consummation of such transaction materially breaches (or, if the review or investigation of such transaction was initiated under section 721 before August 13, 2018, intentionally materially breaches) a mitigation agreement or condition described in section 721(l)(3)(A), such breach is certified to the Committee by the lead department or agency monitoring and enforcing such agreement or condition as a material breach (or, if the review or investigation of such transaction was initiated under section 721 before August 13, 2018, an intentional material breach), and the Committee determines that there are no other adequate and appropriate remedies or enforcement tools available to address such breach.


(2)(i) That is an investment where a foreign person is not an excepted investor due to the application of § 800.219(d), any member of the Committee, or his or her designee at or above the Under Secretary or equivalent level, may file an agency notice to the Committee through the Staff Chairperson regarding such investment if:


(A) That member has reason to believe that the transaction is a covered transaction and may raise national security considerations;


(B) The Committee has not informed the parties to such transaction in writing that the Committee has concluded all action under section 721 with respect to such transaction; and


(C) The President has not announced a decision not to exercise the President's authority under section 721(d) with respect to such transaction.


(ii) No notice filed under this paragraph (c)(2) shall be made with respect to a transaction more than one year after the completion date of the transaction, unless the Chairperson of the Committee determines, in consultation with other members of the Committee, that because the foreign person no longer meets all the criteria set forth in § 800.219(a)(1) or (2), (a)(3)(i) through (iii), or (c)(1)(i) through (iii), the transaction may threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and in no event shall an agency notice under this paragraph be made with respect to such a transaction more than three years after the completion date of the transaction.


(d) Notices filed under paragraph (c) of this section are deemed accepted upon their receipt by the Staff Chairperson. No agency notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be made with respect to a transaction more than three years after the completion date of the transaction, unless the Chairperson of the Committee, in consultation with other members of the Committee, files such an agency notice.


(e) No communications other than those described in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section shall constitute the filing or submitting of a notice for purposes of section 721.


(f) Upon receipt of the electronic copy of a notice filed under paragraph (a) of this section, including the certification required by § 800.502(l), and payment of the fee required under subpart K of this part, the Staff Chairperson shall promptly inspect such notice for completeness.


(g) Parties to a transaction are encouraged to consult with the Committee in advance of filing a notice and, in appropriate cases, to file with the Committee a draft notice or other appropriate documents to aid the Committee's understanding of the transaction and to provide an opportunity for the Committee to request additional information to be included in the notice. Any such pre-notice consultation should take place, or any draft notice should be provided, at least five business days before the filing of a voluntary notice.

(i) For any voluntarily submitted draft or formal written notice that includes a stipulation under section § 800.502(o) that a transaction is a covered transaction, the Committee shall provide comments on the draft or formal written notice or accept the formal written notice of a covered transaction not later than the date that is 10 business days after the date of submission of the draft or formal written notice.


(j) No party to a transaction may file a notice under paragraph (a) of this section if the transaction has been the subject of a declaration submitted under subpart D and the Committee has not yet taken action with respect to the transaction under § 800.407.
