(o) A party filing a voluntary notice may stipulate that the transaction is a covered transaction and, if the party stipulates that the transaction is a covered transaction, that the transaction is a foreign government-controlled transaction. A stipulation offered by any party under this section must be accompanied by a detailed description of the basis for the stipulation. The required description of the basis shall include discussion of all relevant information responsive to paragraphs (c)(5)(iii) through (v) of this section. A party that offers such a stipulation acknowledges that the Committee and the President are entitled to rely on such stipulation in determining whether the transaction is a covered transaction, a foreign government-controlled transaction, and/or subject to mandatory declaration or notice for the purposes of section 721 and all authorities thereunder, and waives the right to challenge any such determination. Neither the Committee nor the President is bound by any such stipulation, nor does any such stipulation limit the ability of the Committee or the President to act on any authority provided under section 721 with respect to any covered transaction.
