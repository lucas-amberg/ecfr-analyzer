The Staff Chairperson may reject a voluntary notice under ยง 800.504(a)(3) upon a determination that the amount of the filing fee paid by the parties was insufficient under this subpart. Prior to rejecting a notice under ยง 800.504(a)(3), the Staff Chairperson shall inform the parties in writing of the insufficiency of payment and provide the parties three business days to pay the remainder of the filing fee.
