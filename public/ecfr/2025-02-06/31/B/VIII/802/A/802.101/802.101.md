# § 802.101   Scope.

(a) Section 721 of title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4565) authorizes the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review transactions involving real estate that meet specified criteria, which are referred to in this part as “covered real estate transactions” and defined at § 802.212, and to mitigate any risk to the national security of the United States that arises as a result of such transactions. Section 721 also authorizes the President to suspend or prohibit any covered real estate transaction when, in the President's judgment, there is credible evidence that leads the President to believe that the foreign person engaging in a covered real estate transaction might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States, and when provisions of law other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) do not, in the judgment of the President, provide adequate and appropriate authority for the President to protect the national security of the United States in the matter before the President.


(b) This part implements regulations pertaining to covered real estate transactions. Regulations pertaining to “covered transactions” are addressed in part 800 of this chapter.
