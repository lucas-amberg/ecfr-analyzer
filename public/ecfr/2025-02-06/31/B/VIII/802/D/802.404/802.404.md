# § 802.404   Rejection, disposition, or withdrawal of declarations.

(a) The Committee, acting through the Staff Chairperson, may:


(1) Reject any declaration that does not comply with § 802.402 and so inform the parties promptly in writing;


(2) Reject any declaration at any time, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if, after the declaration has been submitted and before the Committee has taken one of the actions specified in § 802.405:


(i) There is a material change in the covered real estate transaction as to which a declaration has been submitted; or


(ii) Information comes to light that contradicts material information provided in the declaration by the party (or parties); or


(3) Reject any declaration at any time after the declaration has been submitted, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if the party (or parties) that submitted the declaration does not provide follow-up information requested by the Staff Chairperson within two business days of the request, or within a longer time frame if the party (or parties) so request in writing and the Staff Chairperson grants that request in writing.


(b) The Staff Chairperson shall notify the party (or parties) that submitted a declaration when the Committee has found that the transaction that is the subject of a declaration is not a covered real estate transaction.


(c) Parties to a transaction that have submitted a declaration under § 802.401 may request in writing, at any time prior to the Committee taking action under § 802.405, that such declaration be withdrawn. Such request shall be directed to the Staff Chairperson and shall state the reasons why the request is being made and state whether the transaction that is the subject of the declaration is being fully and permanently abandoned. An official of the Department of the Treasury will promptly advise the parties to the transaction in writing of the Committee's decision.


(d) The Committee may not request or recommend that a declaration be withdrawn and refiled, except to permit parties to a covered real estate transaction to correct material errors or omissions, or describe material changes to the transaction, in the declaration submitted with respect to that covered real estate transaction.


(e) A party (or parties) may not submit more than one declaration for the same or a substantially similar transaction without approval from the Staff Chairperson.
