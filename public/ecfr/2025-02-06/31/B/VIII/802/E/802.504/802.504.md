# § 802.504   Deferral, rejection, or disposition of certain voluntary notices.

(a) The Committee, acting through the Staff Chairperson, may:


(1) Reject any voluntary notice that does not comply with § 802.501 or § 802.502 and so inform the parties promptly in writing;


(2) Reject any voluntary notice at any time, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if, after the notice has been submitted and before action by the Committee or the President has been concluded:


(i) There is a material change in the transaction as to which notification has been made; or


(ii) Information comes to light that contradicts material information provided in the notice by the parties;


(3) Reject any voluntary notice at any time upon determining that the filing fee paid by the parties was insufficient under subpart K of this part, subject to § 802.1108;


(4) Reject any voluntary notice at any time after the notice has been accepted, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if the party or parties that have submitted the voluntary notice do not provide follow-up information requested by the Staff Chairperson within three business days of the request, or within a longer time frame if the parties so request in writing and the Staff Chairperson grants that request in writing;


(5) Reject any voluntary notice before the conclusion of a review or investigation, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if one of the parties submitting the voluntary notice has not submitted the final certification required by § 802.502(l); or


(6) Reject any voluntary notice at any time after the notice has been accepted, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if the Committee has proposed risk mitigation terms, including revisions to such terms, and if the Staff Chairperson has imposed a time frame for responding to such terms as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, to the party or parties that submitted the notice and the party or parties have failed to substantively respond to such terms within the time frame specified.




(b) Notwithstanding the authority of the Staff Chairperson under paragraph (a) of this section to reject an incomplete notice, the Staff Chairperson may defer acceptance of the notice, and the beginning of the review period specified by § 802.503, to obtain any information required under this section that has not been submitted by the notifying party or parties or other parties to the transaction. Where necessary to obtain such information, the Staff Chairperson may inform any non-notifying party or parties that notice has been filed with respect to a transaction involving the party, and request that certain information required under this section, as specified by the Staff Chairperson, be provided to the Committee within seven days after receipt of the Staff Chairperson's request.


(c) The Staff Chairperson shall notify the parties when the Committee has found that the transaction that is the subject of a voluntary notice is not a covered real estate transaction.


(d) The Staff Chairperson may impose a time frame of no fewer than three business days for the party or parties to provide a substantive response to proposed risk mitigation terms, including revisions to such terms. The time frame may be extended if the parties so request in writing and the Staff Chairperson grants that request in writing. In determining whether to impose such a time frame, the Staff Chairperson may consider:


(1) The statutory deadline for completing an investigation under section 721(b)(2)(C)(i);


(2) The risk to the national security of the United States arising from the transaction;


(3) The party's or parties' responsiveness to the Committee;


(4) The nature of the transaction;


(5) The appropriateness of suspending, or imposing conditions on, the transaction under section 721(*l*); and


(6) Other such factors the Staff Chairperson may determine to be appropriate in connection with a specific transaction.




(e) Example: The Staff Chairperson receives a joint notice from Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a company that is selling covered real estate. The joint notice does not contain any information described under § 802.502 concerning the nature of the real estate. The Staff Chairperson may reject the notice or defer the start of the review period until the parties have supplied the omitted information.
