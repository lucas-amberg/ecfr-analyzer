(a) In any assessment, review, or investigation of a covered real estate transaction, the Committee should consider the factors specified in section 721(f), as applicable, and, as appropriate, require the parties to provide to the Committee the information necessary to consider such factors. The Committee's assessment, review, or investigation (if necessary) shall examine, as appropriate, whether:


(1) The transaction is a covered real estate transaction;


(2) There is credible evidence to support a belief that any foreign person party to a covered real estate transaction might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and


(3) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, provide adequate and appropriate authority to protect the national security of the United States.


(b) During an assessment, review, or investigation, the Staff Chairperson may invite the parties to a notified transaction to attend a meeting with the Committee staff to discuss and clarify issues pertaining to the transaction. During an investigation, a party to the transaction under investigation may request a meeting with the Committee staff; such a request ordinarily will be granted.


(c) The Staff Chairperson shall be the point of contact for receiving material filed with the Committee, including notices and declarations.


(d) Where more than one lead agency is designated, communications on material matters between a party to the transaction and a lead agency shall include all lead agencies designated with regard to those matters.


(e) The parties' description of a transaction in a declaration or notice does not limit the ability of the Committee to, as appropriate, assess, review, or investigate, or exercise any other authorities available under section 721 with respect to any covered real estate transaction that the Committee identifies as having been notified to the Committee based upon the facts set forth in the declaration or notice, any additional information provided to the Committee subsequent to the original declaration or notice, or any other information available to the Committee.
