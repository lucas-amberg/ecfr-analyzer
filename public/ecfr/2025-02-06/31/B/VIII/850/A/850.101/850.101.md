# § 850.101   Scope.

(a) This part implements Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023, “Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern” (the Order), directing the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary), in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and, as appropriate, the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies, to issue, subject to public notice and comment, regulations that require U.S. persons to provide notification of information relative to certain transactions involving covered foreign persons and that prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in certain other transactions involving covered foreign persons.


(b) The regulations identify certain types of transactions that are *covered transactions*—that is, transactions that are either notifiable or prohibited. Additionally, the regulations identify other instances where a U.S. person has obligations with respect to certain transactions. The regulations prescribe exceptions to the definition of *covered transaction.* A transaction that meets an exception is not a *covered transaction* and is referred to as an *excepted transaction.* Finally, the regulations prescribe a process for the Secretary to exempt certain *covered transactions* from the rules otherwise prohibiting or requiring notification of *covered transactions* on a case-by-case basis.


(c) The regulations identify categories of *covered transactions* that are *notifiable transactions.* A *notifiable transaction* is a transaction by a *U.S. person* or its *controlled foreign entity* with or resulting in the establishment of a *covered foreign person* that engages in a *covered activity* that the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and, as appropriate, the heads of other *relevant agencies,* has determined may contribute to the threat to the national security of the United States identified in the Order, or the engagement of a *person of a country of concern* in a *covered activity* that the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and, as appropriate, the heads of other *relevant agencies,* has determined may contribute to the threat to the national security of the United States identified in the Order. The regulations require a *U.S. person* to notify the Department of the Treasury of each such notifiable transaction by such *U.S. person* or its *controlled foreign entity.* The regulations also require a *U.S. person* to provide prompt notice to the Department of the Treasury upon acquiring actual knowledge after the *completion date* of a transaction of facts or circumstances that would have caused the transaction to be a *covered transaction* if the *U.S. person* had had such knowledge on the *completion date.* Additionally, any person who makes a representation, statement, or certification under this part is required to promptly notify the Department of the Treasury upon learning of a material omission or inaccuracy in such representation, statement, or certification.


(d) The regulations identify categories of *covered transactions* that are *prohibited transactions.* A *prohibited transaction* is a transaction by a *U.S. person* with or resulting in the establishment of a *covered foreign person* that engages in a *covered activity* that the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and, as appropriate, the heads of other *relevant agencies,* has determined poses a particularly acute national security threat because of its potential to significantly advance the military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities of a *country of concern,* or engagement of a *person of a country of concern* in a *covered activity* that the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and, as appropriate, the heads of other *relevant agencies,* has determined poses a particularly acute national security threat because of its potential to significantly advance the military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities of a *country of concern.* The regulations prohibit a *U.S. person* from engaging in a *prohibited transaction* and also prohibit a *U.S. person* from *knowingly directing* a transaction that the *U.S. person* knows would be a *prohibited transaction* if engaged in by a *U.S. person.* The regulations also require a *U.S. person* to take all reasonable steps to prohibit and prevent any transaction by its *controlled foreign entity* that would be a *prohibited transaction* if undertaken by a *U.S. person.*

(e) Pursuant to the Order, the Secretary shall, as appropriate:


(1) Communicate with the Congress and the public with respect to the implementation of the Order;


(2) Consult with the Secretary of Commerce on industry engagement and analysis of notifiable transactions;


(3) Consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, and the Director of National Intelligence on the implications for military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities of covered national security technologies and products in the Order and potential covered national security technologies and products;


(4) Engage, together with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, with allies and partners regarding the national security risks posed by countries of concern advancing covered national security technologies and products;


(5) Consult with the Secretary of State on foreign policy considerations related to the implementation of the Order, including but not limited to the issuance and amendment of regulations; and


(6) Investigate, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, as appropriate, violations of the Order or the regulations in this part and pursue available civil penalties for such violations.
