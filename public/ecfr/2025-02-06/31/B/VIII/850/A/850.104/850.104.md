# ยง 850.104   Knowledge standard.

(a) Certain provisions of this part apply only if a U.S. person *knows* of a fact or circumstance. The term *knowledge* is defined in ยง 850.216. In determining whether a U.S. person is complying with this part or has violated any obligation under this part, the Department of the Treasury will assess whether such person has or had knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances at the specified time.


(b) Such assessment as to whether, at the time of a given transaction, a U.S. person has or had knowledge of a given fact or circumstance will be made based on information a U.S. person had or could have had through a reasonable and diligent inquiry. A U.S. person that has failed to conduct a reasonable and diligent inquiry by the time of a given transaction may be assessed to have had reason to know of a given fact or circumstance, including facts or circumstances that would cause the transaction to be a covered transaction.


(c) In assessing whether a U.S. person has undertaken such a reasonable and diligent inquiry, the Department of the Treasury's considerations will include the following, as applicable, among others that the Department of the Treasury deems relevant, with respect to a particular transaction:


(1) The inquiry a U.S. person has made regarding an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner), including questions asked of the investment target or relevant counterparty, as of the time of the transaction;


(2) The contractual representations or warranties the U.S. person has obtained or attempted to obtain from the investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) with respect to the determination of a transaction's status as a covered transaction and status of an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) as a covered foreign person;


(3) The efforts by the U.S. person as of the time of the transaction to obtain and consider available non-public information relevant to the determination of a transaction's status as a covered transaction and the status of an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) as a covered foreign person;


(4) Available public information, the efforts undertaken by the U.S. person to obtain and consider such information, and the degree to which other information available to the U.S. person as of the time of the transaction is consistent or inconsistent with such publicly available information;


(5) Whether the U.S. person purposefully avoided learning or seeking relevant information;


(6) The presence or absence of warning signs, which may include evasive responses or non-responses from an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner) to questions or a refusal to provide information, contractual representations, or warranties; and


(7) The use of available public and commercial databases to identify and verify relevant information of an investment target or other relevant transaction counterparty (such as a joint venture partner).


(d) An assessment of whether a U.S. person has undertaken a reasonable and diligent inquiry shall be based on a consideration of the totality of relevant facts and circumstances.
