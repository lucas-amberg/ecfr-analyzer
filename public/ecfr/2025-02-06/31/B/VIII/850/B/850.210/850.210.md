(1) An excepted transaction as set forth in ยง 850.501; or


(2) For the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.


(c) The acquisition of a contingent interest described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may constitute a covered transaction, and the subsequent occurrence of a conversion event described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section may constitute a separate covered transaction. A U.S. person should assess each of the acquisition and the conversion to determine the applicability of this part.
