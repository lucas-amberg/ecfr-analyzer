# § 850.224   Prohibited transaction.

The term *prohibited transaction* means a covered transaction in which the relevant covered foreign person or, with respect to a covered transaction described in § 850.210(a)(5), the relevant joint venture:


(a) Develops or produces any electronic design automation software for the design of integrated circuits or advanced packaging;


(b) Develops or produces any:


(1) Front-end semiconductor fabrication equipment designed for performing the volume fabrication of integrated circuits, including equipment used in the production stages from a blank wafer or substrate to a completed wafer or substrate (*i.e.,* the integrated circuits are processed but they are still on the wafer or substrate);


(2) Equipment for performing volume advanced packaging; or


(3) Commodity, material, software, or technology designed exclusively for use in or with extreme ultraviolet lithography fabrication equipment.


(c) Designs any integrated circuit that meets or exceeds the performance parameters in Export Control Classification Number 3A090.a in supplement No. 1 to 15 CFR part 774, or integrated circuits designed for operation at or below 4.5 Kelvin;


(d) Fabricates any of the following:


(1) Logic integrated circuits using a non-planar transistor architecture or with a production technology node of 16/14 nanometers or less, including fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) integrated circuits;


(2) NOT-AND (NAND) memory integrated circuits with 128 layers or more;


(3) Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) integrated circuits using a technology node of 18 nanometer half-pitch or less;


(4) Integrated circuits manufactured from a gallium-based compound semiconductor;


(5) Integrated circuits using graphene transistors or carbon nanotubes; or


(6) Integrated circuits designed for operation at or below 4.5 Kelvin;


(e) Packages any integrated circuit using advanced packaging techniques;


(f) Develops, installs, sells, or produces any supercomputer enabled by advanced integrated circuits that can provide a theoretical compute capacity of 100 or more double-precision (64-bit) petaflops or 200 or more single-precision (32-bit) petaflops of processing power within a 41,600 cubic foot or smaller envelope;


(g) Develops a quantum computer or produces any of the critical components required to produce a quantum computer such as a dilution refrigerator or two-stage pulse tube cryocooler;


(h) Develops or produces any quantum sensing platform designed for, or which the relevant covered foreign person intends to be used for, any military, government intelligence, or mass-surveillance end use;


(i) Develops or produces any quantum network or quantum communication system designed for, or which the relevant covered foreign person intends to be used for:


(1) Networking to scale up the capabilities of quantum computers, such as for the purposes of breaking or compromising encryption;


(2) Secure communications, such as quantum key distribution; or


(3) Any other application that has any military, government intelligence, or mass-surveillance end use;


(j) Develops any AI system that is designed to be exclusively used for, or which the relevant covered foreign person intends to be used for, any:


(1) Military end use (*e.g.,* for weapons targeting, target identification, combat simulation, military vehicle or weapon control, military decision-making, weapons design (including chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons), or combat system logistics and maintenance); or


(2) Government intelligence or mass-surveillance end use (*e.g.,* through incorporation of features such as mining text, audio, or video; image recognition; location tracking; or surreptitious listening devices);


(k) Develops any AI system that is trained using a quantity of computing power greater than:


(1) 10^25 computational operations (*e.g.,* integer or floating-point operations); or


(2) 10^24 computational operations (*e.g.,* integer or floating-point operations) using primarily biological sequence data;


(l) Meets the conditions set forth in § 850.209(a)(2) because of its relationship to one or more covered foreign persons engaged in any covered activity described in any of paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section; or


(m) Engages in a covered activity, whether referenced in this section or § 850.217 and is:


(1) Included on the Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List (15 CFR part 744, supplement no. 4);


(2) Included on the Bureau of Industry and Security's Military End User List (15 CFR part 744, supplement no. 7);


(3) Meets the definition of “Military Intelligence End-User” by the Bureau of Industry and Security in 15 CFR 744.22(f)(2);


(4) Included on the Department of the Treasury's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List), or is an entity in which one or more individuals or entities included on the SDN List, individually or in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, own a 50 percent or greater interest;


(5) Included on the Department of the Treasury's list of Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC List); or


(6) Designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State under 8 U.S.C. 1189.
