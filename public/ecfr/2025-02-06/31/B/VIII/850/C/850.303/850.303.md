# § 850.303   Knowingly directing an otherwise prohibited transaction.

(a) A U.S. person is prohibited from knowingly directing a transaction by a non-U.S. person that the U.S. person knows at the time of the transaction would be a prohibited transaction if engaged in by a U.S. person. For purposes of this section, a U.S. person “knowingly directs” a transaction when the U.S. person has authority, individually or as part of a group, to make or substantially participate in decisions on behalf of a non-U.S. person, and exercises that authority to direct, order, decide upon, or approve a transaction. Such authority exists when a U.S. person is an officer, director, or otherwise possesses executive responsibilities at a non-U.S. person.


(b) A U.S. person that has the authority described in paragraph (a) of this section and recuses themself from each of the following activities will not be considered to have exercised their authority to direct, order, decide upon, or approve a transaction:


(1) Participating in formal approval and decision-making processes related to the transaction, including making a recommendation;


(2) Reviewing, editing, commenting on, approving, and signing relevant transaction documents; and


(3) Engaging in negotiations with the investment target (or, as applicable, the relevant transaction counterparty, such as a joint venture partner).
