# § 850.501   Excepted transaction.

A transaction that would be either a prohibited transaction or a notifiable transaction if engaged in by a U.S. person but for this section is not a prohibited transaction or a notifiable transaction, as applicable, if the conditions set forth in this section are met. In that case, the transaction is an excepted transaction. The following transactions are excepted transactions:


(a)(1) An investment by a U.S. person:


(i) In any publicly traded security, with “security” as defined in section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10), denominated in any currency, and that trades on a securities exchange or through the method of trading that is commonly referred to as “over-the-counter,” in any jurisdiction;


(ii) In a security issued by:


(A) Any “investment company” as defined in section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(1), that is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, such as index funds, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds; or


(B) Any company that has elected to be regulated or is regulated as a business development company pursuant to section 54 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. 80a-53;


(iii) Made as a limited partner or equivalent in a venture capital fund, private equity fund, fund of funds, or other pooled investment fund other than as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section where:


(A) The limited partner or equivalent's committed capital is not more than $2,000,000, aggregated across any investment and co-investment vehicles of the fund; or


(B) The limited partner or equivalent has secured a binding contractual assurance that its capital in the fund will not be used to engage in a transaction that would be a prohibited transaction or notifiable transaction, as applicable, if engaged in by a U.S. person; or


(iv) In a derivative, so long as such derivative does not confer the right to acquire equity, any rights associated with equity, or any assets in or of a covered foreign person.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an investment is not an excepted transaction if it affords the U.S. person rights beyond standard minority shareholder protections with respect to the covered foreign person. Such standard minority shareholder protections include:


(i) The power to prevent the sale or pledge of all or substantially all of the assets of an entity or a voluntary filing for bankruptcy or liquidation;


(ii) The power to prevent an entity from entering into contracts with majority investors or their affiliates;


(iii) The power to prevent an entity from guaranteeing the obligations of majority investors or their affiliates;


(iv) The right to purchase an additional interest in an entity to prevent the dilution of an investor's pro rata interest in that entity in the event that the entity issues additional instruments conveying interests in the entity;


(v) The power to prevent the change of existing legal rights or preferences of the particular class of stock held by minority investors, as provided in the relevant corporate documents governing such stock; and


(vi) The power to prevent the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, constituent agreement, or other organizational documents of an entity with respect to the matters described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v) of this section;


(b) The acquisition by a U.S. person of equity or other interests in an entity held by one or more persons of a country of concern; *provided that:*

(2) Following such acquisition, the entity does not constitute a covered foreign person;


(c) A transaction that, but for this paragraph, would be a covered transaction between a U.S. person and its controlled foreign entity that supports operations that are not covered activities or that maintains covered activities that the controlled foreign entity was engaged in prior to January 2, 2025;


(d) A transaction made after January 2, 2025, pursuant to a binding, uncalled capital commitment entered into before January 2, 2025;


(e) The acquisition of a voting interest in a covered foreign person by a U.S. person upon default or other condition involving a loan or a similar financing arrangement, where the loan was made by a syndicate of banks in a loan participation where the U.S. person lender(s) in the syndicate:


(1) Cannot on its own initiate any action vis-à-vis the debtor; and


(2) Is not the syndication agent;


(f) The receipt of employment compensation by an individual in the form of an award of equity or the grant of an option to purchase equity in a covered foreign person, or the exercise of such option; or


(g)(1) A transaction that is:


(i) With or involving a person of a country or territory outside of the United States designated by the Secretary, after taking into account whether the country or territory is addressing national security risks substantially similar to those described in the Order and related to outbound investment; and


(ii) Of a type for which the Secretary has determined that the related national security concerns are likely to be adequately addressed by measures taken or that may be taken by the government of the relevant country or territory.

Any rescission shall be made available through public notice.
