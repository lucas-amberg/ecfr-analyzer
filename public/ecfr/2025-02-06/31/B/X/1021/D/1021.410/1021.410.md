# § 1021.410   Additional records to be made and retained by casinos.

(a) With respect to each deposit of funds, account opened or line of credit extended after the effective date of these regulations, a casino shall, at the time the funds are deposited, the account is opened or credit is extended, secure and maintain a record of the name, permanent address, and social security number of the person involved. Where the deposit, account or credit is in the names of two or more persons, the casino shall secure the name, permanent address, and social security number of each person having a financial interest in the deposit, account or line of credit. The name and address of such person shall be verified by the casino at the time the deposit is made, account opened, or credit extended. The verification shall be made by examination of a document of the type described in § 1010.312 of this chapter, and the specific identifying information shall be recorded in the manner described in § 1010.312 of this chapter. In the event that a casino has been unable to secure the required social security number, it shall not be deemed to be in violation of this section if it has made a reasonable effort to secure such number and it maintains a list containing the names and permanent addresses of those persons from who it has been unable to obtain social security numbers and makes the names and addresses of those persons available to the Secretary upon request. Where a person is a nonresident alien, the casino shall also record the person's passport number or a description of some other government document used to verify his identity.


(b) In addition, each casino shall retain either the original or a copy or reproduction of each of the following:


(1) A record of each receipt (including but not limited to funds for safekeeping or front money) of funds by the casino for the account (credit or deposit) of any person. The record shall include the name, permanent address and social security number of the person from whom the funds were received, as well as the date and amount of the funds received. If the person from whom the funds were received is a non-resident alien, the person's passport number or a description of some other government document used to verify the person's identity shall be obtained and recorded;


(2) A record of each bookkeeping entry comprising a debit or credit to a customer's deposit account or credit account with the casino;

(4) A record of each extension of credit in excess of $2,500, the terms and conditions of such extension of credit, and repayments. The record shall include the customer's name, permanent address, social security number, and the date and amount of the transaction (including repayments). If the customer or person for whom the credit extended is a non-resident alien, his passport number or description of some other government document used to verify his identity shall be obtained and recorded;


(5) A record of each advice, request or instruction received or given by the casino for itself or another person with respect to a transaction involving a person, account or place outside the United States (including but not limited to communications by wire, letter, or telephone). If the transfer outside the United States is on behalf of a third party, the record shall include the third party's name, permanent address, social security number, signature, and the date and amount of the transaction. If the transfer is received from outside the United States on behalf of a third party, the record shall include the third party's name, permanent address, social security number, signature, and the date and amount of the transaction. If the person for whom the transaction is being made is a non-resident alien the record shall also include the person's name, his passport number or a description of some other government document used to verify his identity;
