# ยง 2.4   Designation of participating programs.

(a) Pilot programs may be nominated by a DoD Component Head or Component Acquisition Executive for participation in the Defense Acquisition Pilot Program.

(b) Once included in the Defense Acquisition Pilot Program, decision and approval authority for the participating program shall be delegated to the lowest level allowed in the acquisition regulations consistent with the total cost of the program (e.g., under DoD Directive 5000.1,

(c) At the time of nomination approval, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology will establish measures to judge the success of a specific program, and will also establish a means of reporting progress towards the measures.
