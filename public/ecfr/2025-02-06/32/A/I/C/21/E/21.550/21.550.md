# ยง 21.550   Must DoD Components relate reported actions to listings in the CFDA?

Yes, DoD Components' central points must report each action as an obligation or deobligation under a specific programmatic listing in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA, see ยง 21.505). The programmatic listing to be shown is the one that provided the funds being obligated or deobligated. For example, if a grants officer or agreements officer in one DoD Component obligates appropriations of a second DoD Component's programmatic listing, the grants officer or agreements officer must show the CFDA programmatic listing of the second DoD Component on the DD Form 2566.
