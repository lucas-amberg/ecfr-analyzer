# ยง 21.555   When and how must DoD Components report to the DAADS?

DoD Components must report:


(a) Each obligating or deobligating action no later than 15 days after the date of the obligation or deobligation. Doing so enables DAADS to comply with the deadline in the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282; 31 U.S.C. 6101 note) to report to the Governmentwide data system (*USASpending.gov*) established to implement requirements of that Act.


(b) Using a method and in a format permitted either by the DAADS User Guide described in ยง 21.540(b) or by agreement with the DAADS Administrator.
