# § 22.310   Statutes concerning certain research, development, and facilities construction grants.

(a) *Definitions specific to this section.* For the purposes of implementing the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2374 in this section, the following terms are defined:


(1) *Follow-on grant.* A grant that provides for continuation of research and development performed by a recipient under a preceding grant. Note that follow-on grants are distinct from incremental funding actions during the period of execution of a multi-year award.


(2) *New grant.* A grant that is not a follow-on grant.


(b) *Statutory requirement to use competitive procedures.* (1) A grants officer shall not award a grant by other than merit-based, competitive procedures (as defined by § 22.315) to an institution of higher education for the performance of research and development or for the construction of research or other facilities, unless:


(i) In the case of a new grant for research and development, there is a statute meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;


(ii) In the case of a follow-on grant for research and development, or of a grant for the construction of research or other facilities, there is a statute meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and


(iii) The Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a written notice of intent to make the grant. The grant may not be awarded until 180 calendar days have elapsed after the date on which Congress received the notice of intent. Contracting activities must submit a draft notice of intent with supporting documentation through channels to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.


(2) Because subsequently enacted statutes may, by their terms, impose different requirements than set out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, grants officers shall consult legal counsel on a case-by-case basis, when grants for the performance of research and development or for the construction of research or other facilities are to be awarded to institutions of higher education by other than merit-based competitive procedures.


(c) *Subsequent statutes.* In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2361 and 10 U.S.C. 2374, a provision of law may not be construed as requiring the award of a grant through other than the merit-based, competitive procedures described in § 22.315, unless:


(1) *Institutions of higher education—new grants for research and development.* In the case of a new grant for research and development to an institution of higher education, such provision of law specifically:


(i) Identifies the particular institution of higher education involved;


(ii) States that such provision of law modifies or supersedes the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2361 (a requirement that applies only if the statute authorizing or requiring award by other than competitive procedures was enacted after September 30, 1989); and


(iii) States that the award to the institution of higher education involved is required by such provision of law to be made in contravention of the policy set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2374(a).


(2) *Institutions of higher education—follow-on grants for research and development and grants for the construction of any research or other facility.* In the case of any such grant to an institution of higher education, such provision of law specifically:


(i) Identifies the particular institution of higher education involved; and


(ii) States that such provision of law modifies or supersedes the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2361 (a requirement that applies only if the statute authorizing or requiring award by other than competitive procedures was enacted after September 30, 1989).


(3) *Other entities—new grants for research and development*—(i) *General.* In the case of a new grant for research and development to an entity other than an institution of higher education, such provision of law specifically:


(A) Identifies the particular entity involved;


(B) States that the award to that entity is required by such provision of law to be made in contravention of the policy set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2374(a).


(ii) *Exception.* The requirement of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to any grant that calls upon the National Academy of Sciences to:


(A) Investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to the Department of Defense or any Military Department; and


(B) Report on such matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.
