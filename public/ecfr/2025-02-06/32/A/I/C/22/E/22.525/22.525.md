(2) Questions from agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the United States which are to be used for statistical compilations of general public interest.


(b) The Act applies to similar collections of information by recipients of grants or cooperative agreements only when:


(1) A recipient collects information at the specific request of the awarding Federal agency; or


(2) The terms and conditions of the award require specific approval by the agency of the information collection or the collection procedures.
