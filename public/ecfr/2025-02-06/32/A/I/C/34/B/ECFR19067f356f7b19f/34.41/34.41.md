# ยง 34.41   Monitoring and reporting program and financial performance.

Grants officers may use the provisions of subparts A and B of 2 CFR part 1134 for awards to for-profit organizations, or may include equivalent technical and financial reporting requirements that ensure reasonable oversight of the expenditure of appropriated funds. As a minimum, equivalent requirements must include:


(a) Periodic reports (at least annually, and no more frequently than quarterly) addressing both program status and business status, as follows:


(1) The program portions of the reports must address progress toward achieving program performance goals, including current issues, problems, or developments.


(2) The business portions of the reports shall provide summarized details on the status of resources (federal funds and non-federal cost sharing or matching), including an accounting of expenditures for the period covered by the report. The report should compare the resource status with any payment and expenditure schedules or plans provided in the original award; explain any major deviations from those schedules; and discuss actions that will be taken to address the deviations.


(3) When grants officers previously authorized advance payments, pursuant to ยง 34.12(a)(2), they should consult with the program official and consider whether program progress reported in the periodic report, in relation to reported expenditures, is sufficient to justify continued authorization of advance payments.


(b) Unless inappropriate, a final performance report that addresses all major accomplishments under the award.
