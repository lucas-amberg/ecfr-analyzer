# Appendix D to Part 37—What Common National Policy Requirements May Apply and Need To Be Included in TIAs?


Whether your TIA is a cooperative agreement or another type of assistance transaction, as discussed in Appendix B to this part, the terms and conditions of the agreement must provide for recipients' compliance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations. This appendix lists some of the more common requirements to aid you in identifying ones that apply to your TIA. The list is not intended to be all-inclusive, however, and you may need to consult legal counsel to verify whether there are others that apply in your situation (*e.g.*, due to a provision in the appropriations act for the specific funds that you are using or due to a statute or rule that applies to a particular program or type of activity).


One requirement that applies to all TIAs currently requires you to obtain a certification at the time of proposal. That requirement is in a Governmentwide common rule about lobbying prohibitions, which is implemented by the DoD at 32 CFR part 28. The prohibitions apply to all financial assistance. Appendix A to 32 CFR part 22 includes a sample provision that you may use, to have proposers incorporate the certification by reference into their proposals.


DoD policy is to use a certification, as described in the preceding paragraph, only for a national policy requirement that specifically requires one. The usual approach to communicating other national policy requirements to recipients is to incorporate them as award terms or conditions, or assurances. Part 1122 of 2 CFR lists national policy requirements that commonly apply to DoD grants and cooperative agreements. It also has standard wording of general terms and conditions to incorporate the requirements in award documents. Of those requirements, the following six apply to all TIAs. (Note that TIAs must generally use the standard wording in 2 CFR part 1122 for the terms and conditions of these six requirements, but not the standard format.)


1. Requirements concerning debarment and suspension in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by the DoD at 2 CFR part 1125. The requirements apply to all nonprocurement transactions.


2. Requirements concerning drug-free workplace in the Governmentwide common rule that the DoD has codified at 32 CFR part 26. The requirements apply to all financial assistance.


3. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d, *et seq.*), as implemented by DoD regulations at 32 CFR part 195. These apply to all financial assistance. They require recipients to flow down the prohibitions to any subrecipients performing a part of the substantive research program (as opposed to suppliers from whom recipients purchase goods or services).


4. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of age, in the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101, *et seq.*). They apply to all financial assistance and require flow down to subrecipients, as implemented by Department of Health and Human Services regulations at 45 CFR part 90.


5. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of handicap, in section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as implemented by Department of Justice regulations at 28 CFR part 41 and DoD regulations at 32 CFR part 56. They apply to all financial assistance recipients and require flow down to subrecipients.


6. Preferences for use of U.S.-flag air carriers in the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 40118), commonly referred to as the “Fly America Act,” and implementing regulations at 41 CFR 301-10.131 through 301-10.143, which apply to uses of U.S. Government funds.


Additional national policy requirements may apply in certain circumstances, as follows:


1. If construction work is to be done under a TIA or its subawards, it is subject to the prohibitions in Executive Order 11246, as amended, on discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. You must include the clause provided in 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) in any “federally assisted construction contract” (as defined in 41 CFR 60-1.3) under this award unless provisions of 41 CFR part 60-1 exempt the contract from the requirement. The clause will require the contractor to comply with equal opportunity requirements in 41 CFR chapter 60.


2. If the research involves human subjects or animals, it is subject to the applicable requirements identified in appendix C of 2 CFR part 1122.


3. If the research involves actions that may affect the human environment, it is subject to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in paragraph A.4.a of NP Article II, which is found in appendix B of 2 CFR part 1122. It also may be subject to one or more of the other requirements in paragraphs A.4.b through A.4.f, A.5, and A.6 of NP Article II, which concern flood-prone areas, coastal zones, coastal barriers, wild and scenic rivers, underground sources of drinking water, endangered species, and marine mammal protection.


4. If the project may impact any property listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, it is subject to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. 306108) as specified in paragraph 11.a of NP Article IV, which is found in appendix D of 2 CFR part 1122.


5. If the project has potential under this award for irreparable loss or destruction of significant scientific, prehistorical, historical, or archeological data, it is subject to the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974 (54 U.S.C. Chapter 3125) as specified in paragraph 11.b of NP Article IV, which is found in appendix D of 2 CFR part 1122.
