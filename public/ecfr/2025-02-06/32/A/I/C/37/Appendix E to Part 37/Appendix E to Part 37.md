# Appendix E to Part 37—What Provisions May A Participant Need to Include When Purchasing Goods or Services Under a TIA?


A. As discussed in § 37.705, you must inform recipients of any national policy requirements that flow down to their purchases of goods or services (*e.g.,* supplies or equipment) under their TIAs. Note that purchases of goods or services differ from subawards, which are for substantive research program performance.


B. Appendix A to 32 CFR part 34 lists ten national policy requirements that commonly apply to firms' purchases under grants or cooperative agreements. Of those ten, two that apply to all recipients' purchases under TIAs are:


1. *Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352).* A contractor submitting a bid to the recipient for a contract award of $100,000 or more must file a certification with the recipient that it has not and will not use Federal appropriations for certain lobbying purposes. The contractor also must disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. For further details, see 32 CFR part 28, the DoD's codification of the Governmentwide common rule implementing this amendment.


2. *Debarment and suspension.* A contract award with an amount expected to equal or exceed $25,000 and certain other contract awards (see 2 CFR 1125.220, which implements OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220) shall not be made to parties identified in the Exclusions area of the System for Award Management (SAM Exclusions) as being currently debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded. This restriction is in accordance with the DoD adoption at 2 CFR part 1125 of the OMB guidance implementing E.O.s 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235), “Debarment and Suspension.”


C. The following requirements apply to recipient's purchases under TIAs in the situations specified below:


1. *Equal Employment Opportunity.* Although construction work should happen rarely under a TIA, the agreements officer in that case should inform the recipient that Department of Labor regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) prescribe a clause that must be incorporated into recipients' and subrecipients' construction contracts under their awards and subawards, respectively. Further details are provided in appendix B to part 22 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 22), in section b. under the heading “Nondiscrimination.” any “federally assisted construction contract” (as defined in 41 CFR 60-1.3) under the award unless provisions of 41 CFR part 60-1 exempt the contract from the requirement. The clause will require the contractor to comply with equal opportunity requirements in 41 CFR chapter 60.


2. *Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly the Davis Bacon Act.* When required by Federal program legislation, you must take the following actions with respect to each construction contract for more than $2,000 to be awarded using funding provided under this award:


a. Place in the solicitation under which the contract will be awarded a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor;


b. Condition the decision to award the contract upon the contractor's acceptance of that prevailing wage determination;


c. Include in the contract the clauses specified at 29 CFR 5.5(a) in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5, “Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction”) to require the contractor's compliance with the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), as amended (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147); and


d. Report all suspected or reported violations to the award administration office identified in this award.


3. *Fly America requirements.* In each contract under which funds provided under this award might be used to participate in costs of international air travel or transportation for people or property, you must include a clause to require the contractor to:


a. Comply with the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 40118, also known as the “Fly America” Act), as implemented by the General Services Administration at 41 CFR 301-10.131 through 301-10.143, which provides that U.S Government financed international air travel and transportation of personal effects or property must use a U.S. Flag air carrier or be performed under a cost sharing arrangement with a U.S. carrier, if such service is available; and


b. Include the requirements of the Fly America Act in all subcontracts that might involve international air transportation.


4. *Cargo preference for United States flag vessels.* In each contract under which equipment, material, or commodities may be shipped by oceangoing vessels, you must include the clause specified in Department of Transportation regulations at 46 CFR 381.7(b) to require that at least 50 percent of equipment, materials or commodities purchased or otherwise obtained with Federal funds under this award, and transported by ocean vessel, be transported on privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels, if available.
