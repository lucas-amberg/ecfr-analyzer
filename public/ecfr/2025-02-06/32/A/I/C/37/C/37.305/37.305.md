# ยง 37.305   When may I use a fixed-support TIA?

You may use a fixed-support TIA if: 


(a) The agreement is to support or stimulate research with outcomes that are well defined, observable, and verifiable; 


(b) You can reasonably estimate the resources required to achieve those outcomes well enough to ensure the desired level of cost sharing (*see* example in ยง 37.560(b)); and 


(c) Your TIA does not require a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing. In cases where the agreement does require a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing, a fixed-support TIA is not practicable because the agreement has to specify cost principles or standards for costs that may be charged to the project; require the recipient to track the costs of the project; and provide access for audit to allow verification of the recipient's compliance with the mandatory cost sharing. You therefore must use an expenditure-based TIA if you: 


(1) Have a non-waivable requirement (*e.g.,* in statute) for a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing; or 


(2) Have otherwise elected to include in the TIA a requirement for a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing.
