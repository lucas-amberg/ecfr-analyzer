# ยง 37.310   When would I use an expenditure-based TIA?

In general, you must use an expenditure-based TIA under conditions other than those described in ยง 37.305. Reasons for any exceptions to this general rule must be documented in the award file and must be consistent with the policy in ยง 37.230 that precludes payment of fee or profit to participants.
