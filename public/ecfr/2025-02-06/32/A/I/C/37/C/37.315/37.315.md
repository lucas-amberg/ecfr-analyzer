# § 37.315   What are the advantages of using a fixed-support TIA?

In situations where the use of fixed-support TIAs is permissible (see §§ 37.305 and 37.310), their use may encourage some commercial firms' participation in the research. With a fixed-support TIA, you can eliminate or reduce some post-award requirements that sometimes are cited as disincentives for those firms to participate. For example, a fixed-support TIA need not: 


(a) Specify minimum standards for the recipient's financial management system. 


(b) Specify cost principles or standards stating the types of costs the recipient may charge to the project. 


(c) Provide for financial audits by Federal auditors or independent public accountants of the recipient's books and records. 


(d) Set minimum standards for the recipient's purchasing system. 


(e) Require the recipient to prepare financial reports for submission to the Federal Government.
