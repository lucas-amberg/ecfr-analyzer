# ยง 37.540   May I accept fully depreciated real property or equipment as cost sharing?

You should limit the value of any contribution of a fully depreciated asset to a reasonable use charge. In determining what is reasonable, you must consider: 


(a) The original cost of the asset; 


(b) Its estimated remaining useful life at the time of your negotiations; 


(c) The effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased performance due to age; and 


(d) The amount of depreciation that the participant previously charged to Federal awards.
