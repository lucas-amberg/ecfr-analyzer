# ยง 37.545   May I accept costs of prior research as cost sharing?

No, you may not count any participant's costs of prior research as a cost sharing contribution. Only the additional resources that the recipient will provide to carry out the current project (which may include pre-award costs for the current project, as described in ยง 37.830) are to be counted.
