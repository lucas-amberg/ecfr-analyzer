# ยง 37.515   Must I do anything additional to determine the qualification of a consortium?

(a) When the prospective recipient of a TIA is a consortium that is not formally incorporated, your determination that the recipient meets the standard at 32 CFR 22.415(a) requires that you, in consultation with legal counsel, review the management plan in the consortium's collaboration agreement. The purpose of your review is to ensure that the management plan is sound and that it adequately addresses the elements necessary for an effective working relationship among the consortium members. An effective working relationship is essential to increase the research project's chances of success. 


(b) The collaboration agreement, commonly referred to as the articles of collaboration, is the document that sets out the rights and responsibilities of each consortium member. It binds the individual consortium members together, whereas the TIA binds the Government and the consortium as a group (or the Government and a consortium member on behalf of the consortium, as explained in ยง 37.1015). The document should discuss, among other things, the consortium's: 


(1) Management structure. 


(2) Method of making payments to consortium members. 


(3) Means of ensuring and overseeing members' efforts on the project. 


(4) Provisions for members' cost sharing contributions. 


(5) Provisions for ownership and rights in intellectual property developed previously or under the agreement.
