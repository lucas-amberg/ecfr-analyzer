# ยง 37.605   What is the general policy on participants' financial, property, and purchasing systems?

The general policy for expenditure-based TIAs is to avoid requirements that would force participants to use different financial management, property management, and purchasing systems than they currently use for: 


(a) Expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts and assistance awards in general, if they receive them; or 


(b) Commercial business, if they have no expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts and assistance awards.
