# ยง 37.695   What are the requirements for Federally owned property?

If you provide Federally owned property to any participant for the performance of research under a TIA, you must require that participant to account for, use, and dispose of the property in accordance with: 


(a) 32 CFR 34.22, if the participant is a for-profit firm. 


(b) The requirements that apply to the participant's other Federal awards, if it is an entity other than a for-profit firm. If the other Federal awards of a participant that is a GOCO or FFRDC administered by a nonprofit organization are procurement contracts, it is appropriate for you to specify the same property standards that apply to those Federal procurement contracts.
