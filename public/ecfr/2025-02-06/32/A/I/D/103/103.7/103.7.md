# § 103.7   Case management for unrestricted reports of sexual assault.

(a) *General.* CMG oversight for Unrestricted Reports of adult sexual assaults is triggered by open cases in DSAID initiated by a DD Form 2910 or an investigation initiated by an MCIO. In a case where there is an investigation initiated by an MCIO, but no corresponding Unrestricted DD Form 2910:


(1) The SARC would have no information for the CMG members. During the CMG, the MCIO would provide case management information to the CMG, including the SARC.


(2) The SARC would open a case in DSAID indicating the case status as “Open with Limited Information.” The SARC will only use information from the MCIO to initiate an “Open with Limited Information” case in DSAID. In the event that there was a Restricted Report filed prior to the independent investigation, the SARC will not use any information provided by the victim, since that information is confidential.


(b) *Procedures.* (1) The CMG members shall carefully consider and implement immediate, short-term, and long-term measures to help facilitate and assure the victim's well-being and recovery from the sexual assault. They will closely monitor the victim's progress and recovery and strive to protect the victim's privacy, ensuring only those with an official need to know have the victim's name and related details. Consequently, where possible, each case shall be reviewed independently, bringing in only those personnel associated with the case, as well as the CMG chair and co-chair.


(2) The CMG chair shall:


(i) Confirm that the SARCs and SAPR VAs have what they need to provide an effective SAPR response to victims.


(ii) Require an update of the status of each MPO.


(iii) If the victim has informed the SARC of an existing CPO, the chair shall require the SARC to inform the CMG of the existence of the CPO and its requirements.


(iv) After protective order documentation is presented at the CMG from the SARC or the SAPR VA, the DoD law enforcement agents at the CMG will document the information provided in their investigative case file, to include documentation for Reserve Component personnel in title 10 status.


(v) At every CMG meeting, the CMG Chair will ask the CMG members if the victim, victim's family members, witnesses, bystanders (who intervened), SARCs and SAPR VAs, responders, or other parties to the incident have experienced any incidents of retaliation, reprisal, ostracism, or maltreatment. If any allegations are reported, the CMG Chair will forward the information to the proper authority or authorities (*e.g.,* MCIO, Inspector General, MEO). Discretion may be exercised in disclosing allegations of retaliation, reprisal, ostracism, or maltreatment when such allegations involve parties to the CMG. Retaliation, reprisal, ostracism, or maltreatment allegations involving the victim, SARCs, and SAPR VAs will remain on the CMG agenda for status updates, until the victim's case is closed or until the allegation has been appropriately addressed.


(vi) The CMG chair will confirm that each victim receives a safety assessment as soon as possible. There will be a safety assessment capability. The CMG chair will identify installation personnel who have been trained and are able to perform a safety assessment of each sexual assault victim.


(vii) The CMG chair will, if it has not already been done, immediately stand up a multi-disciplinary High-Risk Response Team if a victim is assessed to be in a high-risk situation. The purpose and the responsibility of the High-Risk Response Team is to continually monitor the victim's safety, by assessing danger and developing a plan to manage the situation.


(viii) The High-Risk Response Team (HRRT) shall be chaired by the victim's immediate commander and, at a minimum, include the alleged offender's immediate commander; the victim's SARC and SAPR VA; the MCIO, the judge advocate, and the VWAP assigned to the case; victim's healthcare provider or mental health and counseling services provider; and the personnel who conducted the safety assessment. The responsibility of the HRRT members to attend the HRRT meetings and actively participate in them will not be delegated.
