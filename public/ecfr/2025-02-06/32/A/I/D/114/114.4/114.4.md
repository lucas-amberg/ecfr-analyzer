# § 114.4   Policy.

It is DoD policy that:


(a) The DoD is committed to protecting the rights of victims and witnesses of alleged crimes and supporting their needs in the criminal justice process. The DoD Components will comply with all statutory and policy mandates and will take all additional actions within the limits of available resources to assist victims and witnesses of alleged crimes without infringing on the constitutional or other legal rights of a suspect or an accused.


(b) DoD victim assistance services will focus on the victim and will respond, protect, and care for the victim from initiation of a report through offense disposition, if applicable, and will continue such support until the victim is no longer eligible for such services or the victim specifies to the local responsible official that he or she no longer requires or desires services.


(c) Each DoD Component will provide particular attention and support to victims of serious, violent alleged crimes, including child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault. In order to ensure the safety of victims, and their families, victim assistance personnel shall respect the dignity and the privacy of persons receiving services, and carefully observe any safety plans and military or civilian protective orders in place.


(d) Victim assistance services must meet DoD competency, ethical, and foundational standards established in DoD Instruction 6400.07, “Standards for Victim Assistance Services in the Military Community,” (available at *http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/640007p.pdf*).


(e) Making or preparing to make or being perceived as making or preparing to make a protected communication, to include reporting a violation of law or regulation, including a law or regulation prohibiting rape, sexual assault, or other sexual misconduct, in violation of 10 U.S.C. 920 through 920c, sexual harassment, or unlawful discrimination, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1034, section 1709 of Public Law 113-66, and DoD Directive 7050.06, “Military Whistleblower Protection,” (available at *http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/705006p.pdf*), shall not result in reprisal activity from management officials.


(f) This part is not intended to, and does not, create any entitlement, cause of action, or defense at law or in equity, in favor of any person or entity arising out of the failure to accord to a victim or a witness the assistance outlined in this part. No limitations are hereby placed on the lawful prerogatives of the DoD or its officials.
