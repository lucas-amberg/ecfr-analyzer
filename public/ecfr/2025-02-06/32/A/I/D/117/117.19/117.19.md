# § 117.19   International security requirements.

(a) *General.* This section provides information and procedures governing the protection of classified information in international programs.


(b) *Disclosure of classified U.S. information to foreign interests*—(1) *Applicable federal law.* The transfer of articles, services, and related data to a foreign person, within or outside the United States, or the movement of such material or information to any destination outside of the legal jurisdiction of the United States constitutes an export. Depending on the nature of the articles or data, most exports are pursuant to (1) 22 U.S.C. chapter 39, also known and referred to in this rule as the “Arms Export Control Act,” (2) 50 U.S.C. 4801 *et seq.,* also known as the “Export Control Reform Act of 2018,” or (3) the AEA. This section applies to those exports that involve classified information.


(2) *Security agreements*—(i) Bilateral security agreements (*e.g.,* General Security of Information Agreements and General Security of Military Information Agreements) are negotiated with various foreign governments. Confidentiality requested by some foreign governments prevents a listing of the countries that have executed these agreements. The bilateral security agreement, negotiated through diplomatic channels:


(A) Requires that each government provide substantially the same degree of protection to classified information released by the other government.


(B) Contains provisions concerning limits on the use of each government's information, including restrictions on third-party transfers and proprietary rights.


(C) Does not commit governments to share classified information, nor does it constitute authority to release classified material to that government.


(D) Satisfies, in part, the eligibility requirements of the Arms Export Control Act concerning the agreement of the recipient foreign government to protect U.S. classified defense articles and classified information.


(ii) The applicable CSA will provide a mechanism for contractors to access, for official purposes, classified general security agreements.


(iii) Industrial security agreements have been negotiated with certain foreign governments that identify the procedures to be used when foreign government classified information is provided to U.S. industry and UUSG classified information is provided to foreign defense industry.


(3) *Authorization for disclosure.* The GCA will provide disclosure guidance.


(i) Contractors will only disclose non-public USG information to foreign persons in accordance with specified requirements of the contract. In the absence of any specified requirements the contractor will not disclose non-public USG information to foreign persons.


(ii) Disclosure authorization may be in the form of an export license or other export authorization by a cognizant export authority.


(iii) The contractor may not use disclosure guidance provided by the GCA for a previous contract or program unless so instructed in writing by the GCA or the licensing authority.


(iv) Disclosure and export of classified information, authorized by an appropriate USG disclosure official, by a contractor will ensure the following:


(A) *International agreements.* Contractors may not disclose classified information until agreements are signed by the participating government and disclosure guidance and security arrangements are established. The export of technical data pursuant to such agreements may be exempt by approval of the Department of State or the Department of Commerce.


(B) *Symposia, seminars, exhibitions, and conferences.* Contractors must assure that any foreign nationals who will be attending a classified gathering have the appropriate export license, disclosure authority, and security assurance on file.


(C) *Visits by foreign nationals to the contractor.* The contractor will limit disclosure of classified information to that specific information authorized in connection with an approved visit request and an export authorization, as required.


(D) *Temporary exports.* Classified articles, including articles that require the use of classified information for operation, exported for demonstration purposes must remain under U.S. control. The contractor must obtain an export authorization from the relevant authority (*i.e.,* from the Department of State in accordance with 22 CFR parts 120-130, also known as and referred to in this rule as the “International Traffic in Arms Regulations,” or from the Department of Commerce in accordance with 15 CFR parts 730-774, also known as the “Export Administration Regulations”).


(4) *Direct commercial arrangements.* (i) The disclosure of classified information may be authorized pursuant to a direct commercial sale with the appropriate export authorization. A direct commercial arrangement includes sales, loans, leases, or grants of classified items, including sales under a government agency sales financing program.


(ii) If a proposed disclosure is in support of a foreign government requirement, the contractor should consult with U.S. in-country officials, normally the U.S. Security Assistance/Armaments Cooperation Office or Commercial Counselor.


(A) Before a contractor makes a proposal to a foreign interest that involves the eventual disclosure of U.S. classified information, the contractor must obtain appropriate government disclosure authorization.


(B) Such disclosure authorization does not equate with authorization for export. Export authorization must be obtained from the appropriate regulatory body.


(iii) The contractor will request a FCL assurance for a foreign entity through the CSA from the security authority of the foreign entity's sponsoring government prior to entering into a contractual arrangement with the foreign entity.


(5) *Subcontract security provisions.* (i) A U.S. contractor may be authorized to enter into an agreement involving classified information with a foreign contractor. The U.S. contractor's empowered official will verify the contractor can release the information to a foreign person. Such agreements may include:


(A) Award of a subcontract.


(B) Department of State authorized manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement, or other direct commercial arrangement.


(ii) The contractor will incorporate security provisions into the subcontract document or agreement, and provide security classification guidance by means of a Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent.


(iii) The contractor will provide a copy of the signed contract with the provisions and the classification guidance to the CSA.


(iv) If the export authorization specifies that additional security arrangements are necessary for performance on the contract, the contractor will incorporate those additional arrangements by appropriate provision in the contract or in a separate security document.


(v) The contractor will prepare and maintain a written record that identifies the originator or source of classified information that will be used in providing classified defense articles, material or services to foreign customers. The contractor will maintain this listing with the contractor's record copy of the pertinent export authorization.


(vi) The contractor will include the security provisions in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) in this section in all contracts and subcontracts involving classified information that are awarded to foreign contractors. Contractors must insert the bracketed contract specific information (*e.g.,* applicable country and disposition of classified material) where noted, when using the following security clauses in the contract.


(A) All classified information and material furnished or generated under the contract will be protected to ensure that:


(*1*) The recipient will not release the information or material to any third party without disclosure authorization and export authorization, as appropriate.

(6) *Marking documents prepared for foreign governments.* Marking documents prepared for foreign governments will be marked in accordance with § 117.14(o).


(7) *Storage and control.* Contractors will store foreign government material and control access generally in the same manner as U.S. classified material of an equivalent classification. Contractors will store foreign government material in a manner that will separate it from other material. Separation can be accomplished by establishing distinct files in a storage container or on an information system.


(8) *Disclosure and use limitations.* (i) FGI is provided by the foreign government to the United States. The contractor will:


(A) Not disclose FGI to nationals of a third country, or to any other third party, or use it for any purpose other than that for which it was provided without the prior written consent of the originating foreign government.


(B) Submit requests for other uses or further disclosure to the GCA for U.S. contracts, and through the CSA for direct commercial contracts.


(ii) Approval of the request by the foreign government does not eliminate the requirement for the contractor to obtain an export authorization.


(9) *Transfer.* The contractor will transfer FGI within the United States and its territories using the same channels as specified for U.S. classified information of an equivalent classification, except that contractors cannot use non-cleared express overnight carriers for FGI.


(10) *Reproduction.* The reproduction of foreign government TOP SECRET or equivalent information requires the written approval of the originating government.


(11) *Disposition.* The contractor:


(i) Will destroy FGI on completion of the contract unless the contract specifically authorizes retention or return of the information to the U.S. GCA or foreign government that provided the information.

(13) *Subcontracting.* Subcontracting procedures will be in accordance with § 117.17(a)(4).


(d) *International transfers of classified material*—(1) *General.* This paragraph (d) contains the procedures for international transfers of classified material through government-to-government channels or other arrangements agreed to by the governments involved, otherwise referred to as government-to-government transfers. The requirements in this paragraph (d) do not apply to the transmission of classified material to usg activities outside the united states.


(i) All international transfers of classified material must take place through channels approved by both governments. U.S. control of classified material must be maintained until the material is officially transferred to the intended recipient government through its designated government representative (DGR).


(ii) To ensure government control, written transmission instructions must be prepared for all international transfers of classified material. The contractor is responsible for the preparation of instructions for direct commercial arrangements, and the GCA will prepare instructions for government arrangements.


(iii) The contractor will contact the CSA at the earliest possible stage in deliberations that will lead to the international transfer of classified material. The CSA will advise the contractor on the transfer arrangements, identify the recipient government's DGR, appoint a U.S. DGR, and ensure that the transportation plan prepared by the contractor or foreign government is adequate.


(iv) The contractor's empowered official is responsible for requests for all export authorizations, including ones that will involve the transfer of classified information.


(2) *Transfers of freight*—(i) *Transportation plan (TP).* (A) A requirement to prepare a TP will be included in each arrangement that involves the international transfer of classified material as freight. The TP will:


(*1*) Describe requirements for the secure shipment of the material from the point of origin to the ultimate destination.


(*2*) Provide for security requirements in the event the transfer cannot be made promptly.


(B) The U.S. and recipient government DGRs will be identified in the TP as well as any requirement for an escort. When there are to be repetitive shipments, a notice of classified consignment will be used.


(ii) *Government agency arrangements.* Classified material to be furnished to a foreign government under such transactions normally will be shipped via government agency-arranged transportation and be transferred to the foreign government's DGR within the recipient government's territory.


(A) The government agency that executes the arrangement is responsible, in coordination with the recipient foreign government, for preparing a TP.


(B) When the point of origin is a U.S. contractor facility, the GCA will provide the contractor with a copy of the TP and the applicable letter of offer and acceptance. If a freight forwarder will be involved in processing the shipment, the GCA will provide a copy of the TP to the freight forwarder.


(C) *Commercial arrangements.* (*1*) The contractor will prepare a TP in coordination with the receiving government. This requirement applies whether the material is moved by land, sea, or air, and applies to U.S. and foreign classified contracts.


(*2*) After the CSA approves the TP, the CSA will forward it to the recipient foreign government security authorities for final coordination and approval. The CSA will notify the contractor upon the concurrence by the respective parties.


(D) *International carriers.* The international transfer of classified material will be made using only ships, aircraft, or other carriers that:


(*1*) Are owned or chartered by the USG or under U.S. registry;


(*2*) Are owned or chartered by or under the registry of the recipient government; or


(*3*) Are other than those described that are expressly authorized to perform this function in writing by the Designated Security Authority of the GCA and the security authorities of the foreign government involved. This authority cannot be delegated and this exception may be authorized only when a carrier described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) or (d)(2)(iv)(B) in this section is not available and an urgent operational requirement dictates use of the exception.


(E) *Escorts.* (*1*) The contractor must provide escorts for international shipments of SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL material by air.


(*2*) Escorts must have an eligibility determination and access to classified information at the classification level of the material being shipped.


(*3*) Escorts are responsible for ensuring that the classified material being shipped is safeguarded in the event of an emergency stop en route, re-routing of the aircraft, or in the event that the recipient government's representative fails to meet the shipment at its destination.


(*4*) The contractor does not have to provide escorts if:


(*i*) The classified material is shipped by the Defense Transportation System or a U.S. military carrier.


(*ii*) The recipient government DGR has signed for the receipt of the classified material within the United States.


(*iii*) The classified material is shipped via a military carrier of the recipient government or a carrier owned by or registered to the recipient government.


(*iv*) The classified material is shipped via a cleared U.S. commercial freight carrier, so long as the contractor has a written agreement from the U.S. commercial freight carrier to provide an escort who is eligible for access to classified information and has access to classified information at the classification level of the material being shipped.


(*v*) There are exceptional circumstances, and procedures have been approved by both the USG and the recipient government.


(3) *Secure communications plan.* (i) The contractor is required to meet all requirements outlined in this section, as applicable, for the secure communications plan.

(ii) The approved methods of return will be specified in either the GCA sales arrangement, the security requirements section of a direct commercial sales arrangement or, in the case of material transferred as freight, in the original TP.


(iii) The contractor, on receipt of notification that classified material is to be received, will notify the applicable CSA.


(5) *Use of freight forwarders.* (i) A commercial freight forwarder may be used to arrange for the international transfer of classified material as freight.


(A) The freight forwarder must be under contract to a USG agency, U.S. contractor, or the recipient foreign government.


(B) The contract will describe the specific functions to be performed by the freight forwarder.


(C) The responsibility for security and control of the classified material that is processed by freight forwarders remains with the USG until the freight is transferred to a DGR of the recipient government.


(ii) Only freight forwarders that have a valid determination of eligibility for access to classified information and storage capability for classified material at the appropriate level are eligible to take custody or possession of classified material for delivery as freight to foreign recipients. Freight forwarders that only process unclassified paperwork and make arrangements for the delivery of classified material to foreign recipients do not require an eligibility determination for access to classified information.


(iii) A freight forwarder cannot serve as a DGR.


(6) *Hand carrying classified material.* To meet contractual requirements, the CSA may authorize contractor employees to hand carry classified material outside the United States. SECRET is the highest level of classified material to be carried and it must be of such size and weight that the courier can retain it in his or her possession at all times.


(i) The CSA will ensure that the contractor has made necessary arrangements with U.S. airport security and customs officials and that security authorities of the receiving government approve the plan. If the transfer is under a contract or a bilateral or multinational government program, the GCA will approve the request in writing. The contractor will notify the CSA of a requirement to hand carry at least 5 working days in advance of the transfer.


(ii) The courier must be a full-time employee of the dispatching or receiving contractor who has been determined eligible and has been granted access to classified information.


(iii) The employing contractor will provide the courier with a courier certificate that is consecutively numbered and valid for one journey only.

(v) The dispatching contractor will inventory, wrap, and seal the material in the presence of the U.S. DGR. The contractor will place the address of the receiving security office and the return address of the dispatching contractor security office on the inner envelope or wrapping and mark it with the appropriate classification. The contractor will place the address of the receiving government's DGR on the outer envelope or wrapping along with the return address of the dispatching contractor.


(vi) The dispatching contractor will prepare three copies of a receipt based on the inventory and list the classified material that is being sent. The dispatching contractor will retain one copy of the receipt. The contractor will pack the other two copies with the classified material. The contractor will obtain a receipt for the sealed package from the courier.


(vii) The dispatching contractor will provide the receiving contractor with 24 work hours advance notification of the anticipated date and time of the courier's arrival and the identity of the courier. The receiving contractor must notify the dispatching contractor if the courier does not arrive within 8 hours of the expected time of arrival. The dispatching contractor will notify its DGR of any delay, unless officially notified otherwise of a change in the courier's itinerary.


(viii) The receiving DGR will verify the contents and sign the receipts enclosed in the consignment. The receiving DGR will return one copy to the courier. On return, the courier will provide the executed receipt to the dispatching contractor.


(ix) Throughout the journey, the courier will maintain the classified material under direct personal control. The courier will not leave the material unattended at any time during the journey, in the transport being used, in hotel rooms, in cloakrooms, or other such location, and will not deposit it in hotel safes, luggage lockers, or in luggage offices. In addition, the courier will not open envelopes or packages containing the classified material en route, unless required by customs or other government officials.


(x) When inspection by government officials is unavoidable, the courier will request that the officials provide written verification that they have opened the package. The courier will notify their employing contractor as soon as possible. The contractor will notify the U.S. DGR. If the inspecting officials are not of the same country as the dispatching contractor, the CSA will notify the designated security authority in the country whose officials inspected the consignment. Under no circumstances will the courier hand over the classified material to customs or other officials for their custody.


(xi) When carrying classified material, the courier will not travel by surface routes through third countries, except as authorized by the CSA. The courier will travel only on carriers described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) in this section, and will travel direct routes between the United States and the destination.


(7) *Classified material receipts.* (i) The U.S. DGR and the DGR of the ultimate foreign recipient will maintain a continuous chain of receipts to record international transfers of all classified material from the contractor through the dispatching DGR and recipient DGR to the ultimate foreign recipient. The dispatching contractor will retain:


(A) An active suspense record until return of applicable receipts for the material.


(B) A copy of the external receipt that records the passing of custody of the package containing the classified material and each intermediate consignee in a suspense file until the receipt that is enclosed in the package is signed and returned.

(i) Identify each party to be involved in the transfer in the applicable contract or agreement and in the license application or letter request.


(ii) Notify the appropriate U.S. DGR when the material is ready.


(iii) When the classified material is also ITAR-controlled, provide documentation or written certification by an empowered official (as defined in the ITAR) to the U.S. DGR. This documentation must verify that the classified shipment is within the limitation scope of the pertinent export authorization or an authorized exemption to the export authorization requirements, or is within the limitations of the pertinent GCA contract.


(iv) Have the classified shipment ready for visual review and verification by the DGR. As a minimum this will include:


(A) Preparing the packaging materials, address labels, and receipts for review.


(B) Marking the contents with the appropriate U.S. classification or the equivalent foreign government classification, downgrading, and declassification markings, as applicable.


(C) Ensuring that shipping documents (including, as appropriate, the shipper's export declaration) include the name and contact information for the CSA that validates the license or letter authorization, and the FSO or designee for the particular transfer.


(D) Sending advance notification of the shipment to the CSA, the recipient, and to the freight forwarder, if applicable. The notification will require that the recipient confirm receipt of the shipment or provide notice to the contractor if the shipment is not received in accordance with the prescribed shipping schedule.


(9) *Transfers pursuant to an ITAR exemption.* (i) The contractor will provide to the DGR valid documentation (*i.e.,* license, export authorization, letter of offer and acceptance, or agreement) to verify the export authorization for classified technical data information or certain defense articles to be transferred under an exemption to the ITAR exemption. The documentation must include a copy of the Department of State Form DSP-83 associated with the original export authorization.

(D) *Emergency visits.* A visit related to a specific government-approved contract, international agreement or announced request for proposal, and failure to make the visit could be reasonably expected to seriously jeopardize performance on the contract or program, or result in the loss of a contract opportunity.


(ii) *Requests for visits.* Visit requests are necessary to make administrative arrangements and disclosure decisions and obtain security assurances.


(A) Many foreign governments require the submission of a visit request for all visits to a government facility or a cleared contractor facility, even though classified information may not be involved. They may also require that the requests be received a specified number of days in advance of the visit.


(B) The contractor can obtain information pertaining to the visit requirements of other governments and the NATO from the CSA. The contractor must obtain an export authorization if classified export controlled articles or technical data is to be disclosed or if information to be divulged is related to a classified USG program, unless the disclosure of the information is covered by other agreements, authorizations, or exemptions.


(iii) *Request format.* Contractors will request a visit request template from the CSA. The contractor will forward the visit request to the security official designated by the CSA. The host for the visit should coordinate the visit in advance with appropriate government authorities who are required to approve the visit. It is the visitor's responsibility to ensure that such coordination has occurred.


(iv) *Government agency programs.* The contractor will submit a visit request when contractor employees are to visit foreign government facilities or foreign contractors on USG orders in support of a government contract or agreement.

(3) *Classified visits by foreign nationals to U.S. contractors*—(i) *Requests for classified visits.* Requests for visits by foreign nationals to U.S. contractors that will involve the disclosure of classified information may require authorization by the Department of State. Classified visits by foreign nationals must be processed by government national security authorities on behalf of the contractor through the sponsoring foreign government (normally the visitor's embassy) to the USG for approval.


(ii) *USG approval.* The USG may approve or deny the request or decline to render a decision.


(A) *USG-Approved Visits.* (*1*) USG approved classified visits cannot be used to avoid the export licensing requirements for commercial initiatives.


(*2*) When the cognizant USG agency approves a classified visit, the notification of approval will contain instructions on the level and scope of classified and unclassified information authorized for disclosure, as well as any limitations.

(C) *Non-sponsorship.* The USG agency will decline to render a decision on a classified visit request that is not in support of a USG program. The USG agency will furnish a declination notice indicating that the classified visit is not USG-approved (*i.e.,* the classified visit is non-sponsored) to the requesting foreign government with an information copy to the U.S. contractor to be visited.


(*1*) A declination notice does not preclude the classified visit, provided the contractor has, or obtains, an export authorization for the information involved and, has been notified that the requesting foreign government has provided the required security assurance of the proposed visitor to the USG agency in the original classified visit request.


(*2*) It is the contractor's responsibility to consult applicable export regulations to determine licensing requirements regarding the disclosure of export-controlled information during such classified visits by foreign nationals.


(D) *Visits to subsidiaries.* A classified visit request authorization for a classified visit to any element of a corporate family may be used for visits to other divisions or subsidiaries within the same corporate family in accordance with § 117.15(h)(3), provided disclosures are for the same purpose and the information to be disclosed does not exceed the parameters of the approved classified visit request.


(E) *Long-term classified visits and assignments of foreign nationals.* Extended classified visits and assignments of foreign nationals to contractor locations can be authorized only when it is essential pursuant to a contract or government agreement (*e.g.,* joint venture, liaison representative to a joint or multinational program, and direct commercial sale). The contractor will:


(*1*) Consult with its empowered official for guidance.


(*2*) Notify the CSA in advance of all long-term classified visits and assignments of foreign nationals.

(B) Not inform the foreign visitor of the scope of access authorized or of the limitations imposed by the government.


(ii) *Foreign visitors.* Foreign visitors will not be given custody of classified material except when they are acting as official couriers of the government and the CSA authorizes the transfer.


(iii) *Visitor records.* The contractor will maintain a record of foreign visitors for one year when the visit involves access to classified information.


(iv) *Temporary approval of safeguarding.* (A) Classified U.S. and foreign government material at a U.S. contractor location is to remain under U.S. contractor custody and control and is subject to self-inspection and CSA security reviews.


(B) This does not preclude the contractor from furnishing a foreign visitor with a security container for the temporary storage of classified material, consistent with the purpose of the visit or assignment, provided the CSA approves and responsibility for the container and its contents remains with the U.S. contractor.


(*1*) The CSA may approve exceptions to this policy on a case-by-case basis for the storage of foreign government classified information furnished to the visitor by the visitor's government through government channels.


(*2*) The CSA must approve such exceptions in advance in writing with agreement from the visitor's government. The agreed procedures will be included in the contractor's TCP, will require the foreign nationals to provide receipts for the material, and will include an arrangement for the CSA to ensure compliance, including provisions for the CSA to inspect and inventory the material.


(v) *TCP.* A TCP is required to control access by foreign nationals assigned to, or employed by, cleared contractor facilities, and when foreign nationals visit cleared contractor facilities on a long-term or extended basis, unless the CSA determines that procedures already in place at the contractor's facility are adequate. The TCP will contain procedures to control access for all export-controlled information. A sample TCP may be obtained from the CSA.


(f) *Contractor operations abroad*—(1) *Access by contractor employees assigned outside the United States.* (i) Contractor employees assigned outside the United States, its possessions, or territories may have access to classified information in connection with performance on a specified U.S., NATO, or foreign government classified contract.
