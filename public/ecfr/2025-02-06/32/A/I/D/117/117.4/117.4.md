# ยง 117.4   Policy.

E.O. 12829 established the NISP to serve as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security program to protect classified information and preserve our Nation's economic and technological interests.


(a) When contracts, licenses, agreements, and grants to contractors require access to classified information, national security requires that this information be safeguarded in a manner equivalent to its protection within the executive branch of the USG.


(b) National security requires that the industrial security program promote the economic and technological interests of the United States. Redundant, overlapping, or unnecessary requirements impede those interests.
