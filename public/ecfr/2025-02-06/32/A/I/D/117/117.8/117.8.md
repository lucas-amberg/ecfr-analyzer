# § 117.8   Reporting requirements.

(a) *General.* Pursuant to this rule, Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 3, (available at: *https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-3-Reporting-U.pdf*) and CSA-provided guidance to supplement unique CSA mission requirements, contractors and their cleared employees are required to:


(1) Report certain events that may have an effect on the status of the entity's or an employee's eligibility for access to classified information; report events that indicate an insider threat to classified information or to employees with access to classified information; report events that affect proper safeguarding of classified information; and report events that indicate classified information has been, or is suspected to be, lost or compromised.


(2) Establish internal procedures to ensure employees with eligibility for access to classified information are aware of their responsibilities for reporting pertinent information to the FSO. The contractor will:


(i) Provide reports to the FBI, or other Federal authorities as required by this rule, the terms of a classified contract or other agreement, and by U.S. law.


(ii) Provide complete information to enable the CSA to ascertain whether classified information is adequately protected.


(iii) Submit reports to the FBI, the CSA, or the ISOO as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (g) of this section.


(3) Appropriately mark reports containing classified information in accordance with § 117.14.


(4) Clearly mark a report containing information submitted in confidence as containing that information. When reports contain information pertaining to an individual, 5 U.S.C. 552a (also known as and referred to in this rule as “The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended,”) permits the withholding of certain information from the individual in accordance with specific exemptions, which include authority to withhold release of information to the extent that the disclosure of the information would reveal the identity of a source who furnished the information to the USG under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.


(b) *Reports to be submitted to the FBI.* The contractor will promptly submit a written report to the nearest field office of the FBI regarding information coming to the contractor's attention concerning actual, probable, or possible espionage, sabotage, terrorism, or subversive activities at any of its locations.


(1) An initial report may be made by phone, but it must be followed up in writing (*e.g.,* email or formal correspondence), regardless of the FBI's disposition of the report.


(2) The contractor will promptly notify the CSA when they make a report to the FBI and provide the CSA a copy of the written report.


(c) *Reports to be submitted to the CSA*—(1) *Adverse information.* Contractors are required to report adverse information coming to their attention concerning any of their employees determined to be eligible for access to classified information, in accordance with this rule, SEAD 3, and CSA-provided guidance. Contractors will not make reports based on rumor or innuendo.


(i) The termination of employment of an employee does not negate the requirement to submit this report. If a contractor employee is assigned to a USG location, the contractor will furnish a copy of the report and its final disposition to the USG security point of contact for that location.


(ii) Pursuant to *Becker* v. *Philco,* 372 F.2d 771 (4th Cir. 1967), cert. denied 389 U.S. 979 (1967), and subsequent cases, a contractor may not be liable for defamation of an employee because of communications that are required of and made by a contractor to an agency of the United States under the requirements of this rule or under the terms of applicable contracts.


(2) *Suspicious contacts.* Contractors will report information pertaining to suspicious contacts with employees determined to be eligible for access to classified information, and pertaining to efforts to obtain illegal or unauthorized access to the contractor's cleared facility by any means, including:


(i) Efforts by any individual, regardless of nationality, to obtain illegal or unauthorized access to classified information.


(ii) Efforts by any individual, regardless of nationality, to elicit information from an employee determined eligible for access to classified information, and any contact which suggests the employee may be the target of an attempted exploitation by an intelligence service of another country. See SEAD 3 for specific information to be reported.


(3) *Change in status of employees determined eligible for access to classified information.* Contractors will report by means of the CSA-designated reporting mechanism information pertaining to changes in status of employees determined eligible for access to classified information such as:

(i) City, county, and state where naturalized.


(ii) Date naturalized.


(iii) Court.


(iv) Certificate number.


(5) *Employees desiring not to be processed for a national security eligibility determination or not to perform classified work.* Contractors will report instances when an employee no longer wishes to be processed for a determination of eligibility for access to classified information or to continue having access to classified information, and the reason for that request.


(6) *Classified information nondisclosure agreement (NDA).* Contractors will report the refusal by an employee to sign the SF 312, “Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement,” (available at: *https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/SF312-13.pdf?forceDownload=1*) or other approved NDA.


(7) *Changed conditions affecting the contractor's eligibility for access to classified information.* Contractors are required to report certain events that affect the status of the entity eligibility determination (*e.g.,* FCL), affect the status of an employee's PCL, may indicate an employee poses an insider threat, affect the proper safeguarding of classified information, or indicate classified information has been lost or compromised, including:


(i) Change of ownership or control of the contractor, including stock transfers that affect control of the entity.

(iv) Any action to terminate business or operations for any reason, imminent adjudication or reorganization in bankruptcy, or any change that might affect the validity of the contractor's eligibility for access to classified information.


(v) Any material change concerning the information previously reported concerning foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI). This report will be made by the submission of an updated SF 328, “Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests,” in accordance with CSA-provided guidance. When submitting this information, it is not necessary to repeat answers that have not changed. When entering into discussion, consultations, or agreements that may reasonably lead to effective ownership or control by a foreign interest, the contractor will report the details to the CSA in writing. If the contractor has received a Schedule 13D from the investor, the contractor will forward a copy with the report.

(10) *Unsatisfactory conditions of a prime or subcontractors.* (i) Prime contractors, including subcontractors who have in turn subcontracted work, will report any information coming to their attention that may indicate that classified information cannot be adequately protected by a subcontractor, or other circumstances that may impact the validity of the eligibility for access to classified information of any subcontractors.

Each CSA may provide additional guidance concerning the reporting time period. If the contractor is located on a USG facility, the contractor will submit the report to the CSA and to the head of the USG facility.


(1) *Preliminary inquiry.* Immediately upon receipt of a security violation report involving classified information, the contractor will initiate a preliminary inquiry to ascertain all of the circumstances surrounding the presumed loss, compromise, or suspected compromise, including validation of the classification of the information.


(2) *Initial report.* If the contractor's preliminary inquiry confirms that a loss, compromise, or suspected compromise of any classified information occurred, the contractor will promptly submit an initial report of the incident unless otherwise notified by the CSA.
