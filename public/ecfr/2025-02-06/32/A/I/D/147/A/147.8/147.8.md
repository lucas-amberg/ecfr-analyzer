(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;


(4) Unexplained affluence;


(5) Financial problems that are linked to gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.


(c) *Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:* (1) The behavior was not recent;


(2) It was an isolated incident;


(3) The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);


(4) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;


(5) The affluence resulted from a legal source;


(6) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
