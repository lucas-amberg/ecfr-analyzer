# § 45.12   Initial and Final Determinations.

(a)* Denial of claim—deficient filing.* If a claim does not contain the information required by § 45.4(b), DoD will issue an Initial Determination stating that DoD will issue a Final Determination denying the claim unless the deficiency is cured.


(1) DoD will provide the claimant 90 calendar days following receipt of the Initial Determination to cure the deficiency, unless an extension of time is granted for good cause by the DoD Component which issued the Initial Determination. The date of receipt of the Initial Determination will be presumed to be seven calendar days after the date the Initial Determination was mailed or emailed, unless there is evidence to the contrary.


(2) If the claimant does not timely cure the deficiency, DoD will issue a Final Determination denying the claim for failure to cure the deficiency. A Final Determination issued under paragraph (a) of this section may not be appealed.


(b) *Denial of claim—failure to state a claim.* If a claim does not, based upon the information provided, state a claim cognizable under 10 U.S.C. 2733a or this interim final rule, DoD will issue an Initial Determination denying the claim. Such an Initial Determination may be appealed under the procedures in § 45.13.


(c) *Denial of claim—absence of an expert report.* Where applicable, if the claimant initially does not submit an expert report in support of his or her claim and DoD intends to deny the claim, DoD will issue an Initial Determination stating that DoD will issue a Final Determination denying the claim in the absence of an expert report or manifest negligence. DoD will provide a meaningful explanation for the intent to deny the claim that includes the specific basis for the denial.


(1) DoD will provide the claimant 90 calendar days following receipt of the Initial Determination by the claimant or, if the claimant is represented, by the claimant's representative, to submit an expert report, unless an extension of time is granted for good cause. The date of receipt of the Initial Determination will be presumed to be seven calendar days after the date the Initial Determination was mailed or emailed, unless there is evidence to the contrary.


(2) If the claimant does not timely submit an expert report, DoD will issue a Final Determination denying the claim. A Final Determination issued under this paragraph (c) may not be appealed.


(d) *Initial Determination.* (1) Upon consideration of the information provided by the claimant and relevant information available to DoD, DoD will issue the claimant a written Initial Determination.


(2) The Initial Determination may be in the form of a certified letter and/or an email. The Initial Determination may take the form of a grant of a claim and an offer of settlement or a denial of the claim. Subject to applicable confidentiality requirements, such as 10 U.S.C. 1102, privileged information, and paragraph (a) of this section, DoD will provide a meaningful basis for an offer of settlement or will provide a meaningful explanation for the denial of a claim that includes the specific basis for the denial.


(3) The Initial Determination will include information on the claimant's right to appeal if the claimant does not agree with the Initial Determination.


(4) The claimant may request reconsideration of the damages calculation contained in an Initial Determination if, within the time otherwise allowed to file an administrative appeal, the claimant identifies an alleged clear error—a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed—in the damages calculation. The DoD Component that issued the Initial Determination will review the alleged clear error and will issue an Initial Determination on Reconsideration either granting or denying reconsideration of the Initial Determination and adjusting the damages calculation, if appropriate. The Initial Determination on Reconsideration will include information on the claimant's right to appeal under the procedures in § 45.13.
