# § 45.4   Filing a claim.

(a) *In general.* A member of a uniformed service or, when applicable, an authorized representative may file a claim in writing. Any written claim will suffice as long as it is meets the requirements below and is signed by the claimant or authorized representative.


(b) *Contents of the claim.* The filed claim must include the following:


(1) The factual basis for the claim, including identification of the conduct allegedly constituting malpractice (*e.g.,* the theory of liability and/or breach of the applicable standard of care);


(2) A demand for a specified dollar amount;


(3) If the claim is filed by an attorney, an affidavit from the claimant affirming the attorney's authority to file the claim on behalf of the claimant;


(4) If the claim is filed by an authorized representative, an affidavit from the representative affirming his/her authority to file on behalf of the claimant;


(5) If the claimant is not represented by an attorney, unless the alleged medical malpractice is within the general knowledge and experience of ordinary laypersons, an affidavit from the claimant affirming that the claimant consulted with a health care professional who opined that a DoD health care provider breached the standard of care that caused the alleged harm. Alternatively, if the claimant is represented by an attorney, unless the alleged medical malpractice is within the general knowledge and experience of ordinary laypersons, the claim must include an affidavit from the attorney affirming that the attorney consulted with a health care professional who opined that a DoD health care provider breached the standard of care that caused the alleged harm.


(c) *Additional information to file in support of claim.* In the investigation and adjudication of a claim, DoD will access pertinent DoD records and information systems regarding the member in order to consider fully all facts that have a bearing on the claim. This collection may include information in personnel and medical records, the Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS), reports of investigation, medical quality assurance records, and other information. Upon DoD's request, a claimant must identify any pertinent health care providers outside of DoD, and provide a copy of his or her medical records from each of the identified health care providers, including a statement that the records are complete. A claimant must provide medical release(s) upon DoD's request, enabling DoD to obtain medical records from these health care providers. Claimants may submit any other relevant information they believe supports their claim, such as information regarding the medical care involved, the acts or omissions the claimant believes constitute malpractice, medical opinions from non-DoD providers, and evidence of pain and suffering or other harm.


(d) *Substantiating the claim.* Under section 2733a(b)(6), DoD is allowed to pay a claim only if it is substantiated. The claimant has the burden to substantiate the claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Upon receipt of a claim, DoD may require that the claimant provide additional information DoD believes is necessary for adjudication of the claim, including the submission of an expert opinion at the claimant's expense. DoD may determine an expert opinion is not necessary when negligence is within the general knowledge and experience of ordinary laypersons, such as when a foreign object is unintentionally left in the body or an operation occurred on the wrong body part. DoD may take other steps necessary to adjudicate the claim accurately, including conducting interviews of health care providers.


(e) *No discovery.* There is no discovery process for adjudication of claims under this part. However, claimants may obtain copies of records in DoD's possession that are part of their personnel and medical records in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a; DoD's Privacy Act regulation at 32 CFR part 310; and DoD Manual 6025.18, “Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule in DoD Health Care Programs.” Claimants are not entitled to attorney work product, attorney-client privileged communications, material that is part of a DoD Quality Assurance Program protected under 10 U.S.C. 1102, pre-decisional material, or other privileged information.
