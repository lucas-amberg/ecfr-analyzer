# § 60.3   Definitions.

Unless otherwise noted, these terms and their definitions are for the purpose of this part.


*Child.* An unmarried person under 18 years of age for whom a parent, guardian, foster parent, caregiver, employee of a residential facility, or any staff person providing out-of-home care is legally responsible. The term “child” means a biological child, adopted child, stepchild, foster child, or ward. The term also includes a sponsor's family member (except the sponsor's spouse) of any age who is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical incapacity, and for whom treatment in a DoD medical treatment program is authorized.


*Child abuse.* The physical or sexual abuse, emotional abuse, or neglect of a child by a parent, guardian, foster parent, or by a caregiver, whether the caregiver is intrafamilial or extrafamilial, under circumstances indicating the child's welfare is harmed or threatened. Such acts by a sibling, other family member, or other person shall be deemed to be child abuse only when the individual is providing care under express or implied agreement with the parent, guardian, or foster parent.


*Child sexual abuse.* The employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct or simulation of such conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct; or the rape, and in cases of caretaker or inter-familial relationships, statutory rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of children, or incest with children.


*DoD-sanctioned activity.* A U.S. Government activity or a nongovernmental activity authorized by appropriate DoD officials to perform child care or supervisory functions on DoD controlled property. The care and supervision of children may be either its primary mission or incidental in carrying out another mission (e.g., medical care). Examples include Child Development Centers, Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Youth Activities, School Age/Latch Key Programs, Family Day Care providers, and child care activities that may be conducted as a part of a chaplain's program or as part of another Morale, Welfare, or Recreation Program.


*FACAT.* A multidisciplinary team composed of specially trained and experienced individuals who are on-call to provide advice and assistance on cases of child sexual abuse that involve DoD-sanctioned activities.
