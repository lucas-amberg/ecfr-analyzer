# § 66.3   Definitions.

Unless otherwise noted, these terms and their definitions are for the purposes of this part.


*Adjudicating authority.* Any government official who is empowered to make findings or determinations concerning an alleged criminal offense (adult and juvenile) and establish responsibility for commission of the offense. Examples include judges, courts, magistrates, prosecutors, hearing officers, military commanders (for Article 15 actions pursuant to 10 U.S.C. chapter 47, suspension of dependent privileges, or similar actions), probation officers, juvenile referees, and parole officers or boards.


*Adverse adjudication (adult or juvenile).*

(1) A finding, decision, sentence, or judgment by an adjudicating authority, against an individual, that was other than unconditionally dropped or dismissed or the individual was acquitted is considered adverse adjudication. If the adjudicating authority places a condition or restraint that leads to dismissal, drops the charges, acquits, or the records are later expunged, or the charge is dismissed after a certain period of time, the adjudication is still considered adverse. A suspension of sentence, not processed, or a dismissal after compliance with imposed conditions is also adverse adjudication. This includes fines and forfeiture of bond in lieu of trial.


(2) A conviction for violating any federal law (including 10 U.S.C. chapter 47), or any State or municipal law or ordinance) is considered an adverse adjudication. For example, a shoplifter is reprimanded and required by the on-scene police officer, store security guard, or manager to pay for the item before leaving the store but is not charged, not found guilty, or is not convicted. In this situation, there is no adverse adjudication because no legal proceedings occurred and no adjudicating authority was involved.


*Conviction.* The act of finding a person guilty of a crime, offense, or other violation of the law by an adjudicating authority.


*Dependent.*

(1) A spouse of an applicant for enlistment.


(2) An unmarried step-child under the age of 18 living with the applicant.


(3) An unmarried biological child or unmarried adopted child of the applicant under the age of 18.


(4) Any person living with the applicant who is, by law or in fact, dependent upon the applicant for support, or who is not living with the applicant and is dependent upon the applicant for over one-half of his or her support.


*Reserve components.* Includes the Army National Guard of the United States, the Army Reserve, the Navy Reserve, the Marine Corps Reserve, the Air National Guard of the United States, the Air Force Reserve, and the Coast Guard Reserve.


*Restitution.* Any compensation in time, labor, or money for the adverse effects of an offense as a result of agreements from judicial or prosecutorial involvement. For example, an individual is adversely adjudicated for vandalism and is ordered by the adjudicating authority to replace or repair the damaged property.


*Service review.* A formal review of condition(s) or event(s) that, based on Service-specific standards, may make an applicant for enlistment ineligible to serve. Once a Service review is complete, the Service may grant an exception to policy to allow an individual to serve. These standards are subject to change at the discretion of the Service.


*Waiver.* A formal request to consider the suitability for service of an applicant who because of inappropriate conduct, dependency status, current or past medical conditions, or drug use may not be qualified to serve. Upon the completion of a thorough examination using a “whole person” review, the applicant may be granted a waiver. The applicant must have displayed sufficient mitigating circumstances that clearly justify waiver consideration. The Secretaries of the Military Departments may delegate the final approval authority for all waivers.
