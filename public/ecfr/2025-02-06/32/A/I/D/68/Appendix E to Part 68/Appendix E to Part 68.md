(3) Manage the Navy College Program Distance Learning Partnership (NCPDLP) agreements.


b. *Navy College Office (NCO):* In support of this addendum, the NCO will maintain a continuing liaison with the designated Institution representative and be responsible for inspections and the acceptance of the Institution's services.
