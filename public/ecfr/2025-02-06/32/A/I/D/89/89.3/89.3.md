*Interstate Compact on Education Opportunity for Military Children (the Compact).* An agreement approved through State legislation that requires member States to follow provisions supporting the transition of children of military families between school systems in member States.

Each member State will be allowed one vote on Compact matters, and the Commission will provide the venue for solving interstate issues and disputes.
