# ยง 150.15   Assignments of error and briefs.

(a) *General provisions.* Appellate counsel for the accused may file an assignment of error if any are to be alleged, setting forth separately each error asserted. The assignment of errors should be included in a brief for the accused in the format set forth in Appendix B to this part. An original of all assignments of error and briefs, and as many additional copies as shall be prescribed by the Court, shall be submitted. Briefs and assignments of errors shall be typed or printed, double-spaced on white paper, and securely fastened at the top. All references to matters contained in the record shall show record page numbers and any exhibit designations. A brief on behalf of the government shall be of like character as that prescribed for the accused.


(b) *Time for filing and number of briefs.* Any brief for an accused shall be filed within 60 days after appellate counsel has been notified of the receipt of the record in the Office of the Judge Advocate General. If the Judge Advocate General has directed appellate government counsel to represent the United States, such counsel shall file an answer on behalf of the government within 30 days after any brief and assignment of errors has been filed on behalf of an accused. Appellate counsel for an accused may file a reply brief no later than 7 days after the filing of a response brief on behalf of the government. If no brief is filed on behalf of an accused, a brief on behalf of the government may be filed within 30 days after expiration of the time allowed for the filing of a brief on behalf of the accused.


(c) *Appendix.* The brief of either party may include an appendix. If an unpublished opinion is cited in the brief, a copy shall be attached in an appendix. The appendix may also include extracts of statutes, rules, or regulations. A motion must be filed under ยง 150.23, *infra,* to attach any other matter.
