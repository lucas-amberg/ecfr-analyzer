However, any judge present for duty may issue all necessary orders concerning any proceedings pending on panel and any judge present for duty, or a clerk of court or commissioner to whom the Court has delegated authority, may act on uncontested motions, provided such action does not finally dispose of a petition, appeal, or case before the Court.
