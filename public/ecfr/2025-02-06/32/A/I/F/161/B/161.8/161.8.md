# § 161.8   ID card life-cycle roles and responsibilities.

(a) *General.* This section provides the roles and responsibilities associated with a series of processes and systems that support the ID card life-cycle. The requirements provided in this section may be supplemented by military Service guidance, DoD Component-level procedures and DMDC procedural and system documentation on DEERS, RAPIDS, TASS, and CPR.


(b) *Separation of duties.* The ID card life-cycle includes a requirement for a separation of duties to support the issuance process. This rule requires more than one person to serve in an official role during the sponsorship and enrollment and issuance processes. Authorizing a RAPIDS SSM or VO to exercise the duties of a TASS TASM, TA, or sponsor would allow a single individual to control the ID card issuance process, from record creation to card issuance. Individuals serving in the role of a RAPIDS SSM or VO shall not exercise the role of the TASS TASM or TA or the role of the signatory sponsor on the DD Form 1172-2. (In the case of their own dependents, a RAPIDS SSM or VO can serve as the sponsor on the DD Form 1172-2 but cannot serve as the VO for card issuance.)


(c) *DD Form 1172-2.* The DD Form 1172-2 shall be used to collect the information necessary to register ID card and CAC applicants in DEERS via RAPIDS who are not enrolled through an authorized personnel data feed or are not registered through TASS. The DD Form 577, “Appointment/Termination Record—Authorized Signature,” shall be used to verify the sponsoring individual's signature, when verification through RAPIDS is unavailable. This form is to be used primarily for DEERS enrollment and verification of initial and continued association for dependents and DoD affiliates (e.g., foreign national military). The DD Form 1172-2 shall also be used to add benefits conditions for eligible personnel in accordance with DMDC, “Real-time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) User Guide” and subpart C of this part. Retention and disposition of the DD Form 1172-2 shall be in accordance with the uniformed services' regulatory instructions. In the absence of electronic verification of sponsorship for the enrollment or reenrollment of dependents, the sponsor signing block 65 in Section 5 of the DD Form 1172-2 for the ID card applicant:


(1) Shall be a uniformed services member, retiree, civilian employee working for the sponsoring organization, or an individual entitled to DoD benefits in their own right, without requiring relationship to another sponsor, as described in subpart C of this part.


(2) Must be a DoD ID card or CAC holder.


(3) Shall establish the applicant's initial and continued relationship to the sponsor, affiliation with DoD, and need for a CAC card in accordance with this subpart and DoD Component-level procedures.


(d) *TASS.* TASS shall serve as the sponsorship and DEERS data registration tool for CAC-eligible DoD contractors and other populations as determined by the Director, DHRA. TASS employs an automated version of the DD Form 1172-2 to collect information necessary for DEERS enrollment. Organizations that use TASS shall adhere to the following guidelines on user roles:


(1) *Service Point of Contact (SPOC).* A DoD Component that utilizes TASS shall appoint a SPOC for TASS management and operation. The SPOC shall coordinate with the DMDC to establish a site with TASS capability. The SPOC shall create policies, operating procedures, and other supporting documentation in support of the Service or agency-specific implementation. The SPOC will oversee TASM registration, and provide any other required field support. The TASS SPOC:


(i) Must be a U.S. citizen.


(ii) Must be a uniformed services member, civilian employee working for the sponsoring organization, or a DoD contractor providing management support to the service or agency implementing TASS (a contractor cannot perform the TA or TASM role).


(iii) Must be capable of sending and receiving digitally signed and encrypted email.


(iv) Must be a CAC holder.


(v) Shall complete the training provided by DMDC for the TASM and TA roles.


(2) *TASM.* The TASM will act as a TA and oversee the activity for TASS site TAs. A TASS TASM:


(i) Must be a U.S. citizen.


(ii) Must be a uniformed services member or a DoD civilian employee working for the sponsoring organization.


(iii) Must be capable of sending and receiving digitally signed and encrypted email.


(iv) Must be a CAC holder.


(v) Shall complete the training provided by DMDC for the TASM role.


(3) *TA.* TAs shall be sponsors for eligible populations within TASS and will utilize TASS to register data for the DD Form 1172-2, re-verify CAC holder affiliation, and revoke CACs in accordance with this part and the DMDC “Contractor Verification System TASS (CVS) TASM/TA and Applicant User Guides, Version 3.03” (available at *https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/cvs/login*). Sponsoring an applicant is a multi-step process which includes establishing the individual's eligibility in accordance with paragraph (a) of § 161.7 of this subpart and verifying that the individual has the necessary background investigation completed to be issued a CAC in accordance with paragraph (c) of *§ 161.7* of this subpart. A TASS TA:


(i) Must be a U.S. citizen.


(ii) Must be a uniformed services member, a DoD civilian employee working for the sponsoring organization, or a non DoD Federal agency employee approved by DHRA.


(iii) Must be capable of sending and receiving digitally signed and encrypted email.


(iv) Must be a CAC holder.


(v) Shall complete the training provided by DMDC for the TA role.


(vi) Shall manage no more than 100 active contractors at any given time within TASS. Exceptions to this limit can be authorized by the DoD Component concerned to address specific contract requirements that substantiate a need for a larger contractor-to-TA ratio. The DoD Component SPOC shall document any authorized exceptions to the 100-contractors limit and shall, at a minimum, conduct annual audits on the oversight functions of these specific TAs.


(vii) Shall coordinate with their contracting personnel when establishing the contractor's initial and continued affiliation with DoD and need for CACs in accordance with agency or Component-level procedures.


(viii) Shall coordinate with their contracting, human resources, or personnel security organizations to confirm that the appropriate background check has been completed for CAC applicants.


(ix) Shall re-verify a CAC holder's need for a CAC every 6 months (180 days) within TASS.


(x) Shall revoke the CAC within the TASS upon termination of employment or completion of affiliation with the DoD.


(xi) Shall ensure that the CAC is retrieved upon the CAC holder's termination of employment or completion of affiliation with the DoD.

The SPO shall assign a primary and secondary SSM to each site to ensure the site continues to function in the absence of one of the SSMs. The SSM shall perform all responsibilities of a RAPIDS user (VO), as well as all SSM responsibilities. The SSM shall:


(i) Be a U.S. citizen.


(ii) Be a uniformed services member, civilian employee working for the sponsoring organization, or a DoD contractor.


(iii) Be a CAC holder.
