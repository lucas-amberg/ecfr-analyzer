# § 161.23   Procedures.

(a) *Eligibility documentation*—(1) *Basic requirements.* (i) ID card applicants must provide documentation as initial verification of eligibility for benefits or as proof of relationship to the sponsor. The sponsor is the prime beneficiary who derives eligibility based on individual status rather than dependence upon or relationship to another person, in accordance with § 161.7(a). When possible, DEERS records will be established and updated by authoritative data feeds.


(ii) An individual's DEERS record is established through the in-person presentation of identity documentation and, in some cases, eligibility documentation. Documentation verifying an ID card applicant's identity is always required in accordance with § 161.7(d)(1). Eligibility documentation may also be required to update a DEERS record to reflect a change in benefits or status.


(A) Identity and eligibility documentation is reviewed for authenticity by a RAPIDS verifying official (VO) and incorporated into the individual's DEERS record as necessary.


(B) The sponsor or DoD beneficiary must provide documentation to establish or terminate the relationship to a dependent within 30 days of the change.


(C) The VO ensures that the DD Form 1172-2 is signed by the sponsor.


(*1*) If the sponsor refuses to sign or is physically unable to sign the application, the VO verifies that the dependency between the sponsor and dependent exists and includes reasons why the sponsor is not able to or will not sign the application on the DD Form 1172-2. The VO then signs in the sponsor signature block and in the verifier's block.


(*2*) If the sponsor is deceased, the DoD beneficiary signs on the beneficiary's own behalf or on behalf of the surviving dependent.


(D) A VO may request additional documentation if there is any question of the authenticity of those presented.


(iii) Eligible individuals presenting eligibility documentation not listed in this subpart must have the responsible uniformed service Judge Advocate General or local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) review and verify the documentation. A written Judge Advocate General or SJA opinion may need to be submitted at ID card issuance, verifying the documentation's use for DEERS enrollment.


(2) *Documentation standards*—(i) *Certified documentation.* All documentation must be an original or certified document.


(ii) *Foreign documentation.* Additional requirements are applied toward the verification of foreign eligibility documentation submitted to support enrollment of a dependent, including:


(A) A full English language translation, which the translator has certified as complete and accurate, and the translator's certification of competency to translate from the foreign language into English, in accordance with 8 CFR 103.2(b)(3). Translation must be provided by a translator other than the individual presenting the document.


(B) A written Judge Advocate General or local SJA opinion confirming use of the eligibility documentation, if the uniformed service member is stationed overseas.


(C) Documentation that attests to the genuineness of the signature and seal, or the position of the foreign official who executed, issued, or certified the foreign documentation being presented to substantiate the dependency relationship to the sponsor.


(*1*) An accompanying original *apostille* (*i.e.,* certification) from a higher-level authority in the foreign country of issuance, for eligibility documents from countries that have adopted the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, October 5, 1961 (copies may be obtained from the Internet at *https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=41*). Sponsors should contact their SJA for information on how to obtain an *apostille* from a member nation; or


(*2*) An accompanying original certificate of authentication by a U.S. Consular Officer in the foreign country of issuance, for eligibility documents from all other foreign nations. Sponsors should contact their SJA for information on how to request issuance of certificate(s) of authentication from a U.S. Consular official.
