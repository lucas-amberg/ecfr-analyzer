# ยง 179.4   Policy.

(a) In assigning a relative priority for response activities, the Department generally considers those MRSs posing the greatest hazard as being the highest priority for action. The priority assigned should be based on the overall conditions at each MRS, taking into consideration various factors relating to safety and environmental hazard potential.


(b) In addition to the priority assigned to an MRS, other considerations (*e.g.,* availability of specific equipment, intended reuse, stakeholder interest) can affect the sequence in which munitions response actions at a specific MRS are funded.


(c) It is Department policy to ensure that U.S. EPA, other federal agencies (as appropriate or required), state regulatory agencies, tribal governments, local restoration advisory boards or technical review committees, and local stakeholders are offered opportunities to participate in the application of the rule in this part and making sequencing recommendations.
