# ยง 199.20   Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP).

(a) *Purpose.* The CHCBP is a premium-based temporary health care coverage program, authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1078a, and available to individuals who meet the eligibility and enrollment criteria as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The CHCBP is not part of the TRICARE program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under similar rules and procedures to the TRICARE Select program. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for Department of Defense and the other uniformed services beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent practicable, to be part of the TRICARE Select program. Medical coverage under this program will be the same as the benefits payable under the TRICARE Select program. There is a cost for enrollment to the CHCBP and these premium costs must be paid by CHCBP enrollees before any care may be cost shared.


(b) *General provisions.* Except for any provisions the Director of the TRICARE Management Activity may exclude, the general provisions of ยง 199.1 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to TRICARE.


(c) *Definitions.* Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in ยง 199.2 are relevant to the administration of the CHCBP, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to the TRICARE Select program.


(d) *Eligibility and enrollment.* (1) *Eligibility,* Enrollment in the CHCBP is open to any individual, except as noted in this section, who:


(i) Ceases to meet the requirements for eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 or 10 U.S.C. 1145, and


(ii) Who on the day before they cease to meet the eligibility requirements for such care they were covered under a health benefit plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 or transitional healthcare under 10 U.S.C. 1145, and


(iii) Who would otherwise not be eligible for any benefits under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 or 10 U.S.C. 1145 except for CHCBP.

(3) *Beneficiary liability.* For purposes of CHCBP coverage, the beneficiary deductible, catastrophic cap and cost share provisions of the TRICARE Select plan applicable to Group B beneficiaries under ยง 199.17(l)(2)(ii) shall apply based on the category of beneficiary (*e.g.,* Active Duty Family Member or Retiree Family) to which the CHCBP enrollee last belonged, except that for separating active duty members, amounts applicable to TRICARE Select Active Duty Family Members shall apply.

The rates are based on Federal Employees Health Benefits Program employee and agency contributions required for a comparable health benefits plan, plus an administrative fee. The administrative fee, not to exceed ten percent of the basic premium amount, shall be determined based on actual expected administrative costs for administration of the program. Premiums may be revised annually and shall be published when the premium amount is changed. Premiums will be paid by enrollees quarterly.


(2) *Effects of failure to make premium payments.* Failure by enrollees to submit timely and proper premium payments will result in denial of continued enrollment and denial of payment of medical claims. Premium payments that are late thirty (30) days or more past the start of the quarter for which payment is due will result in the termination of beneficiary enrollment. Beneficiaries denied continued enrollment due to lack of premium payments will not be allowed to reenroll. In such a case, benefit coverage will cease at the end of the ninety (90) day period for which a premium payment was received. Enrollees will be held liable for medical costs incurred after losing eligibility.


(r) *Procedures.* The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may establish other rules and procedures for the administration of the CHCBP.
