# § 199.3   Eligibility.

(a) *General.* This section sets forth those persons who, by the provisions of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, are eligible for CHAMPUS benefits. A determination that a person is eligible does not automatically entitle such a person to CHAMPUS payments. Before any CHAMPUS benefits may be extended, additional requirements, as set forth in other sections of this part, must be met. Additionally, the use of CHAMPUS may be denied if a Uniformed Service medical treatment facility capable of providing the needed care is available. CHAMPUS relies primarily on the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) for eligibility verification.


(b) *CHAMPUS eligibles*—(1) *Retiree.* A member or former member of a Uniformed Service who is entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay based on duty in a Uniformed Service.


(2) *Dependent.* Individuals whose relationship to the sponsor leads to entitlement to benefits. CHAMPUS eligible dependents include the following:


(i) *Spouse.* A lawful husband or wife of a member or former member. The spouse of a deceased member or retiree must not be remarried. A former spouse also may qualify for benefits as a dependent spouse. A former spouse is a spouse who was married to a military member, or former member, but whose marriage has been terminated by a final decree of divorce, dissolution or annulment. To be eligible for CHAMPUS benefits, a former spouse must meet the criteria described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section *and* must qualify under the group defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F)(*1*) or (b)(2)(i)(F)(*2*) of this section.


(A) Must be unremarried; and


(B) Must not be covered by an employer-sponsored health plan; and


(C) Must have been married to a member or former member who performed at least 20 years of service which can be credited in determining the member's or former member's eligibility for retired or retainer pay; and


(D) Must not be eligible for Part A of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii), (f)(3)(viii), and (f)(3)(ix) of this section; and 


(E) Must not be the dependent of a NATO member; *and*

(F) Must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F)(*1*) or (b)(2)(i)(F)(*2*) of this section:


(*1*) The former spouse must have been married to the same member or former member for at least 20 years, at least 20 of which were creditable in determining the member's or former member's eligibility for retired or retainer pay. Eligibility continues indefinitely unless affected by any of the conditions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section.


(*i*) If the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment was before February 1, 1983, the former spouse is eligible for CHAMPUS coverage of health care received on or after January 1, 1985.


(*ii*) If the date of the final decree of the divorce, dissolution, or annulment was on or after February 1, 1983, the former spouse is eligible for CHAMPUS coverage of health care which is received on or after the date of the divorce, dissolution, or annulment.


(*2*) The former spouse must have been married to the same member or former member for at least 20 years, and at least 15, but less than 20 of those married years were creditable in determining the member's or former member's eligibility for retired or retainer pay.


(*i*) If the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment is before April 1, 1985, the former spouse is eligible only for care received on or after January 1, 1985, or the date of the divorce, dissolution, or annulment, whichever is later. Eligibility continues indefinitely unless affected by any of the conditions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section.


(*ii*) If the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution or annulment is on or after April 1, 1985, but before September 29, 1988, the former spouse is eligible only for care received from the date of the decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment until December 31, 1988, or for two years from the date of the divorce, dissolution, or annulment, whichever is later.


(*iii*) If the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment is on or after September 29, 1988, the former spouse is eligible only for care received within the 365 days (366 days in the case of a leap year) immediately following the date of the divorce, dissolution, or annulment.


(ii) *Child.* A dependent child is an unmarried child of a member or former member who has not reached his or her twenty-first (21st) birthday, except an incapacitated adopted child meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*2*) of this section, and who bears one of the following relationships to a member or former member of one of the Uniformed Services:

(H) An individual who falls into one of the following classes:


(*1*) *A student.* A child determined to be a member of one of the classes in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section, who is not married, has passed his or her 21st birthday but has not passed his or her 23rd birthday, is dependent upon the member or former member for over 50 percent of his or her support or was dependent upon the member or former member for over 50 percent of his or her support on the date of the member's or former member's death, and is pursuing a full-time course of education in an institution of higher learning approved by the Secretary of Defense or the Department of Education (as appropriate) or by a state agency under 38 U.S.C. chapters 34 and 35. 


(*2*) *An incapacitated child.* A child determined to be a member of one of the classes in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section, who is not married and is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability that:


(*i*) Existed before the child's twenty-first (21st) birthday; or


(*ii*) Occurred between the ages of 21 and 23 while the child was enrolled in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher learning approved by the Administering Secretary or the Department of Education (see NOTE to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*2*)(*iii*) of this section), and is or was at the time of the member's or former member's death dependent on the member or former member for over one-half of his or her support; and


(*iii*) The incapacity is continuous. (If the incapacity significantly improves or ceases at any time, CHAMPUS eligibility cannot be reinstated on the basis of the incapacity, unless the incapacity recurs and the beneficiary is under age 21, or is under age 23 and is enrolled as a full-time student under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section. If the child was not incapacitated after that date, no CHAMPUS eligibility exists on the basis of the incapacity. However, incapacitated children who marry and who subsequently become unmarried through divorce, annulment, or death of spouse, may be reinstated as long as they still meet all other requirements). 


(*3*) *A child of a deceased reservist.* A child, who is determined to be a member of one of the classes in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section, of a reservist in a Uniformed Service who incurs or aggravates an injury, illness, or disease, during, or on the way to or from, active duty training for a period of 30 days or less or inactive duty training, and the reservist dies as a result of that specific injury, illness or disease.


(*4*) *An unmarried person.* An unmarried person placed in the home of a member or former member prior to adoption. To be a dependent child, the unmarried person must not have reached the age of 21 (or otherwise meets the requirements of a student or incapacitated child set out in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*1*) or (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*2*) of this section) and has been placed in the home of the member or former member by a recognized placement agency or by any other source authorized by State or local law to provide adoption placement, in anticipation of legal adoption by the member or former member.


(iii) *Abused dependents*—(A) *Categories of abused dependents.* An abused dependent may be either a spouse or a child. Eligibility for either class of abused dependent results from being either:


(*1*) The spouse (including a former spouse) or child of a member who has received a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or dismissal from a Uniformed Service as a result of a court-martial conviction for an offense involving physical or emotional abuse of the spouse or child, or was administratively discharged as a result of such an offense. Until October 17, 1998, Medical benefits are limited to care related to the physical or emotional abuse and for a period of 12 months following the member's separation from the Uniformed Service.

(d) *Dual eligibility.* Dual eligibility occurs when a person is entitled to benefits from two sources. For example, when an active duty member is also the dependent of another active duty member, a retiree, or a deceased active duty member or retiree, dual eligibility, that is, entitlement to direct care from the Uniformed Services medical care system and CHAMPUS is the result. Since the active duty status is primary, and it is the intent that all medical care be provided an active duty member through the Uniformed Services medical care system, CHAMPUS eligibility is terminated as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the day the dual eligibility begins. However, any dependent children in a marriage of two active duty persons or of an active duty member and a retiree, are CHAMPUS eligible in the same manner as dependent children of a marriage involving only one CHAMPUS sponsor. Should a spouse or dependent who has dual eligibility leave active duty status, that person's CHAMPUS eligibility is reinstated as of 12:01 a.m. of the day active duty ends, if he or she otherwise is eligible as a dependent of a CHAMPUS sponsor.


(e) *Eligibility under the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP).* (1) A member of the armed forces is eligible for transitional health care if the member is:

(iii) A member who is separated from active duty for which the member is involuntarily retained under 10 U.S.C. 12305 in support of a contingency operation; or


(iv) A member who is separated from active duty served pursuant to a voluntary agreement of the member to remain on active duty for a period of less than 1 year in support of a contingency operation.


(v) A member who receives a sole survivorship discharge (as defined in section 1174(i) of this title).


(vi) A member who is separated from Active Duty who agrees to become a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component.


(2) A spouse (as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section except former spouses) and child (as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) of a member described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is also eligible for TAMP benefits under TRICARE.


(3) TAMP benefits under TRICARE begin on the day after the member is separated from active duty, and, if such separation occurred on or after November 6, 2003, end 180 days after such date. TRICARE benefits available to both the member and eligible family members are generally those available to family members of members of the uniformed services under this Part. However, during TAMP eligibility, a member of a Reserve Component as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, is entitled to dental care to which a member of the uniformed services on active duty for more than 30 days is entitled. Each branch of service will determine eligibility for its members and eligible family members and provide data to DEERS.


(f) *Changes in status which result in termination of CHAMPUS eligibility.* Changes in status which result in a loss of CHAMPUS eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the event occurred, unless otherwise indicated, are as follows:


(1) *Changes in the status of a member.* (i) When an active duty member's period of active duty ends, excluding retirement or death.


(ii) When an active duty member is placed on desertion status (eligibility is reinstated when the active duty member is removed from desertion status and returned to military control).


(2) *Changes in the status of a retiree.* (i) When a retiree ceases to be entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay for any reason, the retiree's dependents lose their eligibility unless the dependent is otherwise eligible (e.g., some former spouses, some dependents who are victims of abuse and some incapacitated children as outlined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*2*) of this section).


(ii) A retiree also loses eligibility when no longer entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay.


(iii) Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part A) under Medicare except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii), (f)(3)(viii) and (f)(3)(ix) of this section.


(3) *Changes in the status of a dependent.* (i) Divorce, except for certain classes of former spouses as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and the member or former member's *own* children (i.e., legitimate, adopted, and judicially determined illegitimate children).


(ii) Annulment, except for certain classes of former spouse as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and the member or former member's *own* children (i.e., legitimate, adopted, and judicially determined illegitimate children). 


(iii) Adoption, except for adoptions occurring after the death of a member or former member.


(iv) Marriage of a child, except when the marriage is terminated by death, divorce, or annulment before the child is 21 or 23 if an incapacitated child as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*2*) of this section.


(v) Marriage of a widow or widower, except for the child of the widow or widower who was the stepchild of the deceased member or former member at the time of death. The stepchild continues CHAMPUS eligibility as other classes of dependent children.


(vi) Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part A) under Medicare except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii), (f)(3)(viii), and (f)(3)(ix) of this section. (This also applies to individuals living outside the United States where Medicare benefits are not available.) 


(vii) Attainment of age 65, except for dependents of active duty members, beneficiaries not entitled to part A of Medicare, beneficiaries entitled to Part A of Medicare who have enrolled in Part B of Medicare, and as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For those who do not retain CHAMPUS, CHAMPUS eligibility is lost at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month in which the beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare.


(viii) End stage renal disease. All beneficiaries, except dependents of active duty members, lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a person because of chronic renal disease unless the following conditions have been met. CHAMPUS eligibility will continue if:


(A) The individual is under 65 years old;


(B) The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 426-1(a);


(C) The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare; and


(D) The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).


(ix) Individuals with certain disabilities. Each case relating to Medicare eligibility resulting from being disabled requires individual investigation. All beneficiaries except dependents of active duty members lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a disabled person unless the following conditions have been met. CHAMPUS eligibility will continue if:


(A) The individual is under 65 years old;


(B) The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 426(b)(2);


(C) The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare except that in the case of a retroactive determination of entitlement to Medicare Part A hospital insurance benefits for a person under 65 years of age there is no requirement to enroll in Medicare Part B from the Medicare Part A entitlement date until the issuance of such retroactive determination; and


(D) The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).


(x) Disabled students, that is children age 21 or 22, who are pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who, either during the school year or between semesters, suffer a disabling illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remain eligible for CHAMPUS medical benefits for 6 months after the disability is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, CHAMPUS benefits can be continued until the 23rd birthday. The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child 21 or 22 years old in a full time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a dependent child 21 or 22 years old in student status *does not* have eligibility and *may not* qualify for eligibility under the requirements related to mental or physical incapacity as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(*2*) of this section.


(g) *Reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility.* Circumstances which result in reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility are as follows:


(1) *End Stage renal disease.* Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has been continued under paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the section, when Medicare eligibility ceases for end-stage renal disease patients, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. He or she is required to take action to be reinstated as a CHAMPUS beneficiary and to obtain a new identification card.


(2) *Disability.* Some disabilities are permanent, others temporary. Each case must be reviewed individually. Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has been continued under paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, when disability ends and Medicare eligibility ceases, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. Again, he or she is required to take action to obtain a new CHAMPUS identification card.


(3) *Enrollment in Medicare Part B.* For individuals whose CHAMPUS eligibility has terminated pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) or (f)(3)(vi) of this section due to beneficiary action to decline Part B of Medicare, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes, effective on the date Medicare Part B coverage begins, if the person subsequently enrolls in Medicare Part B and the person is otherwise still eligible.


(h) *Determination of eligibility status.* Determination of an individual's eligibility as a CHAMPUS beneficiary is the primary responsibility of the Uniformed Service in which the member or former member is, or was, a member, or in the case of dependents of a NATO military member, the Service that sponsors the NATO member. For the purpose of program integrity, the appropriate Uniformed Service shall, upon request of the Director, OCHAMPUS, review the eligibility of a specific person when there is reason to question the eligibility status. In such cases, a report on the results of the review and any action taken will be submitted to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.


(i) *Procedures for determination of eligibility.* Procedures for the determination of eligibility are prescribed within the Department of Defense Instruction 1000.13 available at local military facilities personnel offices.


(j) *CHAMPUS procedures for verification of eligibility.* (1) Eligibility for CHAMPUS benefits will be verified through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) maintained by the Uniformed Services, except for abused dependents as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary, or parent, or legal representative, when appropriate, to provide the necessary evidence required for entry into the DEERS file to establish CHAMPUS eligibility and to ensure that all changes in status that may affect eligibility be reported immediately to the appropriate Uniformed Service for action.


(2) Ineligibility for CHAMPUS benefits may be presumed in the absence of prescribed eligibility evidence in the DEERS file.


(3) The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall issue guidelines as necessary to implement the provisions of this section.
