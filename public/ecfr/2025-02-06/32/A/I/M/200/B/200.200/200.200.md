# § 200.200   Basis for civil money penalties and assessments.

(a) The DHA may impose a penalty, assessment against any person who it determines has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a claim that was for—


(1) An item or service that the person knew, or should have known, was not provided as claimed, including a claim that was part of a pattern or practice of claims based on codes that the person knew, or should have known, would result in greater payment to the person than the code applicable to the item or service actually provided;


(2) An item or service for which the person knew, or should have known, that the claim was false or fraudulent;


(3) An item or service furnished during a period in which the person was excluded from participation under 32 CFR 199.9(f) or by another Federal health care program (as defined in section 1128B(f) of the Act) to which the claim was presented;


(4) A physician's services (or an item or service) for which the person knew, or should have known, that the individual who furnished (or supervised the furnishing of) the service—


(i) Was not licensed as a physician;


(ii) Was licensed as a physician, but such license had been obtained through a misrepresentation of material fact (including cheating on an examination required for licensing); or


(iii) Represented to the patient at the time the service was furnished that the physician was certified by a medical specialty board when he or she was not so certified; or


(5) An item or service that a person knew, or should have known was not medically necessary, and which is part of a pattern of such claims.


(b) The DHA may impose a penalty and, where authorized, an assessment against any person who it determines—


(1) Arranges or contracts (by employment or otherwise) with an individual or entity that the person knows, or should know, is excluded from participation in Federal health care programs for the provision of items or services for which payment may be made under such a program;


(2) Orders or prescribes a medical or other item or service during a period in which the person was excluded from a Federal health care program, in the case when the person knows, or should know, that a claim for such medical or other item or service will be made under such a program;


(3) Knowingly makes, or causes to be made, any false statement, omission, or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid, or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a Federal health care program;


(4) Knows of an overpayment and does not report and return the overpayment in accordance with section 1128J(d) of the Act;


(5) Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a Federal health care program; or


(6) Fails to grant timely access to records, documents, and other material or data in any medium (including electronically stored information and any tangible thing), upon reasonable request, to the OIG, for the purpose of audits, investigations, evaluations, or other OIG statutory functions. Such failure to grant timely access means:


(i) Except when the OIG reasonably believes that the requested material is about to be altered or destroyed, the failure to produce or make available for inspection and copying the requested material upon reasonable request or to provide a compelling reason why they cannot be produced, by the deadline specified in the OIG's written request; and


(ii) When the OIG has reason to believe that the requested material is about to be altered or destroyed, the failure to provide access to the requested material at the time the request is made.
