# § 232.1   Authority, purpose, and coverage.

(a) *Authority.* This part is issued by the Department of Defense to implement 10 U.S.C. 987.


(b) *Purpose.* The purpose of this part is to impose limitations on the cost and terms of certain extensions of credit to Service members and their dependents, and to provide additional protections relating to such transactions in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 987.


(c) *Coverage.* This part defines the types of transactions involving “consumer credit,” a “creditor,” and a “covered borrower” that are subject to the regulation, consistent with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 987. In addition, this part:


(1) Provides the maximum allowable amount of all charges, and the types of charges, that may be associated with a covered extension of consumer credit;


(2) Requires a creditor to provide to a covered borrower a statement of the Military Annual Percentage Rate, or MAPR, before or at the time the borrower becomes obligated on the transaction or establishes an account for the consumer credit. The statement required by § 232.6(a)(1) differs from and is in addition to the disclosures that must be provided to consumers under the Truth in Lending Act;


(3) Provides for the method a creditor must use in calculating the MAPR; and


(4) Contains such other criteria and limitations as the Secretary of Defense has determined appropriate, consistent with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 987.
