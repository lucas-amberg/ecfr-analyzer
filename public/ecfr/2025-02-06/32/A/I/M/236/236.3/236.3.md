# ยง 236.3   Policy.

It is DoD policy to:


(a) Establish a comprehensive approach to require safeguarding of covered defense information on covered contractor information systems and to require contractor cyber incident reporting.


(b) Increase Government stakeholder and DIB situational awareness of the extent and severity of cyber threats to DoD information by implementing a streamlined approval process that enables the contractor to elect, in conjunction with the cyber incident reporting and sharing, the extent to which DoD may share cyber threat information obtained from a contractor (or derived from information obtained from the company) under this part that is not information created by or for DoD with:


(1) DIB CS Program participants to enhance their cybersecurity posture to better protect covered defense information on covered contractor information systems, or a contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and


(2) Other Government stakeholders for lawful Government activities, including cybersecurity for the protection of Government information or information systems, law enforcement and counterintelligence (LE/CI), and other lawful national security activities directed against the cyber threat (*e.g.,* those attempting to infiltrate and compromise information on the contractor information systems).


(c) Modify eligibility criteria to permit greater participation in the voluntary DIB CS Program.
