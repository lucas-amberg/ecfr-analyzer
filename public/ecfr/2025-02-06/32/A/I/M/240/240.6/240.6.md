Students at AFIT and NPS attend full-time programs. Participants may attend the IRMC either full or part-time to complete the first part of their required courses and then select a follow-on partner university to complete their remaining degree requirements either full or part-time. There are no part-time doctoral programs. All candidates must meet the eligibility requirements for their selected program, which are outlined in DoD IASP Academic Programs for Retention Students.


(1) Military officers and DoD civilian employees may apply to attend any one of the three DoD academic institutions.

Retention students shall continue to receive their military pay or civilian salary from their DoD Component throughout their course of study.
