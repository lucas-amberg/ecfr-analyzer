# Appendix A to Part 247—Funded Newspapers and Magazines


A. *Purpose.* Funded newspapers and magazines support the command communication requirements of the DoD Components and their subordinate commands. Normally, printing is accomplished by a commercial printer under contract or in government printing facilities in accordance with DoD Directive 5330.3. 
1 The editorial content of these publications and distribution are accomplished by the contracting command. Overseas, Funded newspapers are authorized to be printed under contract with the *S&S.* Where printing by *S&S* is not feasible because of distance or other factors, Funded newspapers may be printed by other means. These are evaluated on a case-by-case basis with the cognizant DPS office. 


B. *Name.* The name of the publication may include the name of the command or installation, or, the name of the command or installation may appear separately in the nameplate (flag). The emblem of the command or installation may be included in the nameplate, also. When possible, the DoD Components and their subordinate levels shall trademark the names of their publications, as stated in § 247.5(d). 


C. *Masthead.* The masthead shall include the names of the commanding officer and the PAO, the names and editorial titles of the primary staff of the publication, and the mailing address and telephone number of the editorial staff, in addition to that required in § 247.4(i). 


D. *News and editorial materials.* The commander and the public affairs staff shall generate and select news, information, photographs, editorial, and other materials to be used. Authorized news and information sources include the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (OASD(PA)), AFIS, the Military Departments, their subordinate levels of command, and other Government Agencies. Civilian community service news and announcements of benefit to personnel assigned to the command or installation and their family members may also be used. Photographic images used will be in compliance with § 247.4(r). 


E. *Assignment of personnel.* Military and DoD civilian personnel may not be assigned to duty at the premises of the contract printer to perform any job functions that are part of the business activities or contractual responsibilities of the contract printer. Members of the public affairs staff who produce editorial content may work on the premises as liaison and monitor to specify and coordinate layout and other production details provided for in the command contract with the contract printer. A member of the public affairs staff shall review proof copy to prevent mistakes. 


F. *Funding.* The expense of publishing and distributing Funded newspapers and magazines is charged to appropriated funds of the publishing command. 


G. *Printing.* Printing of a funded publication shall be handled in accordance with DoD Directive 5330.3 in conjunction with the DoD Component's printing function with public affairs as the office of primary publishing interest. The use of color is authorized if the cognizant commander, the DoD Component's printing function and the PAO determine it enhances communication. 


H. *Distribution.* Funded publications may be distributed through official channels. Appropriated funds and manpower may be used for distribution of Funded publications, as required. 


I. *Advertising.* Funded publications shall not carry commercial advertising. As a service, the Funded newspaper may carry nonpaid listings of personally owned items and services for sale by members of the command. Noncommercial news stories and announcements concerning nonappropriated fund activities and commissaries may be published in funded publications. 


J. *Employment and gratuities.* DoD personnel shall not accept any gratuities from or employment with any GPO-contracted printers in violation of the DoD 5500.7-R, 
2 the Joint Ethics Regulation. In addition, DoD personnel whose spouse or children (or other relatives as described in the Joint Ethics Regulation) are offered employment by, or work for, a GPO-contracted printer, must take appropriate action to avoid conflicts of interest.
