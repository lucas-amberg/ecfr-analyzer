(1) The notice requirements are satisfied when a copy of the request has been served on the customer or mailed to the customer's last known address on or before the date on which the request was made to the financial institution together with the following notice which shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the law enforcement inquiry: “Records or information concerning your transactions held by the financial institution named in the attached request are being sought by the Department of Defense [or the specific DoD Component] in accordance with the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 for the following purpose:”

A motion to quash a judicial subpoena shall be filed in the court that issued the subpoena.

(iii) Serve the Government authority requesting the records by mailing or delivering a copy of the motion and statement to the Government authority.


(iv) Be prepared to go to court and present the customer's position in further detail.


(v) The customer does not need to have a lawyer, although he or she may wish to employ a lawyer to represent the customer and protect the customer's rights.


(4) If the customer does not follow the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, upon the expiration of ten days from the date of service or fourteen days from the date of mailing of the notice, the records or information requested therein may be made available. The records may be transferred to other Government authorities for legitimate law enforcement inquiries, in which event the customer will be notified after the transfer.
