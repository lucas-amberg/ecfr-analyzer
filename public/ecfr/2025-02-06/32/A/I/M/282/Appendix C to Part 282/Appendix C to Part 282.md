# Appendix C to Part 282—Submitting a Claim


(a) *Who May Submit a Claim.* Any person (“claimant”) may submit a claim who has a demand for money or property against the Government under 31 U.S.C. 3702, 10 U.S.C. 2575, 10 U.S.C. 2771, 24 U.S.C. 420, 10 U.S.C. 4712, 10 U.S.C. 9712, 37 U.S.C. 554, or 32 U.S.C. 714.


(b) *Where to Submit a Claim.* A claimant must submit a claim to the Component concerned in accordance with guidance provided by that Component. A claim that is submitted somewhere other than to the Component concerned does not stop the running of the time limit in paragraph (f) of this Appendix. It is the claimant's responsibility to submit a claim properly.


(c) *Format of a Claim.* A claimant must submit a claim in the format prescribed by the Component concerned. It must be written and be signed by the claimant (in the case of a claim on behalf of a minor or incompetent person, there are additional requirements explained at paragraph (e) of this Appendix) or by the claimant's authorized agent or attorney (there are additional requirements explained at paragraph (d) of this Appendix). In addition, it should:


(1) Provide the claimant's mailing address.


(2) Provide the claimant's telephone number.


(3) State the amount claimed.


(4) State the reasons why the Government owes the claimant that amount.


(5) Have attached copies of documents referred to in the claim.


(6) Include or have attached statements (that are attested to be true and correct to the best of the individual's knowledge and belief) of the claimant or other persons in support of the claim.


(d) *Claim Submitted by Agent or Attorney.* In addition to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Appendix, a claim submitted by the claimant's agent or attorney must include or have attached a duly executed power of attorney or other documentary evidence of the agent's or attorney's right to act for the claimant.


(e) *Claim Submitted on Behalf of a Minor or Incompetent Person.* In addition to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this Appendix:


(1) If a guardian or committee has not been appointed, a claim submitted on behalf of a minor or incompetent person must:


(i) State the claimant's relationship to the minor or incompetent person.


(ii) Provide the name and address of the person having care and custody of the minor or incompetent person.


(iii) Include an affirmation that any moneys received shall be applied to the use and benefit of the minor or incompetent person, and that the appointment of a guardian or committee is not contemplated.


(2) If a guardian or committee has been appointed, a claim on behalf of a minor or incompetent person must include or have attached a certificate of the court showing the appointment and qualification of the guardian or committee.


(f) *When to Submit a Claim.* A claimant must submit a claim so that it is received by the Component concerned within the time limit allowed by statute.


(1) Claimants must submit claims within these statutory time limits: 
1

(i) Claims on account of Treasury checks under 31 U.S.C. 3702(c) must be received within 1 year after the date of issuance.


(ii) Claims under 31 U.S.C. 3702 (b), 10 U.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within 6 years of the date the claim accrued. (A claim accrues on the date when everything necessary to give rise to the claim has occurred.) The time limit for claims of members of the Armed Forces that accrue during war or within 5 years before war begins, is 6 years from the date the claim accrued or 5 years after peace is established, whichever is later.


(iii) Claims under 10 U.S.C. 2575(d)(3) must be received within 5 years after the date of the disposal of the property to which the claim relates.


(iv) Claims under 24 U.S.C. 420(d)(1), 10 U.S.C. 4712, and 10 U.S.C. 9712 must be received within 6 years after the death of the deceased resident.


(v) Claims under 37 U.S.C. 554(h) must be received before the end of the 5-year period from the date the net proceeds from the sale of the missing person's personal property are covered into the Treasury.


(2) The time limits set by statute may not be extended or waived. 
2 Although the issue of timeliness normally shall be raised upon initial submission (as explained at Appendix D to this part, paragraph (b)), the issue may be raised at any point during the claim settlement process.


(g) *Claimant Must Prove the Claim.* The claimant must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, on the written record that the United States is liable to the claimant for the amount claimed. All relevant evidence to prove the claim should be presented when a claim is first submitted. In the absence of compelling circumstances, evidence that is presented at later stages of the administrative process will not be considered.
