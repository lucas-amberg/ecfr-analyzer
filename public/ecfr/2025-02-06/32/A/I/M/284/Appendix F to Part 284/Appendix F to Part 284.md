2. State the amount of the waiver application that is granted and the amount denied and/or that the application was or was not received within the statutory time limit, as appropriate.


3. Explain the reasons for the decision.


After issuing an appeal decision, the DOHA must:


1. Send the applicant the decision and notify the applicant of:


i. The appropriate Component action to resolve the debt as a consequence of the decision if it is or becomes a final action (as explained in paragraph J to this Appendix).


ii. The procedures under this Appendix to request reconsideration (as explained in paragraphs K through M to this Appendix), if the decision does not grant the waiver application to the extent requested, or does not contain a finding of timely receipt, when applicable.


2. Notify the Component concerned of the decision and the appropriate Component action to resolve the debt as a consequence of the decision.


An appeal decision that grants the waiver application to the extent requested on appeal, or that finds that the application was timely received, when applicable, is a final action when issued. An appeal decision is a final action if the DOHA does not receive a request for reconsideration within 30 days of the date of the appeal decision (plus any extension of up to 30 additional days granted by the DOHA for good cause shown).


An applicant may request reconsideration of a DOHA appeal decision.


The DOHA must receive a request for reconsideration within 30 days of the date of the appeal decision. 
2 The DOHA may extend this period for up to an additional 30 days for good cause shown. No request for reconsideration may be accepted after this time has expired. A request for reconsideration must be sent to the DOHA at the address in paragraph E to this Appendix.


The requirements of paragraph C to this Appendix for the content of an appeal apply to a request for reconsideration.


No earlier than 31 days after the date of the appeal decision or the day after the last period for submitting a request, as extended, expires, the DOHA must:

2. Affirm, modify, or reverse the appeal decision.

When considering an appeal or request for reconsideration, the DOHA may:


1. Take administrative notice of matters that are generally known or are capable of confirmation by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.


2. Remand a matter to the Component with instructions to provide additional information.
