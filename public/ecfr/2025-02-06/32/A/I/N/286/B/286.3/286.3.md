# ยง 286.3   General information.

(a) The DoD has a decentralized system for responding to FOIA requests, with each DoD Component designating at least one FOIA Requester Service Center (RSC) to process records from that component. All DoD RSCs have the capability to receive requests electronically either through email or a web portal. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the DoD Component that maintains the records being sought. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the RSC of the DoD Component that maintains the records sought. Addresses and contact information for the RSCs are available at *https://www.foia.gov.* This Web site has the contact information for the following DoD Components: The OSD and the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force, Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, Defense Commissary Agency, Defense Contract Audit Agency, Defense Contract Management Agency, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Defense Health Agency, Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Defense Technical Information Center, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, DoD Education Activity, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Guard Bureau, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency/Central Security Service, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, United States Africa Command, United States Central Command, United States Cyber Command, United States European Command, United States Northern Command, United States Indo-Pacific Command, United States Southern Command, United States Space Command, and United States Space Force, United States Special Operations Command, United States Strategic Command, and United States Transportation Command.


(b) The OSD/Joint Staff FOIA RSC also processes FOIA requests for several DoD agencies and field activities, as well as other DoD organizations. A list of these agencies, field activities, and DoD organizations is available at *https://www.esd.whs.mil/FOID/Submit-Request/.*

(c) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself, regardless of whether the records are in a Privacy Act system of records, must comply with the verification of identity requirements as determined by the DoD Component in accordance with 32 CFR part 310.3(c) through (e).
