This part contains the rules that the Department of Defense (Department or DoD) follows under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. These rules should be read together with the Privacy Act. The rules in this part apply to all records in Privacy Act systems of records maintained by the Department. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the Department to other entities outside the Department. In addition, the Department processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, following the rules contained in 32 CFR part 286, giving individuals the benefit of both statutes.
