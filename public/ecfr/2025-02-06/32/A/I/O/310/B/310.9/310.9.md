# § 310.9   Requests for an accounting of record disclosures.

(a) An individual may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure that has been made by the Department to another person, organization, or agency of any record about the individual maintained in a system of records.


(b) This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. Records of disclosure accountings are maintained for five years after the disclosure or for the life of the record, whichever is longer.


(c) The request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made by writing directly to the DoD Component that maintains the record, following the procedures in § 310.3.


(d) DoD Components are not required to provide disclosure accountings when related to:


(1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept—in other words, disclosures that are made to employees within the Department who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties and disclosures that are made under the Freedom of Information Act;


(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written request from the head of the agency or instrumentality of those law enforcement agencies specifying the law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or


(3) Disclosures made from systems of records that have been exempted from accounting requirements.


(e) An individual may appeal a denial of a request for a disclosure accounting to the address listed in the notification of denial letter, in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records, following the procedures in § 310.6.
