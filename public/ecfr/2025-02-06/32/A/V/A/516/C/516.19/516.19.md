# ยง 516.19   Injunctive relief.

(a) *General.* Plaintiffs may attempt to force government action or restraint in important operational matters or pending personnel actions through motions for temporary restraining orders (TRO) or preliminary injunctions (PI). Because these actions can quickly impede military functions, immediate and decisive action must be taken.


(b) *Notification to HQDA and U.S. Attorney.* The SJA or legal adviser will immediately notify Litigation Division or other appropriate office at HQDA when a motion for TRO or PI has been, or is about to be, filed. The SJA or legal adviser will also notify the responsible U.S. Attorney.


(c) *Actions by SJA or legal adviser.* The SJA or legal adviser will assist the DOJ or DA attorney responsible for the litigation. Installation attorneys or support personnel should begin accumulating relevant documentary evidence and identifying witnesses. If requested, installation attorneys will prepare a legal memorandum concerning the motion, giving particular attention to the following issues relevant to a court granting injunctive relief:


(1) Plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits.


(2) Whether plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if injunctive relief is not granted.


(3) Harm to defendant and other parties if injunctive relief is granted.


(4) The public interest.
