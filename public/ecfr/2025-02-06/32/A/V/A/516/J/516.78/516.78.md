(a) Soldiers who are required to comply with summons to serve on state or local juries will be placed on permissive TDY under the provisions of AR 630-5. 


(b) Jury fees accruing to soldiers for complying with the summons to serve on state and local juries must be turned over to the appropriate finance office for deposit into the U.S. Treasury. Commands will establish procedures with local authorities and their servicing finance and accounting activity to ensure that such jury fees are so deposited. Soldiers, however, may keep any reimbursement from state or local authority for expenses incurred in the performance of jury duty, including transportation, meals, and parking.
