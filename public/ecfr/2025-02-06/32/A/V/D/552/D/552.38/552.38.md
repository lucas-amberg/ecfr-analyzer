(a) *Authorization.* After a maneuver is authorized by the Department of the Army, the Army commander will select the specific areas desired for use. 


(b) *Real estate coverage.* Real estate coverage will be in the form of agreements with landowners, granting the right to conduct maneuvers at a given time or periodically.

Permits will also be obtained to cover the use of lands under the jurisdiction of another Government department or agency.
