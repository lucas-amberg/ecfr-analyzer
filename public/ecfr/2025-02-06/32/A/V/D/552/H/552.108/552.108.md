# § 552.108   General.

(a) *Access controls.* (1) Fort Lewis is a closed post. Access to the installation is limited to persons with prior approved permission to enter.


(2) Public access into the Main Cantonment Area of Fort Lewis is controlled through a series of static security posts manned by sentries empowered to grant or deny access to persons and material. The “Main Cantonment Area” is that area of the Fort Lewis Military Reservation shown on the overprinted 1:50,000 Fort Lewis Special Map (DMA Stock No. V791SFTLEWIS) excluding those areas designated thereon as Impact Areas, lettered Close-In Training Areas, or numbered Training Areas. A full sized map is located at the Fort Lewis Area Access Office, Building T-6127. As defined, the Main Cantonment Area includes, but is not necessarily limited to, those areas of the installation containing Government housing areas, schools, medical facilities, troop billets, the installation command and control facilities, Gray Army Air Field, Madigan Army Medical Center, and certain recreational sites controlled by the Director of Personnel and Community Activities.


(3) Entry of the general public into the Main Cantonment Area at any location other than through established manned access control points is strictly prohibited. For the purposes of this regulation, entry includes the entrance of the person, or the insertion of any part of his body, or the introduction of any unauthorized material.


(b) *Trespassers.* Persons entering or remaining upon the Main Cantonment Area of the Fort Lewis Military Reservation in violation of this regulation are trespassing on a closed federal reservation and are subject to citation by the military police. Trespassers may be barred from subsequent access to the installation and will be subject to the provisions of this regulation. A person violates this regulation when he enters or remains upon the Main Cantonment Area when he is not licensed, invited, or otherwise authorized to so enter or remain. All such persons are trespassers for the purpose of this regulation.


(c) *Prohibited Activities.* Department of Defense policy permits commanders to prohibit any expressive activity which could interfere with or prevent the orderly accomplishment of the installation's mission, or which presents a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline or morale of their soldiers. Therefore, unless the prior approval of the installation commander or his designated representative has been obtained, no person while on the Fort Lewis Military Reservation shall:


(1) Engage in protests, public speeches, sit-ins, or demonstrations promoting a political point of view.


(2) Engage in partisan political campaigning or electioneering.


(3) Display or distribute commercial advertising or solicit business.


(4) Interrupt or disturb a military formation, ceremony, class or other activity.


(5) Obstruct movement on any street, sidewalk, or pathway without prior authority.


(6) Utter to any person abusive, insulting, profane, indecent or otherwise provocative language that by its very utterance tends to incite an immediate breach of the peace.


(7) Distribute or post publications, including pamphlets, newspapers, magazines, handbills, flyers, leaflets, and other printed material, except through regularly established and approved distribution outlets.


(8) Circulate petitions or engage in picketing or similar demonstrations for any purpose.


(9) Disobey a proper request or order by Department of Defense (DoD) police, military police, or other competent authority to disperse or to leave the installation.


(d) *Failure to comply.* Any person who enters or remains upon the Main Cantonment Area of Fort Lewis Military Reservation when he is not licensed, invited or otherwise authorized by the terms of this regulation or who enters or remains upon the Fort Lewis Military Reservation for a purpose of engaging in any activity prohibited by this regulation is in violation of the provisions of the regulation. Violators of this regulation may be subjected to administrative action or criminal punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), title 18 U.S.C. 1382, or title 50 U.S.C. 797, as appropriate to each individual's status. Maximum punishment under title 18 U.S.C. 1382 is a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. Maximum punishment under 50 U.S.C. 797 is a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Administrative action may include suspension of access privileges, or permanent expulsion from the Fort Lewis Military Reservation.
