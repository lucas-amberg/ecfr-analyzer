# § 623.1   General.

(a) *Purpose.* This part sets forth policies and procedures for loan of Army materiel. As used in this regulation, the term “loan” includes a lease. 


(b) *Applicability.* (1) This regulation applies to all Department of the Army (DA) agencies, commands, installations, and activities. 


(2) This regulation applies to the Army National Guard (ARNG) only when the procedure for the loan of equipment under the procedure of National Guard Regulation (NGR) 735-12 does not apply. 


(3) This regulation does not apply to loans governed by the DOD Military Assistance and Sales Manual, DOD 5105.38-M. 


(4) This regulation does not apply to loans governed by the Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR). 


(c) *Scope.* This part outlines when loans of Army materiel may be made. It gives general procedures for requesting and processing loans, and sets forth responsibilities, including requirements for reimbursement. 


(d) *Explanation of terms.* (1) The terms “loan,” “lease” and “bailment” are contractual terms and are frequently used interchangeably. They have no meaning by themselves. It is necessary to study the statute to see what is required. Usually, a “loan” is thought of as a short-term transfer of property, sometimes with reimbursement; a “lease” is a more formal transfer, often long-term and requiring a fair monetary rental; and a “bailment” is a loosely-used term, generally reserved for a delivery of property to another in trust for the purpose of doing something to the property and then returning the property to the owner. The term “issue” is frequently used in the sense of a transfer of property which will be consumed in use. The terms “gift,” meaning a permanent transfer of property without reimbursement, and “sale,” meaning a permanent transfer with reimbursement, are outside the scope of this regulation. 


(2) For additional definitions, see appendix A. 


(3) The words “he, him, his” when used in this publication represent both the masculine and feminine genders, unless otherwise specifically stated.
