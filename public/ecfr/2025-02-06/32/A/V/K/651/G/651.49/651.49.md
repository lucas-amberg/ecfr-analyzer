# ยง 651.49   Preliminary phase.

In the preliminary phase, the proponent agency or office identifies, as early as possible, how it will accomplish scoping and with whose involvement. Key points will be identified or briefly summarized by the proponent, as appropriate, in the NOI, which will: 


(a) Identify the significant issues to be analyzed in the EIS. 


(b) Identify the office or person responsible for matters related to the scoping process. If they are not the same as the proponent of the action, that distinction will be made. 


(c) Identify the lead and cooperating agency, if already determined (40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6). 


(d) Identify the method by which the agency will invite participation of affected parties, and identify a tentative list of the affected parties to be notified. A key part of this preliminary identification is to solicit input regarding other parties who would be interested in the proposed project or affected by it. 


(e) Identify the proposed method for accomplishing the scoping procedure. 


(f) Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation of environmental analyses and the tentative planning and decisionmaking schedule including: 


(1) The scoping process itself. 


(2) Collection or analysis of environmental data, including required studies. 


(3) Preparation of draft and final EISs (DEISs and FEISs), and associated review periods. 


(4) Filing of the ROD. 


(5) Taking the action. 


(6) For a programmatic EIS, preparation of a general expected schedule for future specific implementing (tiered) actions that will involve separate environmental analysis. 


(g) If applicable, identify the extent to which the EIS preparation process is exempt from any of the normal procedural requirements of this part, including scoping.
