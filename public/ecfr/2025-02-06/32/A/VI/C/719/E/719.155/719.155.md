# § 719.155   Application under 10 U.S.C. 874(b) for the substitution of an administrative form of discharge for a punitive discharge or dismissal.

(a) *Statutory provisions.* 10 U.S.C. 874(b) provides that the “Secretary concerned may, for good cause, substitute an administrative form of discharge for a discharge or dismissal executed in accordance with the sentence of a court-martial.”


(b) *Submission procedures.* Applications for relief will be submitted to the Secretary using the following address: Secretary of the Navy (Judge Advocate General, Code 20), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332-2400. Except in unusual circumstances, applications will not normally be considered if received within five (5) years of the execution of the punitive discharge or dismissal, or within five (5) years of disapproval of a prior request under 10 U.S.C. 874(b).


(c) *Contents of the application.* All applications shall contain:


(1) Full name of the applicant;


(2) Social Security Number, service number (if different), and branch of service of the applicant;


(3) Present age and date of birth of the applicant;


(4) Present residence of the applicant;


(5) Date and place of the trial, and type of court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;


(6) Command title of the convening authority of the court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;


(7) Offense(s) of which the applicant was convicted, and sentence finally approved from the trial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;


(8) Date the punitive discharge or dismissal was executed;


(9) Applicant's present marital status, and number and ages of dependents, if any;


(10) Applicant's civilian criminal record (arrest(s) with disposition, and conviction(s)), both prior and subsequent to the court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;


(11) Applicant's entire court-martial record (offense(s) of which convicted and finally approved sentence(s)), and nonjudicial punishment record (including offense(s) and punishment(s) awarded);


(12) Any military administrative discharge proceedings (circumstances and disposition) initiated against the applicant;


(13) Applicant's full employment record since the punitive discharge or dismissal was executed;


(14) The specific type and character of administrative discharge requested pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 874(b) (a more favorable administrative discharge than that requested will not be approved);


(15) At least three but not more than six character affidavits, (The character affidavits must be notarized, must indicate the relationship of the affiant to the applicant, and must include the address of the affiant as well as specific reasons why the affiant believes the applicant to be of good character. The affidavits should discuss the applicant's character primarily as reflected in the civilian community subsequent to the punitive discharge or dismissal which is the subject of the application);


(16) Any matters, other than the character affidavits, supporting the considerations described in subparagraph (18) below;


(17) Any other relief sought within the Department of the Navy and outside the Department of the Navy including dates of application and final dispositions;


(18) A statement by the applicant, setting forth the specific considerations which the applicant believes constitute “good cause,” so as to warrant the substitution of an administrative form of discharge for the punitive discharge or dismissal previously executed. (In this connection, 10 U.S.C. 874(b) does not provide another regular or extraordinary procedure for the review of a court-martial. Questions of guilt or innocence, or legal issues attendant to the court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal, are neither relevant nor appropriate for consideration under 10 U.S.C. 874(b). As used in the statute, “good cause” was envisioned by Congress to encompass only Secretarial exercise of clemency and ultimate control of sentence uniformity. Accordingly, in determining what constitutes “good cause” under 10 U.S.C. 874(b), the primary Secretarial concern will be with the applicant's record in the civilian community subsequent to his or her punitive separation. Material submitted by the 10 U.S.C. 874(b) applicant should be consistent with the foregoing.)


(d) *Signature on application.* Unless incapable of making application himself or herself, the applicant shall personally sign the application, under oath, before a notary or other official authorized to administer oaths. If the applicant is incapable of executing the application, the application may be signed under oath and submitted by the applicant's spouse, next of kin, executor, guardian and other person recognized as a personal representative by the law of the applicant's domicile. One is considered incapable of executing an application for purposes of this paragraph only when the applicant is unable to sign the application under oath due to physical or mental incapacity. When an application is signed by a person other than the applicant, the circumstances rendering the applicant incapable of making sworn application shall be set forth in the application, with appropriate documentation.


(e) *Privacy Act Statement.* Disclosure of personal information requested by paragraph (c) of this section is voluntary; however, failure to accurately provide all requested information may result in the application being denied because of inadequate documentation of good cause.
