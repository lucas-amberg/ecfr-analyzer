# ยง 720.1   Delivery of persons requested by State authorities in criminal cases.

Subpart A of this part deals with requests by State authorities for the surrender of members or civilians pursuant to arrest warrants or similar process, generally in connection with a criminal prosecution. Responding to such requests by a State for delivery of members or civilian employees involves balancing the Federal interest in preserving sovereign immunity and the productivity, peace, good order, and discipline of the installation against the right of the State to exercise its jurisdiction. Additionally, by regulation, naval and Marine authorities are limited in the extent to which they can directly assist such an act. Commands should respond to such requests as set out below, generally using the minimum authority necessary to preserve the Federal interests without unduly restricting State jurisdiction.
