# ยง 720.10   Members released by civil authorities on bail or on their own recognizance.

A member of the Navy or Marine Corps arrested by Federal or State authorities and released on bail or on his own recognizance has a duty to return to his parent organization. Accordingly, when a member of the Navy or Marine Corps is arrested by Federal or State authorities and returns to his ship or station on bail, or on his own recognizance, the commanding officer, upon verification of the attesting facts, date of trial, and approximate length of time that should be covered by the absence, shall grant liberty or leave to permit appearance for trial, unless this would have a serious negative impact on the command. In the event that liberty or leave is not granted, a judge advocate of the Navy or Marine Corps should immediately be requested to act as liaison with the court. Nothing in this section is to be construed as permitting the member arrested and released to avoid the obligations of bond or recognizance by reason of the member's being in the military service.
