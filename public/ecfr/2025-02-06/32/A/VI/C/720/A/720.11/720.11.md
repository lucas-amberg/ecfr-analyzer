Requests by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Naval Investigative Service Command, or other Federal civilian investigative agencies to interview members or civilian employees of the Department of the Navy suspected or accused of crimes should be promptly honored. Any refusal of such a request shall be immediately reported to the Judge Advocate General, or the Office of General Counsel, as appropriate, by telephone, or by message if telephone is impractical.
