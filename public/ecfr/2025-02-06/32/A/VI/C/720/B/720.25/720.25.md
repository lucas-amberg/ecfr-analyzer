# ยง 720.25   Repossession of personal property.

Repossession of personal property, located on a Navy or Marine Corps installation, belonging to a member or to any dependent residing at or located on a Department of the Navy installation, may be permitted in the discretion of the commanding officer of the installation where the property is located, subject to the following. The documents purporting to authorize repossession and the procedures for repossessing the property must comply with State law. Prior to permitting physical repossession of any property, the commanding officer shall cause an informal inquiry into the circumstances and then determine whether to allow the repossession. If repossession is to be allowed, the person whose property is to be repossessed should be asked if he wishes to relinquish the property voluntarily. Repossession must be carried out in a manner prescribed by the commanding officer. In the case of property owned by civilian employees of the Department of the Navy or civilian contractors or their employees or dependents, the commanding officer should direct that the disputed property be removed from the installation until the commanding officer is satisfied that the dispute is resolved.
