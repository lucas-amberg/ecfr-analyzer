# ยง 724.109   Types of administrative discharges.

(a) A determination reflecting a member's military behavior and performance of duty during a specific period of service. The three characterizations are:


(1) *Honorable.* A separation from the naval service with honor. The issuance of an Honorable Discharge is contingent upon proper military behavior and performance of duty.


(2) Under Honorable Conditions (also termed General Discharge). A separation from the naval service under honorable conditions. The issuance of a discharge under honorable conditions is contingent upon military behavior and performance of duty which is not sufficiently meritorious to warrant an Honorable Discharge.


(3) *Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (formerly termed Undesirable Discharge).* A separation from the naval service under conditions other than honorable. It is issued to terminate the service of a member of the naval service for one or more of the reasons/basis listed in the Naval Military Personnel Manual, Marine Corps Separation and Retirement Manual and their predecessor publications.


(4) *Entry Level Separation.* (i) A separation initiated while a member is in entry level status will be described as an Entry Level Separation except in the following circumstances:


(*a*) When characterization under Other Than Honorable Conditions is authorized and is warranted by the circumstances of the case; or


(*b*) When characterization of service as Honorable is clearly warranted by the presence of unusual circumstances including personal conduct and performance of naval duty and is approved on a case-by-case basis by the Secretary of the Navy. This characterization will be considered when the member is separated by reason of Selected Changes in Service Obligation, Convenience of the Government, or Disability.


(ii) With respect to administrative matters outside the administrative separation system that require a characterization of service as Honorable or General, an Entry Level Separation shall be treated as the required characterization. An Entry Level Separation for a member of a Reserve component separated from the Delayed Entry Program is under honorable conditions. 


(b) [Reserved]
