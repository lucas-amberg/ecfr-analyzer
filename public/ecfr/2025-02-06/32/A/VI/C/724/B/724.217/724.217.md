# § 724.217   Limitation—Reconsiderations.

A discharge review shall not be subject to reconsideration except:


(a) When the only previous consideration of the case was on the motion of the NDRB;


(b) When the original discharge review did not involve a personal hearing and a hearing is now desired, and the provisions of § 724.216 do not apply;


(c) When changes in discharge policy are announced after an earlier review of an applicant's discharge, and the new policy is made expressly retroactive;


(d) When the NDRB determines that policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration, provided that such changes in policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded an applicant in such proceedings;


(e) When an individual is to be represented by counsel or representative, and was not so represented in any previous consideration of the case by the NDRB;


(f) When the case was not previously considered under uniform standards published pursuant to Pub. L. 95-126 and such application is made within 15 years after the date of discharge; or


(g) On the basis of presentation of new, substantial, relevant evidence not available to the applicant at the time of the original review. The decision whether evidence offered by an applicant in support of a request for reconsideration is in fact new, substantial, relevant, and was not available to the applicant at the time of the original review will be based on a comparison of such evidence with the evidence considered in the previous discharge review. If this comparison shows that the evidence submitted would have had a probable effect on matters concerning the propriety or equity of the discharge, the request for reconsideration shall be granted.
