# ยง 750.10   Claims: Settlement and release.

(a) *Fully and partially approved claims.* When a claim is approved for payment in the amount claimed, settlement agreement may not be necessary. When a federal tort, military, or non-scope claim is approved for payment in a lesser amount than that claimed, the claimant must indicate in writing a willingness to accept the offered amount in full settlement and final satisfaction of the claim. In the latter instance, no payment will be made until a signed settlement agreement has been received.


(b) *Release.* (1) Acceptance by the claimant of an award or settlement made by the Secretary of the Navy or designees, or the Attorney General or designees, is final upon acceptance by the claimant. Acceptance is a complete release by claimant of any claim against the United States by reason of the same subject manner. Claimant's acceptance of an advance payment does not have the same effect.


(2) The claimant's acceptance of an award or settlement made under the provisions governing the administrative settlement of Federal tort claims or the civil action provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1346(b) also constitutes a complete release of any claim against any employee of the Government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.
