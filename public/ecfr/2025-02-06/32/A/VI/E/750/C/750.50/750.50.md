# § 750.50   Advance payments.

(a) *Scope.* This paragraph applies exclusively to the payment of amounts not to exceed $100,000.00 under 10 U.S.C. 2736 in advance of submission of a claim.


(b) *Statutory authority.* Title 10 U.S.C. 2736 authorizes the Secretary of the Navy or designee to pay an amount not in excess of $100,000.00 in advance of the submission of a claim to or for any person, or the legal representative of any person, who was injured or killed, or whose property was damaged or lost, as the result of an accident for which allowance of a claim is authorized by law. Payment under this law is limited to that which would be payable under the MCA (10 U.S.C. 2733). Payment of an amount under this law is not an admission by the United States of liability for the accident concerned. Any amount so paid shall be deducted from any amount that may be allowed under any other provision of law to the person or his legal representative for injury, death, damage, or loss attributable to the accident concerned.

(6) Overseas commands with a Judge Advocate General's Corps officer or a judge advocate of the Marine Corps attached, have delegated authority to make advance payments up to $3,000.00.


(d) *Conditions for advance payments.* Prior to making an advance payment under 10 U.S.C. 2736, the adjudicating authority shall ascertain that:

(5) The prospective payee has signed a statement that it is understood that payment is not an admission by the Navy or the United States of liability for the accident concerned, and that the amount paid is not a gratuity but shall constitute an advance against and shall be deducted from any amount that may be allowed under any other provision of law to the person or his legal representative for injury, death, damage, or loss attributable to the accident concerned; and


(6) No payment under 10 U.S.C. 2736 may be made if the accident occurred in a foreign country in which the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (4 U.S.T. 1792, TIAS 2846) or other similar agreement is in effect and the injury, death, damage, or loss
