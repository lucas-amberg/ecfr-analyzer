# § 750.67   Scope of liability.

(a) Subject to the exceptions in § 750.68 of specific claims not payable, the United States shall not pay more than $1,000.00 for a claim against the United States, not cognizable under any other provision of law, except Article 139, UCMJ.


(b) Article 139, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. 939, is not preemptive. The prohibition in 10 U.S.C. 2737 on paying claims “not cognizable under any other provisions of law” applies only to law authorizing claims against the United States. Article 139 authorizes claims against servicemembers. See part 755 of this chapter.
