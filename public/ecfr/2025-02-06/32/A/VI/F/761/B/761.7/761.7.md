(b) *Excluded persons*—(1) *Entry prohibited.* Excluded persons, as defined in § 761.5(e), are prohibited from entering any defense area. In a bona fide emergency which requires an excluded person's presence in or transit through a military installation which is also a defense area, the commanding officer of the installation may grant permission to enter or transit subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by regulation or which may, in his discretion, be required.

(c) *Control of violators.* No commanding officer of a military installation shall permit any ship or aircraft which has entered the limits of his command by passing through a defense area without authorization to land, except in emergency, or, if permitted to land, to disembark passengers or cargo except as authorized by the appropriate Entry Control Commander. Commanding officers will take appropriate action to apprehend violators who come within their jurisdiction and request disposition instructions from the appropriate Entry Control Commander.


(d) *Trust Territory.* An authorization from the High Commissioner is required for all persons desiring to enter the Trust Territory, except for those areas under military jurisdiction where entry is controlled by the Department of the Army (Kwajalein Atoll) and the Defense Nuclear Agency (Eniwetok Atoll).


(e) *Military areas.* Entries authorized under this Instruction do not affect the authority of a commanding officer or other appropriate commander to impose and enforce proper regulations pertaining to movement into or within naval stations or other military installations.


(f) *Waiver prohibited.* No officer of the U.S. Armed Forces, except as authorized in writing by the Chief of Naval Operations, has authority to waive the requirements of this part, and any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized person.
