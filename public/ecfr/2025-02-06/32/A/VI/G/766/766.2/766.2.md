# § 766.2   Definition of terms.

For the purpose of this part certain terms are defined as follows:


(a) *Alternate use.* Use of the aviation facility, specified in the flight plan, to which an aircraft may divert when a landing at the point of first intended landing becomes impractical because of weather. (Aircraft may not be dispatched, prior to takeoff from the airport of origin, to a facility licensed for alternate use.)


(b) *Civil aircraft.* Domestic or foreign aircraft operated by private individuals or corporations, or foreign government-owned aircraft operated for commercial purposes. This includes:


(1) *Contract aircraft.* Civil aircraft operated under charter or other contract to any U.S. Government department or agency.


(2) *Leased aircraft.* U.S. Government-owned aircraft delivered by the Government to a lessee subject to terms prescribed in an agreement which does not limit the lessee's use of the aircraft to Government business.


(c) *Civil aviation.* All flying activity by civil aircraft including:


(1) *Commercial aviation.* Transportation by aircraft of passengers or cargo for hire and the ferrying of aircraft as a commercial venture.


(2) *General aviation.* All types of civil aviation other than commercial aviation as defined above.


(d) *Facility.* A separately located and officially defined area of real property in which the Navy exercises a real property interest and which has been designated as a Navy or Marine Corps aviation facility by cognizant authority; or where the Department of the Navy has jurisdiction over real property agreements, expressed or implied, with foreign governments, or by rights of occupation. (This definition does not include aircraft carriers nor any other type of naval vessel with a landing area for aircraft.)


(e) *Government aircraft.* Aircraft owned or operated by any department or agency of either the United States or a foreign government (except a foreign government-owned aircraft operated for commercial purposes). Also aircraft owned by any department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, territory, or possession of the United States when such local government has sole responsibility for operating the aircraft. Government aircraft includes:


(1) *Military aircraft.* Aircraft used in the military services of any government.


(2) *Bailed aircraft.* U.S. Government-owned aircraft delivered by the Government to a Government contractor for a specific purpose directly related to a Government contract.


(3) *Loaned aircraft.* U.S. Government-owned aircraft delivered gratuitously by any Department of Defense agency to another Government agency, to a U.S. Navy or Marine Corps Flying Club, or to a U.S. Army or Air Force Aero Club.


(f) *Joint-use facility.* A Navy or Marine Corps facility where a specific agreement between the Department of the Navy and a civilian community, or between the U.S. Government and a foreign government, provides for civil aircraft use of the runways and taxiways. Civil aircraft terminal, parking, and servicing facilities are established and controlled by civil authorities in an area separate from those of the Navy or Marine Corps.


(g) *Official business.* Business, in the interest of the U.S. Government, which personnel aboard an aircraft must transact with U.S. Government organizations or personnel at or near the naval aviation facility concerned. Use of a facility to solicit U.S. Government business is not “official business.”


(h) *Provisional use.* Use of a naval aviation facility for the purpose of providing adequate service to a community where, because of repair, construction or the performance of other work, the regular civil airport servicing the community is not available for an extended period. (An aircraft may be dispatched prior to takeoff from the airport of origin to a naval aviation facility authorized for provisional use.)


(i) *Scheduled use.* Use of a facility on a scheduled or regularly recurring basis by an air carrier certified by the Civil Aeronautics Board to provide passenger and cargo service to a community or area.


(j) *Services in connection with Government contracts.* This type of operation, cited on the Aviation Facility License, indicates the use of a facility for transporting the contractor's supplies and personnel for the performance of work at the facility under the terms of a specific U.S. Government contract.


(k) *Technical stop.* An en route landing for the purpose of obtaining fuel, oil, minor repairs, or crew rest. This does not include passenger accommodations nor passenger/cargo enplaning or deplaning privileges unless specifically authorized by the Chief of Naval Operations.


(l) *User.* An individual, corporation, or company named in the Aviation Facility License and the Certificate of Insurance.
