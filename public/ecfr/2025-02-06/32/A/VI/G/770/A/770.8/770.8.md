# ยง 770.8   Reports.

Upon killing a deer or turkey, a hunter must attach the appropriate tab from his big game license to the carcass before moving the game from the place of kill. The game will then be taken to the Game Checking Station where the tab will be exchanged for an official game tag. All other game, not requiring a tag, killed on the Reservation will be immediately reported to the Game Warden when checking out at the end of a hunt.
