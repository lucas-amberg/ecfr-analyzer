# ยง 775.11   Public participation.

The importance of public participation (40 CFR 1501.4(b)) in preparing environmental assessments is clearly recognized and it is recommended that commands proposing an action develop a plan to ensure appropriate communication with affected and interested parties. The command Public Affairs Office can provide assistance with developing and implementing this plan. In determining the extent to which public participation is practicable, the following are among the factors to be weighed by the command:


(a) The magnitude of the environmental considerations associated with the proposed action;


(b) The extent of anticipated public interest; and


(c) Any relevant questions of national security and classification.
