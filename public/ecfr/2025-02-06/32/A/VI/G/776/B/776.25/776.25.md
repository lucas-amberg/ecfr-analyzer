(b) A covered attorney shall reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the covered attorney reasonably believes necessary:

(2) To prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the covered attorney reasonably believes is likely to result in the significant impairment of national security or the readiness or capability of a military unit, vessel, aircraft, or weapon system.


(c) A covered attorney may reveal such information to the extent the covered attorney reasonably believes necessary:


(1) To secure legal advice about the covered attorney's compliance with subpart B of this part;


(2) To establish a claim or defense on behalf of the covered attorney in a controversy between the covered attorney and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the covered attorney based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the attorney's representation of the client; and/or


(3) To comply with other law or a court order.

Paragraph (b) of this section is not intended to and does not mandate the disclosure of conduct that may have a slight impact on the readiness or capability of a unit, vessel, aircraft, or weapon system. Examples of such conduct are: Absence without authority from a peacetime training exercise; intentional damage to an individually assigned weapon; and intentional minor damage to military property.
