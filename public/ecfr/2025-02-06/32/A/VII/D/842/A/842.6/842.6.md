# ยง 842.6   Signature on the claim form.

The claimant or authorized agent signs the claim form in ink using the first name, middle initial, and last name.


(a) *Claim filed by an individual.* (1) A married woman signs her name, for example, Mary A. Doe, rather than Mrs. John Doe.


(2) An authorized agent signing for a claimant shows, after the signature, the title or capacity and attaches evidence of authority to present a claim on behalf of the claimant as agent, executor, administrator, parent, guardian, or other representative; for example, John Doe by Richard Roe, Attorney in Fact. A copy of a current and valid power of attorney, court order, or other legal document is sufficient evidence of the agent's authority. 


(b) *Claim with joint interest.* Where a joint ownership or interest in real property exists, all joint owners must sign the claim form. This includes a husband and wife signing a claim if the claim is for property damage. However, only the military member or civilian employee signs the claim form for a claim under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.


(c) *Claim filed by a corporation.* (1) A corporate officer signing the form must show title or capacity and affix the corporate seal (if any) to the claim form.


(2) If the person signing the claim is other than the corporate officer they must: 


(i) Attach to the claim form a certification by a proper corporate officer that the individual is an agent of the corporation duly authorized to file and settle the claim;


(ii) Affix to the claim form the corporate seal (if any) to the certification.


(d) *Claim filed by a partnership.* A partner must sign the form showing his or her title as partner and list the full name of the partnership.
