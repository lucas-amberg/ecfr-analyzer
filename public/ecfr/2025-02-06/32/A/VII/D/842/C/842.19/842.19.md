# ยง 842.19   Partial payments.

Upon request of a claimant, a settlement authority may make a partial payment in advance of final settlement when a claimant experiences personal hardship due to extensive property damage or loss. Partial payments are made if a claim for only part of the loss is submitted and is readily provable, up to the amount of the settlement authority. (The claimant may later amend the claim for the remainder of the loss.) If the total payable amount of the claim exceeds the payment limits of the settlement authority, send it with recommendations to the proper settlement authority.
