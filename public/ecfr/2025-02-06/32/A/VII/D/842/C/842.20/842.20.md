# ยง 842.20   Statute of limitations.

(a) The claimant must file the claim in writing within 2 years after it accrues. It accrues when the claimant discovered or reasonably should have discovered the full extent of the property damage or loss. For transportation losses, the claim usually accrues on the date of delivery.


(b) To compute the statutory period, the incident date is excluded and the day the claim was filed is included.


(c) Consider a claim filed after the statute has run if both of the following are present:


(1) The United States is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim accrues, or the United States enters a war or armed conflict after the claim accrues. Congress or the President establishes the beginning and end of war or armed conflict. A claimant may not file a claim more than 2 years after the war or armed conflict ends.


(2) Good cause is shown. A claimant may not file a claim more than 2 years after the good cause ceases to exist.
