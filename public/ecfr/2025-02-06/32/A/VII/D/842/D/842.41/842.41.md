# ยง 842.41   Applicable law.

This section provides the existing law governing liability, measurement of liability and the effects of settlement upon awards.


(a) *Federal preemption.* Many of the exclusions in this subpart are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680 or other federal statutes or court decisions interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act. Federal case law interpreting the same exclusions under the Federal Tort Claims Act is applied to the Military Claims Act. Where state law differs with federal law, federal law prevails.


(b) *Extent of liability.* Where the claim arises is important in determining the extent of liability.


(1) *Applicable law.* When a claim arises in the United States, its territories or possessions, the same law as if the claim was cognizable under the FTCA will be applied.


(2) *Claims in foreign countries.* In claims arising in a foreign country, where the claim is for personal injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property caused by an act or omission alleged to be negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of military personnel or civilian officers or employees of the United States acting within the scope of their employment, liability or the United States is determined according to federal case law interpreting the FTCA. Where the FTCA requires application of the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, settlement authorities will use the rules set forth in the currently adopted edition of the *Restatement of the* Law, published by the American Law Institute, to evaluate the liability of the Air Force, subject to the following rules:


(i) Foreign rules and regulations governing the operation of motor vehicles (rules of the road) are applied to the extent those rules are not specifically superseded or preempted by United States military traffic regulations.


(ii) Absolute or strict liability will not apply for claims not arising from noncombat activities.


(iii) Hedonic damages are not payable.


(iv) The collateral source doctrine does not apply.


(v) Joint and several liability does not apply. Payment will be made only upon the portion of loss, damage, injury or death attributable to the Armed Forces of the United States.


(vi) Future economic loss will be discounted to present value after deducting for federal income taxes and, in cases of wrongful death, personal consumption.


(c) *Claims not payable.* Do not approve payment for:


(i) Punitive damages.


(ii) Cost of medical or hospital services furnished at the expense of the United States.


(iii) Cost of burial expenses paid by the United States.


(d) *Settlement by insurer or joint tortfeasor.* When settlement is made by an insurer or joint tortfeasor and an additional award is warranted, an award may be made if both of the following are present:


(1) The United States is not protected by the release executed by the claimant.


(2) The total amount received from such source is first deducted.
