# ยง 842.57   Reconsideration of final denials.

This section provides the procedures used to reconsider a final denial.


(a) An FCC has the inherent authority to reconsider a final decision. The mere fact that a request for reconsideration is received does not obligate the settlement authority to reopen the claim.


(b) The FCC does not mention a reconsideration right in the original denial letter.


(c) A settlement authority must reconsider the final action when there is:


(1) New and material evidence concerning the claim; or


(2) Obvious errors in the original decision.


(d) The FCC must document in the claim file the reason for reconsideration.


(e) A FCC above the original settlement authority may direct a claim be forwarded to a higher FCC for reconsideration.
