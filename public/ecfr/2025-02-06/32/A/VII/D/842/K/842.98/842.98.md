# ยง 842.98   Claims not payable.

The following are not payable:


(a) Claims covered by the FTCA, FCA, IACA, 10 U.S.C. 2734a and 2734b, Air Force Admiralty Claims Act (AFACA), 10 U.S.C. 9801-9804, 9806, MCA, 10 U.S.C. 2733, or covered under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act (MPCECA), 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3721.


(b) NGCA claims arising from noncombat activities in the U.S. are not covered by the FTCA because more elements are needed to state an FTCA claim than are needed to state a claim under the NGCA for noncombat activities. All FTCA claims are based on elements of traditional tort liability (*i.e.,* duty, breach, causation, and damages); that is, they are fault based. Noncombat activity claims under the NGCA are based solely on causation and damages. Because NGCA claims for noncombat activities are not fault based, they are not covered by the FTCA.


(c) See subpart E of this part for other claims not payable.


(d) Claims for damage to or loss of bailed property when the bailor specifically assumed such risk.


(e) Claims for personal injury or death of a person covered by:


(1) The Federal Employees' Compensation Act.
