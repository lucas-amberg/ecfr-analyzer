(1) Risks of litigation.


(2) Questionable liability of the third party.


(3) Costs of litigation.


(4) Insurance (Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist and Medical Payment Coverage) or other assets of the tortfeasor available to satisfy a judgment for the entire claim.


(5) Potential counterclaim against the U.S.


(6) Jury verdict expectancy amount.


(7) Amount of settlement with proposed distribution.


(8) Cost of any future care.


(9) Tortfeasor cannot be located.


(10) Tortfeasor is judgment proof.


(11) Tortfeasor has refused to pay and the case is too weak for litigation.


(b) *Hardship on the injured party.* When compromising or waiving a claim to avoid undue hardship on the injured party, settlement authorities should consider the following factors:


(1) Permanent disability or disfigurement of the injured party.


(2) Decreased earning power of the injured party.


(3) Out of pocket losses to the injured party.


(4) Financial status of the injured party.


(5) Pension rights of the injured party.


(6) Other government benefits available to the injured party.


(7) An offer of settlement from a third party which includes virtually all of the thirty party's assets, although the amount is considerably less than the calculation of the injured party's damages.


(8) Whether the injured party received excessive treatment.


(9) Amount of settlement with proposed distribution, including reductions in fees or damages by other parties, medical providers, or attorneys in order to reduce the hardship on the injured party.


(c) *Compromise or waiver.* A compromise or waiver can be made upon written request from the injured party or the injured party's legal representative.
