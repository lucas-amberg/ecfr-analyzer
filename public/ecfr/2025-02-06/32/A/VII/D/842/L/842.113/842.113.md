# ยง 842.113   Reconsideration of a waiver for undue hardship.

A settlement authority may reconsider its previous action on a request for waiver or compromise whether requested or not. Reconsideration is normally on the basis of new evidence or discovery of errors in the waiver submission or settlement, but can be based upon a re-evaluation of the claim by the settlement authority.
