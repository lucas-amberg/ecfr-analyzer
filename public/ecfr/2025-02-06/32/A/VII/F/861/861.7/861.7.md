# § 861.7   Disclosure of voluntarily provided safety-related information.

(a) *General.* In accordance with paragraph (h) of the reference in § 861.1 (a), DOD may withhold from public disclosure safety-related information voluntarily provided to DOD by an air carrier for the purposes of this part if DOD determines that—


(1) The disclosure of the information would, in the future, inhibit an air carrier from voluntarily providing such information to DOD or another Federal agency for the purposes of this part or for other air safety purposes; and


(2) The receipt of such information generally enhances the fulfillment of responsibilities under this part or other air safety responsibilities involving DOD or another Federal agency.


(b) *Processing requests for disclosure of voluntarily provided safety-related information.* Requests for public disclosure will be administratively processed in accordance with 32 CFR part 806, Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program.


(c) *Disclosure of voluntarily provided safety-related information to other agencies.* The Department of Defense may, at its discretion, disclose voluntarily provided safety-related information submitted under this part by an air carrier, to other agencies with safety responsibilities. The DOD will provide such information to another agency only upon receipt of adequate assurances that it will protect the information from public disclosure, and that it will not release such information unless specifically authorized.
