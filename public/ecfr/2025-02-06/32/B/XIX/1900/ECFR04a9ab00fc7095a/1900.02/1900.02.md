(4) *Search,* which means all time expended in looking for and retrieving material that may be responsive to a request utilizing available paper and electronic indices and finding aids, including time spent determining whether records located during a search are responsive to the request.


(g) *Fees* means those direct costs which a requester may be assessed considering the categories established by the FOIA; the fee categories include:


(1) *Commercial use.* Requests in which the disclosure sought is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester and which furthers such commercial, trade, income or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.


(2) *Educational or non-commercial scientific institution, or a representative of the news media*—(i) *Educational or non-commercial scientific institution.* Requests made under the auspices of an accredited United States institution engaged in scholarly or scientific research and which are for information not for commercial use, but rather intended to be used in specific scholarly or scientific works.


(ii) *Representative of the news media.* Requests from any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term *news* means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and individual or corporate publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered a representative of the news media.
