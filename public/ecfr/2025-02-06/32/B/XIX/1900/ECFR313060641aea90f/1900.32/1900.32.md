# ยง 1900.32   Procedures for information concerning other persons.

(a) Personal information concerning individuals other than the requester shall not be disclosed in response to a FOIA request if, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), the release of such information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. *Personal information* is any information about an individual that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that arise from Government possession of such information. *Public interest* means the public interest in understanding the operations and activities of the United States Government and not simply any matter which might be of general interest to the requester or members of the public.


(b) In making the required determination under this section and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), the Agency will balance the privacy interests that would be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested information.


(c) A requester seeking information on a third party is encouraged to provide a signed affidavit or declaration from the third party waiving all or some of their privacy rights, or to submit proof that the third party is deceased (*e.g.,* a copy of a death certificate, a published obituary, etc.). Third-party waivers shall be narrowly construed and the Coordinator, in the exercise of the Coordinator's discretion and administrative authority, may seek clarification from the third party prior to any or all releases.
