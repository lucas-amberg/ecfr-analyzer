# § 1900.34   Requests for expedited processing.

(a) *Expedited processing requests.* Requests for expedited processing shall be submitted to the Coordinator in accordance with §§ 1900.03, 1900.11, and 1900.12. Such requests will be approved only when a compelling need is established to the satisfaction of the Agency. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Agency will decide whether to grant expedited processing and will notify the requester of its decision. A *compelling need* is deemed to exist:


(1) When the matter involves an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or


(2) When the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information and the information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.


(b) *Expedited processing appeals.* Denials of requests for expedited processing may be appealed to the CIA's Agency Release Panel via the Coordinator and shall be acted upon expeditiously.
