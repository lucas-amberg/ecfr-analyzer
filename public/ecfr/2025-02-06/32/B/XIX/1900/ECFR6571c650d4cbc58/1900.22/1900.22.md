# § 1900.22   Action and determination(s) by originator(s) or any interested party.

(a) *Initial action for access.* (1) CIA components tasked pursuant to a FOIA request shall conduct a reasonable search of all relevant record systems within their areas of responsibility which have not been exempted from search, review, and disclosure under the FOIA by the CIA Information Act of 1984 and which are reasonably likely to contain records responsive to the request. They shall:


(i) Determine whether any responsive records exist;


(ii) Determine whether, and to what extent, any FOIA exemptions, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(b), apply to the responsive records;


(iii) Review the exempt records to determine whether they contain any reasonably segregable, non-exempt material;


(iv) Approve the disclosure of all non-exempt records, or portions of records, within their areas of responsibility; and


(v) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or necessary for coordination with or referral to another component or interested party.


(2) In making the decisions discussed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the CIA component officers shall be guided by the applicable law as well as the procedures specified at §§ 1900.31 and 1900.32 regarding confidential commercial or financial information and personal information (about persons other than the requester).


(b) *Referrals and coordinations.* As applicable, any CIA records containing information originated by other CIA components shall be forwarded to those entities for appropriate action in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. Records originated by other Federal agencies or CIA records containing other Federal agency information shall be forwarded to such agencies for appropriate action in accordance with the applicable procedures of each agency.
