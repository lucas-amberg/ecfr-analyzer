(2) *Personal Service.* Subject to the sole discretion of appropriate officials of the CIA, process servers generally will not be allowed to enter CIA facilities or premises for the purpose of serving process upon any CIA employee solely in his or her individual capacity.

(d) The documents for which service is accepted in official capacity only shall be stamped “Service Accepted in Official Capacity Only.” Acceptance of service of process shall not constitute an admission or waiver with respect to jurisdiction, propriety of service, improper venue, or any other defense in law or equity available under the laws or rules applicable to the service of process.
