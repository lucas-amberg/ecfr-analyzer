# ยง 1911.4   Federal agency requests for access and processing procedures.

(a) *Federal agency requests.* Cleared staff and contractor personnel, working for a Federal agency, and seeking access to classified CIA historical records in an official capacity, shall send the request to the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator (Coordinator) identifying the particular records needed, the purpose for which the records are needed, whether declassification of the information contained in the records will be required, and the position and security clearances or security approvals held by the requester.


(b) *Special procedures.* The Coordinator shall review the request and solicit input from the Director of the Center for the Study of Intelligence and other interested parties concerning whether or not the required determinations set forth in paragraph (c) of this section can be made. After considering any input received, the Coordinator will either make or not make the determinations set forth in paragraph (c), in consultation with the ARP, and forward the request and the Coordinator's recommendation to the Chief, Information Review and Release Group (IRRG), Information Management Services for decision on whether or not to provide the access requested. A negative determination by the Chief of IRRG shall be reviewed by the Director, Information Management Services, who shall issue the final CIA decision whether or not to grant the request for access.


(c) *Determinations.* As a condition precedent for access, the Coordinator must make all of the following determinations with respect to each request:


(1) That the requester is a current staff employee or contractor of the U.S. Government;


(2) That the requester is currently cleared, or security approved, for access to classified information and that the specific clearance or security approval and access levels of that individual has been officially recorded;


(3) That the scope of the request for information is clearly delineated;


(4) That the information requested is reasonably accessible and can be located and compiled with a reasonable effort;


(5) That a nondisclosure agreement with a prepublication review clause has been executed by the requester;


(6) That all notes and any resulting document will be appropriately safeguarded, that further access will be appropriately limited, and that no further dissemination of information such as that marked ORCON (Dissemination and Extraction of Information Controlled by Originator) or HUMINT (Human Intelligence) shall be made beyond the requesting agency unless CIA permission is obtained;


(7) That if the resulting document containing CIA information or equities is intended to be declassified, the document will be submitted to the Coordinator for declassification review;


(8) That the information and documents will remain classified until a final declassification review and release decision is made by CIA; and,


(9) That the request for access is an official agency request, made in the requester's official capacity on behalf of the requester's agency.


(d) *Limitations.* (1) With respect to requests for access to CIA information and equities residing outside of CIA, upon a favorable CIA determination in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the CIA will notify both the requester and the agency holding the records with CIA equities. The requester will need to follow the access requirements of the agency holding the records in addition to any access requirements mandated by CIA.


(2) If access to classified historical CIA records is granted, as a rule, such access shall be provided on CIA premises only. No copies of any classified historical CIA records shall be provided to the requester for reference and use on requester premises without the express approval of the Director, Information Management Services. In exceptional cases, if the provision of classified CIA historical records to the requester for reference and use on requester premises is permitted, the classified CIA historical records provided shall not be disclosed or disseminated beyond the requesting agency, and shall be returned to CIA or destroyed when use of the records has ended. Similarly, any notes taken that are derived from classified historical CIA records that have been accessed in accordance with this part shall not be disclosed or disseminated beyond the requesting agency.
