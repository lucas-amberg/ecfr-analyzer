# ยง 1605.56   Organization and meetings.

Each local board shall elect a chairman and vice-chairman at least every two years. A majority of the membership of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. A majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall decide any question or classification. Every member present, unless disqualified, shall vote on every question or classification. In case of a tie vote on any question or classification, the board shall postpone action on the question or classification until it can be decided by a majority vote at the next meeting. If the question or classification remains unresolved at the next meeting, the file will be transferred for classification in accord with ยง 1605.55(c). If any member is absent so long as to hamper the work of the board, the chairman, a member of the board, or a Selective Service compensated employee shall report that fact to the Director of Selective Service and appropriate action shall be taken. If through death, resignation, or other cause, the membership of a board falls below the prescribed number, it shall continue to function provided a quorum of the prescribed membership is present at each official meeting.
