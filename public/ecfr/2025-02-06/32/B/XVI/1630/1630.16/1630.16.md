# ยง 1630.16   Class 1-O: Conscientious objector to all military service.

(a) Any registrant whose acceptability for military service has been satisfactorily determined and who, in accord with part 1636 of this chapter, has been found, by reason of religious, ethical, or moral belief, to be conscientiously opposed to participation in both combatant and noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces shall be classified in Class 1-O.


(b) Upon the written request of the registrant filed with his claim for classification in Class 1-O, the local board will consider his claim for classification in Class 1-O before he is examined. If the local board determines that the registrant would qualify for Class 1-O if he were acceptable for military service, it will delay such classification until he is found acceptable for military service. Upon the written request of such registrant, he will be deemed acceptable for military service without examination only for the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section.
