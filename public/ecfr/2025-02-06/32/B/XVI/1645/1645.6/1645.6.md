# ยง 1645.6   Considerations relevant to granting or denying a claim for Class 4-D.

(a) The board shall first determine whether the registrant is requesting classification in Class 4-D because he is a regular minister of religion or because he is a duly ordained minister of religion.


(b) If the registrant claims to be a duly ordained minister of religion, the board will:


(1) Determine whether the registrant has been ordained, in accordance with the ceremonial ritual or discipline of a church, religious sect, or organization established on the basis of a community of faith and belief, doctrines and practices of religious character, to preach and teach the doctrines of such church, sect, or organization and to administer the rites and ceremonies thereof in public worship; and


(2) Determine whether the registrant as his regular, customary, and bona fide vocation, preaches and teaches the principles of religion and administers the ordinances of public worship, as embodied in the creed or principles of the church, sect, or organization by which the registrant was ordained.


(c) If the registrant claims to be a regular minister of religion, the board will:


(1) Determine whether the registrant as his customary and regular calling or customary and regular full-time profession, preaches and teaches the principles of religion of a church, a religious sect, or organization of which he is a member, without having been formally ordained as a minister of religion; and 


(2) Determine whether the registrant is recognized by such church, sect, or organization as a regular minister.


(d) If the board determines that the registrant is a regular minister of religion or duly ordained minister of religion he shall be classified in Class 4-D.
