(a) Review of ASW job assignments will be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.


(b) Whenever the ASW believes that his job assignment violates his religious, moral or ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation in war that led to his classification as a conscientious objector or is in violation of the provisions of this part he may request a reassignment by the ASOM, as provided for in ยง 1656.12.


(c) The ASOM shall reassign the ASW if the ASOM concludes that the ASW's work assignment violates his religious, moral or ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation in war which led to his classification as a CO or is in violation of the provisions of this part.
