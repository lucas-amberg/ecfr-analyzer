(a) The purpose of this part is to describe the Selective Service System's (SSS) policies and procedures for implementing the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as set forth at 5 U.S.C. 552. The FOIA mandates disclosure to the public of Federal agency records unless specific exemptions apply. The FOIA also requires an agency to proactively disclose records and make certain records available for public inspection.


(b) The rules in this part describe how SSS makes records available to the public, including:


(1) What constitutes a proper request for records;


(2) How to make a FOIA request;


(3) Who has the authority to release and withhold records;


(4) What fees may be charged to process a request for records;


(5) The timing of determinations regarding release;


(6) The exemptions that permit the withholding of records;


(7) A requester's right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison;


(8) A requester's right to appeal the Agency's FOIA determination;


(9) A requester's right to seek assistance from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) and then go to court if they still disagree with the Agency's release determination; and


(10) The records available for public inspection.


(c) The rules in this part do not revoke, modify, or supersede the SSS regulations relating to disclosure of information in parts 1660 or 1665 of this chapter.
