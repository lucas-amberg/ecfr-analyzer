(a) *Coverage.* The FOIA and the rules in this part apply to all SSS records. The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about individuals, but only if the records are in a system of records.


(b) *Requesting your own records.* If you have filed a FOIA request and are an individual requesting your own records that are maintained in a system of records, or if you are a parent or legal guardian authorized to act on behalf of a minor or custodian who is seeking the records about a minor or individual who has been declared incompetent, the Agency will handle your request under the Privacy Act.
