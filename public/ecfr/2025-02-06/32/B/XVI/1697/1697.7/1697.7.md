# ยง 1697.7   Coordinating offset with another federal agency.

(a) *The Selective Service System as the creditor agency.* (1) When the Director determines that an employee of a federal agency owes a delinquent debt to the Selective Service System, the Director shall as appropriate:


(i) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the employee; 


(ii) Certify in writing to the paying agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date the government's right to collect the debt accrued, and that Selective Service System regulations for salary offset have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management; 


(iii) If collection must be made in installments, the Director must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment; 


(iv) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and provide the dates on which action was taken unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of procedures required by law. The written consent or acknowledgement must be sent to the paying agency; 


(v) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Selective Service System must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the employee and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the creditor agency. If the creditor agency is aware that the employee is entitled to Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or similar payments, it must certify to the agency responsible for making such payments the amount of the debt and that the provisions of this part have been followed; and 


(vi) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the Director may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset as provided under 5 CFR 831.1801 or other provisions of law or regulation. 


(b) *The Selective Service System as the paying agency.* (1) Upon receipt of a properly certified debt claim from another agency, deductions will be scheduled to begin at the next established pay interval. The employee must receive written notice that the Selective Service System has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt, the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). The Selective Service System shall not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity or the amount of the certified claim.


(2) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor agency has submitted its debt claim to the Selective Service System and before the debt is collected completely, the Selective Service System must certify the total amount collected. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee. A copy must be furnished the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer.
