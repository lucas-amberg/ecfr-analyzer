# § 1700.6   Time frames for ODNI responses.

(a) ODNI will ordinarily respond to requests according to their order of receipt.


(b) When evaluating requests, ODNI may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work or time needed to process the request.


(c) Subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, ODNI will respond to a FOIA request within 20 days after receipt of the request. A request is received by ODNI, for purposes of commencing the 20-day time frame for its response, on the day that the request is received by the IMO or, in any event, not later than ten days after the request is first received by any ODNI component.


(d) ODNI must determine whether to grant or deny, in whole or in part, an administrative appeal submitted in accordance with § 1700.7 within 20 days after receipt of the appeal, unless the time frame for a response to an appeal is extended in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.


(e) ODNI may toll the 20-day time frame set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section for one of the two reasons cited below, as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii). If ODNI tolls the time frame, the tolling period ends upon receipt of the requester's response.


(1) Once, to await information that the ODNI has reasonably requested from the requester; or


(2) As necessary, to clarify with the requester issues regarding the fee assessment.


(f) Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and ODNI extends the time limit on that basis, ODNI will notify the requester in writing, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 days, ODNI shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing. ODNI shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose and notify the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.


(g) For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, ODNI may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. ODNI will notify the requester(s) of the decision to aggregate.


(h) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve a compelling need. For this purpose, a “compelling need” involves either:


(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or


(2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.


(i) A request for expedited processing must be in writing and may be made at any time.


(j) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. Under this paragraph (h), a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—an urgency that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, ODNI may waive the formal certification requirement.


(k) The IMO will decide within 10 days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny such a request. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.
