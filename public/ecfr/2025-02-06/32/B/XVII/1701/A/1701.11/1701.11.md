(ii) Provide written notice of the amendment or correction to all persons, organizations or agencies to which the record has been disclosed (if an accounting of the disclosure was made);


(2) Where the D/IMO has referred an amendment request to another agency, the D/IMO, upon confirmation from that agency that the amendment has been effected, shall provide written notice of the amendment or correction to all persons, organizations or agencies to which ODNI previously disclosed the record.


(3) If the POC determines that the requester's records are accurate, relevant, timely and complete, and that no basis exists for amending or correcting the record, either in whole or in part, the D/IMO shall inform the requester in writing of:


(i) The reason(s) for the denial; and


(ii) The procedure for appeal of the denial under Sec. 1701.15 of this subpart.
