# ยง 1701.9   Requests for an accounting of record disclosures.

(a) *How to request.* Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (see paragraph (b) of this section), record subjects (or their guardians or representatives) may request an accounting of disclosures that have been made to another person, organization, or agency as permitted by the Privacy Act at 5 U.S.C. 552a(b). This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. Requests for accounting should identify each record in question and must be made in writing to the D/IMO, as indicated in ยง 1701.3 of this subpart, or to the contact designated in a specific Privacy Act System of Records.


(b) *Accounting not required.* The ODNI is not required to provide accounting of disclosure in the following circumstances:


(1) Disclosures for which the Privacy Act does not require accounting, i.e., disclosures to employees within the agency and disclosures made under the FOIA;


(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from the respective head of the law enforcement agency specifying the law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or


(3) Disclosures from systems of records that have been exempted from accounting requirements under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k), by notice published in the _Federal Register._
