# ยง 1801.31   Special procedures for medical and psychological records.

(a) *In general.* When a request for access or amendment involves medical or psychological records and when the originator determines that such records are not exempt from disclosure, NACIC will, after consultation with the Director of Medical Services, CIA, determine:


(1) Which records may be sent directly to the requester and


(2) Which records should not be sent directly to the requester because of possible medical or psychological harm to the requester or another person.


(b) *Procedure for records to be sent to physician.* In the event that NACIC determines, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that records should not be sent directly to the requester, NACIC will notify the requester in writing and advise that the records at issue can be made available only to a physician of the requester's designation. Upon receipt of such designation, verification of the identity of the physician, and agreement by the physician:


(1) To review the documents with the requesting individual,


(2) To explain the meaning of the documents, and


(3) To offer counseling designed to temper any adverse reaction, NACIC will forward such records to the designated physician.


(c) *Procedure if physician option not available.* If within sixty (60) days of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the requester has failed to respond or designate a physician, or the physician fails to agree to the release conditions, NACIC will hold the documents in abeyance and advise the requester that this action may be construed as a technical denial. NACIC will also advise the requester of the responsible official and of his or her rights to administrative appeal and thereafter judicial review.
