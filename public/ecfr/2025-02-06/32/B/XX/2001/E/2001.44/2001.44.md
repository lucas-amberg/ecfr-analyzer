(a) Once a facility is authorized, approved, certified, or accredited for classified use, then all agencies desiring to conduct classified work in the designated space(s) at the same security level shall accept the authorization, approval, certification, or accreditation without change, enhancements, or upgrades provided that no waiver, exception, or deviation has been issued or approved. In the event that a waiver exception, or deviation was granted in the original accreditation of the designated space(s), an agency seeking to utilize the designated facility space may require that a risk mitigation strategy be implemented or agreed upon prior to using the space(s).


(b) Subsequent security inspections or reviews for authorization, approval, certification, or accreditation purposes shall normally be conducted no more frequently than annually unless otherwise required due to a change in the designated facility space(s) or due to a change in the use or ownership of the facility space(s). This does not imply a formal one-year inspection or review requirement or establish any other formal period for inspections or review.
