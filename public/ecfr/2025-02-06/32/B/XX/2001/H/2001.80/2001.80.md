# § 2001.80   Prescribed standard forms.

(a) *General.* The purpose of the standard forms is to promote the implementation of the government-wide information security program. Standard forms are prescribed when their use will enhance the protection of national security information and/or will reduce the costs associated with its protection. The use of the standard forms prescribed is mandatory for agencies of the executive branch that create or handle national security information. As appropriate, these agencies may mandate the use of these forms by their contractors, licensees, or grantees who are authorized access to national security information.


(b) *Waivers.* Except for the SF 312, “Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement,” and the SF 714, “Financial Disclosure Report,” (which are waiverable by the Director of National Intelligence, as the Security Executive Agent, under E.O. 13467, *Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified National Security Information*) only the Director of ISOO may grant a waiver from the use of the prescribed standard forms. To apply for a waiver, an agency must submit its proposed alternative form to the Director of ISOO along with its justification for use. The Director of ISOO will review the request and notify the agency of the decision. Waivers approved prior to December 29, 2009, remain in effect and are subject to review.


(c) *Availability.* Agencies may obtain copies of the standard forms prescribed by ordering through FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP or from the GSA Consumer Global Supply Centers, or the GSA Advantage on-line service. Some of these standard forms can be downloaded from the GSA Forms Library.


(d) *Standard Forms.* Standard forms required for application to national security information are as follows.


(1) *SF 311, Agency Security Classification Management Program Data:* The SF 311 is a data collection form completed by only those executive branch agencies that create and/or handle classified national security information. The form is a record of classification management data provided by the agencies. The agencies submit the completed forms on an annual basis to ISOO, no later than November 15 following the reporting period, for inclusion in a report to the President.


(2) *SF 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement:*

(i) The SF 312 is a nondisclosure agreement between the United States and an employee of the Federal Government or one of its contractors, licensees, or grantees. The prior execution of this form by an individual is necessary before the United States Government may grant that individual access to classified information, with the exception of an emergency as defined in section 4.2(b) of the Order.


(ii) The SF 312 may be filled out electronically or by hand, then must be signed. It may be signed by hand and scanned, if the implementing agency permits and the scanned version is done in a way that constitutes a legally enforceable facsimile. Alternatively, the form may be digitally signed if the implementing agency permits, and if the digital signature mechanism employs public key cryptography in a way that meaningfully guarantees authenticity (*i.e.,* that the digital signature was made by the person it claims to have been made by); consent (*i.e.,* that the person who digitally signed the form meant to do so); and integrity (*i.e.,* that the SF 312 has not changed since the signature was made). Digital signatures created using Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards or common access cards (CACs) issued by the U.S. Government that are compliant with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), or its successor, meet the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii). They include public key infrastructure (PKI), digital signature certificates issued by a certificate authority (CA), and a PIN the signer must enter in order to digitally sign. Agencies may choose to use other digital signature mechanisms than the PIV or CAC cards, as long as they meet the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii). The form may not be signed using other forms of electronic signature (e-signature), such as typing “/s/[first and last name]” or attaching an image of a handwritten signature.


(iii) The SF 312 is the current authorized form; if an employee originally signed the now outdated SF 189 or SF 189-A, or a form under an approved waiver, as agreement to nondisclosure, the forms remain valid. The SF 189 and SF 189-A are no longer available for use with new employees.


(iv) The use of the “Security Debriefing Acknowledgement” portion of the SF 312 is optional at the discretion of the implementing agency. If an agency chooses not to record its debriefing by signing/dating the debriefing section of the SF 312, then the agency shall provide an alternative record.


(v) An authorized representative of a contractor, licensee, grantee, or other non-Government organization, acting as a designated agent of the United States, may witness the execution of the SF 312 by another non-Government employee, and may accept it on behalf of the United States. Also, an employee of a United States agency may witness the execution of the SF 312 by an employee, contractor, licensee, or grantee of another United States agency, provided that an authorized United States Government official or, for non-Government employees only, a designated agent of the United States subsequently accepts by signature the SF 312 on behalf of the United States. If the SF 312 is digitally signed, it does not require a witness to observe and verify the digital signature, and therefore also does not require an official to subsequently accept the signature.


(vi) The provisions of the SF 312, the SF 189, and the SF 189-A do not supersede the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 2302, which pertain to the protected disclosure of information by Government employees, or any other laws of the United States.


(vii) Each agency must retain its executed copies of the SF 312, SF 189, and SF 189-A in file systems from which an agreement can be expeditiously retrieved in the event that the United States must seek its enforcement or a subsequent employer must confirm its prior execution. The original (either in paper form or electronic form), or a legally enforceable facsimile that is retained in lieu of the original, such as microfiche, microfilm, computer disk, or electronic storage medium, must be retained for 50 years following its date of execution. For agreements executed by civilian employees of the United States Government, an agency may store the executed copy of the SF 312 and SF 189 in the United States Office of Personnel Management's Official Personnel Folder as a long-term (right side) document for that employee. An agency may permit its contractors, licensees, and grantees to retain the executed agreements of their employees during the time of employment. Upon the termination of employment, the contractors, licensee, or grantee shall deliver the original or legally enforceable facsimile of the executed SF 312, SF 189, or SF 189-A of that employee to the Government agency primarily responsible for his or her classified work. A contractor, licensee, or grantee of an agency participating in the National Industrial Security Program shall provide the copy or legally enforceable facsimile of the executed SF 312, SF 189, or SF 189-A of a terminated employee to their cognizant security office. Each agency shall inform ISOO of the file systems that it uses to store these agreements for each category of affected individuals.


(viii) Only the Director of National Intelligence, as the Security Executive Agent, may grant an agency's request for a waiver from the use of the SF 312. To apply for a waiver, an agency must submit its proposed alternative nondisclosure agreement to the Director of the Special Security Center (SSC), Office of the Director of National Intelligence, along with a justification for its use. The Director, SSC, shall request a determination about the alternative agreement's enforceability from the Department of Justice.


(ix) The national stock number for the SF 312 is 7540-01-280-5499.


(3) *SF 700, Security Container Information:* The SF 700 provides the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of employees who are to be contacted if the security container to which the form pertains is found open and unattended. The form also includes the means to maintain a current record of the security container's combination and provides the envelope to be used to forward this information to the appropriate agency activity or official. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a security container information form is required, the SF 700 shall be used. Parts 2 and 2A of each completed copy of SF 700 shall be classified at the highest level of classification of the information authorized for storage in the security container. A new SF 700 must be completed each time the combination to the security container is changed. The national stock number for the SF 700 is 7540-01-214-5372.


(4) *SF 701, Activity Security Checklist:* The SF 701 provides a systematic means to make a thorough end-of-day security inspection for a particular work area and to allow for employee accountability in the event that irregularities are discovered. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that an activity security checklist is required, the SF 701 will be used. Completion, storage, and disposition of SF 701 will be in accordance with each agency's security regulations. The national stock number for the SF 701 is 7540-01-213-7899.


(5) *SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet:* The SF 702 provides a record of the names and times that persons have opened, closed, or checked a particular container that holds classified information.

If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a CONFIDENTIAL label is required, the SF 708 will be used. The SF 708 is affixed to the medium containing Confidential information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. The national stock number of the SF 708 is 7540-01-207-5538.


(12) *SF 709, CLASSIFIED Label:* The SF 709 is used to identify and protect electronic media and other media that contain classified information pending a determination by the classifier of the specific classification level of the information. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a CLASSIFIED label is required, the SF 709 will be used. The SF 709 is affixed to the medium containing classified information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. When a classifier has made a determination of the specific level of classification of the information contained on the medium, either the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 shall be affixed on top of the SF 709 so that only the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 is visible.
