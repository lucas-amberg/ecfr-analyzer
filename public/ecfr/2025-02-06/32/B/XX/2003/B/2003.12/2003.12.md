# ยง 2003.12   Review of agency exemptions from automatic declassification under section 3.3 of the Order.

All classified records that are more than 25 years old and have been determined to have permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code, are automatically declassified whether or not the records have been reviewed. However, agency heads may exempt information that would otherwise fall into this category on specific bases set out in section 3.3 of the Order. The ISCAP reviews and approves, denies, or amends agency proposals to exempt such information from automatic declassification.


(a) *Agency notification of exemptions.* The agency head or designated senior agency official notifies the Executive Secretary of proposed agency exemptions in accordance with the requirements of the Order and its implementing directives. Agencies provide any additional information or justification that the Executive Secretary believes is necessary or helpful in order for the ISCAP to review and decide on the exemption.


(b) *Preparation of the exemptions files.* The Executive Secretary notifies the Chair of an agency's submission. At the direction of the ISCAP, the Executive Secretary supervises the preparation of an exemption file, pertinent portions of which are presented to the members of the Panel for review prior to a vote on the exemptions. The exemption file eventually includes all records pertaining to the ISCAP's consideration of the agency's exemptions.


(c) *Resolution.* The Panel may vote to approve an agency exemption, to deny an agency exemption, to amend an agency exemption, or to remand the matter to the agency for further consideration. A decision to deny or amend an agency exemption requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present.


(d) *Notification.* The Executive Secretary promptly notifies the designated senior agency official in writing of the Panel's decision.


(e) *Agency appeals.* Within 60 days of receipt of an ISCAP decision that denies or amends an agency exemption, the agency head may petition the President through the National Security Advisor to overrule the Panel's decision.


(f) *Protection of classified information.* All persons involved in the appeal will make every effort to minimize the inclusion of classified information in the appeal file. Any classified information contained in the exemption file is handled and protected in accordance with the Order and its implementing directives. Information that the agency maintains is exempt from declassification remains classified unless and until a final decision is made to declassify it.


(g) *Maintenance and disposition of file.* The Executive Secretary maintains the exemption file among the ISCAP's records in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207 (the Presidential Records Act).
