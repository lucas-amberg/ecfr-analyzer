# ยง 1.26-1   Purpose.

(a) The regulations in this subpart establish charges which shall be imposed by the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard sells supplies, equipment, apparatus, temporary shelter, and services under certain specified conditions as authorized by law. 


(b) These sales are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those instances which are ordinarily outside the scope of those distress services with which the Coast Guard is primarily concerned (14 U.S.C. 88), or the equipment and apparatus are not readily procurable in the open market.
