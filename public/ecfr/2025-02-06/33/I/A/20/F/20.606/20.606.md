# § 20.606   Protective orders.

(a) In considering a motion for an order of discovery—or a motion, by a party or other person from whom discovery is sought, to reconsider or amend an order of discovery—the ALJ may enter any order that justice requires, to protect a person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. This order may—


(1) Confine discovery to specific terms and conditions, such as a particular time and place;


(2) Confine discovery to a method other than that selected by the party seeking it;


(3) Preclude inquiry into certain matters;


(4) Direct that discovery occur with no one present except persons designated by the ALJ;


(5) Preclude the disclosure of a trade secret or other proprietary information, or allow its disclosure only in a designated way or only to designated persons; or


(6) Require that the person from whom discovery is sought file specific documents or information under seal for opening at the direction of the ALJ.


(b) When a person from whom discovery is sought seeks a protective order, the ALJ may let him or her make all or part of the showing of good cause *in camera.* The ALJ shall record any proceedings *in camera.* If he or she enters a protective order, he or she shall seal any proceedings so recorded. These shall be releasable only as required by law.


(c) Upon motion by a person from whom discovery is sought, the ALJ may—


(1) Restrict or defer disclosure by a party either of the name of a witness or, if the witness comes from the Coast Guard, of any prior statement of the witness; and


(2) Prescribe other appropriate measures to protect a witness.


(d) The ALJ will give any party an adequate opportunity to prepare for cross-examination or other presentation concerning witnesses and statement subject to protective orders.
