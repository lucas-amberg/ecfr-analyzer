# ยง 20.802   Admissibility of evidence.

(a) The ALJ may admit any relevant oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence, unless privileged. Relevant evidence is evidence tending to make the existence of any material fact more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.


(b) The ALJ may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice, by confusion of the issues, or by reasonable concern for undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
