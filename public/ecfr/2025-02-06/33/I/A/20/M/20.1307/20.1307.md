# § 20.1307   Use of judgments of conviction.

(a) A judgment of conviction by a Federal court is conclusive in any S&R proceeding under this part concerning any act or offense described in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704 when the act or offense is the same as in the Federal conviction.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no judgment of conviction by a State court is conclusive in any S&R proceeding under this part concerning any act or offense described in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704, even when an act or offense forming the basis of the charge in the proceeding is the same as in the State conviction. But the judgment is admissible in evidence and constitutes substantial evidence adverse to the respondent.


(c) A judgment of conviction by a Federal or State court for a violation is conclusive in the proceeding if an S&R proceeding alleges conviction for—


(1) A violation of a dangerous-drug law;


(2) An offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of a merchant mariner's license, merchant mariner credential, certificate of registry, or document; or


(3) An offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C.S. 401, note).


(d) If the respondent participates in the scheme of a State for the expungement of convictions, and if he or she pleads *guilty* or *no contest* or, by order of the trial court, has to attend classes, contribute time or money, receive treatment, submit to any manner of probation or supervision, or forgo appeal of the finding of the trial court, the Coast Guard regards him or her, for the purposes of 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704, as having received a conviction. The Coast Guard does not consider the conviction expunged without proof that the expungement is due to the conviction's having been in error.


(e) No respondent may challenge the jurisdiction of a Federal or State court in any proceeding under 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704.
