# § 5.45   Patrol sign.

(a) *Description.* The Auxiliary facility patrol sign has the words “Coast Guard Auxiliary Patrol” in black or dark blue lettering and must contain the Auxiliary emblem, as described in this subpart, centered within the confines of a broad diagonal red (Coast Guard red) stripe which is at a 70 degree angle rising toward the bow of the vessel. The red (Coast Guard red) stripe is followed, away from the bow, by two narrow, parallel stripes—first a white stripe, and then a medium blue (Coast Guard blue) stripe. The background of the sign must be white.


(b) *Display.* (1) The patrol sign must be displayed by vessels while on patrol, whether or not the vessel is underway.


(2) The patrol sign must be displayed on the forward half of each side and may be displayed on the stern of the vessel.


(3) The patrol sign may be displayed on each side of a motorized vehicle or trailer containing a mobile radio or radio direction finding unit while assigned to Coast Guard duty. Normally, they will be placed in any legal position on the upper half of both sides of the vehicle.
