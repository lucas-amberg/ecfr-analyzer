# § 5.46   Auxiliary patrol ensign.

(a) *Description.* The field of the Auxiliary patrol ensign is white. A medium blue (Coast Guard blue) Coast Guard Auxiliary emblem is centered on a broad diagonal red (Coast Guard red) slash which is at a 70 degree angle, rising toward the hoist. The red (Coast Guard red) slash is followed, away from the hoist, by two narrow, parallel stripes—first a white stripe, and then a medium blue (Coast Guard blue) stripe. The entire design is centered on the ensign.


(b) *Display.* Vessels that have been accepted as facilities shall display the Auxiliary patrol ensign when on patrol, whether or not the vessel is underway. The Auxiliary patrol ensign must be displayed at the mast head or from the most conspicuous hoist.
