The Coast Guard conducts a program for appointing qualified men and women as cadets who are admitted to the Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut. The Superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy tenders appointments on the basis of previous academic performance, reported College Entrance Examination Board or American College Testing scores, and the findings of a Cadet Candidate Evaluation Board, consisting of Coast Guard officers appointed by the Superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy, which reviews each applicant's personal qualifications. In addition, a Service Academy Medical Examination must be satisfactorily completed before appointment. Applications must be submitted online at *http://www.uscga.edu* using Coast Guard forms CGA-14, CGA-14A, CGA-14B, CGA-14C, and CGA-14D.
