# ยง 51.3   Applicability and scope.

The provisions of this part apply to the United States Coast Guard including reserve-components and all former members who have been discharged within 15 years of the date upon which application for review is received by the DRB. A former member may apply to the DRB for a change in the character of, and/or the reason for, the discharge. The Coast Guard DRB review is generally applicable only to administrative discharges, however, the DRB may review the discharge of a former member by sentence of a court-martial for the purpose of clemency. A petition for clemency will not be considered by the DRB unless the applicant has exhausted all appellate remedies. Upon a petition for clemency, the DRB shall consider only the equity of the discharge awarded.
