# § 64.13   Approval for waiver of markings.

(a) Owners and/or operators of sunken vessels, rafts or other craft sunk in navigable waters may apply to the District Commander, in whose jurisdiction the vessel, raft, or other craft is located, for a waiver of the requirement to mark them with a light at night as required under § 64.11(a) of this subpart. Information on how to contact the District Commander is available at *http://www.uscg.mil/top/units.*

(b) The District Commander may grant a waiver if it is determined that—


(1) Marking the wrecked vessel, raft or other craft with a light at night would be impractical, and


(2) The granting of such a waiver would not create an undue hazard to navigation.
