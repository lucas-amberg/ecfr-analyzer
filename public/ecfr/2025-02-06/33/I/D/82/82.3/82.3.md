# § 82.3   Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit.

Rule 24(b) of the 72 COLREGS states that when a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, they are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights under Rule 23. A “composite unit” is interpreted to be a pushing vessel that is rigidly connected by mechanical means to a vessel being pushed so they react to sea and swell as one vessel. “Mechanical means” does not include the following:


(a) Lines.


(b) Hawsers.


(c) Wires.


(d) Chains.
