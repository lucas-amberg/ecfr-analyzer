(i) An annual verification audit, as described in § 96.330(f) of this part, and


(ii) An intermediate verification audit, as described in § 96.340(e)(2) of this part.


(b) A satisfactory audit means that the auditor(s) agrees that the requirements of this part are met, based on review and verification of the procedures and documents that make up the safety management system.


(c) Actions required during safety management audits for a company and their U.S. vessel(s) are—


(1) Review and verify the procedures and documents that make up a safety management system, as defined in subpart B of this part.


(2) Make sure the audit complies with this subpart and is consistent with IMO Resolution A.788(19), Guidelines on Implementation of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code by Administrations.


(3) Make sure the audit is carried out by a team of Coast Guard auditors or auditors assigned by a recognized organization authorized to complete such actions by subpart D of this part.


(d) Safety management audits for a company and their U.S. vessel(s) are required—


(1) Before issuing or renewing a Document of Compliance certificate, and to keep a Document of Compliance certificate valid, as described in §§ 96.330 and 96.340 of this part.


(2) Before issuing or renewing a Safety Management Certificate, and to maintain the validity of a Safety Management Certificate, as described in § 96.340 of this part.
