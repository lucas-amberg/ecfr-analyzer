# ยง 96.495   How can I appeal a decision made by an authorized organization?

(a) A responsible person may appeal a decision made by an authorized organization by mailing or delivering to the organization a written request for reconsideration. Within 30 days of receiving your request, the authorized organization must rule on it and send you a written response. They must also send a copy of their response to the Commandant (CG-CVC), Attn: Office of Commercial Vessel Compliance, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7501, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7501.


(b) If you are not satisfied with the organization's decision, you may appeal directly to Commandant (CG-CVC). You must make your appeal in writing, including any documentation and evidence you wish to be considered. You may ask Commandant (CG-CVC) to stay the effect of the appealed decision while it is under review.


(c) The Commandant (CG-CVC) will make a decision on your appeal and send you a response in writing. That decision will be the final Coast Guard action on your request.
