# ยง 101.100   Purpose.

(a) The purpose of this subchapter is:


(1) To implement portions of the maritime security regime required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, as codified in 46 U.S.C. Chapter 701;


(2) To align, where appropriate, the requirements of domestic maritime security regulations with the international maritime security standards in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS Chapter XI-2) and the International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities, parts A and B, adopted on 12 December 2002; and


(3) To ensure security arrangements are as compatible as possible for vessels trading internationally.


(b) For those maritime elements of the national transportation system where international standards do not directly apply, the requirements in this subchapter emphasize cooperation and coordination with local port community stakeholders, and are based on existing domestic standards, as well as established industry security practices.


(c) The assessments and plans required by this subchapter are intended for use in implementing security measures at various MARSEC Levels. The specific security measures and their implementation are planning criteria based on a set of assumptions made during the development of the security assessment and plan. These assumptions may not exist during an actual transportation security incident.
