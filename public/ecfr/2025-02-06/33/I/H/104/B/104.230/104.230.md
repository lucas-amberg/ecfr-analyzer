# ยง 104.230   Drill and exercise requirements.

(a) *General.* (1) Drills and exercises must test the proficiency of vessel personnel in assigned security duties at all Maritime Security (MARSEC) Levels and the effective implementation of the Vessel Security Plan (VSP). They must enable the Vessel Security Officer (VSO) to identify any related security deficiencies that need to be addressed. 


(2) A drill or exercise required by this section may be satisfied with the implementation of security measures required by the Vessel Security Plan as the result of an increase in the MARSEC Level, provided the vessel reports attainment to the cognizant COTP. 


(b) *Drills.* (1) The VSO must ensure that at least one security drill is conducted at least every 3 months, except when a vessel is out of service due to repairs or seasonal suspension of operation provided that in such cases a drill must be conducted within one week of the vessel's reactivation. Security drills may be held in conjunction with non-security drills where appropriate.


(2) Drills must test individual elements of the VSP, including response to security threats and incidents. Drills should take into account the types of operations of the vessel, vessel personnel changes, and other relevant circumstances. Examples of drills include unauthorized entry to a restricted area, response to alarms, and notification of law enforcement authorities.


(3) If the vessel is moored at a facility on the date the facility has planned to conduct any drills, the vessel may, but is not required to, participate in the facility's scheduled drill.


(4) Drills must be conducted within one week from whenever the percentage of vessel personnel with no prior participation in a vessel security drill on that vessel exceeds 25 percent.


(5) Not withstanding paragraph (b)(4) of this section, vessels not subject to SOLAS may conduct drills within 1 week from whenever the percentage of vessel personnel with no prior participation in a vessel security drill on a vessel of similar design and owned or operated by the same company exceeds 25 percent. 


(c) *Exercises.* (1) Exercises must be conducted at least once each calendar year, with no more than 18 months between exercises.


(2) Exercises may be:


(i) Full scale or live;


(ii) Tabletop simulation or seminar;


(iii) Combined with other appropriate exercises; or


(iv) A combination of the elements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(3) Exercises may be vessel-specific or part of a cooperative exercise program to exercise applicable facility and vessel security plans or comprehensive port exercises.


(4) Each exercise must test communication and notification procedures, and elements of coordination, resource availability, and response.


(5) Exercises are a full test of the security program and must include the substantial and active participation of relevant company and vessel security personnel, and may include facility security personnel and government authorities depending on the scope and the nature of the exercises.
