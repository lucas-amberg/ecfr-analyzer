(a) *General.* (1) The vessel owner or operator must ensure the implementation of security measures and have the capability to continuously monitor, through a combination of lighting, watchkeepers, security guards, deck watches, waterborne patrols, automatic intrusion-detection devices, or surveillance equipment, as specified in their approved Vessel Security Plan (VSP), the—


(i) Vessel;


(ii) Restricted areas on board the vessel; and


(iii) Area surrounding the vessel.


(2) The following must be considered when establishing the appropriate level and location of lighting:


(i) Vessel personnel should be able to detect activities on and around the vessel, on both the shore side and the waterside;


(ii) Coverage should facilitate personnel identification at access points;


(iii) Coverage may be provided through coordination with the port or facility; and


(iv) Lighting effects, such as glare, and its impact on safety, navigation, and other security activities.


(b) *Maritime Security (MARSEC) Level 1.* At MARSEC Level 1, the vessel owner or operator must ensure the implementation of security measures, which may be done in coordination with a facility, to:


(1) Monitor the vessel, particularly vessel access points and restricted areas;


(2) Be able to conduct emergency searches of the vessel;


(3) Ensure that equipment or system failures or malfunctions are identified and corrected;


(4) Ensure that any automatic intrusion detection device sets off an audible or visual alarm, or both, at a location that is continuously attended or monitored;


(5) Light deck and vessel access points during the period between sunset and sunrise and periods of limited visibility sufficiently to allow visual identification of persons seeking access to the vessel; and


(6) Use maximum available lighting while underway, during the period between sunset and sunrise, consistent with safety and international regulations.


(c) *MARSEC Level 2.* In addition to the security measures required for MARSEC Level 1 in this section, at MARSEC Level 2, the vessel owner or operator must also ensure the implementation of additional security measures, as specified for MARSEC Level 2 in the approved VSP. These additional security measures may include:

These additional security measures may include:


(1) Cooperating with responders and facilities;


(2) Switching on all lights;


(3) Illuminating the vicinity of the vessel;


(4) Switching on all surveillance equipment capable of recording activities on, or in the vicinity of, the vessel;


(5) Maximizing the length of time such surveillance equipment can continue to record;


(6) Preparing for underwater inspection of the hull; and


(7) Initiating measures, including the slow revolution of the vessel's propellers, if practicable, to deter underwater access to the hull of the vessel.
