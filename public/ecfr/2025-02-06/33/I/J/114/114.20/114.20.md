# ยง 114.20   Departure from permit plans.

(a) If the final inspection shows a minor departure from the authorized plans which does not materially affect navigation, the permittee will be required to furnish as-built plans showing the work as actually constructed but no further action will be taken by the Coast Guard. 


(b) It is not the practice of the Coast Guard to issue letters certifying that completed work conforms to that which was authorized. That question is a matter of fact to be determined in case of controversy by the usual rules of court procedure.
