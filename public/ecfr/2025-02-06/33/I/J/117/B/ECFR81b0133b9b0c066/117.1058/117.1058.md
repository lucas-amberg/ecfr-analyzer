# ยง 117.1058   Snake River.

(a) The draw of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad bridge across the Snake River at mile 1.5 between Pasco and Burbank is automated and is normally maintained in the fully open to navigation position. 


(b) *Lights.* All lights required for automated operation shall be visible for a distance of at least 2 miles and shall be displayed at all times, day and night. 


(1) When the draw is fully open, a steady green light shall be displayed at the center of the drawspan on both upstream and downstream sides. 


(2) When the draw is not fully open, a steady red light shall be displayed at the center of the drawspan on both upstream and downstream sides. 


(3) When the draw is about to close, flashing yellow lights in the form of a down-pointing arrow shall be displayed at the center of the drawspan on both upstream and downstream sides. 


(4) A similar set of red, green, and yellow lights shall be displayed on a remote lighting panel located near the north end, upstream side, of the Washington State highway bridge at mile 2.2. These lights shall be synchronized with the lights on the railroad bridge and shall be visible to vessels traveling downstream throughout the passage of the channel adjacent to Strawberry Island. 


(c) *Operation.* When a train approaches the bridge, the yellow lights shall start flashing. After an eight-minute delay, the green lights shall change to red, the drawspan shall lower and lock, and the yellow lights shall be extinguished. Red lights shall continue to be displayed until the train has crossed and the drawspan is again in the fully open position. At that time, the red lights shall change green. 


(d) Vessels equipped with radiotelephones may contact Burlington Northern Santa Fe to obtain information on the status of the bridge. Bridge status information also may be obtained by calling the commercial telephone number posted at the drawspan of the bridge.
