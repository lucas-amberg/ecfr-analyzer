# ยง 117.299   Loxahatchee River.

The draw of the Florida East Coast Railway bridge across the Loxahatchee River, mile 1.2 at Jupiter, operates as follows:


(a) The bridge is not constantly tended.


(b) The draw is normally in the fully open position, displaying flashing green lights to indicate that vessels may pass.


(c) When a train approaches, the lights go to flashing red and a horn starts four blasts, pauses, and then continues four blasts. After an eight minute delay, the draw lowers and locks, providing the scanning equipment reveals nothing under the draw. The draw remains down for a period of eight minutes or while the approach track circuit is occupied.


(d) After the train has cleared, the draw opens and the lights return to flashing green.
