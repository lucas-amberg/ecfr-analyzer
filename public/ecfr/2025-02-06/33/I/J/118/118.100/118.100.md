The District Commander may require or authorize the display of high intensity red or green retroreflective panels when the District Commander finds it necessary: 


(a) To better identify a hazardous pier.


(b) To provide a backup for red pier lights, red channel margin lights, and green mid channel lights, which are subject to vandalism or otherwise difficult to properly maintain. If the District Commander determines that the nominal nighttime visibility required is less than one-half mile, the panels must be at least six inches square. If the visibility required is more than one-half mile, the panels must be at least 12 inches square.


(c) To mark bridge piers or channel sides on bridges not required to have bridge lighting. Lateral significant red triangles and green square retroreflective panels shall be used. The panels shall be at least 36 square inches in area to provide a nominal nighttime visibility distance of at least one-half mile.
