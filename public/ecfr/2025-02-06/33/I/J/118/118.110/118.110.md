# § 118.110   Daymarks and lateral lighting on bridges.

(a) The District Commander may require or authorize the marking of the margins of navigation channels through bridges with U.S. aids to navigation system lateral marks and lights installed on the superstructure or on the channel piers. The District Commander may also require or authorize the use of quick flashing, flashing, isophase or occulting red and green lights to mark the main channels. 


(b) If lateral system lights are required or authorized to mark the main navigation channels, fixed yellow lights shall be used to mark the adjacent piers and the centerline of the channel shall be marked with the standard lateral system safe water mark and occulting white light, instead of the lights prescribed in § 118.65.


(c) The District Commander may require or authorize the marking of the centerline of the navigation channel drawspan of floating drawbridges with a special mark, diamond in shape, yellow in color, and with a high intensity retroreflective material border. The District Commander may require or authorize the mark to exhibit a flashing yellow light Morse Code “B” characteristic. The mark may not be visible when the drawspan is in the open position.
