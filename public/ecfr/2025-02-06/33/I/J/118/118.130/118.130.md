# ยง 118.130   Fog signals.

On waterways where visibility is frequently reduced due to fog or other causes, the District Commander may require or authorize the installation of one or more fog signals to warn the navigator of the presence of the bridge. The fog signals must conform to the installation, range, and sound frequencies provisions in Subpart 67.10 of Part 67 of this chapter. If more than one fog signal is installed on a bridge or in the vicinity, their characteristics must be different to distinguish each signal. The fog signals must be directional to the fullest extent possible to minimize adverse impact on local residents.
