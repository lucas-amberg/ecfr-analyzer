# § 118.70   Lights on swing bridges.

(a) *Swing span lights on through bridges.* Each swing span of every through swing bridge shall be lighted with three lanterns so that when viewed from an approaching vessel the swing span when closed will display three red lights on top of the span structure, one at each end of the span on the same level and one at the center of the span no less than 10 feet above the other two lights, and when open for navigation will display three green lights on top of the span structure in a line parallel to and directly above the long axis of the span, one at each end of the span on the same level, and one at the center of the span no less than 10 feet above the other two lights. Each lantern shall show through alternate red and green horizontal arcs of 60° each, the axis of adjacent arcs to be 90° from each other; each light shall be securely mounted with the axis of the green arcs parallel to the long axis of the swing span. 


(b) *Swing span lights on deck and half-through bridges.* Each swing span of every deck, half-through, girder, or similar type swing bridge shall be lighted with four lanterns so that when viewed from an approaching vessel the swing span when closed will display one red light at each end, and when open to navigation will display two green lights from each end. Each lantern shall show through one red and two green horizontal arcs of 60° each, the axis of each green arc to be 90° from the axis of the red arc; each light shall be securely mounted at the floor level of the span as near to the side of the span as practicable with the axis of the red light normal to the long axis of the swing span and so that the red light will be visible from an approaching vessel when the span is closed. 


(c) *Pier lights.* Every swing bridge shall be lighted so that each end of the piers adjacent to the navigable channel (draw piers) or each end of their protection piers (draw pier protection piers) and each end of the piers protecting the pivot pier (pivot protection pier) will be marked by a red light. Each of these lights shall show through a horizontal arc of 180° and shall be mounted as low as practicable below the floor level of the swing span to show 90° on either side of a line parallel to the axis of the channel so as to be visible from an approaching vessel. 


(d) *Axis lights.* Every swing bridge shall be lighted so that the intersection of the bridge axis with each side of the pivot pier and the channel side of each draw pier which has a protection pier will be marked by a red light: *Provided,* That if the draw and draw protection piers are straight along their channel faces these lights shall not be required. Each such light shall show through a horizontal arc of 180°, and shall be mounted on the navigable channel face of the pier as low as practicable below the floor level of the swing span to show 90° either side of a line normal to the axis of the navigable channel so as to be visible from an approaching vessel. 


(e) *Omission of lights.* Where the permanent navigable channel passes on only one side of the pivot pier of any swing span, the District Commander may authorize the omission of lighting of the unused channel.
