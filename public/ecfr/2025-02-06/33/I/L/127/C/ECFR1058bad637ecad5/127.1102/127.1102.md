# § 127.1102   Transfer hoses and loading arms.

(a) Each hose within the marine transfer area for LHG used for the transfer of LHG or its vapors to or from a vessel must—


(1) Be made of materials resistant to each LHG transferred, in both the liquid and vapor state (if wire braid is used for reinforcement, the wire must be of corrosion-resistant material, such as stainless steel);


(2) Be constructed to withstand the temperature and pressure foreseeable during transfer, with a MAWP not less than the maximum pressure to which it may be subjected and at least 1030 kPa gauge (149.4 psig);


(3) Be designed for a minimum bursting pressure of a least five times the MAWP;


(4) Have—


(i) Full-threaded connections;


(ii) Flanges that meet ASME B16.5-2020 (incorporated by reference, see § 127.003); or 


(iii) Quick connect couplings that are acceptable to the Commandant;


(5) Be adequately supported against the weight of its constituent parts, the LHG, and any ice formed on it; 


(6) Have no kinks, bulges, soft spots, or other defects that will let it leak or burst under normal working pressure; and 


(7) Have a permanently attached nameplate that indicates, or otherwise be permanently marked to indicate—


(i) Each LHG for which it is suitable;


(ii) Its MAWP at the corresponding service temperature; and 


(iii) If used for service at other than ambient temperature, its minimum service temperature.


(b) Each loading arm used for the transfer of LHG or its vapor must—


(1) Be made of materials resistant to each LHG transferred, in both the liquid and vapor state;


(2) Be constructed to withstand the temperature and pressure foreseeable during transfer;


(3) Be adequately supported against the weight of its constituent parts, the LHG, and any ice formed on it;


(4) Be provided with an alarm to indicate when it is approaching the limits of its extension, unless the examined Operations Manual requires a person to perform the same function; and


(5) Have a permanently attached nameplate that indicates, or otherwise be permanently marked to indicate—


(i) Each LHG it may handle;


(ii) Its MAWP at the corresponding service temperature; and,


(iii) If it is used for service at other than ambient temperature, its minimum service temperature.
