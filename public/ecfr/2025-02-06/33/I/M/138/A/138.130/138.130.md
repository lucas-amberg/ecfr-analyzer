# § 138.130   Agents for Service of process.

(a) *Designation of U.S. agents for service of process.* Each COFR Operator and guarantor must designate on the forms submitted a person located in the United States as its U.S. agent for service of process and (in the event of an incident, a release, or both) for receipt of notices of source designation, claims presented under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, and lawsuits brought under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both.


(b) *U.S. agent for service of process acknowledgment.* Each U.S. agent for service of process designated under paragraph (a) must acknowledge the agency designation in writing unless the agent has already submitted a written master (that is, blanket) agency acknowledgment to the Director showing that the agent has agreed in advance to act as the U.S. agent for service of process for the COFR Operator or guarantor in question.


(c) *How to change the U.S. agent for service of process.* A COFR Operator or guarantor may change a designated U.S. agent for service of process, at any time and for any reason, by submitting a new U.S. agent for service of process designation in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (a), and by causing the new U.S. agent for service of process to submit the agency acknowledgment required by paragraph (b) of this section.


(d) *Replacement of unavailable U.S. agent for service of process.* In the event a designated U.S. agent for service of process becomes unavailable at any time, for any reason, the COFR Operator or guarantor must designate a new U.S. agent for service of process in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (a), within 5 days of the COFR Operator or guarantor becoming aware of such unavailability. In addition, the new U.S. agent for service of process must submit to the Director the agency acknowledgment required by paragraph (b) of this section.


(e) *Service on the Director.* If a designated U.S. agent for service of process cannot be served, then service of process on the Director, as provided in this paragraph, will constitute valid service of process on the COFR Operator or guarantor. Service of process on the Director will not be effective unless the server—


(1) Has sent a copy of each document served on the Director to the COFR Operator or guarantor, as applicable, by registered mail, at the COFR Operator or guarantor's last known address on file with the Director;


(2) Indicates, at the time process is served upon the Director, that the purpose of the mailing is to effect service of process on the COFR Operator or guarantor; and


(3) Provides evidence acceptable to the Director at the time process is served upon the Director, that service was attempted on the designated U.S. agent for service of process but failed, stating the reasons why service on the U.S. agent for service of process was not possible, and that the document was sent to the COFR Operator or guarantor, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
