# § 138.50   How to apply vessel gross tonnages.

(a) *Purpose.* This section sets forth the methods for applying vessel gross tonnage to—


(1) Determine whether a vessel exceeds the 100 or 300 gross ton threshold under § 138.20 and OPA 90, CERCLA, or both;


(2) Calculate the OPA 90 and CERCLA applicable amounts of financial responsibility required, as provided in § 138.100; and


(3) Determine the OPA 90 limit of liability under subpart B of this part in the event of an oil pollution incident, and the CERCLA limit of liability under 42 U.S.C. 9607 in the event of a hazardous substance release.


(b) *Both GT ITC and GRT assigned.* For a vessel assigned both gross tonnage ITC (GT ITC) and gross register tonnage (GRT) under 46 CFR part 69, apply the tonnage thresholds in § 138.20 using the assigned GRT tonnage, and determine the applicable amounts of financial responsibility and the limits of liability using the assigned GT ITC tonnage.


(c) *GT ITC or GRT assigned.* For a vessel assigned only a GT ITC or a GRT tonnage under 46 CFR part 69, apply the tonnage thresholds in § 138.20, and determine the applicable amounts of evidence of financial responsibility and the limits of liability using the assigned GT ITC or GRT tonnage.


(d) *High or low GRT assigned.* For a vessel assigned a high and low GRT tonnage under 46 CFR part 69, subpart D (Dual Regulatory Measurement System), apply the tonnage thresholds in § 138.20, and determine the applicable amounts of financial responsibility and the limits of liability, using the high GRT tonnage.


(e) *Summary.* The use of assigned gross tonnages, as required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, is summarized in the following table.


(f) *Certified gross tonnage governs.* In the event of an incident or release, the responsible parties and guarantors are governed by the vessel's assigned gross tonnage on the date of the incident. This is as determined under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section and evidenced on the appropriate tonnage certifying document as provided for under the U.S. tonnage regulations or international conventions (for example, tonnage certificate or completed Simplified measurement application, International Tonnage Certificate (1969)), regardless of what gross tonnage is specified in the Application or guaranty form submitted under this subpart, except when the responsible parties or guarantors knew or should have known that the tonnage certificate information was incorrect (see also § 138.110(h)(1)(iii)).


(g) *Requirement to present tonnage certifying document(s).* Each COFR Operator must submit to the Director, or other authorized United States Government official, upon request, for examination and copying, the original or an unaltered and legible electronic copy of the vessel's applicable tonnage certifying document(s).
