# § 138.80   Applying for COFRs.

(a) *How to apply for a COFR.* To apply for a COFR of any type, the COFR Operator must—


(1) Submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Director, by one of the submission methods provided in § 138.60(c):


(i) An Application;


(A) For an Individual Certificate, list the name of the covered vessel, and the vessel's gross tonnage information, including the measurement system(s) used on the application;


(B) For a Fleet Certificate, instead of listing each individual barge, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Fleet Certificate. The largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT GROSS TONNAGE] GRT”; and


(C) For a Master Certificate, instead of listing each individual vessel, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Master Certificate. The largest tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable. The largest vessel other than a tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable.”


(ii) The evidence of financial responsibility using one of the guaranty methods provided in § 138.110;


(A) For a Fleet Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount, determined as provided in § 138.100, for the largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered.


(B) For a Master Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount determined as provided in § 138.100 for the largest tank vessel and largest non-tank vessel to be covered by the Master Certificate.


(iii) The agent for service of process designations required by § 138.130; and


(iv) All other supporting documentation required by this subpart.


(A) At the time of Application for a Master Certificate, the COFR Operator must submit a report to the Director, indicating: the name; previous name, if applicable; type; gross tonnage and measurement system(s) used, for each vessel covered by the Master Certificate, indicating which vessels, if any, are tank vessels. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT tonnage, specify both gross tonnages.


(B) Six months after receiving a Master Certificate, and every 6 months thereafter, each COFR Operator must submit to the Director, an updated report, separately listing the vessels no longer covered by that Master Certificate. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT, both gross tonnages must be specified. If a vessel has been transferred to another responsible party and the COFR Operator to whom the Master Certificate was issued ceases to be the vessel's operator, the COFR Operator must report the date and place of the transfer, and the name and contact information of the responsible party to whom the vessel was transferred. If the vessels covered by the Master Certificate have not changed from the previous report, the COFR Operator may submit an updated report that indicates no change from previous report.


(2) Pay, or cause to be paid, all fees required by § 138.120.


(b) *Application deadline.* The Director must receive the Application, evidence of financial responsibility, and other required supporting documentation, at least 21 days prior to the date the Certificate is required. The COFR Operator may seek an exception to the 21-day submission deadline only as provided in § 138.60(e)(3).


(c) *Where to obtain Application forms.* COFR Operators may create an Application using the online eCOFR web process (located at *https://npfc.uscg.mil/cofr/default.aspx*) or, if not using eCOFR, may obtain an “Application for Vessel Certificate of Financial Responsibility (Water Pollution)” at the same website.


(d) *Requirement to verify, or sign and date, the Application.* (1) The COFR Operator must complete and either verify the Application in eCOFR as provided in § 138.60(c)(1)(i) or, if not using eCOFR, sign and date the hard-copy signature page of the Application and submit the signed Application to the Director, by one of the methods specified in § 138.60(c)(1)(ii) through (iv).


(2) The Application must include the title of the person signing it.


(3) If the person signing the Application is acting under a Power of Attorney, they must include a copy of the Power of Attorney with the Application.


(e) *Requirement to update Applications.* The COFR Operator must report any changes to the Application to the Director in writing, no later than 5 business days after discovery of the change. The Director may require that the COFR Operator submit a revised Application and provide additional evidence of financial responsibility, and pay any additional fees required by § 138.120.


(f) *Amending Fleet and Master Certificates.* Before operating a barge or vessel that exceeds the maximum gross tonnage indicated on the COFR, the COFR Operator must:


(1) Submit a new or amended Application, or a written request to supplement the Application, to reflect the new maximum gross tonnages on the COFR;


(2) Unless the COFR Operator qualifies as a self-insurer at the higher total applicable amount, submit, or cause to be submitted, evidence of financial responsibility using one of the guaranty methods provided in § 138.110 to the Director, demonstrating increased coverage based on the new maximum gross tonnage; and


(3) Pay a new certification fee, as required by § 138.120.
