# § 142.90   Lockout and tagout.

(a) While repair or other work is being performed on equipment powered by an external source, that equipment must be locked out as required in paragraph (b) of this section or, if a lockout provision does not exist on the equipment, must be disconnected from the power source or otherwise deactivated, unless the nature of the work being performed necessitates that the power be connected or the equipment activated.

(1) That equipment is being worked on; and


(2) If the power source is disconnected or the equipment deactivated, that the power source must not be connected or the equipment activated.
