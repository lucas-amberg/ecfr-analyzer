# ยง 143.120   Floating OCS facilities.

(a) Before construction is started on a proposed floating OCS facility, the owner or operator of the facility must submit to the Coast Guard for approval all plans and information listed in subpart C of 46 CFR part 107 which relate to the facility. All plans and information must be submitted according to the procedures in that subpart.


(b) The facility must comply with the requirements of subchapters F (Marine Engineering) and J (Electrical Engineering) of 46 CFR chapter I and 46 CFR part 108 (Design and Equipment). Where unusual design or equipment needs make compliance impracticable, alternative proposals that provide an equivalent level of safety may be accepted. These requirements do not apply to production systems on the facility.


(c) The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, determines whether a floating OCS facility meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and issues a certificate of inspection for each facility which meets these requirements. Inspection of the facility may be required as part of this determination. 


(d) Each floating OCS facility that is constructed after April 2, 2018 must comply with the requirements of 46 CFR subpart 111.108 prior to engaging in OCS activities.
