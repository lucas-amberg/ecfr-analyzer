Item (8) is also not required except as pursuant to the laws on vessel entry (19 U.S.C. 1434) and clearance (46 U.S.C. 60105). Vessel owners and operators should protect any personal information they gather in preparing notices for transmittal to the NVMC so as to prevent unauthorized disclosure of that information;

(3) If any person onboard, including a crewmember, is not required to carry a passport for travel, then passport information required in Table 160.206, items (4)(iv) through (vi), and (5)(iv) through (vi), need not be provided for that person.


(c) *Updates to a submitted NOA.* Unless otherwise specified in this section, whenever the most recently submitted NOA information becomes inaccurate, the owner or operator of that vessel must revise and re-submit the NOA within the times required in paragraph (e) of this section. An owner or operator does not need to revise and re-submit an NOA for the following:


(1) A change in submitted arrival time that is less than 6 hours;


(2) Changes in the location, latitude and longitude, of the vessel from the location at the time the NOA was reported; or


(3) Changes to personnel positions or duties on the vessel.


(d) *Methods of submission.* The notice must be submitted to the NVMC by electronic Notice of Arrival and Departure format using methods specified at the NVMC's Web site at *http://www.nvmc.uscg.gov/.*

(e) *Required reporting time of an NOA update.* The owner or operator of each vessel subject to this section must submit an NOA update:


(1) If the most recently submitted NOA, or NOA update, differs by 24 hours or more from the current estimated time of arrival, the owner or operator of the vessel must provide an update as soon as practicable but at least 24 hours before the vessel arrives at the OCS location where the owner or operator plans to perform OCS activities;


(2) If the most recently submitted NOA, or NOA update, differs by less than 24 hours from the current estimated time of arrival, the owner or operator of the vessel must provide an update as soon as practicable but at least 12 hours before the vessel arrives at the OCS location where the owner or operator plans to perform OCS activities; or


(3) If the remaining voyage time is less than 24 hours, the owner or operator of the vessel must provide an update as soon as practicable, but at least 12 hours before the vessel arrives at a place on the OCS.


(f) *Towing vessels.* When a towing vessel controls a vessel required to submit an NOA under this subpart, the owner or operator of the towing vessel, or lead towing vessel if there is more than one, is responsible for submitting only one NOA containing the information required for the towing vessels and the vessel under its control.


(g) This section does not apply to vessels merely transiting the waters superjacent to the OCS and not engaged in OCS activities.
