# ยง 148.221   How do I claim, or object to a claim, that required information is privileged?

(a) Any person may claim that specific information required pursuant to this part should be withheld because it is privileged, and any person can object to that claim.


(b) Requests or objections must be submitted to the Commandant (CG-5P) in writing, with sufficient specificity to identify the information at issue, and to show why it should or should not be considered privileged.


(c) The Commandant (CG-5P) determines whether to grant or deny a claim of privilege.


(d) Submission of a claim stays any deadline for providing the information at issue, unless the claim is made pursuant to the protection for confidential information that is provided by 33 U.S.C. 1513(b), in which case deadlines are not stayed. The Commandant (CG-5P) may also determine that the information at issue is so material that processing of the application must be suspended pending the determination of the claim.
