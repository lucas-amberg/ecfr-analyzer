(iii) Not an affiliate of a person engaged in producing, refining, or marketing oil; and then


(3) Any other applicant.


(b) MARAD may also approve one of the proposed deepwater ports if it determines that that deepwater port will best serve the national interest. In making this determination, MARAD considers:


(1) The degree to which each deepwater port will affect the environment, as determined under the review criteria in subpart G to this part;


(2) The differences between the anticipated completion dates of the deepwater ports; and


(3) The differences in costs for construction and operation of the deepwater ports that would be passed on to consumers of oil.


(c) This section does not apply to applications for natural gas deepwater ports.
