# ยง 148.720   What are the siting criteria?

In accordance with ยง 148.715(b), the proposed and alternative sites for the deepwater port will be evaluated on the basis of how well each:


(a) Optimizes location to prevent or minimize detrimental environmental effects;


(b) Minimizes the space needed for safe and efficient operation;


(c) Locates offshore components in areas with stable sea bottom characteristics;


(d) Locates onshore components where stable foundations can be developed;


(e) Minimizes the potential for interference with its safe operation from existing offshore structures and activities;


(f) Minimizes the danger posed to safe navigation by surrounding water depths and currents;


(g) Avoids extensive dredging or removal of natural obstacles such as reefs;


(h) Minimizes the danger to the deepwater port, its components, and tankers calling at the deepwater port from storms, earthquakes, or other natural hazards;


(i) Maximizes the permitted use of existing work areas, facilities, and access routes;


(j) Minimizes the environmental impact of temporary work areas, facilities, and access routes;


(k) Maximizes the distance between the deepwater port, its components, and critical habitats including commercial and sport fisheries, threatened or endangered species habitats, wetlands, flood plains, coastal resources, marine management areas, and essential fish habitats;


(l) Minimizes the displacement of existing or potential mining, oil, or gas exploration and production or transportation uses;


(m) Takes advantage of areas already allocated for similar use, without overusing such areas;


(n) Avoids permanent interference with natural processes or features that are important to natural currents and wave patterns; and


(o) Avoids dredging in areas where sediments contain high levels of heavy metals, biocides, oil or other pollutants or hazardous materials, and in areas designated wetlands or other protected coastal resources.
