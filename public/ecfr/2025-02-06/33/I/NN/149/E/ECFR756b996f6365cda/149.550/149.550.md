Hose strings that are floating or supported on trestles must display the following lights at night and during periods of restricted visibility:


(a) One row of yellow lights that must be:


(1) Flashing 50 to 70 times per minute;


(2) Visible all around the horizon;


(3) Visible for at least 2 miles (3.7 km) on a clear, dark night;


(4) Not less than 1 or more than 3.5 meters (3 to 11.5 feet) above the water;


(5) Approximately equally spaced;


(6) Not more than 10 meters (32.8 feet) apart where the hose string crosses a navigable channel; and


(7) Where the hose string does not cross a navigable channel, there must be a sufficient number to clearly show the hose string's length and course.


(b) Two red lights at each end of the hose string, including the ends in a channel where the hose string is separated to allow vessels to pass, whether open or closed. The lights must be:


(1) Visible all around the horizon;


(2) Visible for at least 2 miles (3.7 km) on a clear, dark night; and


(3) One meter (3 feet) apart in a vertical line with the lower light at the same height above the water as the flashing yellow light.
