# § 151.23   Inspection for compliance and enforcement.

(a) While at a port or terminal under the jurisdiction of the United States, a ship is subject to inspection by the Coast Guard—


(1) To determine that a valid IOPP Certificate is on board and that the condition of the ship and its equipment corresponds substantially with the particulars of the IOPP Certificate;


(2) To determine that evidence of compliance with MARPOL 73/78, as required by § 151.21 is on board and that the condition of the ship and its equipment corresponds substantially with the particulars of this evidence of compliance;


(3) To determine whether a ship has been operating in accordance with and has not discharged any oil or oily mixtures in violation of the provisions of MARPOL 73/78 or this subchapter;


(4) To determine whether a ship has discharged oil or oily mixtures anywhere in violation of MARPOL 73/78, upon request from a party to MARPOL 73/78 for an investigation when the requesting party has furnished sufficient evidence to support a reasonable belief that a discharge has occurred.


(b) A ship that does not comply with the requirements of parts 151, 155 and 157 of this chapter, or where the condition of the ship or its equipment does not substantially agree with the particulars of the IOPP Certificate or other required documentation, may be detained by order of the COTP or OCMI, at the port or terminal where the violation is discovered until, in the opinion of the detaining authority, the ship can proceed to sea without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment. The detention order may authorize the ship to proceed to the nearest appropriate available shipyard rather than remaining at the place where the violation was discovered.


(c) An inspection under this section may include an examination of the Oil Record Book, the oil content meter continuous records, and a general examination of the ship. A copy of any entry in the Oil Record Book may be made and the Master of the ship may be required to certify that the copy is a true copy of such entry.
