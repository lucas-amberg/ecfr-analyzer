# § 151.2025   Ballast water management requirements.

(a) The master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel equipped with ballast tanks that operates in the waters of the United States must employ one of the following ballast water management methods:


(1) Install and operate a ballast water management system (BWMS) that has been approved by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR part 162. The BWMS must be installed in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. Following installation, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart must properly maintain the BWMS in accordance with all manufacturer specifications. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this subpart, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of vessels employing a Coast Guard-approved BWMS must meet the applicable ballast water discharge standard (BWDS), found in § 151.2030 of this subpart, at all times of discharge into the waters of the United States.


(2) Use only water from a U.S. public water system (PWS), as defined in 40 CFR 141.2, that meets the requirements of 40 CFR parts 141 and 143 as ballast water. Vessels using water from a PWS as ballast must maintain a record of which PWS they received the water from as well as a receipt, invoice, or other documentation from the PWS indicating that water came from that system. Furthermore, they must certify that they have met the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, and describe in the BWM plan the procedures to be used to ensure compliance with those conditions, and thereafter document such compliance in the BW record book. Vessels using water from a PWS must use such water exclusively unless the usage is in accordance with § 151.2040 of this subpart. Vessels using PWS water as ballast must have either—


(i) Previously cleaned the ballast tanks (including removing all residual sediments) and not subsequently introduced ambient water; or


(ii) Never introduced ambient water to those tanks and supply lines.


(3) Perform complete ballast water exchange in an area 200 nautical miles from any shore prior to discharging ballast water, unless the vessel is required to employ an approved BWMS per the schedule found in § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. An alternate management system (AMS) that meets the requirements of § 151.2026 of this subpart may also be used, so long as it was installed on the vessel prior to the date that the vessel is required to comply with the BWDS in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. If using an AMS, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart may employ the AMS for no longer than 5 years from the date they would otherwise be required to comply with the BWDS in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart;


(4) Do not discharge ballast water into waters of the United States.


(5) Discharge to a facility onshore or to another vessel for purposes of treatment. Any vessel owner/operator discharging ballast water to a facility onshore or to another vessel must ensure that all vessel piping and supporting infrastructure up to the last manifold or valve immediately before the dock manifold connection of the receiving facility or similar appurtenance on a reception vessel prevents untreated ballast water from being discharged into waters of the United States.


(b) Requests for approval of BWMS must be submitted to the Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7430, or by email to *msc@uscg.mil,* in accordance with 46 CFR part 162.


(c) A vessel engaged in the foreign export of Alaskan North Slope Crude Oil must comply with §§ 151.2060 and 151.2070 of this subpart, as well as with the provisions of 15 CFR 754.2(j)(1)(iii). Section 15 CFR 754.2(j)(1)(iii) requires a mandatory program of deep water ballast exchange unless doing so would endanger the safety of the vessel or crew.


(d) This subpart does not authorize the discharge of oil or noxious liquid substances (NLS) in a manner prohibited by United States or international laws or regulations. Ballast water carried in any tank containing a residue of oil, NLS, or any other pollutant must be discharged in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.


(e) This subpart does not affect or supersede any requirement or prohibition pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 to 1376).


(f) This subpart does not affect or supersede any requirement or prohibition pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 *et seq.*).


(g) Vessels with installed BWMS for testing and evaluation by an Independent Laboratory in accordance with the requirements of 46 CFR 162.060-10 and 46 CFR 162.060-28 will be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
