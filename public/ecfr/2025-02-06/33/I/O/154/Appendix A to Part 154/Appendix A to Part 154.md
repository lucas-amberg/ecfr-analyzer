# Appendix A to Part 154—Guidelines for Detonation Flame Arresters


This appendix contains the draft ASTM standard for detonation flame arresters. Devices meeting this standard will be accepted by the Commandant (CG-ENG).


1. *Scope*

1.1 This standard provides the minimum requirements for design, construction, performance and testing of detonation flame arresters.


2. *Intent*

2.1 This standard is intended for detonation flame arresters protecting systems containing vapors of flammable or combustible liquids where vapor temperatures do not exceed 60 °C. For all tests, the test media defined in 14.1.1 can be used except where detonation flame arresters protect systems handling vapors with a maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) below 0.9 millimeters. Detonation flame arresters protecting such systems must be tested with appropriate media (the same vapor or a media having a MESG no greater than the vapor). Various gases and their respective MESG are listed in attachment 1.


2.2 The tests in this standard are intended to qualify detonation flame arresters for all in-line applications independent of piping configuration provided the operating pressure is equal to or less than the maximum operating pressure limit specified in the manufacturer's certification and the diameter of the piping system in which the detonation arrester is to be installed is equal to or less than the piping diameter used in the testing.

4. *Terminology*

4.1 Δ P/P_o_—The dimensionless ratio, for any deflagration and detonation test of 14.3, of the maximum pressure increase (the maximum pressure minus the initial pressure), as measured in the piping system on the side of the arrester where ignition begins by the device described in paragraph 14.3.3, to the initial absolute pressure in the piping system. The initial pressure should be greater than or equal to the maximum operating pressure specified in paragraph 11.1.7.


4.2 Deflagration—A combustion wave that propagates subsonically (as measured at the pressure and temperature of the flame front) by the transfer of heat and active chemical species to the unburned gas ahead of the flame front.


4.3 Detonation—A reaction in a combustion wave propagating at sonic or supersonic (as measured at the pressure and temperature of the flame front) velocity. A detonation is stable when it has a velocity equal to the speed of sound in the burnt gas or may be unstable (overdriven) with a higher velocity and pressure.


4.4 Detonation flame arrester—A device which prevents the transmission of a detonation and a deflagration. 


4.5 Flame speed—The speed at which a flame propagates along a pipe or other system. 


4.6 Flame Passage—The transmission of a flame through a device. 


4.7 Gasoline Vapors—A non-leaded petroleum distillate consisting essentially of aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds with a boiling range approximating 65 °C/75 °C.


5. *Classification*

5.1 The two types of detonation flame arresters covered in this specification are classified as follows: 


5.1.1 Type I—Detonation flame arresters acceptable for applications where stationary flames may rest on the device. 


5.1.2 Type II—Detonation flame arresters acceptable for applications where stationary flames are unlikely to rest on the device, and further methods are provided to prevent flame passage when a stationary flame occurs. One example of “further methods” is a temperature monitor and an automatic shutoff valve.

14. *Test Procedures for Detonation Arresters*

14.1 *Media/Air Mixtures*

14.1.1 For vapors from flammable or combustible liquids with a MESG greater than or equal to 0.9 mm, technical grade hexane or gasoline vapors shall be used for all tests in this section except technical grade propane may be used for the deflagration/detonation tests in section 14.3. For vapors with a MESG less than 0.9 mm, the specific vapor (or alternatively, a media with a MESG less than or equal to the MESG of the vapor) must be used as the test medium in all Section 14 tests. 


14.1.2 Hexane, propane, gasoline and other test vapors shall be mixed with air to form the most easily ignitable mixture. 
5

14.2 *Endurance Burn Test Procedure*

14.2.1 An endurance burning test shall be carried out as follows: 


14.2.1.1 The test rig shall consist of an apparatus producing an explosive mixture, a small tank with a diaphragm, a prototype of the detonation flame arrester and a firing source in close proximity to the test device (see Figure 1). The detonation flame arrester shall be installed so that the mixture emission is vertically upwards, or installed in the position for which it is designed and which will cause the most severe heating of the device under the prescribed endurance burn conditions. In this position the mixture shall be ignited.


14.2.1.2 Endurance burn test shall start by using the most easily ignitable test vapor/air mixture with the aid of a pilot flame or a spark igniter at the outlet. The flammable mixture may be reignited as necessary in the course of the endurance burn. 


14.2.1.3 Temperature measurement will be performed on the surface of the arrester element half way between the center and its edge. 


14.2.1.4 By varying the proportions of the flammable mixture and the flow rate, the detonation flame arrester shall be heated by a stable flame on the surface of the arrester until the highest obtainable temperature is reached on the ignited side or until the temperature on the side which was not ignited (protected side) rises 100 °C. 


14.2.1.5 The flammable mixture proportions will then be varied again until the conditions which result in the highest temperature on the protected side are achieved. This temperature shall be maintained for a period of ten minutes, after which the flow shall be stopped and the conditions observed. The highest attainable temperature is considered to have been reached when any subsequent rise of temperature does not exceed 0.5 °C per minute over a ten minute period. 


14.2.1.6 If difficulty arises in establishing the highest attainable temperature on the protected side, the following criteria shall apply. When the increase in temperature on the protected side occurs so slowly that its temperature does not rise 100 °C, the conditions which produced the highest temperature on the ignited side of the arrester will be maintained for two hours. For the condition in which the temperature on the protected side continues to rise at a rate in excess of 0.5 °C per minute for a 10 minute period, endurance burning shall be continued, using the most severe conditions of flammable mixtures and flow rate, for a period of two hours. In either of these cases, at the end of the two hour period, the flow shall be stopped and the conditions observed. The two hour interval shall be measured commencing with the setting of the conditions which produced the most severe conditions of mixture and flow rate. For Type I detonation flame arresters, flame passage shall not occur during this test. For Type II detonation flame arresters, the maximum temperature obtained, and the time elapsed from the time when the most severe conditions are set to when flame passage occurs, shall be recorded. However, for Type II detonation flame arresters the test may be terminated 15 minutes after setting the most severe conditions on the protected side. 


14.3 *Deflagration/Detonation Test Procedure*

14.3.1 A detonation flame arrester shall be installed at one end of a pipe of the same diameter as the inlet of the detonation flame arrester (see Figure 2). The length and configuration of the test pipe shall develop a stable detonation 
6 at the device and shall be capable, by change in its length or configuration, of developing deflagrations and unstable (overdriven) detonations as measured on the side of the pipe where ignition occurs (run-up side). For deflagration testing, two test piping arrangements shall be used on the outlet side of the detonation flame arrester (the side which is not ignited). In both of the following end arrangements, the outlet side pipe diameter shall be equal to that on the run-up side. In one arrangement, the outlet side pipe shall be at least 10 pipe diameters long with a plastic bag over the free end. (Alternate end of pipe closures are also acceptable provided they easily give way during the course of the test, and the closure allows the required gas concentration to be maintained throughout the test piping arrangement.) In the other arrangement the outlet side pipe shall be fitted with a restriction located 0.6 meters from the outlet side arrester flange. The size of the restriction for each nominal size detonation flame arrester shall be as follows:


14.3.2 Flame speeds shall be measured by optical devices capable of providing accuracy of ±5%. These devices shall be situated no more than a distance equal to 3% of the length of the run-up pipe apart with one device no more than 8 inches from the end of the test pipe to which the detonation flame arrester is attached. In addition, each outlet arrangement described in paragraph 14.3.1 shall be fitted with an optical device located no more than 8 inches from the detonation flame arrester outlet. 
7

14.3.3 Explosion pressures within the pipe shall be measured by a high frequency transducer situated in the test pipe no more than 8 inches from the run-up side of the housing of the detonation flame arrester. 


14.3.4 Using the first end arrangement (10 pipe diameter outlet) described in paragraph 14.3.1, a series of tests shall be conducted to determine the test pipe length and configuration that results in the maximum unstable (overdriven) detonation having the maximum measured flame speed at the detonation flame arrester. (These tests may also be carried out using a single length of pipe with igniters spaced at varying distances from the arrester.) The flame speeds, explosion pressures and test pipe configurations shall be recorded for each of these tests. The piping configuration that resulted in the highest recorded unstable (overdriven) detonation flame speed shall be used, and the device shall be subjected to at least four additional unstable (overdriven) detonations. In the course of testing, the device shall also demonstrate its ability to withstand five stable detonations, five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) where Δ P/P_o_ was less than 1 and five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) where Δ P/P_o_ was greater than 1 but less than 10. Initiation of deflagrations shall be at several locations to generate a range for Δ P/P_o_. Deflagration tests using the restricted outlet arrangement described in paragraph 14.3.1 shall then be conducted. In these tests the device shall demonstrate its ability to stop five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) generated by the same configurations which resulted in Δ P/P_o_ being less than 1 during the deflagration tests which were conducted without the restricted end arrangements, and five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) generated by the same configurations which resulted in Δ P/P_o_ being greater than 1 but less than 10 during the deflagration tests which were conducted without the restricted end arrangements. No evidence of flame passage shall occur during these tests. The flame speeds and explosion pressures for each of these tests shall be recorded.


14.3.5 A device that successfully passes the tests of 14.3.4 shall be considered to be directional (suitable for arresting a detonation advancing only from the direction as tested) except; 


14.3.5.1 A device may be tested according to 14.3.4 for detonations approaching from either direction, or 


14.3.5.2 The design of the device is symmetrical where each end may be considered to be identical when approached by a detonation from either direction.
