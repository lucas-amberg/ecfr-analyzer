(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each facility to which this part applies must have enough butterfly valves, wafer-type resilient seated valves, blank flanges, or other means acceptable to the COTP to blank off the ends of each hose or loading arm that is not connected for the transfer of oil or hazardous material. Such hoses and/or loading arms must be blanked off during the transfer of oil or hazardous material. A suitable material in the joints and couplings shall be installed on each end of the hose assembly or loading arm not being used for transfer to ensure a leak-free seal.


(b) A new, unused hose, and a hose that has been cleaned and is gas free, is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
