# § 154.550   Emergency shutdown.

(a) The facility must have an emergency means to enable the person in charge of the transfer on board the vessel, at that person's usual operating station, to stop the flow of oil or hazardous material from the facility to the vessel. The means must be—

(1) 60 seconds on any facility or portion of a facility that first transferred oil on or before November 1, 1980; and 


(2) 30 seconds on any facility that first transfers oil after November 1, 1980.
