# ยง 154.1010   Purpose.

This subpart establishes oil spill response plan requirements for all marine transportation-related (MTR) facilities (hereafter also referred to as facilities) that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm or significant and substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone. The development of a response plan prepares the facility owner or operator to respond to an oil spill. These requirements specify criteria to be used during the planning process to determine the appropriate response resources. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. The criteria are based on a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident.
