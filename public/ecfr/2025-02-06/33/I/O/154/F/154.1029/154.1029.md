# § 154.1029   Worst case discharge.

(a) The response plan must use the appropriate criteria in this section to develop the worst case discharge.


(b) For the MTR segment of a facility, not less than—


(1) Where applicable, the loss of the entire capacity of all in-line and break out tank(s) needed for the continuous operation of the pipelines used for the purposes of handling or transporting oil, in bulk, to or from a vessel regardless of the presence of secondary containment; plus


(2) The discharge from all piping carrying oil between the marine transfer manifold and the non-transportation-related portion of the facility. The discharge from each pipe is calculated as follows: The maximum time to discover the release from the pipe in hours, plus the maximum time to shut down flow from the pipe in hours (based on historic discharge data or the best estimate in the absence of historic discharge data for the facility) multiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in barrels per hour (based on the maximum relief valve setting or maximum system pressure when relief valves are not provided) plus the total line drainage volume expressed in barrels for the pipe between the marine manifold and the non-transportation-related portion of the facility; and


(c) For a mobile facility it means the loss of the entire contents of the container in which the oil is stored or transported.
