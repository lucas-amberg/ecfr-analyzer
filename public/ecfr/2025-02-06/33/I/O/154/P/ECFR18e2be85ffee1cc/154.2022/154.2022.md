# § 154.2022   Certification, recertification, or operational review—certifying entity responsibilities, generally.

Before the initial certification of a facility vapor control system (VCS), the certifying entity must perform each of the tasks specified in this section.


(a) Review all VCS design documentation, including plans, drawings, calculations, specifications, and failure analysis, to ensure that the VCS design meets the requirements of this subpart.


(b) Conduct an initial onsite inspection to ensure that the VCS installation conforms to the VCS plans, drawings, and specifications reviewed.


(c) Conduct onsite reviews and observe tests to ensure the VCS's proper operation in accordance with its design and compliance with applicable regulations and the facility's operations manual and to ensure that—


(1) Each alarm and shutdown shown on the piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) and reviewed in the hazard analysis as part of the system responds properly, through simulation of emergency conditions to activate the alarm or shutdown;


(2) Maximum vacuum cannot be exceeded at the maximum operating conditions of any vapor-moving device, through testing of the vacuum breaker;


(3) VCS shutdown occurs correctly, through the startup of the VCS and tripping of each shutdown loop while the VCS is not connected to a vessel;


(4) VCS startup, normal operation, and shutdown occur properly, through observing the relevant portions of a test loading or unloading of one vessel, or a test cleaning of one tank barge at a tank barge cleaning facility; and that


(5) The automatic liquid block valve successfully stops flow of liquid to the vessel during a system shutdown, through observing the relevant portions of a test loading or test cargo tank cleaning.


(d) Review, for each cargo vapor the VCS will control, the cargo's chemical data and the VCS design to ensure that—


(1) Each vapor-controlled chemical is either specified in writing by the Commandant or listed in 46 CFR 30.25-1, 46 CFR 151.05, or Table 1 or Table 2 of 46 CFR 153;


(2) Each chemical's maximum experimental safe gap, minimum oxygen concentration for combustion (MOCC), and upper and lower limits of flammability have been correctly determined (this may but need not be in compliance with Coast Guard guidance available at *http://homeport.uscg.mil*);


(3) Vapor properties and characteristics are addressed, including freezing point, polymerization potential, solubility, and cargo compatibility;


(4) The flash point for any cargo with a closed-cup flash point of 60 °C (140 °F) or higher is properly determined;


(5) The cargo's vapor growth rate has been correctly determined and the VCS complies with 33 CFR 154.2103(a) and (b) or 33 CFR 154.2203(a) or (b);


(6) Each detonation arrester used in the VCS is correct for each chemical's maximum experimental safe gap;


(7) Setpoints for each oxygen analyzer used in the VCS are correct for each chemical's MOCC;


(8) Setpoints for each oxygen or hydrocarbon analyzer used in the VCS are correct for each chemical's upper or lower flammability limit;


(9) The inerting, enriching, or dilution system used is adequate;


(10) Each vapor-controlled chemical is compatible with all VCS components and with other chemicals and with inerting, enriching, or diluting gases added to the VCS per 46 CFR part 150, Table I and Table II;


(11) The VCS's mechanical equipment and system are suitable;


(12) The VCS's vapor recovery or destruction unit has adequate capacity and is safe for each chemical;


(13) Any calculation to determine the duration of purging required by 33 CFR 154.2150(p) is correct; and that


(14) The VCS's failure analysis addresses any hazards presented with each chemical.


(e) Review the VCS prior to certifying it to control vapors from barge cargo tanks during multi-breasted barge loading operations, to confirm that—


(1) The overfill control system required by 33 CFR 154.2102 will process a liquid overfill condition within any one cargo tank on each barge;


(2) If multi-breasted loading is conducted using more than one liquid transfer hose from the shore facility, the facility is capable of activating the emergency shutdown system required by 33 CFR 154.550, and can automatically stop the cargo flow to each transfer hose simultaneously, in the event an upset condition occurs that closes the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a);


(3) The facility operations manual has been modified to include the procedures for multi-breasted barge-loading operations; and


(4) The facility operations manual describes how to make proper connections, on the facility side, between the alarm and shutdown systems of the VCS and of each barge being loaded.


(f) Review a cargo line pigging system that will be used to clear cargo in the cargo line back to a tank vessel for compliance with 33 CFR 154.2104.


(g) Review the facility operations manual for compliance with 33 CFR 154.310(b).


(h) Review any test program used for instrument testing and calibration for compliance with 33 CFR 154.2180 and 33 CFR 154.2181.


(i) Review the facility's VCS training program for compliance with 33 CFR 154.2030 and 154.2031.
