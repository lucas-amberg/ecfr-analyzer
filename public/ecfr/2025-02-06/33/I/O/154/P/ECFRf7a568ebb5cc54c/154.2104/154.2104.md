# ยง 154.2104   Pigging system.

(a) If a pigging system is used to clear cargo in the cargo lines to the tank vessel while the vessel is connected to the facility vapor control system (VCS), the pigging system must be designed with the following safety features:


(1) A bypass loop installed in the main liquid cargo line that contains the pig-receiving device, through which all the liquid flow is channeled during pigging operations. The pig must act as a seal to separate the vessel from the compressed inert gas that is used to propel it as the pig travels from the pig launcher to the pig-receiving device;


(2) A mechanism for restricting liquid and gas flow so that the vessel, personnel, and environment are not endangered. The compressed inert gas flow capacity that this mechanism secures must not be more than 95 percent of the combined capacity of all vessel and facility VCS relief valves located upstream of the facility's remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a);


(3) A fast-action automatic shutoff valve such as a solenoid valve, which closes on a high-pressure signal from the pressure sensor required by 33 CFR 154.2103(f), located in the liquid bypass loop downstream of the pig-receiving device;


(4) An interlock with the main cargo line manual block valve so that line-clearing operations cannot begin unless the main cargo line manual block valve is closed; and


(5) An automatic means to detect arrival of the pig at the pig-receiving device.


(b) If a cargo line clearance system without using pigging is used to clear cargo in the cargo lines to the tank vessel while the vessel is connected to the facility VCS, the cargo line clearance system must be approved by the Commandant.
