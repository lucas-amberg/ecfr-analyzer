# § 154.2105   Fire, explosion, and detonation protection.

This section applies only to facilities that control vapors of flammable, combustible, or non-high flash point liquid cargoes.

(1) Be capable of inerting the vapor collection line in accordance with 33 CFR 154.2107(a) before receiving the vessel's vapor and have at least one oxygen analyzer, which satisfies the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107(f)(1) and (2), (g), and (h)(2) and (3), sampling the vapor concentration continuously at a point as close as practicable to the facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the analyzer and the facility vapor connection must not exceed 6 meters (19.7 feet); or


(2) Have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to the facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source.


(b) A VCS with a single facility vapor connection that receives only inerted cargo vapor from a vessel and processes it with a vapor destruction unit must—


(1) Satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to the facility vapor connection. The oxygen analyzer required by paragraph (a)(1) can be located 4 meters (13.1 feet) downstream of the detonation arrester. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source; or


(2) Have an inerting system that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107.


(c) A VCS with a single facility vapor connection that receives vapor from a vessel with cargo tanks that are not inerted or are partially inerted, and processes it with a vapor recovery unit must—


(1) Have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to the facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source; or


(2) Have an inerting, enriching, or diluting system that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107.


(d) A VCS with a single facility vapor connection that receives vapor from a vessel with cargo tanks that are not inerted or are partially inerted, and processes the vapor with a vapor destruction unit must—


(1) Have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to the facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source; and


(2) Have an inerting, enriching, or diluting system that satisfies the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107.


(e) A VCS with multiple facility vapor connections that receives vapor from vessels with cargo tanks that carry inerted, partially inerted, non-inerted, or combinations of inerted, partially inerted, and non-inerted cargoes, and processes them with a vapor recovery unit, must have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to each facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and each facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source.


(f) A VCS with multiple facility vapor connections that receives only inerted cargo vapor from vessels and processes it with a vapor destruction unit must—


(1) Satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section for each facility vapor connection and have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to each facility vapor connection. The oxygen analyzer required by paragraph (a)(1) can be located 4 meters (13.1 feet) downstream of the detonation arrester. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and each facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source; or


(2) Have an inerting, enriching, or diluting system that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107.


(g) A VCS with multiple facility vapor connections that receives vapor from vessels with non-inerted or partially inerted cargoes, and processes the vapor with a vapor destruction unit must—


(1) Have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to each facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and each facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source; and


(2) Have an inerting, enriching, or diluting system that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107.


(h) A VCS with multiple facility vapor connections that simultaneously receives vapor from vessels with inerted, partially inerted, and non-inerted cargoes, and processes the vapor with a vapor destruction unit must—


(1) Have a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to each facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and each facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source; and


(2) Have either an inerting, enriching, or diluting system that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107, or a base loading system that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2107(m).


(i) A VCS that uses a vapor balancing system in which cargo vapor from a vessel or facility storage tank is transferred through the facility vapor collection system to facility storage tanks or a vessel must meet the requirements of 33 CFR 154.2110.


(j) Each outlet of a VCS that vents to the atmosphere, except for a discharge vent from a vapor destruction unit or relief valve installed to comply with 33 CFR 154.2103(j) and (k) or 33 CFR 154.2203(e), (k), and (l), must have one of the following located at the outlet:


(1) A detonation arrester;


(2) An end-of-line flame arrester that meets ASTM F 1273 (incorporated by reference, see 33 CFR 154.106); or


(3) An end-of-line flame arrester that meets UL 525 (incorporated by reference, see 33 CFR 154.106) if—


(i) The discharge vent stream's total flammable concentration is proven to be less than 50 percent of the lower flammable limit, or the stream's oxygen concentration is proven to be less than 70 percent by volume of the MOCC, at all times by an outlet concentration analyzer for carbon beds, proof of correct operating temperature for refrigeration systems, or proof of scrubbing medium flow for scrubbers; and


(ii) The proving devices in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section close the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required in 33 CFR 154.2101(a) and close the automatic liquid cargo loading valve if operating outside the conditions necessary to maintain the discharge vent non-combustible.
