(a) Paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section apply only to facilities collecting vapors of flammable, combustible, or non-high flash point liquid cargoes.


(b) Each inlet and outlet to a vapor-moving device that handles vapor that has not been inerted, enriched, or diluted in accordance with 33 CFR 154.2107 must be fitted with a detonation arrester; however, the outlet detonation arrester may be omitted if the vapor-moving device is within 50 times the pipe's diameter of the detonation arrester required by 33 CFR 154.2109(a).


(c) If the vapor is handled by a reciprocating or screw-type compressor in the vapor collection system, the compressor must be installed with indicators and audible and visible alarms to warn against the following conditions:


(1) Excessive gas temperature at the compressor outlet;


(2) Excessive cooling water temperature;


(3) Excessive vibration;


(4) Low lube oil level;


(5) Low lube oil pressure; and


(6) Excessive shaft bearing temperature.


(d) If the vapor is handled by a liquid ring-type compressor in the vapor collection system, it must be installed with indicators and audible and visible alarms to warn against the following conditions:


(1) Low level of liquid sealing medium;


(2) Lack of flow of the liquid sealing medium;


(3) Excessive temperature of the liquid sealing medium;


(4) Low lube oil level;


(5) Low lube oil pressure, if pressurized lubricating system; and


(6) Excessive shaft bearing temperature.


(e) If the vapor is handled by a centrifugal compressor, fan, or lobe blower in the vapor collection system, construction of the blades or housing must be one of the following:


(1) Blades or housing of nonmetallic construction;


(2) Blades and housing of nonferrous material;


(3) Blades and housing of corrosion resistant steel;


(4) Ferrous blades and housing with one-half inch or more design tip clearance;


(5) Nonferrous blades and ferrous housing with one-half inch or more design tip clearance; or


(6) Blades of aluminum or magnesium alloy and a ferrous housing with a nonferrous insert sleeve at the periphery of the impeller.
