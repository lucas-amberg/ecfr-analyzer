# § 154.2111   Vapor control system connected to a facility's main vapor control system.

(a) When a marine vapor control system (VCS), or a marine vapor collection system, is connected to a facility's main VCS serving other facility processing areas that are not related to tank vessel operations, the marine vapor line, before the point where the marine VCS connects to the facility's main VCS, must be fitted with—


(1) A detonation arrester, unless both the marine VCS and the facility's main VCS only control vapors of cargoes that are non-flammable, non-combustible, or that have high flashpoints;


(2) Two fail-safe, quick closing valves, one on each side of any detonation arrester required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which automatically close when—


(i) A flame is detected on the detonation arrester;


(ii) The facility's marine VCS is not in operation; or


(iii) Vapor back flow to the marine vapor line is detected; and


(3) A means to prevent backflow of vapors to the marine vapor line.


(b) Vapors from facility processing areas unrelated to tank vessel operations must not enter the vapor line of a marine VCS before the devices required by paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) Except as specified by paragraph (d) of this section, a facility that wants to connect a facility vapor line, which collects vapor from other facility processing areas that are not related to tank vessel operations, to a marine VCS before the devices required by 33 CFR 154.2109(b)(1) and (2) and (c)(2), must receive approval in writing from the Commandant.


(d) A facility may connect a facility vapor line, which collects vapor from other facility processing areas that are not related to tank vessel operations, to a marine vapor line downstream of the devices required by 33 CFR 154.2109(b)(1) and (2) and (c)(2) to share the marine vapor destruction unit.
