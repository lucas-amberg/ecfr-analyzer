# § 154.2112   Vapors with potential to polymerize or freeze—Special requirements.

(a) A vapor control system (VCS) that controls vapors with the potential to polymerize at a normal ambient condition must—


(1) Be designed to prevent condensation of monomer vapor. Methods such as heat tracing and insulation are permitted if they do not result in an increased risk of polymerization;


(2) Be designed so that polymerization can be detected. Any points suspected of being sites for potential polymerization buildup must be equipped with inspection openings; and


(3) Include devices to measure the pressure drop across detonation arresters due to polymerization. The devices should activate an alarm on high pressure drop to warm of polymerization. Any device used for this purpose, including differential pressure monitors, must not have the capability of transmitting a detonation across the detonation arrester.


(b) A VCS that controls cargo vapors that potentially freeze at ambient temperature must have a design that prevents the freezing of vapors or condensate at ambient temperature or that detects and removes the liquid condensate and solids to prevent accumulation.
