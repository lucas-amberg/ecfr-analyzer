(a) A tank vessel with a capacity of 250 or more barrels that is carrying oil or hazardous material as cargo must have—


(1) Under or around each loading manifold and each transfer connection point, a fixed container or enclosed deck area that, in all conditions of ship list or trim encountered during the loading operation, has a capacity of at least:


(i) One half barrel if it serves one or more hoses with an inside diameter of 2 inches or less, or one or more loading arms with a nominal pipe size diameter of 2 inches or less;


(ii) One barrel if it serves one or more hoses with an inside diameter of more than 2 inches but less than 4 inches, or one or more loading arms with a nominal pipe size diameter of more than 2 inches but less than 4 inches;


(iii) Two barrels if it serves one or more hoses with an inside diameter of 4 inches or more, but less than 6 inches, or one or more loading arms with a nominal pipe size diameter of 4 inches or more, but less than 6 inches;


(iv) Three barrels if it serves one or more hoses with an inside diameter of 6 inches or more, but less than 12 inches, or one or more loading arms with a nominal pipe size diameter of 6 inches or more, but less than 12 inches; or 


(v) Four barrels if it serves one or more hoses with an inside diameter of 12 inches or more, or one or more loading arms with a nominal pipe size diameter of 12 inches or more;


(2) A means of draining or removing discharged oil or hazardous material from each container or enclosed deck area without discharging the oil or hazardous material into the water; and


(3) A mechanical means of closing each drain and scupper in the container or enclosed deck area required by this section. 


(b) An offshore tank barge with a cargo capacity of 250 or more barrels that is carrying hazardous material as cargo and an inland tank barge with the capacity of 250 or more barrels that is carrying oil or a hazardous material as cargo must meet paragraph (a) of this section or be equipped with—


(1) A coaming, at least 4 inches high but not more than 8 inches high, enclosing the immediate area of the cargo hatches, loading manifolds, and transfer connections, that has a capacity, in all conditions of vessel list and trim to be encountered during the loading operation, of at least one-half barrel per hatch, manifold, and connection within the enclosed area; 


(2) A fixed or portable container under each loading manifold and each transfer connection within the coaming, that holds at least one-half barrel; 


(3) A mechanical means of closing each drain and scupper within the coaming; and 


(4) A means of draining or removing discharged oil or hazardous material from the fixed or portable container and from within the coamings without discharging the oil or hazardous material into the water.


(c) All oil tankers and offshore oil barges with a cargo capacity of 250 or more barrels must have peripheral coamings, including port and starboard coamings and forward and aft athwartships coamings, completely enclosing the cargo deck area, cargo hatches, manifolds, transfer connections, and any other openings where cargo may overflow or leak.


(1) Coamings must be at least 4 inches high except in the aft corners.


(2) In the aft corners (port and starboard) of a vessel, the coamings must be at least 8 inches high and extend—


(i) Forward at least 14 feet from each corner; and


(ii) Inboard at least 8 feet from each corner.


(3) Each area enclosed by the coaming required under this paragraph must have—


(i) A means of draining or removing oil from the enclosed deck area without discharging oil into the water; and


(ii) A mechanical means of closing each drain and scupper in the enclosed deck-area.


(4) For a tankship, as defined in 46 CFR 30.10-67, the coaming or other barrier required in 46 CFR 32.56-15 may serve as the aft athwartships coaming if the tankship is otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this section.


(d) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an offshore oil barge with a cargo capacity of 250 or more barrels must have—


(1) A fixed or portable container that holds at least one-half barrel under each oil loading manifold and each oil transfer connection within the coaming;


(2) A mechanical means of closing each drain and scupper within the coaming; and


(3) A means of draining or removing discharged oil from the fixed or portable container and from within the coaming without discharging the oil into the water.
