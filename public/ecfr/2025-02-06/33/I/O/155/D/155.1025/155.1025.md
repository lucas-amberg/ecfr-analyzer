(c)(1) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a vessel may continue to handle, store, transport, transfer, or lighter oil for 2 years after the date of submission of a response plan pending approval of that plan, if the vessel owner or operator has received written authorization for continued operations from the Coast Guard.
