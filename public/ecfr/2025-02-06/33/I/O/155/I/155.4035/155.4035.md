# § 155.4035   Required pre-incident information and arrangements for the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers listed in response plans.

(a) You must provide the information listed in §§ 155.1035(c), 155.1040(c), and 155.5035(c) to your salvage and marine firefighting resource providers.


(b) *Marine firefighting pre-fire plan.* (1) You must prepare a vessel pre-fire plan in accordance with NFPA 1405, Guide for Land-Based Firefighters Who Respond to Marine Vessel Fires, Chapter 9 (Incorporation by reference, *see* § 155.140). If the planholder's vessel pre-fire plan is one that meets another regulation, such as SOLAS Chapter II-2, Regulation 15, or international standard, a copy of that specific fire plan must also be given to the resource provider(s) instead of the NFPA 1405 pre-fire plan, and be attached to the VRP.


(2) The marine firefighting resource provider(s) you are required to identify in your plan must be given a copy of the plan. Additionally, they must certify in writing to you that they find the plan acceptable and agree to implement it to mitigate a potential or actual fire.


(3) If a marine firefighting resource provider subcontracts to other organizations, each subcontracted organization must also receive a copy of the vessel pre-fire plan.
