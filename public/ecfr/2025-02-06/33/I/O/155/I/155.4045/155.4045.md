# § 155.4045   Required agreements or contracts with the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers.

(a) You may only list resource providers in your plan that have been arranged by contract or other approved means.


(b) You must obtain written consent from the resource provider stating that they agree to be listed in your plan. This consent must state that the resource provider agrees to provide the services that are listed in §§ 155.4030(a) through 155.4030(h), and that these services are capable of arriving within the response times listed in Table 155.4030(b). This consent may be included in the contract with the resource provider or in a separate document.


(c) This written consent must be available to the Coast Guard for inspection. The response plan must identify the location of this written consent, which must be:


(1) On board the vessel; or


(2) With a qualified individual located in the United States.


(d) Public marine firefighters may only be listed out to the maximum extent of the public resource's jurisdiction, unless other agreements are in place. A public marine firefighting resource may agree to respond beyond their jurisdictional limits, but the Coast Guard considers it unreasonable to expect public marine firefighting resources to do this.
