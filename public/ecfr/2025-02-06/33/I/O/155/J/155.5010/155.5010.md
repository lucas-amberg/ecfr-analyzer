# ยง 155.5010   Purpose.

The purpose of this subpart is to establish requirements for oil spill response plans for nontank vessels. The planning criteria in this subpart are intended for use in nontank vessel oil spill response plan development and the identification of resources necessary to respond to a nontank vessel's worst case discharge or substantial threat of such a discharge. The development of a nontank vessel response plan prepares the vessel's crew and ship management to respond to an oil spill. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. They are planning criteria based upon a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident. Note to ยง 155.5010: For nontank vessels that are mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs), additional oil spill planning standards are found in 30 CFR part 254.
