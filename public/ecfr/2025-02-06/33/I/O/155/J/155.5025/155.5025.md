# § 155.5025   One-time port waiver.

(a) If the vessel owner or operator seeks a one-time port waiver, they must certify in writing or using electronic signatures acceptable to the Coast Guard, prior to the vessel's entry into the Captain of the Port (COTP) zone, that they have met the requirements of—


(1) 33 CFR 155.1025(e)(1) through (3); and


(2) The vessel owner or operator has identified and ensured the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the private response resources necessary to respond, to the maximum extent practicable under the criteria in § 155.5050 to a worst case discharge or substantial threat of discharge from the vessel in the applicable COTP zone.


(b) Once the vessel owner or operator satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the cognizant U.S. Coast Guard COTP may grant written authorization for that nontank vessel to make one voyage in the respective geographic-specific area not covered by the vessel response plan.


(c) All requirements of this subpart must be met by a nontank vessel that received a one-time port waiver, for any subsequent voyage to the same geographic-specific area.
