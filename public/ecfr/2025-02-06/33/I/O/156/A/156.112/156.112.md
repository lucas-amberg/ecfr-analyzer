(b) Is issued in writing unless it is effective immediately and then it may be issued orally and followed up in writing;


(c) Includes a statement of each condition requiring correction to—


(1) Prevent the discharge of oil or hazardous material; or 


(2) Comply with § 154.735 of this chapter; and
