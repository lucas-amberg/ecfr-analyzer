# ยง 156.170   Equipment tests and inspections.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no person may use any equipment listed in paragraph (c) of this section for transfer operations unless the vessel or facility operator, as appropriate, tests and inspects the equipment in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c) and (f) of this section and the equipment is in the condition specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) During any test or inspection required by this section, the entire external surface of the hose must be accessible.


(c) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section: 


(1) Each nonmetallic transfer hose must:


(i) Have no unrepaired loose covers, kinks, bulges, soft spots or any other defect which would permit the discharge of oil or hazardous material through the hose material, and no gouges, cuts or slashes that penetrate the first layer of hose reinforcement as defined in ยง 156.120(i).


(ii) Have no external deterioration and, to the extent internal inspection is possible with both ends of the hose open, no internal deterioration;


(iii) Not burst, bulge, leak, or abnormally distort under static liquid pressure at least 1
1/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure; and


(iv) Hoses not meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may be acceptable after a static liquid pressure test is successfully completed in the presence of the COTP. The test medium is not required to be water.


(2) Each transfer system relief valve must open at or below the pressure at which it is set to open;


(3) Each pressure gauge must show pressure within 10 percent of the actual pressure;


(4) Each loading arm and each transfer pipe system, including each metallic hose, must not leak under static liquid pressure at least 1
1/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure; and


(5) Each item of remote operating or indicating equipment, such as a remotely operated valve, tank level alarm, or emergency shutdown device, must perform its intended function.


(d) No person may use any hose in underwater service for transfer operations unless the operator of the vessel or facility has tested and inspected it in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(4) of this section, as applicable.


(e) The test fluid used for the testing required by this section is limited to liquids that are compatible with the hose tube as recommended by the hose manufacturer.


(f) The frequency of the tests and inspections required by this section must be:


(1) For facilities, annually or not less than 30 days prior to the first transfer conducted past one year from the date of the last tests and inspections;


(2) For a facility in caretaker status, not less than 30 days prior to the first transfer after the facility is removed from caretaker status; and


(3) For vessels, annually or as part of the biennial and mid-period inspections.


(g) If a facility or vessel collects vapor emitted to or from a vessel cargo tank with a vapor control system, the system must not be used unless the following tests and inspections are satisfactorily completed: 


(1) Each vapor hose, vapor collection arm, pressure or vacuum relief valve, and pressure sensor is tested and inspected in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (f) of this section; 


(2) Each remote operating or indicating device is tested for proper operation in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; 


(3) Each detonation arrester required by 33 CFR 154.2105, 154.2108(b), 154.2109, 154.2110, 154.2111, and 154.2204, or 46 CFR 39.4003, and each flame arrester required by 33 CFR 154.2103, 154.2105(j), and 154.2203 has been inspected internally within the last year, or sooner if operational experience has shown that frequent clogging or rapid deterioration is likely; and 


(4) Each hydrocarbon and oxygen analyzer required by 33 CFR 154.2105(a) and (j), 154.2107(d) and (e), and 154.2110 or 46 CFR 39.4003 is calibrated: 


(i) Within the previous two weeks, or 


(ii) Within 24 hours prior to operation when the vapor control system is operated less frequently than once a week.


(h) Upon the request of the owner or operator, the COTP may approve alternative methods of compliance to the testing requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if the COTP determines that the alternative methods provide an equal level of protection.


(i) Notwithstanding the general provisions of 33 CFR 156.107(a) relating to the authority of the Captain of the Port to approve alternatives, the owner or operator may request the written approval of the Commandant (CG-ENG), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 2nd St. SW., Stop 7126, Washington, DC 20593-7126, for alternative methods of compliance to the testing and inspection requirements of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The Commandant (CG-ENG) will grant that written approval upon determination that the alternative methods provide an equivalent level of safety and protection from fire, explosion, and detonation. Criteria to consider when evaluating requests for alternative methods may include, but are not limited to: operating and inspection history, type of equipment, new technology, and site-specific conditions that support the requested alternative.
