# § 157.460   Additional operational requirements for tank barges.

(a) *Emergency steering capability.* The owner or operator of each tank barge shall not permit the barge to be towed unless, by November 27, 1997, the primary towing vessel has—


(1) A steering gear system with a main power unit, an alternative power unit, and two remote steering gear control systems, except that separate steering wheels or steering levers are not required. The steering gear control systems must be arranged so that if the system in operation fails, the other system can be brought into immediate operation from a position on the navigating bridge; or


(2) Twin screw propulsion with separate control systems for each propeller.


(b) *Fendering system.* An owner or operator of a tank barge shall not permit the barge to be towed unless the primary towing vessel and any fleeting or assist towing vessels have a fendering system that is of substantial size and composition to prevent metal to metal contact between the towing vessel and the barge during maneuvering operations.
