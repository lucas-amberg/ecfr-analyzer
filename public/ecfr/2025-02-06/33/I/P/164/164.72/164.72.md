(Each U.S. towing vessel of 26 feet (about 8 meters) or more in length, except a public vessel, must hold a ship-radio-station license for radio transmitters (including radar and EPIRBs), and each operator must hold a restricted operator's license or higher. To get an application for either license, call (800) 418-FORM or (202) 418-FORM, or write to the FCC; Wireless Bureau, Licensing Division; 1270 Fairfield Road; Gettysburg, PA 17325-7245.)


(4) *Magnetic compass.* Either—


(i) An illuminated swing-meter or an illuminated card-type magnetic steering compass readable from the vessel's main steering station, if the vessel engages in towing exclusively on Western Rivers; or


(ii) An illuminated card-type magnetic steering compass readable from the vessel's main steering station.


(5) *Echo depth-sounding device.* By August 2, 2001, an echo depth-sounding device readable from the vessel's main steering station, unless the vessel engages in towing exclusively on Western Rivers.


(6) *Electronic position-fixing device.* An electronic position-fixing device, a satellite navigational system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) as required by § 164.41, if the vessel engages in towing seaward of navigable waters of the U.S. or more than three nautical miles from shore on the Great Lakes.


(b) Each towing vessel must carry on board and maintain the following:


(1) *Charts or maps.* Marine charts or maps of the areas to be transited, published by the National Ocean Service (NOS), the ACOE, or a river authority that satisfy the following requirements:


(i) The charts or maps must be of a large enough scale and have enough detail to make safe navigation of the areas possible.


(ii) The charts or maps must be either—


(A) Current editions or currently corrected editions, if the vessel engages in towing exclusively on navigable waters of the U.S., including Western Rivers; or


(B) Currently corrected editions, if the vessel engages in towing seaward of navigable waters of the U.S. or more than three nautical miles from shore on the Great Lakes.


(iii) The charts or maps may be, instead of charts or maps required by paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, currently corrected marine charts or maps, or applicable extracts, published by a foreign government. These charts or maps, or applicable extracts, must contain information similar to that on the charts or maps required by paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, be of large enough scale, and have enough detail to make safe navigation of the areas possible, and must be currently corrected.


(2) *General publications.* A currently corrected edition of, or an applicable currently corrected extract from, each of the following publications for the area to be transited:


(i) If the vessel is engaged in towing exclusively on Western Rivers—


(A) U.S. Coast Guard Light List;


(B) Applicable Notices to Navigation published by the ACOE, or Local Notices to Mariners (LNMs) published by the Coast Guard, for the area to be transited, when available; and


(C) River-current tables published by a river authority, if available.


(ii) If the vessel is engaged other than in towing exclusively on Western Rivers—


(A) Coast Guard Light List;


(B) Notices to Mariners published by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or LNMs published by the Coast Guard; 


(C) Tidal-current tables published by private entities using data provided by the NOS, or river-current tables published by a river authority;


(D) Tide tables published by private entities using data provided by the NOS; and


(E) U.S. Coast Pilot.
