The security zone around each LPV is activated and enforced whether the LPV is underway, moored, position-keeping, or anchored, and will continue in effect until such time as the LPV departs Lahaina and the 3-mile enforcement area.


(b) *Definitions.* As used in this section, *large passenger vessel* or *LPV* means a cruise ship more than 300 feet in length that carries passengers for hire, and any passenger ferry more than 300 feet in length that carries passengers for hire.


(c) *Regulations.* (1) Under 33 CFR 165.33, entry into the security zones created by this section is prohibited unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, Honolulu or his or her designated representatives. When authorized passage through a large passenger vessel security zone, all vessels must operate at the minimum speed necessary to maintain a safe course and must proceed as directed by the Captain of the Port or his or her designated representatives. No person is allowed within 100 yards of an LPV that is underway, moored, position-keeping, or at anchor, unless authorized by the Captain of the Port or his or her designated representative.


(2) When conditions permit, the Captain of the Port, or his or her designated representative, may permit vessels that are at anchor, restricted in their ability to maneuver, or constrained by draft to remain within an LPV security zone in order to ensure navigational safety.
