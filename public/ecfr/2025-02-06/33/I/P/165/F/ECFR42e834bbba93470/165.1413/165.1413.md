# § 165.1413   Regulated navigation area; Southern Oahu Tsunami Evacuation; Honolulu, Hawaii.

(a) *Location.* The following area is a regulated navigation area (RNA): All waters of the Pacific Ocean south of the southern side of Oahu, HI extending from the surface of the water to the ocean floor, and is bound by a line connecting the following points: 21°17′14″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°48′20″ W; 21°14′14″ N, 157°48′20″ W thence westward along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. These coordinates are based upon the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coast Survey, Pacific Ocean, Oahu, Hawaii, chart 19357.


(b) *Regulations.* You may contact the Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16 (156.800 MHz) or at telephone number 808-842-2600, to obtain clarification on RNA transits and locations. Operations permitting, the Coast Guard plans to provide on-scene direction using Coast Guard patrol boats and assets. During the enforcement period persons and vessels wishing to remain inside the RNA must abide by the following stipulations:


(1) No person or vessel may enter into an exclusionary area 3.7 nautical miles long by 1 nautical mile wide, centered lengthwise and along a line running seaward at 208 degrees southwest of Honolulu Harbor Front Range Light, except to transit to or from the staging areas or other areas outside the zone. Loitering or lingering in the exclusionary zone is prohibited.


(2) The Western Recreational Vessel Staging area is bound by the following points: 21°17′14″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′34″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′17″ W; 21°16′46″ N, 157°53′23″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. This staging area is intended for recreational vessels departing from and returning to the Keehi Lagoon area.


(3) The Commercial Vessel Staging Area is bound by a line connecting the following points: 21°16′48″ N, 157°52′10″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°54′05″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°51′36″ W; 21°15′55″ N, 157°50′58″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. This staging area is intended for use by all commercial vessels intended to remain in the RNA during a tsunami treat.


(4) The Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area is bound by the following points: 21°15′55″ N, 157°50′58″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°51′36″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°48′20″ W; 21°14′14″ N, 157°48′20″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point. The Commercial Vessel Staging Area borders this staging area's western edge. The dividing line between the Commercial Vessel Staging Area and the Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area can be determined visually. The private dayboards located in the Ala Wai Small Boat Harbor and the La Ronde Rotating Restaurant roof top restaurant form a natural range that mariners can use in daylight hours to gauge the eastern boundary of the Commercial Vessel Staging Area and the western boundary of the Eastern Recreational Vessel Staging Area. This eastern recreational staging area is intended for use by recreational vessels departing from and returning to the Ala Wai Small Boat harbor and Kewalo Basin.


(5) Located between the Western Recreational Vessel Staging Area and the Commercial Vessel Staging Area is an Exclusion Area. This area is bound by the following points: 21°16′46″ N, 157°53′23″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°55′17″ W; 21°13′30″ N, 157°54′05″ W; 21°16′48″ N, 157°52′10″ W and then along the 50-fathom line to the beginning point.


(6) All vessels staging in the RNA must be seaward of the 50-fathom (300 foot) line.


(c) *Enforcement period.* Paragraph (b) of this section will be enforced when a tsunami warning has been issued for the Hawaiian Islands by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The COTP will notify the public of any enforcement, suspension of enforcement, or termination of enforcement through appropriate means to ensure the widest publicity, including the use of broadcast notice to mariners, notices of enforcement and press releases.


(d) *Penalties.* Vessels or persons violating this rule are subject to the penalties set forth in 46 U.S.C. 70036.
