(2) A power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, navigating within the RNAs defined in paragraph (c) of this section, shall have its engine(s) ready for immediate maneuver and shall operate its engine(s) in a control mode and on fuel that will allow for an immediate response to any engine order, ahead or astern, including stopping its engine(s) for an extended period of time.


(3) The master, pilot or person directing the movement of a vessel within the RNAs defined in paragraph (c) of this regulation shall comply with Rule 9 of the Inland Navigation Rules (INRs) (33 CFR subchapter E) in conjunction with the provisions of the associated INRs.


(e) *Specific Regulations*—(1) *San Francisco Bay RNA:* (i) A vessel shall navigate with particular caution in a precautionary area, or in areas near the terminations of traffic lanes or channels, as described in this regulation.


(ii) A power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, shall:


(A) Use the appropriate traffic lane and proceed in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane;


(B) Use the Central Bay Deep Water Traffic Lane if eastbound with a draft of 45 feet or greater or westbound with a draft of 28 feet or greater;


(C) Not enter the Central Bay Deep Water Traffic Lane when another power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons or tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons is navigating therein when either vessel is:


(*1*) Carrying certain dangerous cargoes (as denoted in section 160.202 of this subchapter);


(*2*) Carrying bulk petroleum products; or


(*3*) A tank vessel in ballast if such entry would result in meeting, crossing, or overtaking the other vessel.


(D) Normally join or leave a traffic lane at the termination of the lane, but when joining or leaving from either side, shall do so at as small an angle to the general direction of traffic flow as practicable;


(E) So far as practicable keep clear of the Central Bay Separation Zone and the Deep Water Traffic Lane Separation Zone; 


(F) Not cross a traffic lane separation zone unless crossing, joining, or leaving a traffic lane.


(2) *Pinole Shoal Channel RNA:* (i) A vessel less than 1600 gross tons or a tug with a tow of less than 1600 gross tons is not permitted within this RNA.

(B) If the visibility is less than 
1/2 nautical mile, or subsequently becomes less than 
1/2 nautical mile, the vessel shall not transit under the lift span. 


(ii) *Westbound vessels:* (A) The master, pilot, or person directing the movement of a power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons traveling westbound and intending to transit under the lift span (centered at coordinates 38°02′18″ N, 122°07′17″ W) of the railroad bridge across Carquinez Strait at mile 7.0 shall, immediately after entering the RNA determine whether the visibility around the lift span is 
1/2 nautical mile or greater. 


(B) If the visibility is less than 
1/2 nautical mile, the vessel shall not pass beyond longitude line 121°55′19″ W (coinciding with the charted position of the westernmost end of Mallard Island) until the visibility improves to greater than 
1/2 nautical mile around the lift span. 


(C) If after entering the RNA visibility around the lift span subsequently becomes less than 
1/2 nautical mile, the master, pilot, or person directing the movement of the vessel either shall not transit under the lift span or shall request a deviation from the requirements of the RNA as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(D) Vessels that are moored or anchored within the RNA with the intent to transit under the lift span shall remain moored or anchored until visibility around the lift span becomes greater than 
1/2 nautical mile.
