The Captain of the Port will issue a Broadcast Notice to Mariners and Local Notice to Mariners notifying the public of activation and suspension of enforcement of these safety zones. Additionally, an on-scene Patrol Commander will ensure enforcement of this safety zone by limiting the transit of non-participating vessels in the designated areas described above.
