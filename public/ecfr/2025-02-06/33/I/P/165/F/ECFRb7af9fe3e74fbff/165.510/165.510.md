(f) *Requirements for vessels carrying dangerous cargoes.* The master, owner, or operator of a vessel carrying a dangerous cargo shall: 


(1) Notify the COTP at least 72 hours before the vessel enters or departs the regulated navigation area and at least 12 hours before the vessel moves within the regulated navigation area. The notice must include a report of the vessel's propulsion and machinery status and, for foreign flag vessels, the notice must include any outstanding deficiencies identified by the vessel's flag state or classification society; 


(2) Not enter, get or remain underway within the regulated navigation area if visibility is or is expected to be less than two (2) miles. If during the transit visibility becomes less than two (2) miles, the vessel must seek safe anchorage and notify the COTP immediately; 


(3) Not anchor in any area within the regulated navigation area unless in times of emergency or with COTP permission; 


(4) Not transfer dangerous cargo while the vessel is at anchor or bunkering; 


(5) Maintain a manned watch in the steering compartment whenever the vessel is underway within the regulated navigation area unless the vessel has two separate and independent steering control systems with duplicate pilothouse steering gear control systems which meet the requirements of 46 CFR 58.25-70; 


(6) When anchored within the regulated navigation area and: 


(i) Sustained winds are greater than 25 knots but less than 40 knots, ensure the main engines are ready to provide full power in five minutes or less; and 


(ii) Sustained winds are 40 knots or over, ensure that the main engines are on line to immediately provide propulsion; 


(7) While moored within the regulated navigation area, ensure that at least two wire cable mooring lines (firewarps) are rigged and ready for use as emergency towing hookups fore and aft on the outboard side of the vessel; 


(8) While underway or anchored within the regulated navigation area, ensure that at least two wire cable mooring lines (firewarps) are rigged and ready for use as emergency towing hookups fore and aft on the vessel; and, 


(9) Proceed as directed by the COTP. 


(g) *Requirements for vessels operating in the vicinity of a vessel carrying dangerous cargoes.* (1) Except for a vessel that is attending a vessel carrying dangerous cargo with permission from the master of the vessel carrying dangerous cargo or a vessel that is anchored or moored at a marina, wharf, or pier, and which remains moored or at anchor, no vessel may, without the permission of the COTP: 


(i) Come or remain within 500 yards of the port or starboard side or within 1,000 yards of the bow or stern of an underway vessel that is carrying dangerous cargo; or

(ii) Operate at “no wake” speed or the minimum speed needed to maintain steerage; and 


(iii) Proceed as directed by the COTP. 


(3) No vessel may overtake a vessel carrying dangerous cargoes unless the overtaking can be completed before reaching any bend in the channel. Before any overtaking, the pilots, masters or operators of both the overtaking vessel and the vessel being overtaken must clearly agree on the circumstances of the overtaking, including vessel speeds, time and location of overtaking. 


(h) *Additional restrictions above the C&D Canal.* When operating on the Delaware River above the C&D Canal:
