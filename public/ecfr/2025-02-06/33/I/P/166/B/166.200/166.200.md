# § 166.200   Shipping safety fairways and anchorage areas, Gulf of Mexico.

(a) *Purpose.* Fairways and anchorage areas as described in this section are established to control the erection of structures therein to provide safe approaches through oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico to entrances to the major ports along the Gulf Coast.


(b) *Special Conditions for Fairways in the Gulf of Mexico.* Temporary anchors and attendant cables or chains attached to floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs outside a fairway may be placed within a fairway described in this section for the Gulf of Mexico, provided the following conditions are met:


(1) Anchors installed within fairways to stablize semisubmersible drilling rigs shall be allowed to remain 120 days. This period may be extended by the Army Corps of Engineers, as provided by § 209.135(b).


(2) Drilling rigs must be outside of any fairway boundary to whatever distance is necessary to ensure that the minimum depth of water over an anchor line within a fairway is 125 feet.


(3) No anchor buoys or floats or related rigging will be allowed on the surface of the water or to a depth of at least 125 feet from the surface, within a fairway.


(4) Aids to Navigation or danger markings must be installed as required by 33 CFR Subchapter C.


(c) *Special Conditions for Fairway Anchorages in the Gulf of Mexico.* Structures may be placed within an area designated as a fairway anchorage, but the number of structures will be limited by spacing as follows:


(1) The center of a structure to be erected shall not be less than two (2) nautical miles from the center of any existing structure.


(2) In a drilling or production complex, associated structures connected by walkways shall be considered one structure for purposes of spacing, and shall be as close together as practicable having due consideration for the safety factors involved.


(3) A vessel fixed in place by moorings and used in conjunction with the associated structures of a drilling or production complex, shall be considered an attendant vessel and the extent of the complex shall include the vessel and its moorings.


(4) When a drilling or production complex extends more than five hundred (500) yards from the center, a new structure shall not be erected closer than two (2) nautical miles from the outer limit of the complex.


(5) An underwater completion installation in an anchorage area shall be considered a structure and shall be marked with a lighted buoy approved by the United States Coast Guard under § 66.01.
