# § 167.1323   In Puget Sound and its approaches: Puget Sound.

The traffic separation scheme in Puget Sound consists of six separation zones and two traffic lanes connected by six precautionary areas. The following are established:


(a) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:


(b) Precautionary area “SC,” which is contained within a circle of radius 0.62 miles, centered at 48°01.85′ N, 122°38.15′ W.


(c) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:


(d) Precautionary area “SE,” which is contained within a circle of radius 0.62 miles, centered at 47°55.40′ N, 122°29.55′ W.


(e) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:


(f) Precautionary area “SF,” which is contained within a circle of radius 0.62 miles, centered at 47°45.90′ N, 122°26.25′ W.


(g) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:


(h) Precautionary area “SG,” which is contained within a circle of radius 0.62 miles, centered at 47°39.68′ N, 122°27.87′ W.


(i) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:


(j) Precautionary area “T,” which is contained within a circle of radius 0.62 miles, centered at 47°34.55′ N, 122°27.07′ W.


(k) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions:


(l) Precautionary area “TC,” which is contained within a circle of radius 0.62 miles, centered at 47°19.48′ N, 122°27.38′ W.


(m) A traffic lane for northbound traffic that connects with precautionary areas “SC,” “SE,” “SF,” “SG,” “T,” and “TC,” as described in paragraphs (b), (d), (f), (h), (j), and (k) of this section, respectively, and is located between the separation zones described in paragraphs (a), (c), (e), (g), (i), and (k) of this section, respectively, and a line connecting the following geographical positions:


(n) A traffic lane for southbound traffic that connects with precautionary areas “SC,” “SE,” “SF,” “SG,” “T,” and “TC,” as described in paragraphs (b), (d), (f), (h), (j), and (k) of this section, respectively, and is located between the separation zones described in paragraphs (a), (c), (e), (g), (i), and (k) of this section, respectively, and a line connecting the following geographical positions:
