# § 183.105   Quantity of flotation required.

(a) Each boat must have enough flotation to keep any portion of the boat above the surface of the water when the boat has been submerged in calm, fresh water for at least 18 hours and loaded with:


(1) A weight that, when submerged, equals two-fifteenths of the persons capacity marked on the boat; 


(2) A weight that, when submerged, equals 25 percent of the dead weight; and


(3) A weight in pounds that, when submerged, equals 62.4 times the volume in cubic feet of the two largest air chambers, if air chambers are used for flotation.


(b) For the purpose of this section, “dead weight” means the maximum weight capacity marked on the boat minus the persons capacity marked on the boat.
