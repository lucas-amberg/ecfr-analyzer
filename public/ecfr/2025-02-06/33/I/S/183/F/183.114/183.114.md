# § 183.114   Test of flotation materials.

(a) *Vapor test.* The flotation material must not reduce in buoyant force more than 5 percent after being immersed in a fully saturated gasoline vapor atmosphere for 30 days at a minimum temperature of 38 °C. 


(b) *24-hour gasoline test.* The flotation material must not reduce in buoyant force more than 5 percent after being immersed for 24 hours at 23 plus or minus 2 °C in reference fuel B, of ASTM D 471 (incorporated by reference, see § 183.5). 


(c) *30-day gasoline test.* The flotation material must not reduce in buoyant force more than 5 percent after being immersed for 30 days at 23 plus or minus 2 °C in reference fuel B, of ASTM D 471 (incorporated by reference, see § 183.5). 


(d) *24-hour oil test.* The flotation material must not reduce in buoyant force more than 5 percent after being immersed for 24 hours at 23 plus or minus 2 °C in reference oil No. 2, of ASTM D 471 (incorporated by reference, see § 183.5). 


(e) *30-day oil test.* The flotation material must not reduce in buoyant force more than 5 percent after being immersed for 30 days at 23 plus or minus 2 °C in reference oil No. 2, of ASTM D 471 (incorporated by reference, see § 183.5). 


(f) *24-hour bilge cleaner test.* The flotation material must not reduce in buoyant force more than 5 percent after being immersed for 24 hours at 23 plus or minus 2 °C in a 5-percent solution of trisodium phosphate in water. 


(g) *30-day bilge cleaner test.* The flotation material must not reduce in buoyant force more than 5 percent after being immersed for 30 days at 23 plus or minus 2 °C in a 5-percent solution of trisodium phosphate in water. 


(h) The buoyant force reduction in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section is measured in accordance with ASTM D 2842 (incorporated by reference, see § 183.5).
