Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1941, as amended, (33 U.S.C. 701n) (69 Stat. 186), commonly and hereinafter referred to as Public Law 84-99, authorizes an emergency fund to be expended at the discretion of the Chief of Engineers for: preparation for natural disasters; flood fighting and rescue operations; repair or restoration of flood control works threatened, damaged, or destroyed by flood, or nonstructural alternatives thereto; emergency protection of federally authorized hurricane or shore protection projects which are threatened, when such protection is warranted to protect against imminent and substantial loss to life and property; and repair and restoration of federally authorized hurricane or shore protection projects damaged or destroyed by wind, wave, or water of other than ordinary nature. The law includes provision of emergency supplies of clean water when a contaminated source threatens the public health and welfare of a locality, and activities necessary to protect life and improved property from a threat resulting from a major flood or coastal storm. This law authorizes the Secretary of the Army (Secretary) to construct wells and to transport water within areas determined by the Secretary to be drought-distressed. The Secretary of the Army has delegated the authority vested in the Secretary under Public Law 84-99 through the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) to the Chief of Engineers, subject to such further direction as the Secretary may provide.
