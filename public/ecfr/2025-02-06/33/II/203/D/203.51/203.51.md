# § 203.51   Levee owner's manual.

(a) *Authority.* In accordance with section 202(f) of Public Law 104-303, the Corps will provide a levee owner's manual to the non-Federal sponsor of all flood control works in an Active status in the RIP. 


(b) *Policies*—(1) *Active non-Federal projects.* A levee owner's manual developed and distributed by the Corps will be provided to all sponsors of Active non-Federal projects. The levee owner's manual will include the standards that must be met to maintain an Active status in the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program. Levee owner's manuals will also be provided, upon request, to sponsors of Inactive non-Federal projects so that the sponsors may evaluate their projects and prepare for an IEI to gain an Active status in the RIP. 


(2) *Federal projects.* The Operation and Maintenance Manual specified by 33 CFR 208.10(a)(10) will fulfill the requirement of providing a levee owner's manual if the Corps has not provided a separate levee owner's manual to the sponsor of a Federal project. 


(c) *Procedural requirements.* Levee Owner's Manuals will be initially provided to non-Federal sponsors of Active flood control works during scheduled CEI's and IEI's. Sponsors of Inactive projects and private levee owners will be provided manuals upon written request to the responsible Corps district.
