# ยง 203.85   Rehabilitation of Federal flood control projects.

Some sponsors of Federal flood control projects are not required to furnish written assurances of local cooperation, when such assurances already exist from the PCA of the original construction of the project. In lieu of a new PCA, the Corps will notify the sponsor, in writing, of the sponsor's standing requirements. These requirements include such items as LERRD's, costs attributable to deficient or deferred maintenance, removal of temporary works, cost-sharing requirements, and any other requirements contained in ยง 203.82. The project sponsor must acknowledge its responsibilities prior to the provision of Rehabilitation Assistance. If the existing PCA does not adequately address responsibilities, then a CA will be required.
