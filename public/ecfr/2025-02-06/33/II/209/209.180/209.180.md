# § 209.180   Temporary closure of waterway to navigation.

(a) When an application is received for the temporary closure of a waterway for the construction of a structure or the performance of other work in the waterway, the District Engineer will assure himself of the necessity for the closure and arrange after informal communication with any important navigation interests concerned the time and duration of the closure which will enable the operations to be completed with the least interference with navigation. If there is no question as to the necessity and propriety of the closure, the District Engineer is authorized to inform the applicant as follows: “The Department of the Army will interpose no objection to the closure for a stated period beginning at a specified date: *Provided,* That prior thereto the applicant will notify navigation interests by an advertisement in the press or otherwise as the District Engineer may approve and on the understanding that the waiver of objection does not affect the liability of the applicant for any damages that may arise by reason of the closure.” The letter to the applicant will be signed “By Authority of the Secretary of the Army” and distribution made as prescribed for permits.


(b) District Engineers will give careful consideration to the effect of any closure on through navigation. Should coordination with other districts be necessary the case will be forwarded to the Division Engineer for such coordination.


(c) Cases not falling within the authority above conferred will be forwarded to the Chief of Engineers with the recommendations of the Division and District Engineers.
