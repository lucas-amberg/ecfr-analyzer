# ยง 234.2   Definitions.

*Acceptability.* The viability and appropriateness of an alternative from the perspective of the Nation's general public and consistency with existing Federal laws, authorities, and public policies. It does not include local or regional preferences for solutions or political expediency.


*Adaptive management.* A deliberate, iterative, and scientific-based process of designing, implementing, monitoring, and adjusting an action, measure, or project to address changing circumstances and outcomes, reduce uncertainty, and maximize one or more goals over time.


*Completeness.* The extent to which an alternative provides and accounts for all features, investments, and/or other actions necessary to realize the planned effects, including any necessary actions by others. It does not necessarily mean that alternative actions need to be large in scope or scale.


*Effectiveness.* The extent to which an alternative alleviates the specified problems and achieves the specified opportunities.


*Efficiency.* The extent to which an alternative alleviates the specified problems and realizes the specified opportunities at the least cost.


*Federal investment.* Investments made by the Corps related to water resources development projects, including flood and storm risk management, ecosystem restoration, land management activities, navigation, recreation, and hydropower.


*Federal Objective.* The fundamental goal of Federal investments in water resources. Federal water resources investments shall reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment. Federal investments should strive to maximize net public benefits.


*Indigenous Knowledge.* Indigenous Knowledge may be described as a body of observations, oral and written knowledge, innovations, practices, and beliefs developed by Tribes and Indigenous Peoples through interaction and experience with the environment, consistent with the definitions used in 43 CFR 2361.5 and 6101.4(h) and the Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Indigenous Knowledge, issued November 30, 2022. It is applied to phenomena across biological, physical, social, cultural, and spiritual systems. Indigenous Knowledge can be developed over millennia, continues to develop, and includes understanding based on evidence acquired through direct contact with the environment and long-term experiences, as well as extensive observations, lessons, and skills passed from generation to generation.


*Nature-based alternatives.* An alternative comprised of actions to protect, sustainably manage, or restore natural or modified ecosystems to address societal challenges, while simultaneously providing benefits for people and the environment.


*Non-Federal interest.* (1) A legally constituted public body (including an Indian Tribe and a Tribal Organization (as those terms are defined in 25 U.S.C. 5304)); or


(2) A nonprofit entity with the consent of the affected local government, that has full authority and capability to perform the terms of its agreement and to pay damages, if necessary, in the event of failure to perform.


*Nonstructural alternative.* An alternative comprised of a nonstructural approach or combination of nonstructural approaches that addresses the water resources problem.


*Nonstructural approach.* An approach that alters the use of existing infrastructure or human activities to generally avoid or minimize adverse changes to existing hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecological processes. This may include measures such as certain forms of nature-based solutions; modified floodplain practices; policy modifications; vessel speed limits; traffic management and tidal navigation restrictions; the reoperation of dams and reservoirs to restore or better mimic natural hydrology and flow patterns; invasive plant removal; signage to limit public access at an aquatic ecosystem restoration site; setbacks; elevations; relocation; buyout/acquisition including the acquisition of flowage easements; dry flood proofing; and wet flood proofing. They may also include actions that are not the responsibility of the Corps such as providing flood insurance, establishing building codes for new construction, and other local floodplain management practices, installing early warning systems, and developing emergency evacuation plans.


*Professional judgment.* An evidence-based decision that relies on appropriate training and experience.


*Public benefits.* Encompasses economic, environmental, and social impacts, and includes those that can be quantified in monetary terms, as well as those that can be quantified or described qualitatively.


*Regional economic development effects.* The changes in the distribution of regional economic activity that would result from implementation of an alternative plan. These economic effects amount to a transfer of resources from one part of the Nation to another (either from one region of the country to another, or within a region). They accrue in a local area or region but are offset by equivalent losses elsewhere in the country.


*Regulatory.* Generally, those activities subject to legal restrictions promulgated by the Federal Government.


*Resilience.* Resilience is the ability to prepare for threats and hazards, adapt to changing conditions, and withstand and recover rapidly from adverse conditions and disruptions.


*Sustainable.* The creation and maintenance of conditions under which humans and nature can coexist in the present and into the future.


*Tribal Nation (Federally recognized Indian Tribe or Tribal Organization).* An Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian Tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 5130.


*Unwise use of floodplains.* Any action or change that diminishes public health and safety, or an action that is incompatible with or adversely impacts one or more floodplain functions that leads to a floodplain that is no longer self-sustaining or degrades ecosystem services.


*Watershed.* A land area that drains to a common waterbody.
