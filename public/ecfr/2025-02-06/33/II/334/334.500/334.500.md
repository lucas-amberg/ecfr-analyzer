(b) *The regulations*—(1) *St. Johns River restricted area.* All persons, vessels, or other craft are prohibited from entering, transiting, drifting, dredging, or anchoring within the area described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section without the permission of the Commanding Officer, NAVSTA Mayport or his/her authorized representative. This restriction will be in place 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Warning signs notifying individuals of the restricted area boundary and prohibiting entry into the area will be posted at 500-foot intervals along the property boundary.


(2) *Atlantic Ocean restricted area.* All persons, vessels, or other craft are prohibited from entering, transiting, drifting, dredging, or anchoring within the area described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section without the permission of the Commanding Officer, NAVSTA Mayport or his/her authorized representative.

Warning signs notifying individuals of the restricted area boundary and prohibiting entry into the area will be posted at 500-foot intervals along the property boundary.


(3) *Sherman Creek restricted area.* All persons, vessels, or other craft are prohibited from entering, transiting, drifting, dredging, or anchoring within the area described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section without the permission of the Commanding Officer, NAVSTA Mayport or his/her authorized representative.

Warning signs notifying individuals of the restricted area boundary and prohibiting entry into the area will be posted at 500-foot intervals along the property boundary where practicable (e.g., not in the wetlands). In addition, a floating Small Craft Intrusion Barrier will be placed across Sherman Creek just east of the A1A bridge and another will be placed across tributaries to Sherman Creek just north of the Wonderwood Expressway.


(4) *Danger zone.* During periods of munitions movement at wharves Bravo and Charlie, no person or vessel shall be allowed to remain within the 1,250-foot Explosive Safety Quantity-Distance arcs generated by the activity. NAVSTA Mayport will not announce or publish notification prior to enforcing this regulation due to the unacceptable security threat posed by advance public notice of military munitions movements.


(c) *Enforcement.* The regulations in this section shall be enforced by the Commanding Officer, NAVSTA Mayport and/or such persons or agencies as he/she may designate. Military vessels will patrol the areas identified in this section 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Any person or vessel encroaching within the areas identified in this section will be asked to immediately leave the area. Failure to do so will result in the forceful removal of the person or vessel from the area in question.
