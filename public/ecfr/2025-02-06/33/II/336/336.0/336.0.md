Since the jurisdiction of the CWA extends to all waters of the U.S., including the territorial sea, and the jurisdiction of the ODA extends over ocean waters including the territorial sea, the following rules are established to assure appropriate regulation of discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. and ocean waters.


(a) The disposal into ocean waters, including the territorial sea, of dredged material excavated or dredged from navigable waters of the U.S. will be evaluated by the Corps in accordance with the ODA.


(b) In those cases where the district engineer determines that the discharge of dredged material into the territorial sea would be for the primary purpose of fill, such as the use of dredged material for beach nourishment, island creation, or construction of underwater berms, the discharge will be evaluated under section 404 of the CWA.


(c) For those cases where the district engineer determines that the materials proposed for discharge in the territorial sea would not be adequately evaluated under the section 404(b)(1) guidelines of the CWA, he may evaluate that material under the ODA.
