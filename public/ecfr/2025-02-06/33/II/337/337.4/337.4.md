# ยง 337.4   Memoranda of Agreement (MOA).

The establishment of joint notification procedures for Corps projects involving disposal of dredged or fill material should be actively pursued through the development of MOAs with the state. The MOAs may be used to define responsibilities between the state and the Corps district involved. The primary purpose of MOAs will be to avoid or eliminate administrative duplication, when such duplication does not contribute to the overall decision-making process. MOAs for purposes of this regulation will not be used to implement provisions not related to the maintenance or enforcement of Federally-approved state water quality standards or coastal zone management programs. District engineers are authorized and encouraged to develop MOAs with states and other Federal agencies for Corps projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material. Copies of all MOAs will be forwarded to CECW-D, Office of the Chief of Engineers, Washington, DC 20314-1000 for approval.
