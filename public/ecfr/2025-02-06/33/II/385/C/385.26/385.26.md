# § 385.26   Project Implementation Reports.

(a) *General requirements.* (1) The Project Implementation Report is a document that provides information on plan formulation and evaluation, engineering and design, estimated benefits and costs, environmental effects, and the additional information and analysis necessary for the Secretary of the Army to approve the project for implementation, or for Congress to authorize the project for implementation. The Project Implementation Report bridges the gap between the conceptual level of detail contained in the “Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,” dated April 1, 1999 and the detailed design necessary to prepare plans and specifications required to proceed to construction. Prior to requesting approval or authorization for the implementation of a project, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, complete a Project Implementation Report addressing the project's justification in accordance with section 601(f)(2) of WRDA 2000, and other factors required by section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000. To eliminate duplication with State and local procedures, the Project Implementation Report shall also address the factors of relevant State laws, including sections 373.1501 and 373.470 of the Florida Statutes.


(2) Before completion of the draft Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall provide the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force with information about the alternative plans developed and evaluated for the Project Implementation Report.


(3) The Project Implementation Report shall:


(i) Be consistent with the Plan and applicable law, policy, and regulation, including the Principles and Guidelines of the Water Resources Council, as modified by section 601(f)(2)(A) of WRDA 2000;

(xv) Describe how the project contributes to the achievement of interim goals established pursuant to § 385.38 and the interim targets established pursuant to § 385.39; 


(xvi) Include, in accordance with § 385.28(c), a draft Project Operating Manual as an appendix; and 


(xvii) Include, as appropriate, information necessary for the non-Federal sponsor to address the requirements of Chapter 373 of the Florida Statutes, and other applicable planning and reporting requirements of Florida law. 


(4) The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall develop the Project Implementation Report generally in accordance with the process shown in figure 2 in Appendix A of this part. 


(5) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall develop a guidance memorandum in accordance with § 385.5 for approval by the Secretary of the Army, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor, that describes the major tasks that are generally needed to prepare a Project Implementation Report and the format and content of a Project Implementation Report. 


(b) *Formulation and evaluation.* In preparing a Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall formulate and evaluate alternative plans to optimize the project's contributions towards achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan, and to develop justified and cost-effective ways to achieve the benefits of the Plan. 


(1) *General.* The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall develop a guidance memorandum in accordance with § 385.5 for approval by the Secretary of the Army, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor, that describes the processes to be used to formulate and evaluate alternative plans and their associated monetary and non-monetary benefits and costs, determine cost-effectiveness and optimize the project's contribution towards achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan, and the basis for justifying and selecting an alternative to be recommended for implementation. The guidance memorandum shall also provide a process for evaluating projects that are outside the boundary of regional computer models or projects whose effects cannot be captured in regional computer models. Project Implementation Reports approved by the Secretary of the Army before December 12, 2003 or before the development of the guidance memorandum may use whatever method that, in the Secretary of the Army's discretion, is deemed appropriate and is consistent with applicable law, policy, and regulations. 


(2) *Project formulation and evaluation.* The guidance memorandum shall describe the process for formulating and evaluating alternative plans for their ability to optimize contributions for achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan. The guidance memorandum shall describe the process for including each alternative plan with all of the other components of the Plan and evaluating the total monetary and non-monetary benefits and costs of the resulting comprehensive plan when compared to the without CERP condition. In formulating alternative plans to be evaluated, the project as described in the “Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,” dated April 1, 1999 shall be included as one of the alternative plans that is evaluated. For the selected plan, the guidance memorandum shall also describe the process for evaluating that plan as the next-added increment of the Plan. 


(3) *Identification of selected alternative plan.* The guidance memorandum shall also include a process for identification of a selected alternative plan, based on the analyses conducted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The alternative plan to be selected should be the plan that maximizes net benefits, both monetary and non-monetary, on a system-wide basis, provided that this plan is justified on a next-added increment basis. Alternative plans that are not justified on a next-added increment basis shall not be selected. The guidance memorandum shall describe an iterative process for evaluating and/or combining alternative options until an alternative is identified that maximizes net benefits while still providing benefits that justify costs on a next-added increment basis. 


(c) *RECOVER performance evaluation of alternative plans.* (1) Prior to the identification of a selected alternative plan, RECOVER shall evaluate the performance of alternative plans towards achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan. 


(2) RECOVER shall prepare information for the Project Delivery Team describing the results of the evaluations of alternative plans developed for the Project Implementation Report towards achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan, including, as appropriate, suggestions for improving the performance of the alternative plans.
