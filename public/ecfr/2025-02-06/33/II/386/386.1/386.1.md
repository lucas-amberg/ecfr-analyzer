The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) authorized a new Federal credit program for water resources infrastructure projects to be administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Title 1, Division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and Division J, Title III of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act limits the program to safety projects to maintain, upgrade, and repair dams identified in the National Inventory of Dams with a primary owner type of State, local government, public utility or private. The purpose of this rule is to establish the process by which the Corps will administer such credit assistance, including the assessment of fees, and to set forth the policies and procedures that the Corps will use for receiving, evaluating, approving applications, and servicing and monitoring direct loans and loan guarantees.
