(a) Only a Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement executed by the Secretary can obligate the Corps to issue a loan or loan guarantee. The Corps is not bound by oral representations. Each Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee Agreement shall contain the following requirements and conditions, and shall not be executed until the Corps determines that the following requirements and conditions are satisfied:


(1) Except if explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress, no Federal funds, proceeds of Federal loans, or proceeds of loans guaranteed by the Federal Government may be used by a borrower to pay for credit subsidy costs, administrative fees, or other fees charged by or paid to the Corps relating to the WIFIA program; however, proceeds of the Federal credit instrument may be used to pay for such administrative or other fees but may not be used to pay an “Optional Credit Subsidy Fee”.


(2) At closing, the Corps will ensure that the following requirements and conditions are or will be satisfied pursuant to the credit agreement or otherwise:


(i) The project qualifies as an eligible project under WIFIA;


(ii) The face value of the credit agreement is limited to no more than 49 percent of reasonably anticipated eligible project costs, or if credit assistance in excess of 49 percent has been approved, no more than the percentage of eligible project costs agreed upon, not to exceed 80 percent of total project costs;


(iii) If the credit instrument is a loan guarantee, the loan guarantee does not finance, either directly or indirectly, tax exempt debt obligations, consistent with the requirements of section 149(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;


(iv) The amount of the credit agreement, when combined with other funds, will be sufficient to carry out the project, including adequate contingency funds;

(xiii) Loan proceeds provided under the agreement shall not be utilized by the applicant to provide cash contributions to the Corps for project related costs, except for such fees as allowed by 33 U.S.C. 3908(b)(7), limited to the application, transaction processing, and servicing fees as described in § 386.15;


(xiv) Costs incurred with loan proceeds under the agreement shall not be eligible for reimbursement or for the transfer of credit toward the non-Federal cost share of another federally authorized project;


(xv) The credit agreement and related agreements contain such other terms and conditions as the Corps deems reasonable and necessary to protect the interests of the United States, including without limitation provisions for:


(A) Such collateral and other credit support for the credit agreement; and


(B) Such collateral sharing, priorities and voting rights among creditors and other intercreditor arrangements as, in each case, the Corps deems reasonable and necessary to protect the interests of the United States; and


(3) The credit agreement must contain audit provisions which provide, in substance, as follows:


(i) The applicant must keep such records concerning the project as are necessary to facilitate an effective and accurate audit and performance evaluation of the project; and


(ii) The Corps and the Inspector General, or their duly authorized representatives, must have access, for the purpose of audit and examination, to any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the applicant. Examination of records may be made during the regular business hours of the applicant, or at any other time mutually convenient.


(4) OMB has reviewed and approved the Corps calculation of the Credit Subsidy Cost of the Loan or Loan Guarantee.


(b) The Corps will set a closing date. By the closing date, the prospective borrower must have satisfied all of the detailed terms and conditions required by the Corps and all other contractual, statutory, and regulatory requirements. In addition, the prospective borrower must have provided at least one final rating opinion letter which provides a credit rating on the final negotiated direct loan or Loan Guarantee Agreement that does not take into account the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The prospective borrower must submit this final credit rating letter to the Corps prior to closing. If the prospective borrower has not satisfied all such terms and conditions by the closing date, the Secretary may set a new closing date or reject the application.


(c) The execution of a Loan Agreement or Loan Guarantee shall represent approval of the application for credit assistance and shall represent the legal obligation of budget authority.
