# ยง 386.9   Investment-grade ratings.

(a) At the time a prospective borrower submits an application, the Corps shall require a preliminary rating opinion letter. The letter is a conditional credit assessment from a NRSRO that provides a preliminary indication of the project's overall creditworthiness and that specifically addresses the potential of the project's senior debt obligations, which may include, or be limited to, the Federal credit instrument to achieve an investment-grade rating, and address the rating of obligations similar to those proposed for the Federal credit instrument when the Federal credit instrument is not a senior debt obligation. The requirement of this paragraph (a) may be met, on a case-by-case basis, by accepting a recent credit rating of obligations that have a lien on the revenues pledged for repayment. This rating should be based on an unenhanced analysis of the underlying pledged source of repayment and not give any credit to any prospective loan guarantee provided by the U.S. Government.


(b) Consistent with 33 U.S.C. 3907(a)(D)(ii), the full funding of a Federal credit instrument shall be contingent on:


(1) The assignment of investment-grade ratings by NRSROs to all project obligations that have a lien on the pledged security senior to that of the Federal credit instrument on the pledged security; or


(2)(i) In the event that the Federal credit instrument is:


(A) A senior debt obligation;


(B) Pari passu with the senior project obligations; or


(C) A general obligation of the prospective borrower, to the Federal credit instrument.


(ii) The applicant must provide at least one final rating opinion letter which provides a credit rating on the direct loan or the unenhanced Federal credit instrument. This rating should be based on an unenhanced analysis of the underlying pledged source of repayment and not give any credit to the loan or loan guarantee provided by the U.S. Government.


(c) Neither the preliminary rating opinion letter nor the final ratings should reflect the effect of bond insurance, unless that insurance provides credit enhancement that secures WIFIA obligation.
