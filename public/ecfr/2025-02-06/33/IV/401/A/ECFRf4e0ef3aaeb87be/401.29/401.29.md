(c) Any vessel will be permitted to load at an increased draught of not more than 7 cm above the maximum permissible draught in effect as prescribed under paragraph (b) of this section if it is equipped with a Draught Information System (DIS) and meets the following:


(1) An operational Draught Information System (DIS) approved by a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) as compliant with the Implementation Specifications found at *www.greatlakes-seaway.com* and having onboard:

(3) Any vessel not yet approved, but intending to use the DIS in the Seaway must notify the Manager or the Corporation at least 96 hours in advance so that arrangements can be made for appropriate testing for approval to use the DIS to transit the Seaway.


(4) A vessel already approved to use the DIS to transit the Seaway must email a completed DIS Confirmation Checklist (found at *www.greatlakes-seaway.com*) to *slsmcmarineservices@seaway.ca* 96 hours prior to its initial transit of the navigation season.
