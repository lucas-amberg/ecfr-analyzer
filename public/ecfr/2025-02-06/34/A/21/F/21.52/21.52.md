# § 21.52   Initial decision by an adjudicative officer in applications subject to CRRA jurisdiction.

(a) If the application is subject to the jurisdiction of the CRRA, the adjudicative officer shall issue the initial decision within 30 days after completion of the proceedings. 


(b) The initial decision must include the information required under § 21.51(b). However, instead of the information required under § 21.51(b)(3), the initial decision must inform the applicant of— 


(1) Its right to request review by the CRRA; and 


(2) Its right to request review by the Secretary of the CRRA's final decision. 


(c) If the applicant or the Department's counsel appeals the adjudicative officer's initial decision, the appeal must be submitted to the CRRA, in writing, within 30 days after the initial decision is issued. 


(d) If the applicant or the Department's counsel does not appeal the adjudicative officer's initial decision to the CRRA and the Secretary does not decide to review the initial decision under § 21.54(a), the initial decision becomes the Department's final decision 60 days after it is issued by the officer.
