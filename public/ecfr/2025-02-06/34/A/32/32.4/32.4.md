# § 32.4   Employee response.

(a) *Voluntary repayment agreement.* Within 7 days of receipt of the written notice under § 32.3, the employee may submit a request to the Secretary to arrange for a voluntary repayment schedule. To arrange for a voluntary repayment schedule, the employee shall submit a financial statement and sign a written repayment agreement approved by the Secretary. An employee who arranges for a voluntary repayment schedule may nonetheless request a waiver of the overpayment under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Waiver.* An employee seeking a waiver of collection of the debt that is authorized by law must request the waiver in writing to the Secretary within 10 days of receipt of the written notice under § 32.3. The employee must state why he or she believes a waiver should be granted.


(c) *Involuntary repayment schedule.* If the employee claims that the amount of the involuntary deduction will cause extreme financial hardship and should be reduced, he or she must submit a written explanation and a financial statement signed under oath or affirmation to the Secretary within 10 days of receipt of the written notice under § 32.3. An employee who fails to submit this financial information in a timely manner waives the right to object to the involuntary repayment schedule at a hearing under § 32.5. The Secretary notifies the employee, in writing, whether the Secretary will reduce the rate of the involuntary deduction.
