(d) The ALJ may not grant a written motion before the time for filing responses to the motion has expired, except upon consent of the parties or following a hearing on the motion, but may overrule or deny the motion without awaiting a response. 


(e) The ALJ shall make a reasonable effort to dispose of all outstanding motions prior to the beginning of the hearing.
