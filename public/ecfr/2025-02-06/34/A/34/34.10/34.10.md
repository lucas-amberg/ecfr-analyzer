# § 34.10   Conditions for a paper hearing.

We provide a paper hearing—


(a) If you request a paper hearing; 


(b) If you requested an oral hearing, but we determine under § 34.9(e) that you have withdrawn that request; 


(c) If you fail to appear for a scheduled oral hearing, as provided in § 34.15; or 


(d) If we deny a request for an oral hearing because we conclude that, by a review of the written record, we can resolve the issues raised by your objections.
