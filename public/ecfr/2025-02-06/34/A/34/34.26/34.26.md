# § 34.26   Ending garnishment.

(a)(1) A garnishment order we issue is effective until we rescind the order. 


(2) If an employer is unable to honor a garnishment order because the amount available for garnishment is insufficient to pay any portion of the amount stated in the order, the employer must—


(i) Notify us; and 


(ii) Comply with the order when sufficient disposable pay is available. 


(b) After we have fully recovered the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and collection costs, we send the debtor's employer notification to stop wage withholding.
