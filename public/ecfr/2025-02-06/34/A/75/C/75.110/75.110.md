# § 75.110   Information regarding performance measurement.

(a) The Secretary may establish, in an application notice for a competition, one or more program performance measurement requirements, including requirements for performance measures, baseline data, or performance targets, and a requirement that applicants propose in their applications one or more of their own project-specific performance measures, baseline data, or performance targets and ensure that the applicant's project-specific performance measurement plan would, if well implemented, yield quality data.


(b) If the application notice establishes program performance measurement requirements, the applicant must also describe in the application—


(1)(i) The data collection and reporting methods the applicant would use and why those methods are likely to yield reliable, valid, and meaningful performance data; and


(ii) If the Secretary requires applicants to collect data after the substantive work of a project is complete in order to measure progress toward attaining certain performance targets, the data-collection and reporting methods the applicant would use during the post-performance period and why those methods are likely to yield quality data.


(2) The applicant's capacity to collect and report the quality of the performance data, as evidenced by quality data collection, analysis, and reporting in other projects or research.


(c) If an application notice requires applicants to propose project-specific performance measures, baseline data, or performance targets, the application must include the following, as required by the application notice:


(1) *Project-specific performance measures.* How each proposed project-specific performance measure would: accurately measure the performance of the project; be consistent with the program performance measures established under paragraph (a) of this section; and be used to inform continuous improvement of the project.


(2) *Baseline data.* (i) Why each proposed baseline is valid and reliable, including an assessment of the quality data used to establish the baseline; or


(ii) If the applicant has determined that there are no established baseline data for a particular performance measure, an explanation of why there is no established baseline and of how and when, during the project period, the applicant would establish a valid baseline for the performance measure.


(3) *Performance targets.* Why each proposed performance target is ambitious yet achievable compared to the baseline for the performance measure and when, during the project period, the applicant would meet the performance target(s).
