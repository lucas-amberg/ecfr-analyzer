(b) *Extension of project period with prior approval.* At the conclusion of the project period extension authorized under paragraph (a) of this section, or in any case in which a project period extension is not authorized under paragraph (a) of this section, a grantee, with prior approval of the Secretary, may extend a project for an additional period if—


(1) The extension is not otherwise prohibited by statute, regulations, or the conditions of an award;


(2) The extension does not involve the obligation of additional Federal funds;


(3) The extension is to carry out the approved objectives and scope of the project; and


(4)(i) The Secretary determines that, due to special or unusual circumstances applicable to a class of grantees, the project periods for the grantees should be extended; or

(c) *Waiver.* The Secretary may waive the requirement in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if—


(1) The grantee could not reasonably have known of the need for the extension on or before the start of the 45-day period; or
