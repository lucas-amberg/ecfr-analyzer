(A) The goals and objectives of the project; and


(B) The performance targets in the grantee's approved application, if the Secretary established performance measurement requirements for the grant in the application notice; or


(ii) Obtain the Secretary's approval for changes to the project that—

(4) Maintain financial and administrative management systems that meet the requirements in 2 CFR 200.302 and 200.303; and


(5) Receive a determination from the Secretary that continuation of the project is in the best interest of the Federal Government.


(b) *Information considered in making a continuation award.* In determining whether the grantee has met the requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may consider any relevant information regarding grantee performance. This includes considering reports required by § 75.118, performance measures established under § 75.110, financial information required by 2 CFR part 200, and any other relevant information.


(c) *Funding for continuation awards.* Subject to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in selecting applications for funding under a program, the Secretary gives priority to continuation awards over new grants.


(d) *Budget period.* If the Secretary makes a continuation award under this section—


(1) The Secretary makes the award under §§ 75.231 through 75.236; and


(2) The new budget period begins on the day after the previous budget period ends.


(e) *Amount of continuation award.* (1) Within the original project period of the grant and notwithstanding any requirements in 2 CFR part 200, a grantee may expend funds that have not been obligated at the end of a budget period for obligations in subsequent budget periods if—


(i) The obligation is for an allowable cost within the approved scope and objectives of the project; and


(ii) The obligation is not otherwise prohibited by applicable statutes, regulations, or the conditions of an award.


(2) The Secretary may—


(i) Require the grantee to submit a written statement describing how the funds made available under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be used; and


(ii) Determine the amount of new funds that the Department will make available for the subsequent budget period after considering the statement the grantee provides under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and any other information available to the Secretary about the use of funds under the grant.


(3) In determining the amount of new funds to make available to a grantee under this section, the Secretary considers whether the unobligated funds made available are needed to complete activities that were planned for completion in the prior budget period.


(4) A decision to reduce the amount of a continuation award under this paragraph (e) does not entitle a grantee to reconsideration under 2 CFR 200.342.


(f) *Decision not to make a continuation award.* The Secretary may decide not to make a continuation award if—


(1) A grantee fails to meet any of the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section; or


(2) A grantee fails to ensure that data submitted to the Department as a condition of the grant meet the definition of “quality data” in 34 CFR 77.1(c) and does not have a plan acceptable to the Secretary for addressing data-quality issues in the next budget period.


(g) *Request for reconsideration.* If the Secretary decides not to make a continuation award under this section, the Secretary will notify the grantee of that decision, the grounds on which it is based, and, consistent with 2 CFR 200.342, provide the grantee with an opportunity to request reconsideration of the decision.


(1) A request for reconsideration must—


(i) Be submitted in writing to the Department official identified in the notice denying the continuation award by the date specified in that notice; and


(ii) Set forth the grantee's basis for disagreeing with the Secretary's decision not to make a continuation award and include relevant supporting documentation.


(2) The Secretary will consider the request for reconsideration.


(h) *No-cost extension when a continuation award is not made.* If the Secretary decides not to make a continuation award under this section, the Secretary may authorize a no-cost extension of the last budget period of the grant in order to provide for the orderly closeout of the grant.


(i) *A decision to reduce or not to make a continuation award does not constitute withholding.* A decision by the Secretary to reduce the amount of a continuation award under paragraph (e) of this section or to not make a continuation award under paragraph (f) of this section does not constitute a withholding under section 455 of GEPA (20 U.S.C. 1234d).
