# § 75.215   How the Department selects a new project.

Sections 75.216 through 75.222 describe the process the Secretary uses to select applications for new grants. All these sections apply to a discretionary grant program.

(See § 75.1(b) Discretionary grant programs, § 75.1(c) Formula grant programs, and § 75.200, How applications for new discretionary grants and cooperative agreements are selected for funding; standards for use of cooperative agreements.)
