# § 75.561   Approval of indirect cost rates and cost allocation plans.

(a) If the Department of Education is the cognizant agency, the Secretary approves an indirect cost rate or cost allocation plan for a grantee that is eligible and does not elect a *de minimis* rate, and is not a local educational agency. For the purposes of this section, the term “local educational agency” does not include a State agency.






(b) Each State educational agency, on the basis of a plan approved by the Secretary, shall approve an indirect cost rate for each local educational agency that requests it to do so. 


(c) The Secretary generally approves indirect cost rate agreements annually. Indirect cost rate agreements may be approved for periods longer than a year if the Secretary determines that rates will be sufficiently stable to justify a longer rate period.
