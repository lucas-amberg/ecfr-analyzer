# § 75.563   Restricted indirect cost rate or cost allocation plans—programs covered.

If a grantee or subgrantee decides to charge indirect costs to a program that is subject to a statutory prohibition on using Federal funds to supplant non-Federal funds, the grantee must—


(a) Use a negotiated restricted indirect cost rate or restricted cost allocation plan compliant with 34 CFR 76.564 through 76.569; or


(b) Elect to use an indirect cost rate of 8 percent of the modified total direct costs (MTDC) base if the grantee or subgrantee does not have a negotiated restricted indirect cost rate. MTDC is defined in 2 CFR 200.1. If the Secretary determines that the grantee or subgrantee would have a lower rate under 34 CFR 76.564 through 76.569, the lower rate must be used on the affected program.


(c) If the grantee has established a threshold for equipment that is lower than the amount specified in the Uniform Guidance, the grantee must use that threshold to exclude equipment from the MTDC base.


(d) For purposes of the MTDC base and application of the 8 percent rate, MTDC includes up to the amount specified in the definition of MTDC in the Uniform Guidance of each subaward, each year.
