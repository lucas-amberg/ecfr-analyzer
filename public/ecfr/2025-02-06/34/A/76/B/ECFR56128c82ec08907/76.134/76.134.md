# § 76.134   What is the relationship between consolidated and non-consolidated grants?

(a) An Insular Area may request that any State-administered formula grant programs be included in its consolidated grant and may apply separately for assistance under any other of those programs for which it is eligible.


(b) Those programs that an Insular Area decides to exclude from consolidation—for which it must submit separate plans or applications—are implemented in accordance with the applicable applicable statutes and regulations. The excluded programs are not subject to the provisions for allocation of funds among programs in a consolidated grant.
