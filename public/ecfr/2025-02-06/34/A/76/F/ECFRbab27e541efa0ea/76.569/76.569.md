# § 76.569   Using the restricted indirect cost rate.

(a) Under the programs referenced in §§ 75.563 and 76.563, the maximum amount of indirect costs recovery under a grant is determined by the following formula: Indirect costs = (Restricted indirect cost rate) × (Total direct costs of the grant minus capital outlays, subawards exceeding amount specified in the definition of Modified Total Direct Cost in the Uniform Guidance each, per year, and other distorting or unallowable items as specified in the grantee's indirect cost rate agreement)




(b) If a grantee uses a restricted indirect cost rate, the general management and fixed costs covered by that rate must be excluded by the grantee from the direct costs it charges to the grant.
