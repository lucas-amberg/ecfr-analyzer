(a) An SEA that allocates more or fewer funds to a charter school LEA than the amount for which the charter school LEA is eligible, based on actual enrollment or eligibility data when the charter school LEA opens or significantly expands its enrollment, must make appropriate adjustments to the amount of funds allocated to the charter school LEA as well as to other LEAs under the applicable program.


(b) Any adjustments to allocations to charter school LEAs under this subpart must be based on actual enrollment or other eligibility data for the charter school LEA on or after the date the charter school LEA first opens or significantly expands its enrollment, even if allocations or adjustments to allocations to other LEAs in the State are based on enrollment or eligibility data from a prior year.
