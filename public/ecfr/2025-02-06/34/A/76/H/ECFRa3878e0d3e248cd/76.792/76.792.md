# ยง 76.792   How does an SEA allocate funds to eligible charter school LEAs under a covered program in which the SEA awards subgrants on a formula basis?

(a) For each eligible charter school LEA that opens or significantly expands its enrollment on or before November 1 of an academic year, the SEA must implement procedures that ensure that the charter school LEA receives the proportionate amount of funds for which the charter school LEA is eligible under each covered program.


(b) For each eligible charter school LEA that opens or significantly expands its enrollment after November 1 but before February 1 of an academic year, the SEA must implement procedures that ensure that the charter school LEA receives at least a *pro rata* portion of the proportionate amount of funds for which the charter school LEA is eligible under each covered program. The *pro rata* amount must be based on the number of months or days during the academic year the charter school LEA will participate in the program as compared to the total number of months or days in the academic year.


(c) For each eligible charter school LEA that opens or significantly expands its enrollment on or after February 1 of an academic year, the SEA may implement procedures to provide the charter school LEA with a *pro rata* portion of the proportionate amount of funds for which the charter school LEA is eligible under each covered program.
