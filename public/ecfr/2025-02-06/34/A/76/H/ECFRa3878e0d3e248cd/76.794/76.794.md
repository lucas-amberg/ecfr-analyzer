# ยง 76.794   How does an SEA allocate funds to charter school LEAs under a covered program in which the SEA awards subgrants on a discretionary basis?

(a) *Competitive programs.* (1) For covered programs in which the SEA awards subgrants on a competitive basis, the SEA must provide each eligible charter school LEA in the State that is scheduled to open on or before the closing date of any competition under the program a full and fair opportunity to apply to participate in the program.


(2) An SEA is not required to delay the competitive process in order to allow a charter school LEA that has not yet opened or significantly expanded its enrollment to compete for funds under a covered program.


(b) *Noncompetitive discretionary programs.* The requirements in this subpart do not apply to discretionary programs or portions of programs under which the SEA does not award subgrants through a competition.
