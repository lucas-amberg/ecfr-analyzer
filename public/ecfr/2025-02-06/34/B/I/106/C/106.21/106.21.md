# § 106.21   Admission.

(a) *Status generally.* No person shall, on the basis of sex, be denied admission, or be subjected to discrimination in admission, by any recipient to which this subpart applies.


(b) *Specific prohibitions.* (1) In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which this subpart applies shall not: 


(i) Give preference to one person over another on the basis of sex, by ranking applicants separately on such basis, or otherwise; 


(ii) Apply numerical limitations upon the number or proportion of persons of either sex who may be admitted; or 


(iii) Otherwise treat one individual differently from another on the basis of sex. 


(2) A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for admission which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria which do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable. 


(c) *Parental, family, or marital status; pregnancy or related conditions.* In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which this subpart applies:


(1) Must treat pregnancy or related conditions in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary medical conditions; and


(2) Must not:


(i) Adopt or implement any policy, practice, or procedure concerning the current, potential, or past parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant that treats persons differently on the basis of sex;


(ii) Discriminate against any person on the basis of current, potential, or past pregnancy or related conditions, or adopt or implement any policy, practice, or procedure that so discriminates; and


(iii) Make a pre-admission inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for admission, including whether such applicant is “Miss or Mrs.” A recipient may ask an applicant to self-identify their sex, but only if this question is asked of all applicants and if the response is not used as a basis for discrimination prohibited by this part.
