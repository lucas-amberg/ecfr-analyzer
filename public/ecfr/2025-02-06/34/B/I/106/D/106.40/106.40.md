# ยง 106.40   Parental, family, or marital status; pregnancy or related conditions.

(a) *Status generally.* A recipient must not adopt or implement any policy, practice, or procedure concerning a student's current, potential, or past parental, family, or marital status that treats students differently on the basis of sex.


(b) *Pregnancy or related conditions.* (1) *Nondiscrimination.* A recipient must not discriminate in its education program or activity against any student based on the student's current, potential, or past pregnancy or related conditions. A recipient does not engage in prohibited discrimination when it allows a student, based on pregnancy or related conditions, to voluntarily participate in a separate portion of its education program or activity provided the recipient ensures that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to students who are not pregnant and do not have related conditions.


(2) *Responsibility to provide Title IX Coordinator contact and other information.* A recipient must ensure that when a student, or a person who has a legal right to act on behalf of the student, informs any employee of the student's pregnancy or related conditions, unless the employee reasonably believes that the Title IX Coordinator has been notified, the employee promptly provides that person with the Title IX Coordinator's contact information and informs that person that the Title IX Coordinator can coordinate specific actions to prevent sex discrimination and ensure the student's equal access to the recipient's education program or activity.


(3) *Specific actions to prevent discrimination and ensure equal access.* A recipient must take specific actions under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section to promptly and effectively prevent sex discrimination and ensure equal access to the recipient's education program or activity once the student, or a person who has a legal right to act on behalf of the student, notifies the Title IX Coordinator of the student's pregnancy or related conditions. The Title IX Coordinator must coordinate these actions.


(i) *Responsibility to provide information about recipient obligations.* The recipient must inform the student, and if applicable, the person who notified the Title IX Coordinator of the student's pregnancy or related conditions and has a legal right to act on behalf of the student, of the recipient's obligations under paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section and ยง 106.44(j) and provide the recipient's notice of nondiscrimination under ยง 106.8(c)(1).


(ii) *Reasonable modifications.* (A) The recipient must make reasonable modifications to the recipient's policies, practices, or procedures as necessary to prevent sex discrimination and ensure equal access to the recipient's education program or activity. Each reasonable modification must be based on the student's individualized needs. In determining what modifications are required under this paragraph, the recipient must consult with the student. A modification that a recipient can demonstrate would fundamentally alter the nature of its education program or activity is not a reasonable modification.


(B) The student has discretion to accept or decline each reasonable modification offered by the recipient. If a student accepts a recipient's offered reasonable modification, the recipient must implement it.


(C) Reasonable modifications may include, but are not limited to, breaks during class to express breast milk, breastfeed, or attend to health needs associated with pregnancy or related conditions, including eating, drinking, or using the restroom; intermittent absences to attend medical appointments; access to online or homebound education; changes in schedule or course sequence; extensions of time for coursework and rescheduling of tests and examinations; allowing a student to sit or stand, or carry or keep water nearby; counseling; changes in physical space or supplies (for example, access to a larger desk or a footrest); elevator access; or other changes to policies, practices, or procedures.


(iii) *Voluntary access to separate and comparable portion of program or activity.* The recipient must allow the student to voluntarily access any separate and comparable portion of the recipient's education program or activity under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(iv) *Voluntary leaves of absence.* The recipient must allow the student to voluntarily take a leave of absence from the recipient's education program or activity to cover, at minimum, the period of time deemed medically necessary by the student's licensed healthcare provider. To the extent that a student qualifies for leave under a leave policy maintained by a recipient that allows a greater period of time than the medically necessary period, the recipient must permit the student to take voluntary leave under that policy instead if the student so chooses. When the student returns to the recipient's education program or activity, the student must be reinstated to the academic status and, as practicable, to the extracurricular status that the student held when the voluntary leave began.


(v) *Lactation space.* The recipient must ensure that the student can access a lactation space, which must be a space other than a bathroom, that is clean, shielded from view, free from intrusion from others, and may be used by a student for expressing breast milk or breastfeeding as needed.


(vi) *Limitation on supporting documentation.* A recipient must not require supporting documentation under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (v) unless the documentation is necessary and reasonable for the recipient to determine the reasonable modifications to make or whether to take additional specific actions under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (v). Examples of situations when requiring supporting documentation is not necessary and reasonable include, but are not limited to, when the student's need for a specific action under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (v) is obvious, such as when a student who is pregnant needs a bigger uniform; when the student has previously provided the recipient with sufficient supporting documentation; when the reasonable modification because of pregnancy or related conditions at issue is allowing a student to carry or keep water nearby and drink, use a bigger desk, sit or stand, or take breaks to eat, drink, or use the restroom; when the student has lactation needs; or when the specific action under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (v) is available to students for reasons other than pregnancy or related conditions without submitting supporting documentation.


(4) *Comparable treatment to other temporary medical conditions.* To the extent consistent with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a recipient must treat pregnancy or related conditions in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary medical conditions with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy the recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's education program or activity.


(5) *Certification to participate.* A recipient must not require a student who is pregnant or has related conditions to provide certification from a healthcare provider or any other person that the student is physically able to participate in the recipient's class, program, or extracurricular activity unless:


(i) The certified level of physical ability or health is necessary for participation in the class, program, or extracurricular activity;


(ii) The recipient requires such certification of all students participating in the class, program, or extracurricular activity; and


(iii) The information obtained is not used as a basis for discrimination prohibited by this part.
