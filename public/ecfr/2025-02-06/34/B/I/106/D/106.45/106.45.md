# § 106.45   Grievance procedures for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints of sex discrimination.

(a)(1) *General.* A recipient's grievance procedures for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints of sex discrimination must be in writing and include provisions that incorporate the requirements of this section. The requirements related to a respondent apply only to sex discrimination complaints alleging that a person violated the recipient's prohibition on sex discrimination. When a sex discrimination complaint alleges that a recipient's policy or practice discriminates on the basis of sex, the recipient is not considered a respondent.


(2) *Complaint.* The following persons have a right to make a complaint of sex discrimination, including complaints of sex-based harassment, requesting that the recipient investigate and make a determination about alleged discrimination under Title IX or this part:


(i) A complainant;


(ii) A parent, guardian, or other authorized legal representative with the legal right to act on behalf of a complainant;


(iii) The Title IX Coordinator, after making the determination specified in § 106.44(f)(1)(v);


(iv) With respect to complaints of sex discrimination other than sex-based harassment, in addition to the persons listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section,


(A) Any student or employee; or


(B) Any person other than a student or employee who was participating or attempting to participate in the recipient's education program or activity at the time of the alleged sex discrimination.


(b) *Basic requirements for grievance procedures.* A recipient's grievance procedures must:


(1) Treat complainants and respondents equitably;


(2) Require that any person designated as a Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or decisionmaker not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. The decisionmaker may be the same person as the Title IX Coordinator or investigator;


(3) Include a presumption that the respondent is not responsible for the alleged sex discrimination until a determination is made at the conclusion of the recipient's grievance procedures for complaints of sex discrimination;


(4) Establish reasonably prompt timeframes for the major stages of the grievance procedures, including a process that allows for the reasonable extension of timeframes on a case-by-case basis for good cause with notice to the parties that includes the reason for the delay. Major stages include, for example, evaluation (*i.e.,* the recipient's decision whether to dismiss or investigate a complaint of sex discrimination); investigation; determination; and appeal, if any;


(5) Require the recipient to take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of the parties and witnesses during the pendency of a recipient's grievance procedures, provided that the steps do not restrict the ability of the parties to: obtain and present evidence, including by speaking to witnesses, subject to § 106.71; consult with their family members, confidential resources, or advisors; or otherwise prepare for or participate in the grievance procedures;


(6) Require an objective evaluation of all evidence that is relevant, as defined in § 106.2, and not otherwise impermissible under paragraph (b)(7) of this section—including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence—and provide that credibility determinations must not be based on a person's status as a complainant, respondent, or witness;


(7) Exclude the following types of evidence, and questions seeking that evidence, as impermissible (*i.e.,* must not be accessed or considered, except by the recipient to determine whether an exception in paragraphs (i) through (iii) applies; must not be disclosed; and must not otherwise be used), regardless of whether they are relevant:


(i) Evidence that is protected under a privilege as recognized by Federal or State law or evidence provided to a confidential employee, unless the person to whom the privilege or confidentiality is owed has voluntarily waived the privilege or confidentiality;


(ii) A party's or witness's records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional in connection with the provision of treatment to the party or witness, unless the recipient obtains that party's or witness's voluntary, written consent for use in the recipient's grievance procedures; and


(iii) Evidence that relates to the complainant's sexual interests or prior sexual conduct, unless evidence about the complainant's prior sexual conduct is offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the alleged conduct or is evidence about specific incidents of the complainant's prior sexual conduct with the respondent that is offered to prove consent to the alleged sex-based harassment. The fact of prior consensual sexual conduct between the complainant and respondent does not by itself demonstrate or imply the complainant's consent to the alleged sex-based harassment or preclude determination that sex-based harassment occurred; and


(8) If a recipient adopts grievance procedures that apply to the resolution of some, but not all, complaints articulate consistent principles for how the recipient will determine which procedures apply.


(c) *Notice of allegations.* Upon initiation of the recipient's grievance procedures, a recipient must provide notice of the allegations to the parties whose identities are known.


(1) The notice must include:


(i) The recipient's grievance procedures under this section, and if applicable § 106.46, and any informal resolution process under § 106.44(k);


(ii) Sufficient information available at the time to allow the parties to respond to the allegations. Sufficient information includes the identities of the parties involved in the incident(s), the conduct alleged to constitute sex discrimination under Title IX or this part, and the date(s) and location(s) of the alleged incident(s), to the extent that information is available to the recipient;


(iii) A statement that retaliation is prohibited; and


(iv) A statement that the parties are entitled to an equal opportunity to access the relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence or an accurate description of this evidence as set out in paragraph (f)(4) of this section; and if the recipient provides a description of the evidence, the parties are entitled to an equal opportunity to access to the relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence upon the request of any party.


(2) If, in the course of an investigation, the recipient decides to investigate additional allegations of sex discrimination by the respondent toward the complainant that are not included in the notice provided under paragraph (c) of this section or that are included in a complaint that is consolidated under paragraph (e) of this section, the recipient must provide notice of the additional allegations to the parties whose identities are known.


(d) *Dismissal of a complaint.* (1) A recipient may dismiss a complaint of sex discrimination made through its grievance procedures under this section, and if applicable § 106.46, for any of the following reasons:


(i) The recipient is unable to identify the respondent after taking reasonable steps to do so;


(ii) The respondent is not participating in the recipient's education program or activity and is not employed by the recipient;


(iii) The complainant voluntarily withdraws any or all of the allegations in the complaint, the Title IX Coordinator declines to initiate a complaint under § 106.44(f)(1)(v), and the recipient determines that, without the complainant's withdrawn allegations, the conduct that remains alleged in the complaint, if any, would not constitute sex discrimination under Title IX or this part even if proven; or


(iv) The recipient determines the conduct alleged in the complaint, even if proven, would not constitute sex discrimination under Title IX or this part. Prior to dismissing the complaint under this paragraph, the recipient must make reasonable efforts to clarify the allegations with the complainant.


(2) Upon dismissal, a recipient must promptly notify the complainant of the basis for the dismissal. If the dismissal occurs after the respondent has been notified of the allegations, then the recipient must also notify the respondent of the dismissal and the basis for the dismissal promptly following notification to the complainant, or simultaneously if notification is in writing.


(3) A recipient must notify the complainant that a dismissal may be appealed and provide the complainant with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal of a complaint on the bases set out in § 106.46(i)(1). If the dismissal occurs after the respondent has been notified of the allegations, then the recipient must also notify the respondent that the dismissal may be appealed on the bases set out in § 106.46(i)(1). If the dismissal is appealed, the recipient must:


(i) Notify the parties of any appeal, including notice of the allegations consistent with paragraph (c) of this section if notice was not previously provided to the respondent;


(ii) Implement appeal procedures equally for the parties;


(iii) Ensure that the decisionmaker for the appeal did not take part in an investigation of the allegations or dismissal of the complaint;


(iv) Ensure that the decisionmaker for the appeal has been trained as set out in § 106.8(d)(2);


(v) Provide the parties a reasonable and equal opportunity to make a statement in support of, or challenging, the outcome; and


(vi) Notify the parties of the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result.


(4) A recipient that dismisses a complaint must, at a minimum:


(i) Offer supportive measures to the complainant as appropriate under § 106.44(g);


(ii) For dismissals under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section in which the respondent has been notified of the allegations, offer supportive measures to the respondent as appropriate under § 106.44(g); and


(iii) Require its Title IX Coordinator to take other appropriate prompt and effective steps to ensure that sex discrimination does not continue or recur within the recipient's education program or activity under § 106.44(f)(1)(vii).


(e) *Consolidation of complaints.* A recipient may consolidate complaints of sex discrimination against more than one respondent, or by more than one complainant against one or more respondents, or by one party against another party, when the allegations of sex discrimination arise out of the same facts or circumstances. If one of the complaints to be consolidated is a complaint of sex-based harassment involving a student complainant or student respondent at a postsecondary institution, the grievance procedures for investigating and resolving the consolidated complaint must comply with the requirements of § 106.46 in addition to the requirements of this section. When more than one complainant or more than one respondent is involved, references in this section and in § 106.46 to a party, complainant, or respondent include the plural, as applicable.


(f) *Complaint investigation.* A recipient must provide for adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints. To do so, the recipient must:


(1) Ensure that the burden is on the recipient—not on the parties—to conduct an investigation that gathers sufficient evidence to determine whether sex discrimination occurred;


(2) Provide an equal opportunity for the parties to present fact witnesses and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence that are relevant and not otherwise impermissible;


(3) Review all evidence gathered through the investigation and determine what evidence is relevant and what evidence is impermissible regardless of relevance, consistent with § 106.2 and with paragraph (b)(7) of this section; and


(4) Provide each party with an equal opportunity to access the evidence that is relevant to the allegations of sex discrimination and not otherwise impermissible, consistent with § 106.2 and with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, in the following manner:


(i) A recipient must provide an equal opportunity to access either the relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence, or an accurate description of this evidence. If the recipient provides a description of the evidence, it must further provide the parties with an equal opportunity to access the relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence upon the request of any party;


(ii) A recipient must provide a reasonable opportunity to respond to the evidence or to the accurate description of the evidence described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section; and


(iii) A recipient must take reasonable steps to prevent and address the parties' unauthorized disclosure of information and evidence obtained solely through the grievance procedures. For purposes of this paragraph, disclosures of such information and evidence for purposes of administrative proceedings or litigation related to the complaint of sex discrimination are authorized.


(g) *Questioning parties and witnesses to aid in evaluating allegations and assessing credibility.* A recipient must provide a process that enables the decisionmaker to question parties and witnesses to adequately assess a party's or witness's credibility to the extent credibility is both in dispute and relevant to evaluating one or more allegations of sex discrimination.


(h) *Determination whether sex discrimination occurred.* Following an investigation and evaluation of all relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, the recipient must:


(1) Use the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof to determine whether sex discrimination occurred, unless the recipient uses the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in all other comparable proceedings, including proceedings relating to other discrimination complaints, in which case the recipient may elect to use that standard of proof in determining whether sex discrimination occurred. Both standards of proof require the decisionmaker to evaluate relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence for its persuasiveness; if the decisionmaker is not persuaded under the applicable standard by the evidence that sex discrimination occurred, whatever the quantity of the evidence is, the decisionmaker must not determine that sex discrimination occurred.


(2) Notify the parties in writing of the determination whether sex discrimination occurred under Title IX or this part including the rationale for such determination, and the procedures and permissible bases for the complainant and respondent to appeal, if applicable;


(3) If there is a determination that sex discrimination occurred, as appropriate, require the Title IX Coordinator to coordinate the provision and implementation of remedies to a complainant and other persons the recipient identifies as having had equal access to the recipient's education program or activity limited or denied by sex discrimination, coordinate the imposition of any disciplinary sanctions on a respondent, including notification to the complainant of any such disciplinary sanctions, and require the Title IX Coordinator to take other appropriate prompt and effective steps to ensure that sex discrimination does not continue or recur within the recipient's education program or activity under § 106.44(f)(1)(vii). A recipient may not impose discipline on a respondent for sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX unless there is a determination at the conclusion of the recipient's grievance procedures that the respondent engaged in prohibited sex discrimination;


(4) Comply with § 106.45, and if applicable § 106.46, before the imposition of any disciplinary sanctions against a respondent; and


(5) Not discipline a party, witness, or others participating in a recipient's grievance procedures for making a false statement or for engaging in consensual sexual conduct based solely on the recipient's determination whether sex discrimination occurred.


(i) *Appeals.* In addition to an appeal of a dismissal consistent with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a recipient must offer the parties an appeal process that, at a minimum, is the same as it offers in all other comparable proceedings, if any, including proceedings relating to other discrimination complaints. For a complaint of sex-based harassment involving a student complainant or student respondent, a postsecondary institution must also offer an appeal on the bases set out in § 106.46(i)(1).


(j) *Additional provisions.* If a recipient adopts additional provisions as part of its grievance procedures for handling complaints of sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment, such additional provisions must apply equally to the parties.


(k) *Informal resolution.* In lieu of resolving a complaint through the recipient's grievance procedures, the parties may instead elect to participate in an informal resolution process under § 106.44(k) if provided by the recipient consistent with that paragraph.


(l) *Provisions limited to sex-based harassment complaints.* For complaints alleging sex-based harassment, the grievance procedures must:


(1) Describe the range of supportive measures available to complainants and respondents under § 106.44(g); and


(2) List, or describe the range of, the possible disciplinary sanctions that the recipient may impose and remedies that the recipient may provide following a determination that sex-based harassment occurred.
