# ยง 106.47   Assistant Secretary review of sex-based harassment complaints.

The Assistant Secretary will not deem a recipient to have violated this part solely because the Assistant Secretary would have reached a different determination in a particular complaint alleging sex-based harassment than a recipient reached under ยง 106.45, and if applicable ยง 106.46, based on the Assistant Secretary's independent weighing of the evidence.
