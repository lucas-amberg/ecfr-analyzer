(10) When, including the approximate time of day, the LEA will provide services.

(e)(1)(i) The LEA must maintain in its records and provide to the SEA a written affirmation, signed by officials of each private school with participating children or appropriate private school representatives, that the required consultation has occurred.


(ii) The LEA's written affirmation must provide the option for private school officials to indicate their belief that timely and meaningful consultation has not occurred or that the program design is not equitable with respect to eligible private school children.


(2) If the officials of the private schools do not provide the affirmations within a reasonable period of time, the LEA must submit to the SEA documentation that the required consultation occurred.


(f)(1) An official of a private school has the right to complain to the SEA that the LEA did not—


(i) Engage in timely and meaningful consultation;


(ii) Consider the views of the official of the private school; or


(iii) Make a decision that treats the private school students equitably.


(2) If a private school official wishes to file a complaint, the official must provide the basis of the noncompliance by the LEA to the SEA and the LEA must forward the appropriate documentation to the SEA.
