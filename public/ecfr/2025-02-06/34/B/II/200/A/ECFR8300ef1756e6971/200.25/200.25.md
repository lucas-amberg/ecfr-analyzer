# § 200.25   Schoolwide programs in general.

(a) *Purpose.* (1) The purpose of a schoolwide program is to improve academic achievement throughout a school so that all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students, demonstrate proficiency related to the challenging State academic standards under § 200.1. 


(2) The improved achievement is to result from improving the entire educational program of the school. 


(b) *Eligibility.* (1) A school may operate a schoolwide program if—


(i) The school's LEA determines that the school serves an eligible attendance area or is a participating school under section 1113 of the ESEA; and 


(ii) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, for the initial year of the schoolwide program—


(A) The school serves a school attendance area in which not less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families; or 


(B) Not less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from low-income families. 


(iii) A school that does not meet the poverty percentage in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section may operate a schoolwide program if the school receives a waiver from the State to do so, after taking into account how a schoolwide program will best serve the needs of the students in the school in improving academic achievement and other factors.


(2) In determining the percentage of children from low-income families under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the LEA may use a measure of poverty that is different from the measure or measures of poverty used by the LEA to identify and rank school attendance areas for eligibility and participation under this subpart.


(c) *Participating students and services.* A school operating a schoolwide program is not required to identify—


(1) Particular children as eligible to participate; or


(2) Individual services as supplementary.


(d) *Supplemental funds.* In accordance with the method of determination described in section 1118(b)(2) of the ESEA, a school participating in a schoolwide program must use funds available under this subpart and under any other Federal program included under paragraph (e) of this section and § 200.29 only to supplement the total amount of funds that would, in the absence of the funds under this subpart, be made available from non-Federal sources for that school, including funds needed to provide services that are required by law for children with disabilities and English learners.

(e) *Consolidation of funds.* An eligible school may, consistent with § 200.29, consolidate and use funds or services under subpart A of this part, together with other Federal, State, and local funds that the school receives, to operate a schoolwide program in accordance with §§ 200.25 through 200.29.


(f) *Prekindergarten program.* A school operating a schoolwide program may use funds made available under this subpart to establish or enhance prekindergarten programs for children below the age of 6.
