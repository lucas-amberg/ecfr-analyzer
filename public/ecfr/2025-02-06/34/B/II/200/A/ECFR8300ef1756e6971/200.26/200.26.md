# § 200.26   Core elements of a schoolwide program.

(a) *Comprehensive needs assessment.* (1) A school operating a schoolwide program must conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school that—


(i) Takes into account information on the academic achievement of all students in the school, including all subgroups of students under section 1111(c)(2) of the ESEA and migratory children as defined in section 1309(3) of the ESEA, relative to the challenging State academic standards under § 200.1 and any other factors as determined by the LEA to—


(A) Help the school understand the subjects and skills for which teaching and learning need to be improved; and


(B) Identify the specific academic needs of students and subgroups of students who are failing, or are at risk of failing, to meet the challenging State academic standards; and


(ii) Assesses the needs of the school relative to each of the components of the schoolwide program under section 1114(b)(7) of the ESEA.


(2) The comprehensive needs assessment must be developed with the participation of individuals who will carry out the schoolwide program plan. 


(3) The school must document how it conducted the needs assessment, the results it obtained, and the conclusions it drew from those results. 


(b) *Comprehensive plan.* Using data from the comprehensive needs assessment under paragraph (a) of this section, a school that wishes to operate a schoolwide program must develop a comprehensive plan, in accordance with section 1114(b) of the ESEA, that describes how the school will improve academic achievement for all students in the school, but particularly the needs of those students who are failing, or are at risk of failing, to meet the challenging State academic standards and any other factors as determined by the LEA.


(c) *Evaluation.* A school operating a schoolwide program must—


(1) Regularly monitor the implementation of, and results achieved by, the schoolwide program, using data from the State's annual assessments and other indicators of academic achievement;


(2) Determine whether the schoolwide program has been effective in increasing the achievement of students in meeting the challenging State academic standards, particularly for those students who had been furthest from achieving the standards; and


(3) Revise the plan, as necessary, based on the results of the regular monitoring, to ensure continuous improvement of students in the schoolwide program.
