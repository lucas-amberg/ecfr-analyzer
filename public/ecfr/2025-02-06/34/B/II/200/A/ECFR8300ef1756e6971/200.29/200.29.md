# § 200.29   Consolidation of funds in a schoolwide program.

(a)(1) In addition to funds under subpart A of this part, a school may consolidate and use in its schoolwide program Federal funds from any program administered by the Secretary that is included in the most recent notice published for this purpose in the _Federal Register._

(2) For purposes of §§ 200.25 through 200.29, the authority to consolidate funds from other Federal programs also applies to services provided to the school with those funds. 


(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, a school that consolidates and uses in a schoolwide program funds from any other Federal program administered by the Secretary—


(i) Is not required to meet the statutory or regulatory requirements of that program applicable at the school level; but


(ii) Must meet the intent and purposes of that program to ensure that the needs of the intended beneficiaries of that program are addressed. 


(2) A school that chooses to consolidate funds from other Federal programs must meet the requirements of those programs relating to— 


(i) Health; 


(ii) Safety; 


(iii) Civil rights; 


(iv) Student and parental participation and involvement; 


(v) Services to private school children; 


(vi) Maintenance of effort; 


(vii) Comparability of services; 


(viii) Use of Federal funds to supplement, not supplant non-Federal funds in accordance with § 200.25(d); and 


(ix) Distribution of funds to SEAs or LEAs. 


(c) A school must meet the following requirements if the school consolidates and uses funds from these programs in its schoolwide program: 


(1) *Migrant education.* Before the school chooses to consolidate in its schoolwide program funds received under part C of Title I of the ESEA, the school must— 


(i) Use these funds, in consultation with parents of migratory children or organizations representing those parents, or both, first to meet the unique educational needs of migratory students that result from the effects of their migratory lifestyle, and those other needs that are necessary to permit these students to participate effectively in school, as identified through the comprehensive Statewide needs assessment under § 200.83; and 


(ii) Document that these needs have been met. 


(2) *Indian education.* The school may consolidate funds received under subpart 1 of part A of title VI of the ESEA if—


(i) The parent committee established by the LEA under section 6114(c)(4) of the ESEA approves the inclusion of these funds;


(ii) The schoolwide program is consistent with the purpose described in section 6111 of the ESEA; and


(iii) The LEA identifies in its application how the use of such funds in a schoolwide program will produce benefits to Indian students that would not be achieved if the funds are not used in a schoolwide program.


(3) *Special education.* (i) The school may consolidate funds received under part B of the IDEA. 


(ii) However, the amount of funds consolidated may not exceed the amount received by the LEA under part B of IDEA for that fiscal year, divided by the number of children with disabilities in the jurisdiction of the LEA, and multiplied by the number of children with disabilities participating in the schoolwide program. 


(iii) The school may also consolidate funds received under section 7003(d) of the ESEA (Impact Aid) for children with disabilities in a schoolwide program.


(iv) A school that consolidates funds under part B of IDEA or section 7003(d) of the ESEA may use those funds for any activities under its schoolwide program plan but must comply with all other requirements of part B of IDEA, to the same extent it would if it did not consolidate funds under part B of IDEA or section 7003(d) of the ESEA in the schoolwide program.


(d) A school that consolidates and uses in a schoolwide program funds under subpart A of this part or from any other Federal program administered by the Secretary—


(1) Is not required to maintain separate fiscal accounting records, by program, that identify the specific activities supported by those particular funds; but


(2) Must maintain records that demonstrate that the schoolwide program, as a whole, addresses the intent and purposes of each of the Federal programs whose funds were consolidated to support the schoolwide program.


(e) Each State must modify or eliminate State fiscal and accounting barriers so that schools can easily consolidate funds from other Federal, State, and local sources in their schoolwide programs to improve educational opportunities and reduce unnecessary fiscal and accounting requirements.
