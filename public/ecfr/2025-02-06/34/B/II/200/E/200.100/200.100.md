# § 200.100   Reservation of funds for school improvement, State administration, and direct student services.

A State must reserve funds for school improvement, and may reserve funds for State administration and direct student services as follows:


(a) *School improvement.* (1) To carry out school improvement activities and the State's statewide system of technical assistance and support for LEAs authorized under sections 1003 and 1111(d) of the ESEA, an SEA must reserve the greater of—


(i) Seven percent from the sum of the amounts allocated to the State under section 1002(a) of the ESEA; or


(ii) The sum of the total amount that the State—


(A) Reserved for fiscal year 2016 under section 1003(a) of the ESEA as in effect on December 9, 2015; and


(B) Received for fiscal year 2016 under section 1003(g) of the ESEA as in effect on December 9, 2015.


(2) For fiscal year 2018 and subsequent years, in reserving funds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a State may not reduce the sum of the allocations an LEA receives under subpart 2 of part A of title I of the ESEA below the sum of the allocations the LEA received under subpart 2 for the preceding fiscal year.


(3) If funds under section 1002(a) are insufficient in a given fiscal year to implement both paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, a State is not required to reserve the full amount required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 


(b) *State administration.*(1) An SEA may reserve for State administrative activities authorized in sections 1004 and 1603 of the ESEA no more than the greater of—


(i) One percent from each of the amounts allocated to the State or Outlying Area under section 1002(a), (c), and (d) of the ESEA; or 


(ii) $400,000 ($50,000 for the Outlying Areas). 


(2)(i) An SEA reserving $400,000 under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section must reserve proportionate amounts from each of the amounts allocated to the State or Outlying Area under section 1002(a), but is not required to reserve proportionate amounts from section 1002(a), (c), and (d) of the ESEA. 


(ii) If an SEA reserves funds from the amounts allocated to the State or Outlying Area under section 1002(c) or (d) of the ESEA, the SEA may not reserve from those allocations more than the amount the SEA would have reserved if it had reserved proportionate amounts from section 1002(a), (c), and (d) of the ESEA. 


(3) If the sum of the amounts allocated to all the States under section 1002(a), (c), and (d) of the ESEA is greater than $14,000,000,000, an SEA may not reserve more than one percent of the amount the State would receive if $14,000,000,000 had been allocated among the States under section 1002(a), (c), and (d) of the ESEA. 


(4) An SEA may use the funds it has reserved under paragraph (b) of this section to perform general administrative activities necessary to carry out, at the State level, any of the programs authorized under Title I, parts A, C, and D of the ESEA. 


(c) *Direct student services.* To carry out direct student services authorized under section 1003A of the ESEA, an SEA may, after meaningful consultation with geographically diverse LEAs, reserve not more than three percent of the amounts allocated to the State under subpart 2 of part A of title I of the ESEA for each fiscal year.


(d) *Reservations and hold-harmless.* In reserving funds under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an SEA may— 


(1) Proportionately reduce each LEA's total allocation received under section 1002(a) of the ESEA while ensuring that no LEA receives in total less than the hold-harmless percentage under § 200.73(a)(4), except that, when the amount remaining is insufficient to pay all LEAs the hold-harmless amount provided in § 200.73, the SEA shall ratably reduce each LEA's hold-harmless allocation to the amount available; or 


(2) Proportionately reduce each LEA's total allocation received under subpart 2 of part A of title I of the ESEA even if an LEA's total allocation falls below its hold-harmless percentage under § 200.73(a)(4).
