# § 222.11   How does the Secretary recover overpayments?

Except as otherwise provided in §§ 222.12-222.18, the Secretary adjusts for and recovers overpayments as follows: 


(a) If the Secretary determines that an LEA has received a payment in excess of what it should have received under the Act and this part, the Secretary deducts the amount of the overpayment from subsequent payments for which the LEA is eligible under the Act. 


(b)(1) If the LEA is not eligible for subsequent payments under the Act, the LEA must promptly refund the amount of the overpayment to the Secretary. 


(2) If the LEA does not promptly repay the amount of the overpayment or promptly enter into a repayment agreement with the Secretary, the Secretary may use the procedures in 34 CFR part 30 to offset that amount against payments from other Department programs or, under the circumstances permitted in part 30, to request that another agency offset the debt.
