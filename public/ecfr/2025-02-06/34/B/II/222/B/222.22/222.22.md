# § 222.22   How does the Secretary treat compensation from Federal activities for purposes of determining eligibility and payments?

(a) An LEA with an otherwise approvable application is eligible to receive assistance under section 8002 for a fiscal year only if the LEA meets the requirements in subpart A of these regulations and § 222.21, and is not substantially compensated, for the loss in revenue resulting from Federal ownership of real property by increases in revenue accruing to the LEA during the previous fiscal year from Federal activities with respect to the eligible Federal property in the LEA. 


(b) The Secretary considers that an LEA is substantially compensated by increases in revenue from Federal activities with respect to the eligible Federal property if—


(1) The LEA received revenue during the preceding fiscal year that is generated from activities in or on the eligible Federal property; and


(2) The revenue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section equals or exceeds the maximum payment amount under section 8002(b) for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance. 


(c) If an LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section received revenue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section during the preceding fiscal year that, when added to the LEA's projected total section 8002 payment for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance, exceeds the maximum payment amount under section 8002(b) for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance, the Secretary reduces the LEA's projected section 8002 payment by an amount equal to that excess amount.


(d) For purposes of this section, the amount of revenue that an LEA receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property includes payments received by any Federal agency due to activities on Federal property, including forestry, mining, and grazing, but does not include revenue from:


(1) Payments received by the LEA from the Secretary of Defense to support—


(i) The operation of a domestic dependent elementary or secondary school; or


(ii) The provision of a free public education to dependents of members of the Armed Forces residing on or near a military installation;


(2) Payments from the Department; or


(3) Payments in Lieu of Taxes from the Department of Interior under 31 U.S.C. 6901 *et seq.*
