# § 222.41   How does a State educational agency compute and certify local contribution rates based upon generally comparable local educational agencies?

Except as otherwise specified in the Act, the SEA, subject to the Secretary's review and approval, computes and certifies an LCR for each group of generally comparable LEAs within its State that was identified using the factors in § 222.39, and § 222.40 if appropriate, as follows:


(a)(1) The SEA shall compile the aggregate local current expenditures of the comparable LEAs in each group for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed. 


(2) For purposes of this section, the SEA shall consider only those aggregate current expenditures made by the generally comparable LEAs from revenues derived from local sources. No State or Federal funds may be included. 


(b) The SEA shall compile the aggregate number of children in ADA to whom the generally comparable LEAs in each group provided a free public education during the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed. 


(c) The SEA shall divide— 


(1) The aggregate current expenditures determined under paragraph (a) of this section by; 


(2) The aggregate number of children determined under paragraph (b) of this section. 


(d) The SEA certifies the resulting figure for each group as the LCR for that group of generally comparable LEAs to be used by the Secretary under section 8003(b)(1)(C)(iii) in determining the LEA's maximum payment amount under section 8003.
