# ยง 222.54   What supplement-not-supplant requirement applies to this subpart?

Funds provided under section 8003(d) may not supplant any State funds that were or would have been available to the LEA for the free appropriate public education of children counted under section 8003(d). 


(a) No section 8003(d) funds may be paid to an LEA whose per pupil State aid for federally connected children with disabilities, either general State aid or special education State aid, has been or would be reduced as a result of eligibility for or receipt of section 8003(d) funds, whether or not a State has a program of State aid that meets the requirements of section 8009 of the Act and subpart K of the regulations in this part. 


(1) A reduction in the per pupil amount of State aid for children with disabilities, including children counted under section 8003(d), from that received in a previous year raises a presumption that supplanting has occurred. 


(2) The LEA may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the reduction was unrelated to the receipt of section 8003(d) funds. 


(b) In any State in which there is only one LEA, all funds for programs, and for early intervention services, for children with disabilities other than funds from Federal sources are considered by the Secretary to be local funds.
