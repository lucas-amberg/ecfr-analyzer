# § 222.70   What tax rates does the Secretary use if two or more different classifications of real property are taxed at different rates?

If the real property of an LEA and its generally comparable LEAs consists of two or more classifications of real property taxed at different rates, the Secretary determines whether the LEA meets the applicable tax rate requirement under § 222.68(c)(1) or (2) by using one of the following:


(a) Actual tax rates for each of the classifications of real property.


(b) Tax rates computed in accordance with § 222.69 for each of the classifications of real property.


(c) Tax rates computed by—


(1) Determining the total true value of all real property in the LEA by dividing the assessed value of each classification of real property in the LEA by the percentage of true value assigned to that property for tax purposes and aggregating the results;


(2) Determining the LEA's total revenues derived from local real property taxes for current expenditures (as defined in section 8013);


(3) Dividing the amount determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the amount determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(4) Performing the computations in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for each of the generally comparable LEAs and then determining the average of their computed tax rates.
