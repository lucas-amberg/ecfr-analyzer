# § 222.104   When does the Assistant Secretary consider a complaint received?

(a) The Assistant Secretary considers a complaint to have been received only after the Assistant Secretary determines that the complaint—


(1) Satisfies the requirements in §§ 222.102 and 222.103; and 


(2) Is in writing and signed by the tribal chairman or the tribe's authorized designee. 


(b) If the Assistant Secretary determines that a complaint fails to meet the requirements in §§ 222.102-222.103, the Assistant Secretary notifies the tribe or its designee in writing that the complaint has been dismissed for purposes of invoking the hearing procedures in §§ 222.102-222.113. 


(c) Any notification that a complaint has been dismissed includes the reasons why the Assistant Secretary determined that the complaint did not meet the requirements in §§ 222.102 and 222.103. 


(d) Notification that a complaint has been dismissed does not preclude other efforts to investigate or resolve the issues raised in the complaint, including the filing of an amended complaint.
