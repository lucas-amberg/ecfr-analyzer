# ยง 222.152   When may a local educational agency request reconsideration of a determination?

(a)(1) An LEA may request reconsideration of any determination made by the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) under the Act, either in addition to or instead of requesting an administrative hearing under ยง 222.151. 


(2) A request for reconsideration, or actual reconsideration by the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee), does not extend the time within which an applicant must file a request for an administrative hearing under ยง 222.151, unless the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) extends that time limit in writing. 


(b) The Secretary's (or the Secretary's delegatee's) consideration of a request for reconsideration is not prejudiced by a pending request for an administrative hearing on the same matter, or the fact that a matter has been scheduled for a hearing. The Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) may, but is not required to, postpone the administrative hearing due to a request for reconsideration. 


(c) The Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) may reconsider any determination under the Act concerning a particular party unless the determination has been the subject of an administrative hearing under this part with respect to that party.
