# Appendix to Subpart K of Part 222—Determinations Under Section 8009 of the Act—Methods of Calculations for Treatment of Impact Aid Payments Under State Equalization Programs


The following paragraphs describe the methods for making certain calculations in conjunction with determinations made under the regulations in this subpart. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations, these methods are the only methods that may be used in making these calculations. 


1. *Determinations of disparity standard compliance under § 222.162(b)(1).*

(a) The determinations of disparity in current expenditures or revenue per pupil are made by—


(i) Ranking all LEAs having similar grade levels within the State on the basis of current expenditures or revenue per pupil for the second preceding fiscal year before the year of determination; 


(ii) Identifying those LEAs in each ranking that fall at the 95th and 5th percentiles of the total number of pupils in attendance in the schools of those LEAs; and 


(iii) Subtracting the lower current expenditure or revenue per pupil figure from the higher for those agencies identified in paragraph (ii) and dividing the difference by the lower figure. 


(b) In cases under § 222.162(b), where separate computations are made for different groups of LEAs, the disparity percentage for each group is obtained in the manner described in paragraph (a) above. Then the weighted average disparity percentage for the State as a whole is determined by—


(i) Multiplying the disparity percentage for each group by the total number of pupils receiving free public education in the schools in that group; 


(ii) Summing the figures obtained in paragraph (b)(i); and 


(iii) Dividing the sum obtained in paragraph (b)(ii) by the total number of pupils for all the groups.


2. *Determinations under § 222.163(b) as to maximum proportion of payments under the Act that may be taken into consideration by a State under an equalization program.* The proportion that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues for a particular LEA shall be obtained by dividing: (a) The amount of local tax revenues covered under the equalization program by (b) the total local tax revenues attributable to current expenditures within the LEA. Local revenues that can be excluded from the proportion computation are those received from local non-tax sources such as interest, bake sales, gifts, donations, and in-kind contributions.
