# § 222.196   What additional construction and legal requirements apply?

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a grantee under this program must comply with—


(1) The general construction legal requirements identified in the grant application assurances;


(2) The prevailing wage standards in the grantee's locality that are established by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a, *et seq.*); and


(3) All relevant Federal, State, and local environmental laws and regulations.


(b) A grantee that qualifies for a grant because it enrolls a high proportion of federally connected children who reside on Indian lands is considered to receive a grant award primarily for the benefit of Indians and must therefore comply with the Indian preference requirements of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination Act.
