# § 225.21   What are some examples of impermissible uses of reserve account funds?

(a) Grantees must not use reserve account funds to—


(1) Directly pay for a charter school's construction, renovation, repair, or acquisition; or


(2) Provide a down payment on facilities in order to secure loans for charter schools. A grantee may, however, use funds to guarantee a loan for the portion of the loan that would otherwise have to be funded with a down payment.


(b) In the event of a default of payment to lenders or contractors by a charter school whose loan or lease is guaranteed by reserve account funds, a grantee may use these funds to cover defaulted payments that are referenced under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
