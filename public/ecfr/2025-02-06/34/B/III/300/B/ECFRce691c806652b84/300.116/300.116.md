(b) The child's placement—


(1) Is determined at least annually;


(2) Is based on the child's IEP; and


(3) Is as close as possible to the child's home;


(c) Unless the IEP of a child with a disability requires some other arrangement, the child is educated in the school that he or she would attend if nondisabled;


(d) In selecting the LRE, consideration is given to any potential harmful effect on the child or on the quality of services that he or she needs; and


(e) A child with a disability is not removed from education in age-appropriate regular classrooms solely because of needed modifications in the general education curriculum.
