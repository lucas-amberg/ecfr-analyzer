# § 300.204   Exception to maintenance of effort.

Notwithstanding the restriction in § 300.203(b), an LEA may reduce the level of expenditures by the LEA under Part B of the Act below the level of those expenditures for the preceding fiscal year if the reduction is attributable to any of the following:

(b) A decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities.


(c) The termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this part, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the SEA, because the child—


(1) Has left the jurisdiction of the agency;


(2) Has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide FAPE to the child has terminated; or


(3) No longer needs the program of special education.


(d) The termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.


(e) The assumption of cost by the high cost fund operated by the SEA under § 300.704(c).
