# § 300.323   When IEPs must be in effect.

(a) *General.* At the beginning of each school year, each public agency must have in effect, for each child with a disability within its jurisdiction, an IEP, as defined in § 300.320.


(b) *IEP or IFSP for children aged three through five.* (1) In the case of a child with a disability aged three through five (or, at the discretion of the SEA, a two-year-old child with a disability who will turn age three during the school year), the IEP Team must consider an IFSP that contains the IFSP content (including the natural environments statement) described in section 636(d) of the Act and its implementing regulations (including an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates pre-literacy, language, and numeracy skills for children with IFSPs under this section who are at least three years of age), and that is developed in accordance with the IEP procedures under this part. The IFSP may serve as the IEP of the child, if using the IFSP as the IEP is—


(i) Consistent with State policy; and


(ii) Agreed to by the agency and the child's parents.


(2) In implementing the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the public agency must—


(i) Provide to the child's parents a detailed explanation of the differences between an IFSP and an IEP; and


(ii) If the parents choose an IFSP, obtain written informed consent from the parents.


(c) *Initial IEPs; provision of services.* Each public agency must ensure that—


(1) A meeting to develop an IEP for a child is conducted within 30 days of a determination that the child needs special education and related services; and


(2) As soon as possible following development of the IEP, special education and related services are made available to the child in accordance with the child's IEP.


(d) *Accessibility of child's IEP to teachers and others.* Each public agency must ensure that—


(1) The child's IEP is accessible to each regular education teacher, special education teacher, related services provider, and any other service provider who is responsible for its implementation; and


(2) Each teacher and provider described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is informed of—


(i) His or her specific responsibilities related to implementing the child's IEP; and


(ii) The specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that must be provided for the child in accordance with the IEP.


(e) *IEPs for children who transfer public agencies in the same State.* If a child with a disability (who had an IEP that was in effect in a previous public agency in the same State) transfers to a new public agency in the same State, and enrolls in a new school within the same school year, the new public agency (in consultation with the parents) must provide FAPE to the child (including services comparable to those described in the child's IEP from the previous public agency), until the new public agency either—


(1) Adopts the child's IEP from the previous public agency; or


(2) Develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP that meets the applicable requirements in §§ 300.320 through 300.324.


(f) *IEPs for children who transfer from another State.* If a child with a disability (who had an IEP that was in effect in a previous public agency in another State) transfers to a public agency in a new State, and enrolls in a new school within the same school year, the new public agency (in consultation with the parents) must provide the child with FAPE (including services comparable to those described in the child's IEP from the previous public agency), until the new public agency—


(1) Conducts an evaluation pursuant to §§ 300.304 through 300.306 (if determined to be necessary by the new public agency); and


(2) Develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP, if appropriate, that meets the applicable requirements in §§ 300.320 through 300.324.


(g) *Transmittal of records.* To facilitate the transition for a child described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section—


(1) The new public agency in which the child enrolls must take reasonable steps to promptly obtain the child's records, including the IEP and supporting documents and any other records relating to the provision of special education or related services to the child, from the previous public agency in which the child was enrolled, pursuant to 34 CFR 99.31(a)(2); and


(2) The previous public agency in which the child was enrolled must take reasonable steps to promptly respond to the request from the new public agency.
