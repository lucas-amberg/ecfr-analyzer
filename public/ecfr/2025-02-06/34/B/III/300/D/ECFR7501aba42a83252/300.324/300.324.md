# § 300.324   Development, review, and revision of IEP.

(a) *Development of IEP*—(1) *General.* In developing each child's IEP, the IEP Team must consider—


(i) The strengths of the child;


(ii) The concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of their child;


(iii) The results of the initial or most recent evaluation of the child; and


(iv) The academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child.


(2) *Consideration of special factors.* The IEP Team must—


(i) In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others, consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior;


(ii) In the case of a child with limited English proficiency, consider the language needs of the child as those needs relate to the child's IEP;


(iii) In the case of a child who is blind or visually impaired, provide for instruction in Braille and the use of Braille unless the IEP Team determines, after an evaluation of the child's reading and writing skills, needs, and appropriate reading and writing media (including an evaluation of the child's future needs for instruction in Braille or the use of Braille), that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is not appropriate for the child;


(iv) Consider the communication needs of the child, and in the case of a child who is deaf or hard of hearing, consider the child's language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the child's language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode; and


(v) Consider whether the child needs assistive technology devices and services.


(3) *Requirement with respect to regular education teacher.* A regular education teacher of a child with a disability, as a member of the IEP Team, must, to the extent appropriate, participate in the development of the IEP of the child, including the determination of—


(i) Appropriate positive behavioral interventions and supports and other strategies for the child; and


(ii) Supplementary aids and services, program modifications, and support for school personnel consistent with § 300.320(a)(4).


(4) *Agreement.* (i) In making changes to a child's IEP after the annual IEP Team meeting for a school year, the parent of a child with a disability and the public agency may agree not to convene an IEP Team meeting for the purposes of making those changes, and instead may develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.


(ii) If changes are made to the child's IEP in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the public agency must ensure that the child's IEP Team is informed of those changes.


(5) *Consolidation of IEP Team meetings.* To the extent possible, the public agency must encourage the consolidation of reevaluation meetings for the child and other IEP Team meetings for the child.


(6) *Amendments.* Changes to the IEP may be made either by the entire IEP Team at an IEP Team meeting, or as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, by amending the IEP rather than by redrafting the entire IEP. Upon request, a parent must be provided with a revised copy of the IEP with the amendments incorporated.


(b) *Review and revision of IEPs*—(1) *General.* Each public agency must ensure that, subject to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the IEP Team—


(i) Reviews the child's IEP periodically, but not less than annually, to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved; and


(ii) Revises the IEP, as appropriate, to address—


(A) Any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals described in § 300.320(a)(2), and in the general education curriculum, if appropriate;


(B) The results of any reevaluation conducted under § 300.303;


(C) Information about the child provided to, or by, the parents, as described under § 300.305(a)(2);


(D) The child's anticipated needs; or


(E) Other matters.


(2) *Consideration of special factors.* In conducting a review of the child's IEP, the IEP Team must consider the special factors described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(3) *Requirement with respect to regular education teacher.* A regular education teacher of the child, as a member of the IEP Team, must, consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, participate in the review and revision of the IEP of the child.


(c) *Failure to meet transition objectives*—(1) *Participating agency failure.* If a participating agency, other than the public agency, fails to provide the transition services described in the IEP in accordance with § 300.320(b), the public agency must reconvene the IEP Team to identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for the child set out in the IEP.


(2) *Construction.* Nothing in this part relieves any participating agency, including a State vocational rehabilitation agency, of the responsibility to provide or pay for any transition service that the agency would otherwise provide to children with disabilities who meet the eligibility criteria of that agency.


(d) *Children with disabilities in adult prisons*—(1) *Requirements that do not apply.* The following requirements do not apply to children with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons:


(i) The requirements contained in section 612(a)(16) of the Act and § 300.320(a)(6) (relating to participation of children with disabilities in general assessments).


(ii) The requirements in § 300.320(b) (relating to transition planning and transition services) do not apply with respect to the children whose eligibility under Part B of the Act will end, because of their age, before they will be eligible to be released from prison based on consideration of their sentence and eligibility for early release.


(2) *Modifications of IEP or placement.* (i) Subject to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the IEP Team of a child with a disability who is convicted as an adult under State law and incarcerated in an adult prison may modify the child's IEP or placement if the State has demonstrated a bona fide security or compelling penological interest that cannot otherwise be accommodated.


(ii) The requirements of §§ 300.320 (relating to IEPs), and 300.114 (relating to LRE), do not apply with respect to the modifications described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
