# § 300.703   Allocations to States.

(a) *General.* After reserving funds for technical assistance under § 300.702, and for payments to the outlying areas, the freely associated States, and the Secretary of the Interior under § 300.701 (a) and (b) for a fiscal year, the Secretary allocates the remaining amount among the States in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.


(b) *Special rule for use of fiscal year 1999 amount.* If a State received any funds under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999 on the basis of children aged three through five, but does not make FAPE available to all children with disabilities aged three through five in the State in any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary computes the State's amount for fiscal year 1999, solely for the purpose of calculating the State's allocation in that subsequent year under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, by subtracting the amount allocated to the State for fiscal year 1999 on the basis of those children.


(c) *Increase in funds.* If the amount available for allocations to States under paragraph (a) of this section for a fiscal year is equal to or greater than the amount allocated to the States under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are calculated as follows:


(1) *Allocation of increase*—(i) *General.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary allocates for the fiscal year—


(A) To each State the amount the State received under this section for fiscal year 1999;


(B) Eighty-five (85) percent of any remaining funds to States on the basis of the States' relative populations of children aged 3 through 21 who are of the same age as children with disabilities for whom the State ensures the availability of FAPE under Part B of the Act; and


(C) Fifteen (15) percent of those remaining funds to States on the basis of the States' relative populations of children described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section who are living in poverty.


(ii) *Data.* For the purpose of making grants under this section, the Secretary uses the most recent population data, including data on children living in poverty, that are available and satisfactory to the Secretary.


(2) *Limitations.* Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, allocations under this section are subject to the following:


(i) *Preceding year allocation.* No State's allocation may be less than its allocation under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year.


(ii) *Minimum.* No State's allocation may be less than the greatest of—


(A) The sum of—


(*1*) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999; and


(*2*) One third of one percent of the amount by which the amount appropriated under section 611(i) of the Act for the fiscal year exceeds the amount appropriated for section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999;


(B) The sum of—


(*1*) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and


(*2*) That amount multiplied by the percentage by which the increase in the funds appropriated for section 611 of the Act from the preceding fiscal year exceeds 1.5 percent; or


(C) The sum of—


(*1*) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and


(*2*) That amount multiplied by 90 percent of the percentage increase in the amount appropriated for section 611 of the Act from the preceding fiscal year.


(iii) *Maximum.* Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, no State's allocation under paragraph (a) of this section may exceed the sum of—


(A) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and


(B) That amount multiplied by the sum of 1.5 percent and the percentage increase in the amount appropriated under section 611 of the Act from the preceding fiscal year.


(3) *Ratable reduction.* If the amount available for allocations to States under paragraph (c) of this section is insufficient to pay those allocations in full, those allocations are ratably reduced, subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(d) *Decrease in funds.* If the amount available for allocations to States under paragraph (a) of this section for a fiscal year is less than the amount allocated to the States under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are calculated as follows:


(1) *Amounts greater than fiscal year 1999 allocations.* If the amount available for allocations under paragraph (a) of this section is greater than the amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1999, each State is allocated the sum of—


(i) *1999 amount.* The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999; and


(ii) *Remaining funds.* An amount that bears the same relation to any remaining funds as the increase the State received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year over fiscal year 1999 bears to the total of all such increases for all States.


(2) *Amounts equal to or less than fiscal year 1999 allocations*—(i) *General.* If the amount available for allocations under paragraph (a) of this section is equal to or less than the amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1999, each State is allocated the amount it received for fiscal year 1999.


(ii) *Ratable reduction.* If the amount available for allocations under paragraph (d) of this section is insufficient to make the allocations described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, those allocations are ratably reduced.
