# § 303.236   Judicial review.

If a State is dissatisfied with the Secretary's final decision with respect to the eligibility of the State under part C of the Act, the State may, not later than 60 days after notice of that decision, file with the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which that State is located a petition for review of that decision. A copy of the petition must be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary then files in the court the record of the proceedings upon which the Secretary's action was based, as provided in 28 U.S.C. 2112.
