Each public agency or EIS provider who has a direct role in the provision of early intervention services is responsible for making a good faith effort to assist each eligible child in achieving the outcomes in the child's IFSP. However, part C of the Act does not require that any public agency or EIS provider be held accountable if an eligible child does not achieve the growth projected in the child's IFSP.
