If the lead agency or EIS provider proposes to screen a child, it must—


(i) Provide the parent notice under § 303.421 of its intent to screen the child to identify whether the child is suspected of having a disability and include in that notice a description of the parent's right to request an evaluation under § 303.321 at any time during the screening process; and


(ii) Obtain parental consent as required in § 303.420(a)(1) before conducting the screening procedures.


(2) If the parent consents to the screening and the screening or other available information indicates that the child is—


(i) Suspected of having a disability, after notice is provided under § 303.421 and once parental consent is obtained as required in § 303.420, an evaluation and assessment of the child must be conducted under § 303.321; or


(ii) Not suspected of having a disability, the lead agency or EIS provider must ensure that notice of that determination is provided to the parent under § 303.421, and that the notice describes the parent's right to request an evaluation.


(3) If the parent of the child requests and consents to an evaluation at any time during the screening process, evaluation of the child must be conducted under § 303.321, even if the lead agency or EIS provider has determined under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section that the child is not suspected of having a disability.
