# § 303.448   Civil action.

(a) *General.* Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under §§ 303.440 through 303.445 who does not have the right to an appeal under § 303.446(b), and any party aggrieved by the findings and decision under § 303.446(b), has the right to bring a civil action with respect to the due process complaint under § 303.440. The action may be brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy.


(b) *Time limitation.* The party bringing the action has 90 days from the date of the decision of the hearing officer or, if applicable, the decision of the State review official, to file a civil action, or, if the State has an explicit time limitation for bringing civil actions under part C of the Act, in the time allowed by that State law.


(c) *Additional requirements.* In any action brought under paragraph (a) of this section, the court—


(1) Receives the records of the administrative proceedings;


(2) Hears additional evidence at the request of a party; and


(3) Basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, grants the relief that the court determines to be appropriate.


(d) *Jurisdiction of district courts.* The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction of actions brought under section 615 of the Act without regard to the amount in controversy.


(e) *Rule of construction.* Nothing in this part restricts or limits the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under these laws seeking relief that is also available under section 615 of the Act, the procedures under §§ 303.440 and 303.446 must be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under section 615 of the Act.
