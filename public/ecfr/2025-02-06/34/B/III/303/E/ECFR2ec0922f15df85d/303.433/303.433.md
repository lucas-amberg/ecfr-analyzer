(2) Give the complainant the opportunity to submit additional information, either orally or in writing, about the allegations in the complaint;


(3) Provide the lead agency, public agency, or EIS provider with an opportunity to respond to the complaint, including, at a minimum—


(i) At the discretion of the lead agency, a proposal to resolve the complaint; and


(ii) An opportunity for a parent who has filed a complaint and the lead agency, public agency, or EIS provider to voluntarily engage in mediation, consistent with §§ 303.430(b) and 303.431;


(4) Review all relevant information and make an independent determination as to whether the lead agency, public agency, or EIS provider is violating a requirement of part C of the Act or of this part; and


(5) Issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint and contains—


(i) Findings of fact and conclusions; and


(ii) The reasons for the lead agency's final decision.


(b) *Time extension; final decision; implementation.* The lead agency's procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section also must—


(1) Permit an extension of the time limit under paragraph (a) of this section only if—


(i) Exceptional circumstances exist with respect to a particular complaint; or


(ii) The parent (or individual or organization, if mediation is available to the individual or organization under State procedures) and the lead agency, public agency or EIS provider involved agree to extend the time to engage in mediation pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section; and

(c) *Complaints filed under this section and due process hearings under § 303.430(d).* (1) If a written complaint is received that is also the subject of a due process hearing under § 303.430(d), or contains multiple issues of which one or more are part of that hearing, the State must set aside any part of the complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing. However, any issue in the complaint that is not a part of the due process hearing must be resolved using the time limit and procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(2) If an issue raised in a complaint filed under this section has previously been decided in a due process hearing involving the same parties—


(i) The due process hearing decision is binding on that issue; and


(ii) The lead agency must inform the complainant to that effect.


(3) A complaint alleging a lead agency, public agency, or EIS provider's failure to implement a due process hearing decision must be resolved by the lead agency.
