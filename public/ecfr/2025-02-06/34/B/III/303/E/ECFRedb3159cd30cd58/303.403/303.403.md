(a) *Destruction* means physical destruction of the record or ensuring that personal identifiers are removed from a record so that the record is no longer personally identifiable under § 303.29.


(b) *Early intervention records* mean all records regarding a child that are required to be collected, maintained, or used under part C of the Act and the regulations in this part.
