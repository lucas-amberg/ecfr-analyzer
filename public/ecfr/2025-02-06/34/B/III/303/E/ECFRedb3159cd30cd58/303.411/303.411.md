# ยง 303.411   Opportunity for a hearing.

The participating agency must, on request, provide parents with the opportunity for a hearing to challenge information in their child's early intervention records to ensure that it is not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the child or parents. A parent may request a due process hearing under the procedures in ยง 303.430(d)(1) provided that such hearing procedures meet the requirements of the hearing procedures in ยง 303.413 or may request a hearing directly under the State's procedures in ยง 303.413 (*i.e.,* procedures that are consistent with the FERPA hearing requirements in 34 CFR 99.22).
