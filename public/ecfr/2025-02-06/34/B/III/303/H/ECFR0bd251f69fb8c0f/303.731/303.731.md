(a) *General.* (1) The Secretary makes payments to the Secretary of the Interior under part C of the Act, which the Secretary of the Interior must distribute to tribes or tribal organizations (as defined under section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450b), or consortia of those entities, for the coordination of assistance in the provision of early intervention services by States to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families on reservations served by elementary and secondary schools for Indian children operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.


(2) A tribe, tribal organization, or consortium of those entities is eligible to receive a payment under this section if the tribe, tribal organization, or consortium of those entities is on a reservation that is served by an elementary or secondary school operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior.


(3) The amount of the payment to the Secretary of the Interior under this section for any fiscal year is 1.25 percent of the aggregate amount available to all States under part C of the Act.


(b) *Allocation.* For each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Interior must distribute the entire payment received under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by providing to each tribe, tribal organization, or consortium an amount based on the number of infants and toddlers residing on the reservation, as determined annually, divided by the total number of those children served by all tribes, tribal organizations, or consortia.


(c) *Information.* To receive a payment under this section, the tribe, tribal organization, or consortium must submit the appropriate information to the Secretary of the Interior to determine the amounts to be distributed under paragraph (b) of this section.


(d) *Use of funds.* (1) The funds received by a tribe, tribal organization, or consortium must be used to assist States in child find, screening, and other procedures for the early identification of Indian children under three years of age and for parent training. The funds also may be used to provide early intervention services in accordance with part C of the Act. These activities may be carried out directly or through contracts or cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Indian Education, local educational agencies, and other public or private nonprofit organizations. The tribe, tribal organization, or consortium is encouraged to involve Indian parents in the development and implementation of these activities.


(2) The tribe, tribal organization, or consortium must, as appropriate, make referrals to local, State, or Federal entities for the provision of services or further diagnosis.


(e) *Reports.* (1) To be eligible to receive a payment under paragraph (b) of this section, a tribe, tribal organization, or consortium must make a biennial report to the Secretary of the Interior of activities undertaken under this section, including the number of contracts and cooperative agreements entered into, the number of infants and toddlers contacted and receiving services for each year, and the estimated number of infants and toddlers needing services during the two years following the year in which the report is made. This report must include an assurance that the tribe, tribal organization, or consortium has provided the lead agency in the State child find information (including the names and dates of birth and parent contact information) for infants or toddlers with disabilities who are included in the report in order to meet the child find coordination and child count requirements in sections 618 and 643 of the Act.


(2) The Secretary of the Interior must provide a summary of this information (including confirmation that each tribe, tribal organization, or consortium has provided to the Secretary of the Interior the assurance required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section) on a biennial basis to the Secretary along with such other information as required of the Secretary of the Interior under part C of the Act. The Secretary may require additional information from the Secretary of the Interior.


(3) Within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year the Secretary of the Interior must provide the Secretary with a report on the payments distributed under this section. The report must include—


(i) The name of each tribe, tribal organization, or combination of those entities that received a payment for the fiscal year;


(ii) The amount of each payment; and


(iii) The date of each payment.


(f) *Prohibited uses of funds.* None of the funds under this section may be used by the Secretary of the Interior for administrative purposes, including child count and the provision of technical assistance.
