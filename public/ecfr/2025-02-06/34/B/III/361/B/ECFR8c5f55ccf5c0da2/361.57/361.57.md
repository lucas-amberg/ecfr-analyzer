The procedures must be in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section:


(b) *General requirements.* (1) *Notification.* Procedures established by the State unit under this section must provide an applicant or recipient or, as appropriate, the individual's representative notice of—

(4) *Impact on provision of services.* The State unit may not institute a suspension, reduction, or termination of vocational rehabilitation services being provided to an applicant or recipient, including evaluation and assessment services and individualized plan for employment development, pending a resolution through mediation, pending a decision by a hearing officer or reviewing official, or pending informal resolution under this section unless—


(i) The individual or, in appropriate cases, the individual's representative requests a suspension, reduction, or termination of services; or


(ii) The State agency has evidence that the services have been obtained through misrepresentation, fraud, collusion, or criminal conduct on the part of the individual or the individual's representative.

(c) *Informal dispute resolution.* The State unit may develop an informal process for resolving a request for review without conducting mediation or a formal hearing. A State's informal process must not be used to deny the right of an applicant or recipient to a hearing under paragraph (e) of this section or any other right provided under this part, including the right to pursue mediation under paragraph (d) of this section.

At any point during the mediation process, either party or the mediator may elect to terminate the mediation. In the event mediation is terminated, either party may pursue resolution through an impartial hearing;


(iii) The mediation process is conducted by a qualified and impartial mediator, as defined in § 361.5(c)(43), who must be selected from a list of qualified and impartial mediators maintained by the State—


(A) On a random basis;
