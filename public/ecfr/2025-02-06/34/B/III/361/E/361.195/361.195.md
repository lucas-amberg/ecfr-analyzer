(a) The Secretaries of Labor and Education will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by five percent of the maximum available amount for the immediately succeeding program year if:


(1) The State fails to submit the State annual performance reports as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(2), as defined in § 361.185;


(2) The State fails to meet State adjusted levels of performance for the same primary performance indicator(s) under either § 361.190(d)(1) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 361.190; or


(3) The State's score on the same indicator for the same program falls below 50 percent under § 361.190(d)(2) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 361.190.


(b) If the State fails under paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (3) of this section in the same program year, the Secretaries of Labor and Education will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by 10 percent of the maximum available amount for the immediately succeeding program year.


(c) If a State's Governor's Reserve Allotment is reduced:


(1) The reduced amount will not be returned to the State in the event that the State later improves performance or submits its annual performance report; and


(2) The Governor's Reserve will continue to be set at the reduced level in each subsequent year until the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education, depending on which program is impacted, determines that the State met the State adjusted levels of performance for the applicable primary performance indicators and has submitted all of the required performance reports.


(d) A State may request review of a sanction the Secretary of Labor imposes in accordance with the provisions of 20 CFR 683.800.
