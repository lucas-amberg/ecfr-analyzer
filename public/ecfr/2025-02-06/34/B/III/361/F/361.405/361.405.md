(a) Yes, TANF, authorized under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 *et seq.*), is a required partner.


(b) The Governor may determine that TANF will not be a required partner in the State, or within some specific local areas in the State. In this instance, the Governor must notify the Secretaries of the U.S. Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services in writing of this determination.


(c) In States, or local areas within a State, where the Governor has determined that TANF is not required to be a partner, local TANF programs may still work in collaboration or partnership with the local one-stop centers to deliver employment and training services to the TANF population unless inconsistent with the Governor's direction.
