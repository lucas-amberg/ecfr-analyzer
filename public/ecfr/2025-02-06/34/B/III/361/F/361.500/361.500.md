# § 361.500   What is the Memorandum of Understanding for the one-stop delivery system and what must be included in the Memorandum of Understanding?

(a) The MOU is the product of local discussion and negotiation, and is an agreement developed and executed between the Local WDB and the one-stop partners, with the agreement of the chief elected official and the one-stop partners, relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system in the local area. Two or more local areas in a region may develop a single joint MOU, if they are in a region that has submitted a regional plan under sec. 106 of WIOA.


(b) The MOU must include:


(1) A description of services to be provided through the one-stop delivery system, including the manner in which the services will be coordinated and delivered through the system;


(2) Agreement on funding the costs of the services and the operating costs of the system, including:


(i) Funding of infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in accordance with §§ 361.700 through 361.755; and


(ii) Funding of the shared services and operating costs of the one-stop delivery system described in § 361.760;


(3) Methods for referring individuals between the one-stop operators and partners for appropriate services and activities;


(4) Methods to ensure that the needs of workers, youth, and individuals with barriers to employment, including individuals with disabilities, are addressed in providing access to services, including access to technology and materials that are available through the one-stop delivery system;


(5) The duration of the MOU and procedures for amending it; and


(6) Assurances that each MOU will be reviewed, and if substantial changes have occurred, renewed, not less than once every 3-year period to ensure appropriate funding and delivery of services.


(c) The MOU may contain any other provisions agreed to by the parties that are consistent with WIOA title I, the authorizing statutes and regulations of one-stop partner programs, and the WIOA regulations.


(d) When fully executed, the MOU must contain the signatures of the Local WDB, one-stop partners, the chief elected official(s), and the time period in which the agreement is effective. The MOU must be updated not less than every 3 years to reflect any changes in the signatory official of the Board, one-stop partners, and chief elected officials, or one-stop infrastructure funding.


(e) If a one-stop partner appeal to the State regarding infrastructure costs, using the process described in § 361.750, results in a change to the one-stop partner's infrastructure cost contributions, the MOU must be updated to reflect the final one-stop partner infrastructure cost contributions.
