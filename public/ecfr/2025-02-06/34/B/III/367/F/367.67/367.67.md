(2) If a State charges consumers or allows other service providers to charge for the cost of IL services provided under the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind program, a State is neither required to nor prohibited from considering the ability of individual consumers to pay for the cost of these services in determining how much a particular consumer must contribute to the costs of a particular service.
