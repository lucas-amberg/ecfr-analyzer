(1) Is not assigned to advocate for or otherwise represent or is not involved with advocating for or otherwise representing the client or client-applicant who is a party to the mediation; and


(2) Has not previously advocated for or otherwise represented or been involved with advocating for or otherwise representing that same client or client-applicant.
