The grantee is required to contribute at least ten percent of the total cost of a project under this program. However, if the grantee can demonstrate that it has insufficient resources to contribute the entire match but that it can fulfill all other requirements for receiving an award, the Secretary may waive part of the non-Federal share of the cost of the project after negotiations with Department staff.
