(a) The designated State unit, in consultation with the State educational agency, must develop a new process, or utilize an existing process, to document the completion of the actions described in § 397.20 and § 397.30 by a youth with a disability, as well as a process for the transmittal of that documentation from the educational agency to the designated State unit, consistent with confidentiality requirements of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g(b) and 34 CFR 99.30 and 99.31) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1417(c) and 34 CFR 300.622).


(1) Such documentation must, at a minimum, contain the—


(i) Youth's name;

(viii) Date and method (*e.g.,* hand-delivered, faxed, mailed, emailed, etc.) by which document was transmitted to the youth.


(2) In the event a youth with a disability or, as applicable, the youth's parent or guardian, refuses, through informed choice, to participate in the activities required by this part, such documentation must, at a minimum, contain the—

(3) The documentation process must include procedures for the designated State unit to retain a copy of all documentation required by this part in a manner consistent with the designated State unit's case management system and the requirements of 2 CFR 200.333.


(b) The documentation process must ensure that—


(1) A designated State unit provides, in the case of a student with a disability, documentation of completion of appropriate pre-employment transition services, in accordance with § 361.48(a) of this chapter and as required by § 397.20(a)(1);


(2) In the case of a student with a disability, for actions described in § 397.30—


(i) The appropriate school official, responsible for the provision of transition services, must provide the designated State unit documentation of completion of appropriate transition services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, including those provided under section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII) (20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII));

(B) 90 calendar days, if additional time is necessary due to extenuating circumstances, after the determination or completion of each of the required actions in § 397.20 and § 397.30(a). Extenuating circumstances should be interpreted narrowly to include circumstances such as the unexpected lengthy absence of the educational or designated State unit personnel necessary for the production of the documentation or the transmittal of that documentation due to illness or family emergency, or a natural disaster.


(ii) Documentation required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, when a youth has refused to participate in an action required by this part, must be provided to the youth within 10 calendar days of the youth's refusal to participate.


(3) When transmitting documentation of the final determination or activity completed, as required by § 397.20 and § 397.30(a), the designated State unit must provide a coversheet that itemizes each of the documents that have been provided to the youth.
