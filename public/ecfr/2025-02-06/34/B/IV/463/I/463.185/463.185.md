(1) Natural disasters;


(2) Unexpected personnel transitions; and


(3) Unexpected technology related issues.


(c) In the event that a State may not be able to submit a complete and accurate performance report by the deadline for timely reporting:


(1) The State must notify the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days prior to the established deadline for submission, of a potential impact on the State's ability to submit its State annual performance report in order to not be considered failing to report.


(2) In circumstances where unexpected events occur less than 30 days before the established deadline for submission of the State annual performance reports, the Secretaries of Labor and Education will review requests for extending the reporting deadline in accordance with the Departments of Labor and Education's procedures that will be established in guidance.
