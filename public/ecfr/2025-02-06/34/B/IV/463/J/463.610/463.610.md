# ยง 463.610   When is the sole-source selection of one-stop operators appropriate, and how is it conducted?

(a) States may select a one-stop operator through sole source selection when allowed under the same policies and procedures used for competitive procurement with non-Federal funds, while other non-Federal entities including subrecipients of a State (such as local areas) may select a one-stop operator through sole selection when consistent with local procurement policies and procedures and the Uniform Guidance set out at 2 CFR 200.320.


(b) In the event that sole source procurement is determined necessary and reasonable, in accordance with ยง 463.605(c), written documentation must be prepared and maintained concerning the entire process of making such a selection.


(c) Such sole source procurement must include appropriate conflict of interest policies and procedures. These policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in 20 CFR 679.430 for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.


(d) A Local WDB may be selected as a one-stop operator through sole source procurement only with agreement of the chief elected official in the local area and the Governor. The Local WDB must establish sufficient conflict of interest policies and procedures and these policies and procedures must be approved by the Governor.
