# ยง 463.736   How does the Governor establish a cost allocation methodology used to determine the one-stop partner programs' proportionate shares of infrastructure costs under the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?

Once the appropriate budget is determined for a local area through either method described in ยง 463.735 (by acceptance of a budget agreed upon in local negotiation or by the Governor applying the formula detailed in ยง 463.745), the Governor must determine the appropriate cost allocation methodology to be applied to the one-stop partners in such local area, consistent with the Federal cost principles permitted under 2 CFR part 200, to fund the infrastructure budget.
