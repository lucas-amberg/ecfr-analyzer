(A) The institution's period of participation as specified under 34 CFR 668.13 expires; or


(B) The institution's provisional certification is revoked under 34 CFR 668.13.


(2) If an institution loses its eligibility because it violated the requirements of § 600.5(a)(8), as evidenced by the determination under provisions contained in § 600.5(d), it loses its eligibility on the last day of the fiscal year used in § 600.5(d), except that if an institution's latest fiscal year was described in § 600.7(h)(1), it loses its eligibility as of June 30, 1994.


(3) If an institution loses its eligibility under the provisions of § 600.7(a)(1), it loses its eligibility on the last day of the award year being evaluated under that provision.
