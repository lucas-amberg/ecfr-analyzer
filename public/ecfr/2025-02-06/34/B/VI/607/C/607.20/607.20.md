# § 607.20   How does the Secretary choose applications for funding?

(a) The Secretary evaluates an application on the basis of the criteria in—


(1) Sections 607.21 and 607.23 for a planning grant; and


(2) Sections 607.22, 607.23, 607.24, and 607.25 for a development grant.


(b) The Secretary informs applicants of the maximum possible score for each criterion in the application package or in a notice published in the _Federal Register_.


(c)(1) With regard to applicants that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, for each fiscal year, the Secretary awards individual development grants to applicants that are not individual development grantees under this part, before the Secretary awards an individual development grant to any applicant that is an individual grantee under this part.


(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an institution that is a recipient of a cooperative arrangement grant is not an individual grantee under this part.


(d) The Secretary considers funding an application for a development grant that—


(1) Is submitted with a comprehensive development plan that satisfies all the elements required of such a plan under § 607.8; and


(2) In the case of an application for a cooperative arrangement grant, demonstrates that the grant will enable each eligible participant to meet the goals and objectives of its comprehensive development plan better and at a lower cost than if each eligible participant were funded individually.
