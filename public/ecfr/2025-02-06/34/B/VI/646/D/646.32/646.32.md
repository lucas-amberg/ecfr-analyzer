# § 646.32   What other requirements must a grantee meet?

(a) *Number of Participants.* For each year of the project period, a grantee must serve at least the number of participants that the Secretary identifies in the _Federal Register_ notice inviting applications for a competition. Through this notice, the Secretary also provides the minimum and maximum grant award amounts for the competition.


(b) *Eligibility of participants.* (1) A grantee shall determine the eligibility of each participant in the project when the individual is selected to participate. The grantee does not have to revalidate a participant's eligibility after the participant's initial selection.


(2) A grantee shall determine the low-income status of an individual on the basis of the documentation described in section 402A(e) of the Act.


(c) *Recordkeeping.* A grantee must maintain participant records that show—


(1) The basis for the grantee's determination that each participant is eligible to participate in the project under § 646.3;


(2) The grantee's basis for determining the academic need for each participant;


(3) The services that are provided to each participant; 


(4) The performance and progress of each participant by cohort for the duration of the participant's attendance at the grantee institution; and


(5) To the extent practicable, any services the participant receives during the project year from another Federal TRIO program or another federally funded program that serves populations similar to those served under the SSS program.


(d) *Project director.* (1) A grantee must employ a full-time project director unless—


(i) The director is also administering one or two additional programs for disadvantaged students operated by the sponsoring institution or agency; or


(ii) The Secretary grants a waiver of this requirement.


(2) The grantee must give the project director sufficient authority to administer the project effectively.


(3) The Secretary waives the requirements in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the applicant demonstrates that the project director will be able to effectively administer more than three programs and that this arrangement would promote effective coordination between the program and other Federal TRIO programs (sections 402B through 402F of the HEA) or similar programs funded through other sources.


(e) *Project coordination.* (1) The Secretary encourages grantees to coordinate project services with other programs for disadvantaged students operated by the grantee institution provided the Student Support Services grant funds are not used to support activities reasonably available to the general student population.


(2) To the extent practical, the grantee may share staff with programs serving similar populations provided the grantee maintains appropriate records of staff time and effort and does not commingle grant funds.


(3) Costs for special classes and events that would benefit Student Support Services students and participants in other programs for disadvantaged students must be proportionately divided among the benefiting projects.
