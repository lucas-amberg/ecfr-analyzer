(b) For a fellowship initially awarded for an academic year prior to the academic year 1993-1994, the institution shall pay the fellow a stipend in the amount of the fellow's financial need or $10,000, whichever is less.


(c) For a fellowship initially awarded for the academic year 1993-1994 or any succeeding academic year, the institution shall pay the fellow a stipend at a level of support equal to that provided by the National Science Foundation graduate fellowships, except that the amount must be adjusted as necessary so as not to exceed the fellow's demonstrated level of financial need.
