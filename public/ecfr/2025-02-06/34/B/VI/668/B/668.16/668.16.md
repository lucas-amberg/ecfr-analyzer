# § 668.16   Standards of administrative capability.

To begin and to continue to participate in any title IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that the institution is capable of adequately administering that program under each of the standards established in this section. The Secretary considers an institution to have that administrative capability if the institution—




(a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance with all statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, all applicable regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory authority, and all applicable special arrangements, agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA;


(b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible for administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it participates and for coordinating those programs with the institution's other Federal and non-Federal programs of student financial assistance. The Secretary considers an individual to be “capable” under this paragraph if the individual is certified by the State in which the institution is located, if the State requires certification of financial aid administrators. The Secretary may consider other factors in determining whether an individual is capable, including, but not limited to, the individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program training provided or approved by the Secretary, and previous experience and documented success in administering the Title IV, HEA programs properly;


(2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution participates. The Secretary considers the following factors to determine whether an institution uses an adequate number of qualified persons—


(i) The number and types of programs in which the institution participates;


(ii) The number of applications evaluated;


(iii) The number of students who receive any student financial assistance at the institution and the amount of funds administered;


(iv) The financial aid delivery system used by the institution;


(v) The degree of office automation used by the institution in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs;


(vi) The number and distribution of financial aid staff; and


(vii) The use of third-party servicers to aid in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs;


(3) Communicates to the individual designated to be responsible for administering Title IV, HEA programs, all the information received by any institutional office that bears on a student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program assistance; and


(4) Has written procedures for or written information indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of reports to the Secretary;


(c)(1) Administers Title IV, HEA programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls; and


(2) Divides the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or delivering funds so that no office has responsibility for both functions with respect to any particular student aided under the programs. For example, the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or delivering funds must be divided so that for any particular student aided under the programs, the two functions are carried out by at least two organizationally independent individuals who are not members of the same family, as defined in § 668.15, or who do not together exercise substantial control, as defined in § 668.15, over the institution;


(d)(1) Establishes and maintains records required under this part and the individual Title IV, HEA program regulations; and


(2)(i) Reports annually to the Secretary on any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a private education lender or group of lenders as described under section 140(d) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631(d)) to any employee who is employed in the financial aid office of the institution or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans, including responsibilities involving the selection of lenders, or other financial aid of the institution, including—


(A) The amount for each specific instance of reasonable expenses paid or provided;


(B) The name of the financial aid official, other employee, or agent to whom the expenses were paid or provided;


(C) The dates of the activity for which the expenses were paid or provided; and


(D) A brief description of the activity for which the expenses were paid or provided.


(ii) Expenses are considered to be reasonable if the expenses—


(A) Meet the standards of and are paid in accordance with a State government reimbursement policy applicable to the entity; or


(B) Meet the standards of and are paid in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles for reimbursement, if no State policy that is applicable to the entity exists.


(iii) The policy must be consistently applied to an institution's employees reimbursed under this paragraph;


(e) For purposes of determining student eligibility for assistance under a title IV, HEA program, establishes, publishes, and applies reasonable standards for measuring whether an otherwise eligible student is maintaining satisfactory academic progress in his or her educational program. The Secretary considers an institution's standards to be reasonable if the standards are in accordance with the provisions specified in § 668.34.


(f) Develops and applies an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepancies in the information that the institution receives from different sources with respect to a student's application for financial aid under Title IV, HEA programs. In determining whether the institution's system is adequate, the Secretary considers whether the institution obtains and reviews—


(1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents, Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration Status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on behalf of each applicant;


(2) Any documents, including any copies of State and Federal income tax returns, that are normally collected by the institution to verify information received from the student or other sources; and


(3) Any other information normally available to the institution regarding a student's citizenship, previous educational experience, documentation of the student's social security number, or other factors relating to the student's eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA programs;


(g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education for investigation—


(1) After conducting the review of an application provided for under paragraph (f) of this section, any credible information indicating that an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her application. The type of information that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to the eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance, or the amount of the assistance. Examples of this type of information are—


(i) False claims of independent student status;


(ii) False claims of citizenship;


(iii) Use of false identities;


(iv) Forgery of signatures or certifications; and


(v) False statements of income; and


(2) Any credible information indicating that any employee, third-party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs, or the receipt of funds under those programs, may have engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or breach of fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the Title IV, HEA programs. The type of information that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to the eligibility and funding of the institution and its students through the Title IV, HEA programs;


(h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling with clear and accurate information to students who apply for title IV, HEA program assistance. In determining whether an institution provides adequate counseling, the Secretary considers whether its counseling and financial aid communications advise students and families to accept the most beneficial types of financial assistance available to them and include information regarding—


(1) The cost of attendance of the institution as defined under section 472 of the HEA, including the individual components of those costs and a total of the estimated costs that will be owed directly to the institution, for students, based on their attendance status;


(2) The source and amount of each type of aid offered, separated by the type of the aid and whether it must be earned or repaid;


(3) The net price, as determined by subtracting total grant or scholarship aid included in paragraph (h)(2) of this section from the cost of attendance in paragraph (h)(1) of this section;


(4) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, delivered, or applied to a student's account, and instructions and applicable deadlines for accepting, declining, or adjusting award amounts; and


(5) The rights and responsibilities of the student with respect to enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial aid, including the institution's refund policy, the requirements for the treatment of title IV, HEA program funds when a student withdraws under § 668.22, its standards of satisfactory progress, and other conditions that may alter the student's aid package;






(i) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and financial statements required for compliance with the provisions of this part and the individual program regulations in a timely manner;


(j) Shows no evidence of significant problems that affect, as determined by the Secretary, the institution's ability to administer a Title IV, HEA program and that are identified in—


(1) Reviews of the institution conducted by the Secretary, the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General, nationally recognized accrediting agencies, guaranty agencies as defined in 34 CFR part 682, the State agency or official by whose authority the institution is legally authorized to provide postsecondary education, or any other law enforcement agency; or


(2) Any findings made in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding;




(k)(1) Is not, and has not been—


(i) Debarred or suspended under Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or


(ii) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 2 CFR 180.700 or 180.800, as adopted at 2 CFR 3485.12, for debarment or suspension under E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; and


(2) Does not have any principal or affiliate of the institution (as those terms are defined in 2 CFR parts 180 and 3485), or any individual who exercises or previously exercised substantial control over the institution as defined in § 668.174(c)(3), who—


(i) Has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of Federal, State, Tribal, or local government funds, or has been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material violation of law involving those funds; or


(ii) Is a current or former principal or affiliate (as those terms are defined in 2 CFR parts 180 and 3485), or any individual who exercises or exercised substantial control as defined in § 668.174(c)(3), of another institution whose misconduct or closure contributed to liabilities to the Federal Government in excess of 5 percent of its title IV, HEA program funds in the award year in which the liabilities arose or were imposed;






(l) For an institution that seeks initial participation in a Title IV, HEA program, does not have more than 33 percent of its undergraduate regular students withdraw from the institution during the institution's latest completed award year. The institution must count all regular students who are enrolled during the latest completed award year, except those students who, during that period—


(1) Withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from the institution;


(2) Were entitled to and actually received in a timely manner, a refund of 100 percent of their tuition and fees;




(m)(1) Has a cohort default rate—


(i) That is less than 25 percent for each of the three most recent fiscal years during which rates have been issued, to the extent those rates are calculated under subpart M of this part;

(iii) As defined in 34 CFR 674.5, on loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program to students for attendance at that institution that does not exceed 15 percent;


(2) Provided that—


(i) If the Secretary determines that an institution's administrative capability is impaired solely because the institution fails to comply with paragraph (m)(1) of this section, and the institution is not subject to a loss of eligibility under § 668.187(a) or § 668.206(a), the Secretary allows the institution to continue to participate in the title IV, HEA programs. In such a case, the Secretary may provisionally certify the institution in accordance with § 668.13(c) except as provided in paragraphs (m)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section;


(ii) An institution that fails to meet the standard of administrative capability under paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section based on two cohort default rates that are greater than or equal to 30 percent but less than or equal to 40 percent is not placed on provisional certification under paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section if it—


(A) Has timely filed a request for adjustment or appeal under § 668.209, § 668.210, or § 668.212 with respect to the second such rate, and the request for adjustment or appeal is either pending or succeeds in reducing the rate below 30 percent;


(B) Has timely filed an appeal under § 668.213 after receiving the second such rate, and the appeal is either pending or successful; or


(C)(*1*) Has timely filed a participation rate index challenge or appeal under § 668.204(c) or § 668.214 with respect to either or both of the two rates, and the challenge or appeal is either pending or successful; or

(iii) The institution may appeal the loss of full participation in a title IV, HEA program under paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section by submitting an erroneous data appeal in writing to the Secretary in accordance with and on the grounds specified in § 668.192 or § 668.211 as applicable;


(iv) If the institution has 30 or fewer borrowers in the three most recent cohorts of borrowers used to calculate its cohort default rate under subpart N of this part, we will not provisionally certify it solely based on cohort default rates; and


(v) If a rate that would otherwise potentially subject the institution to provisional certification under paragraphs (m)(1)(ii) and (m)(2)(i) of this section is calculated as an average rate, we will not provisionally certify it solely based on cohort default rates;












(n) Has not been subject to a significant negative action or a finding as by a State or Federal agency, a court, or an accrediting agency, where the basis of the action is repeated or unresolved, such as non-compliance with a prior enforcement order or supervisory directive, and the institution has not lost eligibility to participate in another Federal educational assistance program due to an administrative action against the institution;

(1) Provides at no substantial charge to the institution; and 


(2) Identifies through a notice published in the _Federal Register_; 




(p) Develops and follows adequate procedures to evaluate the validity of a student's high school diploma if the institution or the Secretary has reason to believe that the high school diploma is not valid or was not obtained from an entity that provides secondary school education, consistent with the following requirements:


(1) Adequate procedures to evaluate the validity of a student's high school diploma must include—
