(b) *Compliance audits for institutions.* (1) An institution's compliance audit must cover, on a fiscal year basis, all title IV, HEA program transactions, and must cover all of those transactions that have occurred since the period covered by the institution's last compliance audit.


(2) The compliance audit required under this section must be conducted in accordance with—


(i) The general standards and the standards for compliance audits contained in the U.S. General Accounting Office's (GAO's) Government Auditing Standards. (This publication is available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402); and

(c) *Compliance audits for third-party servicers.* (1) A third-party servicer that administers title IV, HEA programs for institutions does not have to have a compliance audit performed if—


(i) The servicer contracts with only one institution; and


(ii) The audit of that institution's administration of the title IV, HEA programs involves every aspect of the servicer's administration of that program for that institution.

(d) *Audited financial statements*— (1) *General.* To enable the Department to make a determination of financial responsibility, an institution must, to the extent requested by the Department, submit to the Department a set of acceptable financial statements for its latest complete fiscal year (or such fiscal years as requested by the Department or required by this part), as well as any other documentation the Department deems necessary to make that determination. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2024, financial statements submitted to the Department must match the fiscal year end of the entity's annual return(s) filed with the IRS. Financial statements submitted to the Department must include the Supplemental Schedule required under § 668.172(a) and section 2 of appendices A and B to subpart L of this part, and be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and other guidance contained in 2 CFR part 200; or in audit guides developed by and available from the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General, whichever is applicable to the entity, and provided that the Federal student aid functions performed by that entity are covered in the submission. As part of these financial statements, the institution must include a detailed description of related entities based on the definition of a related entity as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 850. The disclosure requirements under this paragraph (d)(1) extend beyond those of ASC 850 to include all related parties and a level of detail that would enable the Department to readily identify the related party. Such information must include, but is not limited to, the name, location and a description of the related entity including the nature and amount of any transactions between the related party and the institution, financial or otherwise, regardless of when they occurred. If there are no related party transactions during the audited fiscal year or related party outstanding balances reported in the financial statements, then management must add a note to the financial statements to disclose this fact.


(2) *Submission of additional information.* (i) In determining whether an institution is financially responsible, the Department may also require the submission of audited consolidated financial statements, audited full consolidating financial statements, audited combined financial statements, or the audited financial statements of one or more related parties that have the ability, either individually or collectively, to significantly influence or control the institution, as determined by the Department.


(ii) For a domestic or foreign institution that is owned directly or indirectly by any foreign entity holding at least a 50 percent voting or equity interest in the institution, the institution must provide documentation of the entity's status under the law of the jurisdiction under which the entity is organized, including, at a minimum, the date of organization, a current certificate of good standing, and a copy of the authorizing statute for such entity status. The institution must also provide documentation that is equivalent to articles of organization and bylaws and any current operating or shareholders' agreements. The Department may also require the submission of additional documents related to the entity's status under the foreign jurisdiction as needed to assess the entity's financial status. Documents must be translated into English.






(3) *Disclosure of Federal revenue.* A proprietary institution must disclose in a footnote to its audited financial statement the percentage of its revenues derived from Federal funds that the institution received during the fiscal year covered by that audit. The revenue percentage must be calculated in accordance with § 668.28. The institution must also report in the footnote the dollar amount of the numerator and denominator of its 90/10 ratio as well as the individual revenue amounts identified in section 2 of appendix C to this subpart.






(4) *Audited financial statements for third-party servicers.* A third-party servicer that enters into a contract with a lender or guaranty agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or guaranty agency's programs, as provided under 34 CFR part 682, must submit annually an audited financial statement. This financial statement must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and other guidance contained in audit guides issued by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General.


(e) *Access to records.* (1) An institution or a third-party servicer that has a compliance or financial statement audit conducted under this section must—


(i) Give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records or other documents necessary to review that audit, including the right to obtain copies of those records or documents; and


(ii) Require an individual or firm conducting the audit to give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records, audit work papers, or other documents necessary to review that audit, including the right to obtain copies of those records, work papers, or documents.


(2) An institution must give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records or other documents necessary to review a third-party servicer's compliance or financial statement audit, including the right to obtain copies of those records or documents.


(f) *Determination of liabilities.* (1) Based on the audit finding and the institution's or third-party servicer's response, the Secretary determines the amount of liability, if any, owed by the institution or servicer and instructs the institution or servicer as to the manner of repayment.


(2) If the Secretary determines that a third-party servicer owes a liability for its administration of an institution's title IV, HEA programs, the servicer must notify each institution under whose contract the servicer owes a liability of that determination. The servicer must also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the same service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed.


(g) *Repayments.* (1) An institution or third-party servicer that must repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification, unless—


(i) The institution or servicer files an appeal under the procedures established in subpart H of this part; or


(ii) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g)(1) of this section—


(i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted surety or has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary questions expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements and identifies liabilities, then the Secretary may determine that deferring recourse to the surety or guarantee is not appropriate because—


(A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers affected by the act or omission giving rise to the liability outweighs the importance of deferring collection action until completion of available appeal proceedings; or


(B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete assurance that recourse to that protection will be fully available through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or


(ii) The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR part 30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures of this section.


(3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in the Secretary's notification, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or third-party servicer must repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this part unless—


(i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or


(ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is appropriate pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.


(4) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a violation incurred in servicing any aspect of that institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs and remains responsible for that amount until that amount is repaid in full.


(h) *Audit submission requirements for foreign institutions.* (1) *Audited financial statements.* (i) The Secretary waives for that fiscal year the submission of audited financial statements if the institution is a foreign public or nonprofit institution that received less than $500,000 in U.S. title IV program funds during its most recently completed fiscal year, unless that foreign public or nonprofit institution is in its initial provisional period of participation, and received title IV program funds during that fiscal year, in which case the institution must submit, in English, audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the institution's home country.

(2) *Compliance audits.* A foreign institution's compliance audit must cover, on a fiscal year basis, all title IV, HEA program transactions, and must cover all of those transactions that have occurred since the period covered by the institution's last compliance audit. A compliance audit that is due under this paragraph must be submitted no later than six months after the last day of the institution's fiscal year, and must meet the following requirements:
