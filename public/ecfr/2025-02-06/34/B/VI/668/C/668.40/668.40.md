# § 668.40   Conviction for possession or sale of illegal drugs.

(a)(1) A student is ineligible to receive title IV, HEA program funds, for the period described in paragraph (b) of this section, if the student has been convicted of an offense under any Federal or State law involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs for conduct that occurred during a period of enrollment for which the student was receiving title IV, HEA program funds. However, the student may regain eligibility before that time period expires under the conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) For purposes of this section, a conviction means only a conviction that is on a student's record.
