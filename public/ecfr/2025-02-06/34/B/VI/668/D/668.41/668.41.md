# § 668.41   Reporting and disclosure of information.

(a) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply to this subpart:


*Athletically related student aid* means any scholarship, grant, or other form of financial assistance, offered by an institution, the terms of which require the recipient to participate in a program of intercollegiate athletics at the institution. Other student aid, of which a student-athlete simply happens to be the recipient, is not athletically related student aid.


*Certificate or degree-seeking student* means a student enrolled in a course of credit who is recognized by the institution as seeking a degree or certificate.


*First-time undergraduate student* means an entering undergraduate who has never attended any institution of higher education. It includes a student enrolled in the fall term who attended a postsecondary institution for the first time in the prior summer term, and a student who entered with advanced standing (college credit earned before graduation from high school).


*Normal time* is the amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog.

*Notice* means a notification of the availability of information an institution is required by this subpart to disclose, provided to an individual on a one-to-one basis through an appropriate mailing or publication, including direct mailing through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or electronic mail.
