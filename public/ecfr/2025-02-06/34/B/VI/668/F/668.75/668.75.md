# § 668.75   Omission of fact.

An omission of fact is a misrepresentation under § 668.71 if a reasonable person would have considered the omitted information in making a decision to enroll or continue attendance at the institution. An omission of fact includes, but is not limited to, the concealment, suppression, or absence of material information or statement concerning—


(a) The entity that is actually providing the educational instruction, or implementing the institution's recruitment, admissions, or enrollment process;


(b) The availability of enrollment openings in the student's desired program;


(c) The factors that would prevent an applicant from meeting the legal or other requirements to be employed in the field for which the training is provided, for reasons such as prior criminal record or preexisting medical conditions;


(d) The factors that would prevent an applicant from meeting the legal or other requirements to be employed, licensed, or certified in the field for which the training is provided because the academic, professional, or occupational degree or credential that the institution will confer upon completion of the course of study has not been authorized by the appropriate State educational or licensure agency, or requires specialized accreditation that the institution does not have; or,


(e) The nature of the institution's educational programs, the institution's financial charges, or the employability of the institution's graduates as defined in § 668.72-74.
