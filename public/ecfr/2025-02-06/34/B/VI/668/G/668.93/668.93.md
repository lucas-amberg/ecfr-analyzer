# § 668.93   Fines.

(a) In determining the amount of a fine, the designated department official, hearing official, and Secretary take into account—


(1) (i) The gravity of an institution's or third-party servicer's violation or failure to carry out the relevant statutory provision, regulatory provision, special arrangement, agreement, or limitation entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA; or


(ii) The gravity of the institution's or servicer's misrepresentation;


(2) The size of the institution;


(3) The size of the servicer's business, including the number of institutions and students served by the servicer;


(4) In the case of a violation by a third-party servicer, the extent to which the servicer can document that the institution contributed to that violation; and


(5) For purposes of assessing a fine on a third-party servicer, the extent to which—


(i) Violations are caused by repeated mechanical systemic unintentional errors. The Secretary counts the total of violations caused by a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error as a single violation, unless the servicer has been cited for a similar violation previously and had failed to make the appropriate corrections to the system; and


(ii) The financial loss of Title IV, HEA program funds was attributable to a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error.


(b) In determining the gravity of the institution's or servicer's violation, failure, or misrepresentation under paragraph (a) of this section, the designated department official, hearing official, and Secretary take into account the amount of any liability owed by the institution and any third-party servicer that contracts with the institution, and the number of students affected as a result of that violation, failure, or misrepresentation on—


(1) Improperly expended or unspent Title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution or servicer, as applicable; or


(2) Required refunds, including the treatment of title IV, HEA program funds when a student withdraws under § 668.22.

(2) The individual subject to the penalty described in paragraph (d)(1) is any individual who—


(i) The Secretary determines, in accordance with § 668.174(c), exercises substantial control over an institution participating in, or seeking to participate in, a program under this title;
