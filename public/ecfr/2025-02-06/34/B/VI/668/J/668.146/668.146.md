(2) Sample the major content domains of secondary school level verbal and quantitative skills with sufficient numbers of questions to—

(4) Have all forms (including short forms) comparable in reliability;


(5) Have, in the case of a test that is revised, new scales, scale values, and scores that are demonstrably comparable to the old scales, scale values, and scores;
