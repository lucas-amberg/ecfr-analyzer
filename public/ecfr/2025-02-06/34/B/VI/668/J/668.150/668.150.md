(ii) Have the ability and facilities to keep its test secure against disclosure or release; and


(iii) Have not been decertified within the last three years by any test publisher or State;


(4) Decertify a test administrator for a period of three years if the test publisher or the State finds that the test administrator—

(iii) Has compromised the integrity of the testing process; or


(iv) Has given the test in violation of the provisions contained in § 668.151;


(5) Reevaluate the qualifications of a test administrator who has been decertified by another test publisher or State and determine whether to continue the test administrator's certification or to decertify the test administrator;


(6) Immediately notify the test administrator, the Secretary, and the institutions where the test administrator previously administered approved tests when the test publisher or the State decertifies a test administrator;


(7)(i) Review the test results of the tests administered by a decertified test administrator and determine which tests may have been improperly administered during the five (5) year period preceding the date of decertification;


(ii) Immediately notify the affected institutions and students or prospective students; and

(13) Analyze the test scores of students who take the test to determine whether the test scores and data produce any irregular pattern that raises an inference that the tests were not being properly administered, and provide the Secretary with a copy of this analysis within 18 months after the test was approved and every 18 months thereafter during the period of test approval;


(14) Upon request, give the Secretary, a State agency, an accrediting agency, and law enforcement agencies access to test records or other documents related to an audit, investigation, or program review of an institution, the test publisher, or a test administrator;


(15) Immediately report to the Secretary if the test publisher or the State finds any credible information indicating that a test has been compromised;
