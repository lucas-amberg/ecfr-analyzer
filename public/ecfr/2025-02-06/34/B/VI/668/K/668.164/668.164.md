# § 668.164   Disbursing funds.

(a) *Disbursement.* (1) Except as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a disbursement of title IV, HEA program funds occurs on the date that the institution credits the student's ledger account or pays the student or parent directly with—


(i) Funds received from the Secretary; or


(ii) Institutional funds used in advance of receiving title IV, HEA program funds.


(2)(i) For a Direct Loan for which the student is subject to the delayed disbursement requirements under 34 CFR 685.303(b)(5), if an institution credits a student's ledger account with institutional funds earlier than 30 days after the beginning of a payment period, the Secretary considers that the institution makes that disbursement on the 30th day after the beginning of the payment period; or


(ii) If an institution credits a student's ledger account with institutional funds earlier than 10 days before the first day of classes of a payment period, the Secretary considers that the institution makes that disbursement on the 10th day before the first day of classes of a payment period.


(b) *Disbursements by payment period.* (1) Except for paying a student under the FWS program or unless 34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(i) applies, an institution must disburse during the current payment period the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that a student enrolled at the institution, or the student's parent, is eligible to receive for that payment period.


(2) An institution may make a prior year, late, or retroactive disbursement, as provided under paragraph (c)(3), (j), or (k) of this section, respectively, during the current payment period as long as the student was enrolled and eligible during the payment period covered by that prior year, late, or retroactive disbursement.


(3) At the time a disbursement is made to a student for a payment period, an institution must confirm that the student is eligible for the type and amount of title IV, HEA program funds identified by that disbursement. A third-party servicer is also responsible for confirming the student's eligibility if the institution engages the servicer to perform activities or transactions that lead to or support that disbursement. Those activities and transactions include but are not limited to—


(i) Determining the type and amount of title IV, HEA program funds that a student is eligible to receive;


(ii) Requesting funds under a payment method described in § 668.162; or


(iii) Accounting for funds that are originated, requested, or disbursed, in reports or data submissions to the Secretary.


(c) *Crediting a student's ledger account.* (1) An institution may credit a student's ledger account with title IV, HEA program funds to pay for allowable charges associated with the current payment period. Allowable charges are—


(i) The amount of tuition, fees, and institutionally provided room and board assessed the student for the payment period or, as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the prorated amount of those charges if the institution debits the student's ledger account for more than the charges associated with the payment period; and


(ii) The amount incurred by the student for the payment period for purchasing books, supplies, and other educationally related goods and services provided by the institution for which the institution obtains the student's or parent's authorization under § 668.165(b).


(2) An institution may include the costs of books and supplies as part of tuition and fees under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section if —


(i) The institution—


(A) Has an arrangement with a book publisher or other entity that enables it to make those books or supplies available to students below competitive market rates;


(B) Provides a way for a student to obtain those books and supplies by the seventh day of a payment period; and


(C) Has a policy under which the student may opt out of the way the institution provides for the student to obtain books and supplies under this paragraph (c)(2). A student who opts out under this paragraph (c)(2) is considered to also opt out under paragraph (m)(3) of this section;


(ii) The institution documents on a current basis that the books or supplies, including digital or electronic course materials, are not available elsewhere or accessible by students enrolled in that program from sources other than those provided or authorized by the institution; or


(iii) The institution demonstrates there is a compelling health or safety reason.


(3)(i) An institution may include in one or more payment periods for the current year, prior year charges of not more than $200 for—


(A) Tuition, fees, and institutionally provided room and board, as provided under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, without obtaining the student's or parent's authorization; and

(ii) For purposes of this section—


(A) The current year is—


(*1*) The current loan period for a student or parent who receives only a Direct Loan;


(*2*) The current award year for a student who does not receive a Direct Loan but receives funds under any other title IV, HEA program; or


(*3*) At the discretion of the institution, either the current loan period or the current award year if a student receives a Direct Loan and funds from any other title IV, HEA program.


(B) A prior year is any loan period or award year prior to the current loan period or award year, as applicable.


(4) An institution may include in the current payment period unpaid allowable charges from any previous payment period in the current award year or current loan period for which the student was eligible for title IV, HEA program funds.


(5) For purposes of this section, an institution determines the prorated amount of charges associated with the current payment period by—


(i) For a program with substantially equal payment periods, dividing the total institutional charges for the program by the number of payment periods in the program; or


(ii) For other programs, dividing the number of credit or clock hours in the current payment period by the total number of credit or clock hours in the program, and multiplying that result by the total institutional charges for the program.


(d) *Direct payments.* (1) Except as provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an institution makes a direct payment—


(i) To a student, for the amount of the title IV, HEA program funds that a student is eligible to receive, including Direct PLUS Loan funds that the student's parent authorized the student to receive, by—

(3) *Payments by the Secretary.* The Secretary may pay title IV, HEA credit balances under paragraphs (h) and (m) of this section directly to a student or parent using a method established or authorized by the Secretary and published in the _Federal Register_.


(4) *Student choice.* (i) An institution located in a State that makes direct payments to a student by EFT and that enters into an arrangement described in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, including an institution that uses a third-party servicer to make those payments, must establish a selection process under which the student chooses one of several options for receiving those payments.


(A) In implementing its selection process, the institution must—

To effectuate this provision, an institution may share information related to students' enrollment status with the servicer or entity that is party to the arrangement.

(ii) For an award under the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, Federal Perkins Loan, Iraq-Afghanistan Service Grant, and TEACH Grant programs, the student is no longer enrolled at the institution for the award year.


(2) *Conditions for a late disbursement.* Except as limited under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, a student who becomes ineligible, as described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, qualifies for a late disbursement (and the parent qualifies for a parent Direct PLUS Loan disbursement) if, before the date the student became ineligible—


(i) The Secretary processed a SAR or ISIR with an official expected family contribution for the student for the relevant award year; and


(ii)(A) For a loan made under the Direct Loan program or for an award made under the TEACH Grant program, the institution originated the loan or award; or

(3) *Making a late disbursement.* Provided that the conditions described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section are satisfied—


(i) If the student withdrew from the institution during a payment period or period of enrollment, the institution must make any post-withdrawal disbursement required under § 668.22(a)(4) in accordance with the provisions of § 668.22(a)(5);


(ii) If the student completed the payment period or period of enrollment, the institution must provide the student or parent the choice to receive the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that the student or parent was eligible to receive while the student was enrolled at the institution.

(iii) If the student did not withdraw but ceased to be enrolled as at least a half-time student, the institution may make the late disbursement of a loan under the Direct Loan program to pay for educational costs that the institution determines the student incurred for the period in which the student or parent was eligible.


(4) *Limitations.* (i) An institution may not make a late disbursement later than 180 days after the date the institution determines that the student withdrew, as provided in § 668.22, or for a student who did not withdraw, 180 days after the date the student otherwise became ineligible, pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) of this section.


(ii) An institution may not make a late second or subsequent disbursement of a loan under the Direct Loan program unless the student successfully completed the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended.


(iii) An institution may not make a late disbursement of a Direct Loan if the student was a first-year, first-time borrower as described in 34 CFR 685.303(b)(5) unless the student completed the first 30 days of his or her program of study. This limitation does not apply if the institution is exempt from the 30-day delayed disbursement requirements under 34 CFR 685.303(b)(5)(i)(A) or (B).


(iv) An institution may not make a late disbursement of any title IV, HEA program assistance unless it received a valid SAR or a valid ISIR for the student by the deadline date established by the Secretary in a notice published in the _Federal Register_.


(k) *Retroactive payments.* If an institution did not make a disbursement to an enrolled student for a payment period the student completed (for example, because of an administrative delay or because the student's ISIR was not available until a subsequent payment period), the institution may pay the student for all prior payment periods in the current award year or loan period for which the student was eligible. For Pell Grant payments under this paragraph (k), the student's enrollment status must be determined according to work already completed, as required by 34 CFR 690.76(b).


(l) *Returning funds.* (1) Notwithstanding any State law (such as a law that allows funds to escheat to the State), an institution must return to the Secretary any title IV, HEA program funds, except FWS program funds, that it attempts to disburse directly to a student or parent that are not received by the student or parent. For FWS program funds, the institution is required to return only the Federal portion of the payroll disbursement.


(2) If an EFT to a student's or parent's financial account is rejected, or a check to a student or parent is returned, the institution may make additional attempts to disburse the funds, provided that those attempts are made not later than 45 days after the EFT was rejected or the check returned. In cases where the institution does not make another attempt, the funds must be returned to the Secretary before the end of this 45-day period.

(m) *Provisions for books and supplies.* (1) An institution must provide a way for a student who is eligible for title IV, HEA program funds to obtain or purchase, by the seventh day of a payment period, the books and supplies applicable to the payment period if, 10 days before the beginning of the payment period—


(i) The institution could disburse the title IV, HEA program funds for which the student is eligible; and


(ii) Presuming the funds were disbursed, the student would have a credit balance under paragraph (h) of this section.


(2) The amount the institution provides to the student to obtain or purchase books and supplies is the lesser of the presumed credit balance under this paragraph or the amount needed by the student, as determined by the institution.


(3) The institution must have a policy under which the student may opt out of the way the institution provides for the student to obtain or purchase books and supplies under this paragraph (m). A student who opts out under this paragraph is considered to also opt out under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section;
