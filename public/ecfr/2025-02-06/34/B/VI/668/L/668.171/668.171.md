# § 668.171   General.

(a) *Purpose.* To begin and to continue to participate in any title IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that it is financially responsible under the standards established in this subpart. As provided under section 498(c)(1) of the HEA, the Secretary determines whether an institution is financially responsible based on the institution's ability to—


(1) Provide the services described in its official publications and statements;


(2) Meet all of its financial obligations; and


(3) Provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title IV, HEA program requirements.


(b) *General standards of financial responsibility.* Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the Department considers an institution to be financially responsible if the Department determines that—


(1) The institution's Equity, Primary Reserve, and Net Income ratios yield a composite score of at least 1.5, as provided under § 668.172 and appendices A and B to this subpart;


(2) The institution has sufficient cash reserves to make required returns of unearned title IV, HEA program funds, as provided under § 668.173;




(3) The institution is able to meet all of its financial obligations and provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title IV, HEA program requirements. An institution is not deemed able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if—


(i) It fails to make refunds under its refund policy, return title IV, HEA program funds for which it is responsible under § 668.22, or pay title IV, HEA credit balances as required under § 668.164(h)(2);


(ii) It fails to make repayments to the Department for any debt or liability arising from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs;


(iii) It fails to make a payment in accordance with an existing undisputed financial obligation for more than 90 days;


(iv) It fails to satisfy payroll obligations in accordance with its published payroll schedule;


(v) It borrows funds from retirement plans or restricted funds without authorization; or


(vi) It is subject to an action or event described in paragraph (c) of this section (mandatory triggering events), or an action or event that the Department has determined to have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution under paragraph (d) of this section (discretionary triggering events); and






(4) The institution or persons affiliated with the institution are not subject to a condition of past performance under § 668.174(a) or (b).




(c) *Mandatory triggering events.* (1) Except for the mandatory triggers that require a recalculation of the institution's composite score, the mandatory triggers in this paragraph (c) constitute automatic failures of financial responsibility. For any mandatory triggers under this paragraph (c) that result in a recalculated composite score of less than 1.0, and for those mandatory triggers that constitute automatic failures of financial responsibility, the Department will require the institution to provide financial protection as set forth in this subpart, unless the institution demonstrates that the event is resolved or that insurance covers the loss in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The financial protection required under this paragraph is not less than 10 percent of the total title IV, HEA funding in the prior fiscal year. If the Department requires financial protection as a result of more than one mandatory or discretionary trigger, the Department will require separate financial protection for each individual trigger. For automatic triggers, the Department will consider whether the financial protection can be released following the institution's submission of two full fiscal years of audited financial statements following the Department's notice that requires the posting of the financial protection. In making this determination, the Department considers whether the administrative or financial risk caused by the event has ceased or been resolved, including full payment of all damages, fines, penalties, liabilities, or other financial relief. For triggers that require a recalculation of the composite score, the Department will consider whether the financial protection can be released if subsequent annual submissions pass the Department's requirements for financial responsibility.


(2) The following are mandatory triggers:


(i) *Legal and administrative actions.* (A) For an institution or entity with a composite score of less than 1.5, other than a composite score calculated under 34 CFR 600.20(g) and § 668.176, that has entered against it a final monetary judgment or award, or enters into a monetary settlement which results from a legal proceeding, including from a lawsuit, arbitration, or mediation, whether or not the judgment, award or settlement has been paid, and as a result, the recalculated composite score for the institution or entity is less than 1.0, as determined by the Department under paragraph (e) of this section;


(B) On or after July 1, 2024, the institution or any entity whose financial statements were submitted in the prior fiscal year to meet the requirements of 34 CFR 600.20(g) or this subpart, is sued by a Federal or State authority to impose an injunction, establish fines or penalties, or to obtain financial relief such as damages, or in a qui tam action in which the United States has intervened, but only if the Federal or State action has been pending for 120 days, or a qui tam action has been pending for 120 days following intervention by the United States, and—


(*1*) No motion to dismiss, or its equivalent under State law has been filed within the applicable 120-day period; or


(*2*) If a motion to dismiss or its equivalent under State law, has been filed within the applicable 120-day period and denied, upon such denial;


(C) The Department has initiated action to recover from the institution the cost of adjudicated claims in favor of borrowers under the borrower defense to repayment provisions in 34 CFR part 685 and, the recalculated composite score for the institution or entity as a result of the adjudicated claims is less than 1.0, as determined by the Department under paragraph (e) of this section; or


(D) For an institution or entity that has submitted an application for a change in ownership under 34 CFR 600.20 that has entered against it a final monetary judgment or award, or enters into a monetary settlement which results from a legal proceeding, including from a lawsuit, arbitration, or mediation, or a monetary determination arising from an administrative proceeding described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) or (C) of this section, at any point through the end of the second full fiscal year after the change in ownership has occurred, and as a result, the recalculated composite score for the institution or entity is less than 1.0, as determined by the Department under paragraph (e) of this section. This trigger applies whether the judgment, award, settlement, or monetary determination has been paid.


(ii) *Withdrawal of owner's equity.* (A) For a proprietary institution whose composite score is less than 1.5, or for any proprietary institution through the end of the first full fiscal year following a change in ownership, and there is a withdrawal of owner's equity by any means, including by declaring a dividend, unless the withdrawal is a transfer to an entity included in the affiliated entity group on whose basis the institution's composite score was calculated; or is the equivalent of wages in a sole proprietorship or general partnership or a required dividend or return of capital; and


(B) As a result of that withdrawal, the institution's recalculated composite score for the entity whose financial statements were submitted to meet the requirements of § 668.23 for the annual submission, or 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h) for a change in ownership, is less than 1.0, as determined by the Department under paragraph (e) of this section.


(iii) *Gainful employment.* As determined annually by the Department, the institution received at least 50 percent of its title IV, HEA program funds in its most recently completed fiscal year from gainful employment (GE) programs that are “failing” under subpart S of this part. 


(iv) *Institutional teach-out plans or agreements.* The institution is required to submit a teach-out plan or agreement, by a State, the Department or another Federal agency, an accrediting agency, or other oversight body for reasons related in whole or in part to financial concerns.


(v) [Reserved]


(vi) *Publicly listed entities.* For an institution that is directly or indirectly owned at least 50 percent by an entity whose securities are listed on a domestic or foreign exchange, the entity is subject to one or more of the following actions or events:


(A) *SEC actions.* The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issues an order suspending or revoking the registration of any of the entity's securities pursuant to section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or suspends trading of the entity's securities pursuant to section 12(k) of the Exchange Act.


(B) *Other SEC actions.* The SEC files an action against the entity in district court or issues an order instituting proceeding pursuant to section 12(j) of the Exchange Act.


(C) *Exchange actions.* The exchange on which the entity's securities are listed notifies the entity that it is not in compliance with the exchange's listing requirements, or its securities are delisted.


(D) *SEC reports.* The entity failed to file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC within the time period prescribed for that report or by any extended due date under 17 CFR 240.12b-25.


(E) *Foreign exchanges or oversight authority.* The entity is subject to an event, notification, or condition by a foreign exchange or oversight authority that the Department determines is equivalent to those identified in paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section.


(vii) *Non-Federal educational assistance funds.* For its most recently completed fiscal year, a proprietary institution did not receive at least 10 percent of its revenue from sources other than Federal educational assistance, as provided under § 668.28(c). The financial protection provided under this paragraph (c)(3)(viii) will remain in place until the institution passes the 90/10 revenue requirement under § 668.28(c) for two consecutive years.


(viii) *Cohort default rates.* The institution's two most recent official cohort default rates are 30 percent or greater, as determined under subpart N of this part, unless—


(A) The institution files a challenge, request for adjustment, or appeal under subpart N of this part with respect to its rates for one or both of those fiscal years; and


(B) That challenge, request, or appeal remains pending, results in reducing below 30 percent the official cohort default rate for either or both of those years or precludes the rates from either or both years from resulting in a loss of eligibility or provisional certification.


(ix) [Reserved]


(x) *Contributions and distributions.* (A) An institution's financial statements required to be submitted under § 668.23 reflect a contribution in the last quarter of the fiscal year, and the entity that is part of the financial statements then made a distribution during the first two quarters of the next fiscal year; and


(B) The offset of such distribution against the contribution results in a recalculated composite score of less than 1.0, as determined by the Department under paragraph (e) of this section.


(xi) *Creditor events.* As a result of an action taken by the Department, the institution or any entity included in the financial statements submitted in the current or prior fiscal year under 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), § 668.23, or this subpart is subject to a default or other adverse condition under a line of credit, loan agreement, security agreement, or other financing arrangement.


(xii) *Declaration of financial exigency.* The institution declares a state of financial exigency to a Federal, State, Tribal, or foreign governmental agency or its accrediting agency.


(xiii) *Receivership.* The institution, or an owner or affiliate of the institution that has the power, by contract or ownership interest, to direct or cause the direction of the management of policies of the institution, files for a State or Federal receivership, or an equivalent proceeding under foreign law, or has entered against it an order appointing a receiver or appointing a person of similar status under foreign law.






(d) *Discretionary triggering events.* The Department may determine that an institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if the Department determines that a discretionary triggering event is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution. For those discretionary triggers that the Department determines will have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution, the Department will require the institution to provide financial protection as set forth in this subpart. The financial protection required under this paragraph (d) is not less than 10 percent of the total title IV, HEA funding in the prior fiscal year. If the Department requires financial protection as a result of more than one mandatory or discretionary trigger, the Department will require separate financial protection for each individual trigger. The Department will consider whether the financial protection can be released following the institution's submission of two full fiscal years of audited financial statements following the Department's notice that requires the posting of the financial protection. In making this determination, the Department considers whether the administrative or financial risk caused by the event has ceased or been resolved, including full payment of all damages, fines, penalties, liabilities, or other financial relief. The following are discretionary triggers:


(1) *Accrediting agency and government agency actions.* The institution's accrediting agency or a Federal, State, local, or Tribal authority places the institution on probation or issues a show-cause order or places the institution in a comparable status that poses an equivalent or greater risk to its accreditation, authorization, or eligibility.


(2) *Other defaults, delinquencies, creditor events, and judgments.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(xi) of this section, the institution or any entity included in the financial statements submitted in the current or prior fiscal year under 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), § 668.23, or this subpart is subject to a default or other adverse condition under a line of credit, loan agreement, security agreement, or other financing arrangement;


(ii) Under that line of credit, loan agreement, security agreement, or other financing arrangement, a monetary or nonmonetary default or delinquency or other event occurs that allows the creditor to require or impose on the institution or any entity included in the financial statements submitted in the current or prior fiscal year under 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), § 668.23, or this subpart, an increase in collateral, a change in contractual obligations, an increase in interest rates or payments, or other sanctions, penalties, or fees;


(iii) Any creditor of the institution or any entity included in the financial statements submitted in the current or prior fiscal year under 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), § 668.23, or this subpart takes action to terminate, withdraw, limit, or suspend a loan agreement or other financing arrangement or calls due a balance on a line of credit with an outstanding balance;


(iv) The institution or any entity included in the financial statements submitted in the current or prior fiscal year under 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), § 668.23, or this subpart enters into a line of credit, loan agreement, security agreement, or other financing arrangement whereby the institution or entity may be subject to a default or other adverse condition as a result of any action taken by the Department; or


(v) The institution or any entity included in the financial statements submitted in the current or prior fiscal year under 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), § 668.23, or this subpart has a judgment awarding monetary relief entered against it that is subject to appeal or under appeal.


(3) *Fluctuations in title IV volume.* There is a significant fluctuation between consecutive award years, or a period of award years, in the amount of Direct Loan or Pell Grant funds, or a combination of those funds, received by the institution that cannot be accounted for by changes in those programs.


(4) *High annual dropout rates.* As calculated by the Department, the institution has high annual dropout rates.


(5) *Interim reporting.* For an institution required to provide additional financial reporting to the Department due to a failure to meet the financial responsibility standards in this subpart or due to a change in ownership, there are negative cash flows, failure of other financial ratios, cash flows that significantly miss the projections submitted to the Department, withdrawal rates that increase significantly, or other indicators of a significant change in the financial condition of the institution.


(6) *Pending borrower defense claims.* There are pending claims for borrower relief discharge under 34 CFR 685.400 from students or former students of the institution and the Department has formed a group process to consider claims under 34 CFR 685.402 and, if approved, those claims could be subject to recoupment.


(7) *Discontinuation of programs.* The institution discontinues academic programs that enroll more than 25 percent of its enrolled students who receive title IV, HEA program funds.


(8) *Closure of locations.* The institution closes locations that enroll more than 25 percent of its students who receive title IV, HEA program funds.


(9) *State actions and citations.* The institution, or one or more of its programs, is cited by a State licensing or authorizing agency for failing to meet State or agency requirements, including notice that it will withdraw or terminate the institution's licensure or authorization if the institution does not take the steps necessary to come into compliance with that requirement.

(1) For a proprietary institution, debts, liabilities, and losses (including cumulative debts, liabilities, and losses for all triggering events) since the end of the prior fiscal year incurred by the entity whose financial statements were submitted in the prior fiscal year to meet the requirements of § 668.23 or this subpart, and debts, liabilities, and losses (including cumulative debts, liabilities, and losses for all triggering events) through the end of the first full fiscal year following a change in ownership incurred by the entity whose financial statements were submitted for 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), will be adjusted as follows:


(i) For the primary reserve ratio, increasing expenses and decreasing adjusted equity by that amount.


(ii) For the equity ratio, decreasing modified equity by that amount.


(iii) For the net income ratio, decreasing income before taxes by that amount.


(2) For a nonprofit institution, debts, liabilities, and losses (including cumulative debts, liabilities, and losses for all triggering events) since the end of the prior fiscal year incurred by the entity whose financial statements were submitted in the prior fiscal year to meet the requirements of § 668.23 or this subpart, and debts, liabilities, and losses (including cumulative debts, liabilities, and losses for all triggering events) through the end of the first full fiscal year following a change in ownership incurred by the entity whose financial statements were submitted for 34 CFR 600.20(g) or (h), will be adjusted as follows:

(4) For a proprietary institution, a contribution and distribution in the entity whose financial statements were submitted in the prior fiscal year to meet the requirements of § 668.23, this subpart, or 34 CFR 600.20(g) will be adjusted as follows:


(i) For the primary reserve ratio, decreasing adjusted equity by the amount of the distribution.


(ii) For the equity ratio, decreasing modified equity by the amount of the distribution.








(f) *Reporting requirements.* (1) In accordance with procedures established by the Department, an institution must timely notify the Department of the following actions or events:

In response to that notice, the institution must report the total amount of the wage-equivalent distributions it made during its prior fiscal year and any distributions that were made to pay any taxes related to the operation of the institution. During its current fiscal year and the first six months of its subsequent fiscal year (18-month period), the institution is not required to report any distributions to the Department, provided that the institution does not make wage-equivalent distributions that exceed 150 percent of the total amount of wage-equivalent distributions it made during its prior fiscal year, less any distributions that were made to pay any taxes related to the operation of the institution. However, if the institution makes wage-equivalent distributions that exceed 150 percent of the total amount of wage-equivalent distributions it made during its prior fiscal year less any distributions that were made to pay any taxes related to the operation of the institution at any time during the 18-month period, it must report each of those distributions no later than 21 days after they are made, and the Department recalculates the institution's composite score based on the cumulative amount of the distributions made at that time;

(3)(i) In its timely notice to the Department under this paragraph (f), or in its response to a determination by the Department that the institution is not financially responsible because of a triggering event under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section that does not have a notice requirement set forth in this paragraph (f), in accordance with procedures established by the Department, the institution may—


(A) Show that the creditor waived a violation of a loan agreement under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. However, if the creditor imposes additional constraints or requirements as a condition of waiving the violation, or imposes penalties or requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the institution must identify and describe those penalties, constraints, or requirements and demonstrate that complying with those actions will not significantly affect the institution's ability to meet its financial obligations;


(B) Show that the triggering event has been resolved, or for obligations resulting from monetary judgments, awards, settlements, or administrative determinations that arise under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (D) of this section, that the institution can demonstrate that insurance will cover all of the obligation, or for purposes of recalculation under paragraph (e) of this section, that insurance will cover a portion of the obligation; or


(C) Explain or provide information about the conditions or circumstances that precipitated a triggering event under paragraph (d) of this section that demonstrates that the triggering event has not had, or will not have, a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution.


(ii) The Department will consider the information provided by the institution in its notification of the triggering event in determining whether to issue a determination that the institution is not financially responsible.






(g) *Public institutions.* (1) The Department considers a domestic public institution to be financially responsible if the institution—


(i) Notifies the Department that it is designated as a public institution by the State, local, or municipal government entity, Tribal authority, or other government entity that has the legal authority to make that designation; and


(ii) Provides a letter or other documentation acceptable to the Department and signed by an official of that government entity confirming that the institution is a public institution and is backed by the full faith and credit of the government entity in the following circumstances—


(A) Before the institution's initial certification as a public institution;


(B) Upon a change in ownership and request to be recognized as a public institution; or


(C) Upon request by the Department, which could include during the recertification of a public institution;


(iii) Is not subject to a condition of past performance under § 668.174; and


(iv) Is not subject to an automatic mandatory triggering event as described in paragraph (c) of this section or a discretionary triggering event as described in paragraph (d) of this section that the Department determines will have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution.


(2) The Department considers a foreign public institution to be financially responsible if the institution—


(i) Notifies the Department that it is designated as a public institution by the country or other government entity that has the legal authority to make that designation; and


(ii) Provides a letter or other documentation acceptable to the Department and signed by an official of that country or other government entity confirming that the institution is a public institution and is backed by the full faith and credit of the country or other government entity. This letter or other documentation must be submitted before the institution's initial certification, upon a change in ownership and request to be recognized as a public institution, and for the first re-certification of a public institution after July 1, 2024. Thereafter, the letter or other documentation must be submitted in the following circumstances—


(A) When the institution submits an application for re-certification following any period of provisional certification;


(B) Within 10 business days following a change in the governmental status of the institution whereby the institution is no longer backed by the full faith and credit of the government entity; or


(C) Upon request by the Department;


(iii) Is not subject to a condition of past performance under § 668.174; and


(iv) Is not subject to an automatic mandatory triggering event as described in paragraph (c) of this section or a discretionary triggering event as described in paragraph (d) of this section that the Department determines will have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution.










(h) *Audit opinions and disclosures.* Even if an institution satisfies all of the general standards of financial responsibility under paragraph (b) of this section, the Department does not consider the institution to be financially responsible if the institution's audited financial statements—


(1) Include an opinion expressed by the auditor that was an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion, unless the Department determines that the adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion does not have a significant bearing on the institution's financial condition; or


(2) Include a disclosure in the notes to the institution's or entity's audited financial statements about the institution's or entity's diminished liquidity, ability to continue operations, or ability to continue as a going concern, unless the Department determines that the diminished liquidity, ability to continue operations, or ability to continue as a going concern has been alleviated. The Department may conclude that diminished liquidity, ability to continue operations, or ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated even if the disclosure provides that those concerns have been alleviated.








(i) *Administrative actions.* If the Department determines that an institution is not financially responsible under the standards and provisions of this section or under an alternative standard in § 668.175, or the institution does not submit its financial statements and compliance audits by the date and in the manner required under § 668.23, the Department may—


(1) Initiate an action under subpart G of this part to fine the institution, or limit, suspend, or terminate the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs;


(2) For an institution that is provisionally certified, take an action against the institution under the procedures established in § 668.13(d); or


(3) Deny the institution's application for certification or recertification to participate in the title IV, HEA programs.
