# § 668.175   Alternative standards and requirements.

(a) *General.* An institution that is not financially responsible under the general standards and provisions in § 668.171, may begin or continue to participate in the title IV, HEA programs by qualifying under an alternate standard set forth in this section.




(b) *Letter of credit or cash escrow alternative for new institutions.* A new institution that is not financially responsible solely because the Department determines that its composite score is less than 1.5, qualifies as a financially responsible institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Department, or providing other financial protection described under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, for an amount equal to at least one-half of the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that the Department determines the institution will receive during its initial year of participation. A new institution is an institution that seeks to participate for the first time in the title IV, HEA programs.






(c) *Financial protection alternative for participating institutions.* A participating institution that is not financially responsible, either because it does not satisfy one or more of the standards of financial responsibility under § 668.171(b), (c), or (d), or because of an audit opinion or disclosure about the institution's liquidity, ability to continue operations, or ability to continue as a going concern described under § 668.171(h), qualifies as a financially responsible institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Department, or providing other financial protection described under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, for an amount determined by the Department that is not less than one-half of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year, except that this paragraph (c) does not apply to a public institution. For purposes of a failure under § 668.171(b)(2) or (3), the institution must also remedy the issue(s) that gave rise to the failure to the Department's satisfaction.






(d) *Zone alternative.* (1) A participating institution that is not financially responsible solely because the Department determines that its composite score under § 668.172 is less than 1.5 may participate in the title IV, HEA programs as a financially responsible institution for no more than three consecutive years, beginning with the year in which the Department determines that the institution qualifies under the alternative in this paragraph (d).


(i)(A) An institution qualifies initially under this alternative if, based on the institution's audited financial statements for its most recently completed fiscal year, the Department determines that its composite score is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4; and


(B) An institution continues to qualify under this alternative if, based on the institution's audited financial statements for each of its subsequent two fiscal years, the Department determines that the institution's composite score is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4.


(ii) An institution that qualified under this alternative for three consecutive years, or for one of those years, may not seek to qualify again under this alternative until the year after the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, as determined by the Department.


(2) Under the zone alternative, the Department—


(i) Requires the institution to make disbursements to eligible students and parents, and to otherwise comply with the provisions, under either the heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement payment method described in § 668.162;


(ii) Requires the institution to provide timely information regarding any of the following oversight and financial events—


(A) Any event that causes the institution, or related entity as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 850, to realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in the institution's or related entity's most recent audited financial statements; or


(B) In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 and ASC 225 and taking into account the environment in which the entity operates, any losses that are unusual in nature, meaning the underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the entity, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates; infrequently occur, meaning the underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future; or both;


(iii) May require the institution to submit its financial statement and compliance audits earlier than the time specified under § 668.23(a)(4); and


(iv) May require the institution to provide information about its current operations and future plans.


(3) Under the zone alternative, the institution must—


(i) For any oversight or financial event described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section for which the institution is required to provide information, in accordance with procedures established by the Department, notify the Department no later than 10 days after that event occur; and


(ii) As part of its compliance audit, require its auditor to express an opinion on the institution's compliance with the requirements under the zone alternative in this paragraph (d), including the institution's administration of the payment method under which the institution received and disbursed title IV, HEA program funds.


(4) If an institution fails to comply with the requirements under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, the Department may determine that the institution no longer qualifies under the alternative in this paragraph (d).




(e) [Reserved]


(f) *Provisional certification alternative.* (1) The Department may permit an institution that is not financially responsible to participate in the title IV, HEA programs under a provisional certification for no more than three consecutive years if—

(2) Under the alternative in this paragraph (f), the institution must—


(i) Provide to the Department an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Department, or provide other financial protection described under paragraph (h) of this section, for an amount determined by the Department that is not less than 10 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year, except that this paragraph (f)(2)(i) does not apply to a public institution that the Department determines is backed by the full faith and credit of the State or equivalent governmental entity;

(ii) May require one or more of the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), to be jointly or severally liable for any liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs; and


(iii) May require the institution to provide, or continue to provide, the financial protection resulting from an event described in § 668.171(c) and (d) until the institution meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

(g) *Provisional certification alternative for persons or entities owing liabilities.* (1) The Secretary may permit an institution that is not financially responsible because the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution owe a liability for a violation of a title IV, HEA program requirement, to participate in the title IV, HEA programs under a provisional certification only if—


(i)(A) The persons or entities that exercise substantial control, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), repay or enter into an agreement with the Secretary to repay the applicable portion of that liability, as provided under § 668.174(b)(2)(ii); or

(iii) The institution submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount determined by the Secretary that is not less than 10 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year.

(2) In lieu of submitting a letter of credit for the amount required by the Secretary under this section, the Secretary may permit an institution to—


(i) Provide the amount required in the form of other surety or financial protection that the Secretary specifies in a document published in the _Federal Register_;


(ii) Provide cash for the amount required; or


(iii) Enter into an arrangement under which the Secretary offsets the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that an institution has earned in a manner that ensures that, no later than the end of a six to twelve-month period selected by the Secretary, the amount offset equals the amount of financial protection the institution is required to provide.
