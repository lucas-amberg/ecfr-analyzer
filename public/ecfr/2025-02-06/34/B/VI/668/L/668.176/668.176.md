# § 668.176   Change in ownership.

(a) *Purpose.* To continue participation in the title IV, HEA programs during and following a change in ownership, institutions must meet the financial responsibility requirements in this section.


(b) *Materially complete application.* To meet the requirements of a materially complete application under 34 CFR 600.20(g)(3)(iii) and (iv)—


(1) An institution undergoing a change in ownership and control as provided under 34 CFR 600.31 must submit audited financial statements of its two most recently completed fiscal years prior to the change in ownership, at the level of the change in ownership or the level of financial statements required by the Department, that are prepared and audited in accordance with the requirements of § 668.23(d); and


(2) The institution must submit audited financial statements of the institution's new owner's two most recently completed fiscal years prior to the change in ownership that are prepared and audited in accordance with the requirements of § 668.23 at the highest level of unfractured ownership or at the level required by the Department.


(i) If the institution's new owner does not have two years of acceptable audited financial statements, the institution must provide financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or cash to the Department in the amount of 25 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year;


(ii) If the institution's new owner only has one year of acceptable financial statements, the institution must provide financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or cash to the Department in the amount of 10 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year; or


(iii) For an entity where no individual new owner obtains control, but the combined ownership of the new owners is equal to or exceeds the ownership share of the existing ownership, financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or cash to the Department in the amount of 25 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year, based on the combined ownership share of the new owners, except for any new owner that submits two years or one year of acceptable audited financial statements as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(3) The institution must meet the financial responsibility requirements in this paragraph (b)(3). In general, the Department considers an institution to be financially responsible only if it—


(i) For a for-profit institution evaluated at the ownership level required by the Department for the new owner—


(A) Has not had operating losses in either or both of its two latest fiscal years that in sum result in a decrease in tangible net worth in excess of 10 percent of the institution's tangible net worth at the beginning of the first year of the two-year period. The Department may calculate an operating loss for an institution by excluding prior period adjustment and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. For purposes of this section, the calculation of tangible net worth must exclude all related party accounts receivable/other assets and all assets defined as intangible in accordance with the composite score;


(B) Has, for its two most recent fiscal years, a positive tangible net worth. In applying the standard in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B), a positive tangible net worth occurs when the institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth excludes all related party accounts receivable/other assets and all assets classified as intangible in accordance with the composite score; and


(C) Has a passing composite score and meets the other financial requirements of this subpart for its most recently completed fiscal year.


(ii) For a nonprofit institution evaluated at the ownership level required by the Department for the new owner—


(A) Has, at the end of its two most recent fiscal years, positive net assets without donor restrictions. The Department will exclude all related party receivables/other assets from net assets without donor restrictions and all assets classified as intangibles in accordance with the composite score;


(B) Has not had an excess of net assets without donor restriction expenditures over net assets without donor restriction revenues over both of its two latest fiscal years that results in a decrease exceeding 10 percent in either the net assets without donor restrictions from the start to the end of the two-year period or the net assets without donor restriction in either one of the two years. The Department may exclude from net changes in fund balances for the operating loss calculation prior period adjustment and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. In calculating the net assets without donor restriction, the Department will exclude all related party accounts receivable/other assets and all assets classified as intangible in accordance with the composite score; and


(C) Has a passing composite score and meets the other financial requirements of this subpart for its most recently completed fiscal year.


(iii) For a public institution, has its liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of a State or equivalent governmental entity.


(4) For a for-profit or nonprofit institution that is not financially responsible under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, provide financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or cash in an amount that is not less than 10 percent of the prior year title IV, HEA funding or an amount determined by the Department, and follow the zone requirements in § 668.175(d).


(c) *Acquisition debt.* (1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, the Department may determine that the institution is not financially responsible following a change in ownership if the amount of debt assumed to complete the change in ownership requires payments (either periodic or balloon) that are inconsistent with available cash to service those payments based on enrollments for the period prior to when the payment is or will be due.


(2) For a for-profit or nonprofit institution that is not financially responsible under this section, provide financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or cash in an amount that is not less than 10 percent of the prior year title IV, HEA funding or an amount determined by the Department, and follow the zone requirements in § 668.175(d).


(d) *Terms of the extension.* To meet the requirements for a temporary provisional program participation agreement following a change in ownership, as described in 34 CFR 600.20(h)(3)(i), an institution must meet the following requirements:


(1) For a proprietary institution or a nonprofit institution—

(B) As part of the same-day balance sheet or statement of financial position, the institution must include a disclosure that includes all related-party transactions, and such details as would enable the Department to identify the related party in accordance with the requirements of § 668.23(d). Such information must include, but is not limited to, the name, location, and description of the related entity, including the nature and amount of any transaction between the related party and the institution, financial or otherwise, regardless of when it occurred;

The acid test ratio must be calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities. The calculation of the acid test ratio must exclude all related party receivables/other assets and all assets classified as intangibles in accordance with the composite score;


(E) A proprietary institution's same-day balance sheet must demonstrate a positive tangible net worth the day after the change in ownership.
