# § 668.182   Definitions of terms used in this subpart.

We use the following definitions in this subpart: 


(a) *Cohort.* Your cohort is a group of borrowers used to determine your cohort default rate. The method for identifying the borrowers in a cohort is provided in § 668.183(b). 


(b) *Data manager.* (1) For FFELP loans held by a guaranty agency or lender, the guaranty agency is the data manager. 


(2) For FFELP loans that we hold, we are the data manager. 


(3) For Direct Loan Program loans, the Direct Loan Servicer, as defined in 34 CFR 685.102, is the data manager. 


(c) *Days.* In this subpart, “days” means calendar days. 


(d) *Default.* A borrower is considered to be in default for cohort default rate purposes under the rules in § 668.183(c). 


(e) *Draft cohort default rate.* Your draft cohort default rate is a rate we issue, for your review, before we issue your official cohort default rate. A draft cohort default rate is used only for the purposes described in § 668.185. 


(f) *Entering repayment.* (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, loans are considered to enter repayment on the dates described in 34 CFR 682.200 (under the definition of “repayment period”) and in 34 CFR 685.207. 


(2) A Federal SLS loan is considered to enter repayment—


(i) At the same time the borrower's Federal Stafford loan enters repayment, if the borrower received the Federal SLS loan and the Federal Stafford loan during the same period of continuous enrollment; or 


(ii) In all other cases, on the day after the student ceases to be enrolled at an institution on at least a half-time basis in an educational program leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential. 


(3) For the purposes of this subpart, a loan is considered to enter repayment on the date that a borrower repays it in full, if the loan is paid in full before the loan enters repayment under paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. 


(g) *Fiscal year.* A fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on the following September 30. A fiscal year is identified by the calendar year in which it ends. 


(h) *Loan record detail report.* The loan record detail report is a report that we produce. It contains the data used to calculate your draft or official cohort default rate. 


(i) *Official cohort default rate.* Your official cohort default rate is the cohort default rate that we publish for you under § 668.186. Cohort default rates calculated under this subpart are not related in any way to cohort default rates that are calculated for the Federal Perkins Loan Program. 


(j) *We.* We are the Department, the Secretary, or the Secretary's designee.


(k) *You.* You are an institution.
