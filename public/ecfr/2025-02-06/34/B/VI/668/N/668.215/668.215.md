# § 668.215   Average rates appeals.

(a) *Eligibility.* (1) You may appeal a notice of a loss of eligibility under § 668.206(a)(1), based on one cohort default rate over 40 percent, if that cohort default rate is calculated as an average rate under § 668.202(d)(2).


(2) You may appeal a notice of a loss of eligibility under § 668.206(a)(2), based on three cohort default rates of 30 percent or greater, if at least two of those cohort default rates—


(i) Are calculated as average rates under § 668.202(d)(2); and


(ii) Would be less than 30 percent if calculated for the fiscal year alone using the method described in § 668.202(d)(1).


(b) *Deadline for submitting an appeal.* (1) Before notifying you of your official cohort default rate, we make an initial determination about whether you qualify for an average rates appeal. If we determine that you qualify, we notify you of that determination at the same time that we notify you of your official cohort default rate.


(2) If you disagree with our initial determination, you must send us your average rates appeal, including all supporting documentation, within 30 days after you receive the notice of your loss of eligibility.


(c) *Determination.* You do not lose eligibility under § 668.206 if we determine that you meet the requirements for an average rates appeal.
