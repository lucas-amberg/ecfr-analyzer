# § 668.233   Student eligibility.

A student with an intellectual disability is eligible to receive Federal Pell, FSEOG, and FWS program assistance under this subpart if—


(a) The student satisfies the general student eligibility requirements under § 668.32, except for the requirements in paragraphs (a), (e), and (f) of that section. With regard to these exceptions, a student—


(1) Does not have to be enrolled for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certificate;


(2) Is not required to have a high school diploma, a recognized equivalent of a high school diploma, or have passed an ability to benefit test; and


(3) Is making satisfactory progress according to the institution's published standards for students enrolled in its comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs;


(b) The student is enrolled in a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program approved by the Secretary; and


(c) The institution obtains a record from a local educational agency that the student is or was eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA. If that record does not identify the student as having an intellectual disability, as described in paragraph (1) of the definition of a student with an intellectual disability in § 668.231, the institution must also obtain documentation establishing that the student has an intellectual disability, such as—


(1) A documented comprehensive and individualized psycho-educational evaluation and diagnosis of an intellectual disability by a psychologist or other qualified professional; or


(2) A record of the disability from a local or State educational agency, or government agency, such as the Social Security Administration or a vocational rehabilitation agency, that identifies the intellectual disability.
