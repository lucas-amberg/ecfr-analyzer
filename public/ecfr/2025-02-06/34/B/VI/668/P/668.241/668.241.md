# § 668.241   Best interest determination.

(a) An oversight entity's determination that a prison education program is operating in the best interest of students—


(1) Must include an assessment of—


(i) Whether the experience, credentials, and rates of turnover or departure of instructors for the prison education program are substantially similar to other programs at the institution, accounting for the unique geographic and other constraints of prison education programs;


(ii) Whether the transferability of credits for courses available to confined or incarcerated individuals and the applicability of such credits toward related degree or certificate programs is substantially similar to those at other similar programs at the institution, accounting for the unique geographic and other constraints of prison education programs;


(iii) Whether the prison education program's offering of relevant academic and career advising services to participating confined or incarcerated individuals, while they are confined or incarcerated, in advance of reentry, and upon release, is substantially similar to offerings to a student who is not a confined or incarcerated individual and who is enrolled in, and may be preparing to transfer from, the same institution, accounting for the unique geographic and other constraints of prison education programs; and


(iv) Whether the institution ensures that all formerly confined or incarcerated individuals are able to fully transfer their credits and continue their programs at any location of the institution that offers a comparable program, including by the same mode of instruction; and


(2) May include an assessment of—


(i) Whether the rates of recidivism, which do not include any recidivism by the student after a reasonable number of years of release and which only include new felony convictions, defined as each sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month (*see* United States Sentencing Guideline section 4A1.1(a)), meet thresholds set by the oversight entity;


(ii) Whether the rates of completion reported by the Department, which do not include any students who were transferred across facilities and which account for the status of part-time students, meet thresholds set by the oversight entity with input from relevant stakeholders;


(iii) Whether the rate of confined or incarcerated individuals continuing their education post-release, as determined by the percentage of students who reenroll in higher education reported by the Department, meets thresholds established by the oversight entity with input from relevant stakeholders;


(iv) Whether job placement rates in the relevant field for such individuals meet any applicable standards required by the accrediting agency for the institution or program or a State where the institution is authorized. If no job placement rate standard applies to prison education programs offered by the institution, the oversight entity may define, and the institution may report, a job placement rate, with input from relevant stakeholders;


(v) Earnings for such individuals, which could include measuring such earnings against a threshold established by the oversight entity; and


(vi) Other indicators pertinent to program success as determined by the oversight entity.


(b) An oversight entity makes the best interest determination—


(1) Through a feedback process that considers input from relevant stakeholders; and


(2) In light of the totality of the circumstances.


(c) If the oversight entity does not find a program to be in the best interest of students, it must allow for programs to re-apply within a reasonable timeframe.


(d) After the two years of initial approval under § 668.236, the oversight entity must determine that the prison education program is operating in the best interest of students, under paragraph (a) of this section.


(e)(1) After its initial determination under paragraph (d) of this section that a program is operating in the best interest of confined or incarcerated individuals, the institution must obtain subsequent evaluations of each eligible prison education program from the responsible oversight entity not less than 120 calendar days prior to the expiration of the institution's Program Participation Agreements. The oversight entity may also make a determination between subsequent evaluations based on the oversight entity's regular monitoring and evaluation of program outcomes.


(2) Each subsequent evaluation must—


(i) Include the entire period following the prior determination and be based on the applicable factors in paragraph (a) of this section for all students enrolled in the program since the prior determination;


(ii) Include input from relevant stakeholders through the oversight entity's feedback process; and


(iii) Be submitted to the Secretary no later than 30 days following completion of the evaluation.


(f)(1) The institution must obtain and maintain documentation of the methodology by which the oversight entity made each determination under this section and under § 668.236(a)(2) and (3) for review by the institution's accrediting agency, for submission to the Department for approval of the first program at the first two additional locations, to document input from relevant stakeholders through the oversight entity's feedback process in paragraphs (b)(1) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, for reporting to the Department, and for public disclosure.


(2) The institution must maintain the documentation described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for as long as the program is active or, if the program is discontinued, for three years following the date of discontinuance.
