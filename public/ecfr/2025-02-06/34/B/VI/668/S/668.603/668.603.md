# § 668.603   Ineligible GE programs.

(a) *Ineligible programs.* If a GE program is a failing program under the D/E rates measure in § 668.402 in two out of any three consecutive award years for which the program's D/E rates are calculated, or the earnings premium measure in § 668.402 in two out of any three consecutive award years for which the program's earnings premium measure is calculated, the program is ineligible and its participation in the title IV, HEA programs ends upon the earliest of—


(1) The issuance of a new Eligibility and Certification Approval Report that does not include that program;


(2) The completion of a termination action of program eligibility, if an action is initiated under subpart G of this part; or


(3) A revocation of program eligibility if the institution is provisionally certified.


(b) *Basis for appeal.* If the Secretary initiates an action under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the institution may initiate an appeal under subpart G of this part if it believes the Secretary erred in the calculation of the program's D/E rates under § 668.403 or the earnings premium measure under § 668.404. Institutions may not dispute a program's ineligibility based upon its D/E rates or the earnings premium measure except as described in this paragraph (b).


(c) *Restrictions*—(1) *Ineligible program.* Except as provided in § 668.26(d), an institution may not disburse title IV, HEA program funds to students enrolled in an ineligible program.


(2) *Period of ineligibility.* An institution may not seek to reestablish the eligibility of a failing GE program that it discontinued voluntarily either before or after D/E rates or the earnings premium measure are issued for that program, or reestablish the eligibility of a program that is ineligible under theD/E rates or the earnings premium measure, until three years following the earlier of the date the program loses eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section or the date the institution voluntarily discontinued the failing program.


(3) *Restoring eligibility.* An ineligible program, or a failing program that an institution voluntarily discontinues, remains ineligible until the institution establishes the eligibility of that program under § 668.604(c).
