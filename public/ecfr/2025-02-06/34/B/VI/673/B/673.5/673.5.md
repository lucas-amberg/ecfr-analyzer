# § 673.5   Overaward.

(a) *Overaward prohibited*—(1) *Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG Programs.* An institution may only award or disburse a Federal Perkins loan or an FSEOG to a student if that loan or the FSEOG, combined with the other estimated financial assistance the student receives, does not exceed the student's financial need.


(2) *FWS Program.* An institution may only award FWS employment to a student if the award, combined with the other estimated financial assistance the student receives, does not exceed the student's financial need.


(b) *Awarding and disbursement.* (1) When awarding and disbursing a Federal Perkins loan or an FSEOG or awarding FWS employment to a student, the institution shall take into account those amounts of estimated financial assistance it—


(i) Can reasonably anticipate at the time it awards Federal Perkins Loan funds, an FSEOG, or FWS funds to the student;


(ii) Makes available to its students; or


(iii) Otherwise knows about.


(2) If a student receives amounts of estimated financial assistance at any time during the award period that were not considered in calculating the Federal Perkins Loan amount or the FWS or FSEOG award, and the total amount of estimated financial assistance including the loan, the FSEOG, or the prospective FWS wages exceeds the student's need, the overaward is the amount that exceeds need.


(c) *Estimated financial assistance.* (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, the Secretary considers that “estimated financial assistance” includes, but is not limited to, any—


(i) Funds a student is entitled to receive from a Federal Pell Grant;


(ii) William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans;


(iii) Federal Family Education Loans;


(iv) Long-term need-based loans, including Federal Perkins loans;


(v) Grants, including FSEOGs, State grants, Academic Competitiveness Grants, and National SMART Grants;


(vi) Scholarships, including athletic scholarships;


(vii) Waivers of tuition and fees;


(viii) Fellowships or assistantships, except non-need-based employment portions of such awards;


(ix) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, veterans' education benefits;


(x) National service education awards or post-service benefits paid for the cost of attendance under title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (AmeriCorps);


(xi) Net earnings from need-based employment;


(xii) Insurance programs for the student's education; and


(xiii) Any educational benefits paid because of enrollment in a postsecondary education institution, or to cover postsecondary education expenses.


(2) The Secretary does not consider as estimated financial assistance—


(i) Any portion of the estimated financial assistance described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section that is included in the calculation of the student's expected family contribution (EFC);


(ii) Earnings from non-need-based employment;


(iii) Those amounts used to replace EFC, including the amounts of any TEACH Grants, unsubsidized Federal Stafford or Direct Loans, Federal PLUS or Federal Direct PLUS Loans, and non-federal non-need-based loans, including private, state-sponsored, and institutional loans. However, if the sum of the amounts received that are being used to replace the student's EFC actually exceed the EFC, the excess amount must be treated as estimated financial assistance;


(iv) Assistance not received under a title IV, HEA program, if that assistance is designated to offset all or a portion of a specific component of the cost of attendance and that amount is excluded from the cost of attendance as well. If that assistance is excluded from either estimated financial assistance or cost of attendance, that amount must be excluded from both;


(v) Federal veterans' education benefits paid under—


(A) Chapter 103 of title 10, United States Code (Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps);


(B) Chapter 106A of title 10, United States Code (Educational Assistance for Persons Enlisting for Active Duty);

(I) Chapter 35 of title 38, United States Code (Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program);


(J) Section 903 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981 (10 U.S.C. 2141 note) (Educational Assistance Pilot Program);


(K) Section 156(b) of the “Joint Resolution making further continuing appropriations and providing for productive employment for the fiscal year 1983, and for other purposes” (42 U.S.C. 402 note) (Restored Entitlement Program for Survivors, also known as “Quayle benefits”);


(L) The provisions of chapter 3 of title 37, United States Code, related to subsistence allowances for members of the Reserve Officers Training Corps; and


(M) Any program that the Secretary may determine is covered by section 480(c)(2) of the HEA; and


(vi) Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants made under section 420R of the HEA.


(3) The institution may also exclude as estimated financial assistance any portion of a subsidized Federal Stafford or Direct Loan that is equal to or less than the amount of a student's national service education awards or post service benefits paid for the cost of attendance under title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (AmeriCorps).


(d) *Treatment of estimated financial assistance in excess of need—General.* An institution shall take the following steps if it learns that a student has received additional amounts of estimated financial assistance not included in the calculation of Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG eligibility that would result in the student's total amount of estimated financial assistance exceeding his or her financial need by more than $300:


(1) The institution shall decide whether the student has increased financial need that was unanticipated when it awarded financial aid to the student. If the student demonstrates increased financial need and the total amount of estimated financial assistance does not exceed this increased need by more than $300, no further action is necessary.


(2) If the student's total amount of estimated financial assistance still exceeds his or her need by more than $300, as recalculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the institution shall cancel any undisbursed loan or grant (other than a Federal Pell Grant).


(3) *Federal Perkins loan and FSEOG overpayment.* If the student's total amount of estimated financial assistance still exceeds his or her need by more than $300, after the institution takes the steps required in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the institution shall consider the amount by which the estimated financial assistance amount exceeds the student's financial need by more than $300 as an overpayment. 


(e) *Termination of FWS employment.* (1) An institution may fund a student's FWS employment with FWS funds only until the amount of the FWS award has been earned or until the student's financial need, as recalculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, is met.


(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an institution may provide additional FWS funding to a student whose need has been met until that student's cumulative earnings from all need-based employment occurring subsequent to the time his or her financial need has been met exceed $300.


(f) *Liability for and recovery of Federal Perkins loans and FSEOG overpayments.* (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, a student is liable for any Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment made to him or her. An FSEOG overpayment for purposes of this paragraph does not include the non-Federal share of an FSEOG award if an institution meets its FSEOG matching share by the individual recipient method or the aggregate method. 


(2) The institution is liable for a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment if the overpayment occurred because the institution failed to follow the procedures in this part or 34 CFR parts 668, 674, or 676. The institution shall restore an amount equal to the overpayment and any administrative cost allowance claimed on that amount to its loan fund for a Federal Perkins loan overpayment or to its FSEOG account for an FSEOG overpayment. 


(3) A student is not liable for, and the institution is not required to attempt recovery of, a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment, nor is the institution required to refer an FSEOG overpayment to the Secretary, if the overpayment— 


(i) Is less than $25; and 


(ii) Is neither a remaining balance nor a result of the application of the overaward threshold in paragraph (d) of this section.


(4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if an institution makes a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment for which it is not liable, it shall promptly send a written notice to the student requesting repayment of the overpayment amount. The notice must state that failure to make that repayment, or to make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to pay the overpayment, makes the student ineligible for further title IV, HEA program funds until final resolution of the overpayment. 


(ii) If a student objects to the institution's Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG overpayment determination on the grounds that it is erroneous, the institution shall consider any information provided by the student and determine whether the objection is warranted. 


(5) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if a student fails to repay an FSEOG overpayment or make arrangements satisfactory to the holder of the overpayment debt to repay the FSEOG overpayment after the institution has taken the action required by paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the institution must refer the FSEOG overpayment to the Secretary for collection purposes in accordance with procedures required by the Secretary. After referring the FSEOG overpayment to the Secretary under this section, the institution need make no further effort to recover the overpayment.
