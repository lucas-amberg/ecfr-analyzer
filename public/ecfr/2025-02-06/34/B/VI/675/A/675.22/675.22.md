# § 675.22   Employment provided by a Federal, State, or local public agency, or a private nonprofit organization.

(a) If a student is employed by a Federal, State, or local public agency, or a private nonprofit organization, the work that the student performs must be in the public interest.

(2) It is for an elected official who is not responsible for the regular administration of Federal, State, or local government;
