# ยง 676.10   Selection of students for FSEOG awards.

(a)(1) In selecting among eligible students for FSEOG awards in each award year, an institution shall select those students with the lowest expected family contributions who will also receive Federal Pell Grants in that year.


(2) If the institution has FSEOG funds remaining after giving FSEOG awards to all the Federal Pell Grant recipients at the institution, the institution shall award the remaining FSEOG funds to those eligible students with the lowest expected family contributions who will not receive Federal Pell Grants.


(b) *Part-time and independent students.* If an institution's allocation of FSEOG funds is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need demonstrated by students attending the institution as less-than-full-time or independent students, a reasonable portion of the allocation must be offered to those students.
