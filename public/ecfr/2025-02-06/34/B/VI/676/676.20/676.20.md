(a) An institution may award an FSEOG for an academic year in an amount it determines a student needs to continue his or her studies. However, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an FSEOG may not be awarded for a full academic year that is—


(1) Less than $100; or


(2) More than $4,000.
