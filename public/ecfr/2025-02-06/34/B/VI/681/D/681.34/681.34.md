# ยง 681.34   HEAL loan account servicing.

HEAL loan account servicing involves the proper maintenance of records, and the proper review and management of accounts. Generally accepted account servicing standards ensure that collections are received and accounted for, delinquent accounts are identified promptly, and reports are produced comparing actual results to previously established objectives.


(a) *Borrower inquiries.* A lender or holder must respond on a timely basis to written inquiries and other communications from a borrower and any endorser of a HEAL loan.


(b) *Conversion of loan to repayment status.* (1) At least 30 and not more than 60 days before the commencement of the repayment period, the lender or holder must contact the borrower in writing to establish the terms of repayment. Lenders or holders may not charge borrowers for the additional interest or other charges, penalties, or fees that accrue when a lender or holder does not contact the borrower within this time period and a late conversion results.


(2) Terms of repayment are established in a written schedule that is made a part of, and subject to the terms of, the borrower's original HEAL note.


(3) The lender or holder may not surrender the original promissory note to the borrower until the loan is paid in full. At that time, the lender or holder must give the borrower the original promissory note.


(c) *Borrower contacts.* The lender or holder must contact each borrower to request updated contact information for the borrower and to notify the borrower of the balance owed for principal, interest, insurance premiums, and any other charges or fees owed to the lender, at least every 6 months from the time the loan is disbursed. The lender or holder must use this notice to remind the borrower of the option, without penalty, to pay all or part of the principal and accrued interest at any time.


(d) *Skip-tracing.* If, at any time, the lender or holder is unable to locate a borrower, the lender or holder must initiate skip-tracing procedures as described in ยง 682.411.
