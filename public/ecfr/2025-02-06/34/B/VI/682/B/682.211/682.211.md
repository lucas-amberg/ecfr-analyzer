# § 682.211   Forbearance.

(a)(1) The Secretary encourages a lender to grant forbearance for the benefit of a borrower or endorser in order to prevent the borrower or endorser from defaulting on the borrower's or endorser's repayment obligation, or to permit the borrower or endorser to resume honoring that obligation after default. *Forbearance* means permitting the temporary cessation of payments, allowing an extension of time for making payments, or temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously were scheduled.


(2) Subject to paragraph (g) of this section, a lender may grant forbearance of payments of principal and interest under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section only if—


(i) The lender reasonably believes, and documents in the borrower's file, that the borrower or endorser intends to repay the loan but, due to poor health or other acceptable reasons, is currently unable to make scheduled payments; or


(ii) The borrower's payments of principal are deferred under § 682.210 and the Secretary does not pay interest benefits on behalf of the borrower under § 682.301.


(3) If two individuals are jointly liable for repayment of a PLUS loan or a Consolidation loan, the lender may grant forbearance on repayment of the loan only if the ability of both individuals to make scheduled payments has been impaired based on the same or differing conditions.


(4) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(11) of this section, if payments of interest are forborne, they may be capitalized as provided in § 682.202(b).


(b) A lender may grant forbearance if— 


(1) The lender and the borrower or endorser agree to the terms of the forbearance and, unless the agreement was in writing, the lender sends, within 30 days, a notice to the borrower or endorser confirming the terms of the forbearance and records the terms of the forbearance in the borrower's file; or


(2) In the case of forbearance of interest during a period of deferment, if the lender informs the borrower at the time the deferment is granted that interest payments are to be forborne. 


(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a lender may grant forbearance for a period of up to one year at a time if both the borrower or endorser and an authorized official of the lender agree to the terms of the forbearance. If the borrower or endorser requests the forbearance orally and the lender and the borrower or endorser agree to the terms of the forbearance orally, the lender must notify the borrower or endorser of the terms within 30 days of that agreement.


(d)(1) A guaranty agency may authorize a lender to grant forbearance to permit a borrower or endorser to resume honoring the agreement to repay the debt after default but prior to claim payment. The forbearance agreement in this situation must include a new agreement to repay the debt signed by the borrower or endorser or a written or oral affirmation of the borrower's or endorser's obligation to repay the debt.


(2) If the forbearance is based on the borrower's or endorser's oral request and affirmation of the obligation to repay the debt—


(i) The forbearance period is limited to a period of 120 days;


(ii) Such a forbearance cannot be granted consecutively;


(iii) The lender must orally review with the borrower the terms and conditions of the forbearance, including the consequences of interest capitalization, and all other repayment options available to the borrower; and


(iv) The lender must—


(A) Send a notice to the borrower or endorser, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, that confirms the terms of the forbearance and the borrower's or endorser's affirmation of the obligation to repay the debt, and includes information on all other repayment options available to the borrower, and


(B) Retain a record of the terms of the forbearance and affirmation in the borrower's or endorser's file.


(3) For purposes of this section, an “affirmation” means an acknowledgement of the loan by the borrower or endorser in a legally binding manner. The form of the affirmation may include, but is not limited to, the borrower's or endorser's—


(i) New signed repayment agreement or schedule, or another form of signed agreement to repay the debt;


(ii) Oral acknowledgment and agreement to repay the debt documented by the lender in the borrower's or endorser's file and confirmed by the lender in a notice to the borrower; or


(iii) A payment made on the loan by the borrower or endorser.


(e)(1) At the time of granting a borrower or endorser a forbearance, the lender must provide the borrower or endorser with information to assist the borrower or endorser in understanding the impact of capitalization of interest on the loan principal and total interest to be paid over the life of the loan; and


(2) At least once every 180 days during the period of forbearance, the lender must contact the borrower or endorser to inform the borrower or endorser of—


(i) The outstanding obligation to repay;


(ii) The amount of the unpaid principal balance and any unpaid interest that has accrued on the loan since the last notice provided to the borrower or endorser under this paragraph;


(iii) The fact that interest will accrue on the loan for the full term of the forbearance;


(iv) The amount of interest that will be capitalized, as of the date of the notice, and the date capitalization will occur;


(v) The option of the borrower or endorser to pay the interest that has accrued before the interest is capitalized; and


(vi) The borrower's or endorser's option to discontinue the forbearance at any time.

(4) For the period prior to the borrower's filing of a bankruptcy petition as provided in § 682.402(f);


(5) For the periods described in § 682.402(c) in regard to the borrower's total and permanent disability;


(6) Upon receipt of a valid identity theft report as defined in section 603(q)(4) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a) or notification from a consumer reporting agency that information furnished by the lender is a result of an alleged identity theft as defined in § 682.402(e)(14), for a period not to exceed 120 days necessary for the lender to determine the enforceability of the loan. If the lender determines that the loan does not qualify for discharge under § 682.402(e)(1)(i)(C), but is nonetheless unenforceable, the lender must comply with §§ 682.300(b)(2)(ix) and 682.302(d)(1)(viii).

(12) For a period not to exceed 3 months when the lender determines that a borrower's ability to make payments has been adversely affected by a natural disaster, a local or national emergency as declared by the appropriate government agency, or a military mobilization;


(13) For a period not to exceed 60 days necessary for the lender to collect and process documentation supporting the borrower's eligibility for loan forgiveness under the income-based repayment program.

(14) For a period of delinquency at the time a borrower makes a change to the repayment plan; or
