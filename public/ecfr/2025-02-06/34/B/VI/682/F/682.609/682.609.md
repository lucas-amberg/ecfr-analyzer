# § 682.609   Remedial actions.

(a) The Secretary may require a school to repay funds paid to other program participants by the Secretary. The Secretary also may require a school to purchase from the holder of a FFEL loan that portion of the loan that is unenforceable, that the borrower was ineligible to receive, or for which the borrower was ineligible to receive interest benefits contrary to the school's certification, and to make arrangements acceptable to the Secretary for reimbursement of the amounts the Secretary will be obligated to pay to program participants respecting that loan in the future. The repayment of funds and purchase of loans may be required if the Secretary determines that the payment to program participants, the unenforceability of the loan, or the disbursement of loan amounts for which the borrower was ineligible or for which the borrower was ineligible for interest benefits, resulted in whole or in part from—


(1) The school's violation of a Federal statute or regulation; or


(2) The school's negligent or willful false certification.


(b) In requiring a school to repay funds to the Secretary or to another party or to purchase loans from a holder in connection with an audit or program review, the Secretary follows the procedures described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart H.


(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may waive the right to require repayment of funds or repurchase of loans by a school if, in the Secretary's judgment, the best interest of the United States so requires. 


(d) The Secretary may impose a fine or take an emergency action against a school or limit, suspend, or terminate a school's participation in the FFEL programs, in accordance with 34 CFR part 668, subpart G.


(e) A school shall comply with any emergency action, limitation, suspension, or termination imposed by a guaranty agency in accordance with the agency's standards and procedures. A school shall repay funds to the Secretary or other party or purchase loans from a holder if a guaranty agency determines that the school improperly received or retained the funds in violation of a Federal law or regulation or a guaranty agency rule or regulation.
