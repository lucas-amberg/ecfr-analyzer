# § 682.700   Purpose and scope.

(a) This subpart governs the limitation, suspension, or termination by the Secretary of the eligibility of an otherwise eligible lender to participate in the FFEL programs or the eligibility of a third-party servicer to enter into a contract with an eligible lender to administer any aspect of the lender's FFEL programs.

These regulations also govern the Secretary's disqualification of a lender from participation in the FFEL programs under section 432(h)(2) of the Act.

(1)(i) To a determination that an organization fails to meet the definition of “eligible lender” in section 435(d)(1) of the Act or the definition of “lender” in § 682.200, for any reason other than a violation of the prohibitions in section 435(d)(5) of the Act; or


(ii) To a determination that an organization fails to meet the standards in § 682.416; or
