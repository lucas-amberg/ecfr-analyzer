(i)(A) The borrower;


(B) The borrower's spouse, for a married borrower filing a joint Federal income tax return;


(C) The borrower's children, including unborn children who will be born during the year the borrower certifies family size, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower and are not included in the family size for any other borrower except the borrower's spouse who filed jointly with the borrower; and

*New borrower* means—


(i) For the purpose of the PAYE plan, an individual who—

The Secretary determines the annual amount that would be due under the 10-year Standard Repayment plan based on the greater of the balances of the borrower's eligible loans that were outstanding at the time the borrower entered repayment on the loans or the balances on those loans that were outstanding at the time the borrower selected the IBR or PAYE plan.

(2) If a borrower does not provide approval for the disclosure of applicable tax information under sections 455(e)(8) and 493C(c)(2) of the Act when completing the promissory note or on the application form for an IDR plan, the borrower must provide documentation of the borrower's income and family size to the Secretary;


(3) If the Secretary has received approval for disclosure of applicable tax information, but cannot obtain the borrower's AGI and family size from the Internal Revenue Service, the borrower and, if applicable, the borrower's spouse, must provide documentation of income and family size to the Secretary;


(4) After the Secretary obtains sufficient information to calculate the borrower's monthly payment amount, the Secretary calculates the borrower's payment and establishes the 12-month period during which the borrower will be obligated to make a payment in that amount;


(5) The Secretary then sends to the borrower a repayment disclosure that—


(i) Specifies the borrower's calculated monthly payment amount;


(ii) Explains how the payment was calculated;


(iii) Informs the borrower of the terms and conditions of the borrower's selected repayment plan; and


(iv) Informs the borrower of how to contact the Secretary if the calculated payment amount is not reflective of the borrower's current income or family size;


(6) If the borrower believes that the payment amount is not reflective of the borrower's current income or family size, the borrower may request that the Secretary recalculate the payment amount. To support the request, the borrower must also submit alternative documentation of income or family size not based on tax information to account for circumstances such as a decrease in income since the borrower last filed a tax return, the borrower's separation from a spouse with whom the borrower had previously filed a joint tax return, the birth or impending birth of a child, or other comparable circumstances;


(7) If the borrower provides alternative documentation under paragraph (l)(6) of this section or if the Secretary obtains documentation from the borrower or spouse under paragraph (l)(3) of this section, the Secretary grants forbearance under § 685.205(b)(9) to provide time for the Secretary to recalculate the borrower's monthly payment amount based on the documentation obtained from the borrower or spouse;


(8) Once the borrower has 3 monthly payments remaining under the 12-month period specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this section, the Secretary follows the procedures in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(7) of this section.


(9) If the Secretary requires information from the borrower under paragraph (l)(3) of this section to recalculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount under paragraph (l)(8) of this section, and the borrower does not provide the necessary documentation to the Secretary by the time the last payment is due under the 12-month period specified under paragraph (l)(4) of this section—


(i) For the IBR and PAYE plans, the borrower's monthly payment amount is the amount determined under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) or (f)(3)(ii) of this section;


(ii) For the ICR plan, the borrower's monthly payment amount is the amount the borrower would have paid under a 10-year standard repayment plan based on the total balance of the loans being repaid under the ICR Plan when the borrower initially entered the ICR Plan; and


(iii) For the REPAYE plan, the Secretary removes the borrower from the REPAYE plan and places the borrower on an alternative repayment plan under which the borrower's required monthly payment is the amount the borrower would have paid on a 10-year standard repayment plan based on the current loan balances and interest rates on the loans at the time the borrower is removed from the REPAYE plan.


(10) At any point during the 12-month period specified under paragraph (l)(4) of this section, the borrower may request that the Secretary recalculate the borrower's payment earlier than would have otherwise been the case to account for a change in the borrower's circumstances, such as a loss of income or employment or divorce. In such cases, the 12-month period specified under paragraph (l)(4) of this section is reset based on the borrower's new information.


(11) The Secretary tracks a borrower's progress toward eligibility for forgiveness under paragraph (k) of this section and forgives loans that meet the criteria under paragraph (k) of this section without the need for an application or documentation from the borrower.


(m) *Automatic enrollment in an IDR plan.* The Secretary places a borrower on the IDR plan under this section that results in the lowest monthly payment based on the borrower's income and family size if—


(1) The borrower is otherwise eligible for the plan;




(2) The borrower has approved the disclosure of tax information under paragraph (l)(1) of this section;




(3) The borrower has not made a scheduled payment on the loan for at least 75 days or is in default on the loan and is not subject to a Federal offset, administrative wage garnishment under section 488A of the Act, or to a judgment secured through litigation; and


(4) The Secretary determines that the borrower's payment under the IDR plan would be lower than or equal to the payment on the plan in which the borrower is enrolled.


(n) *Removal from default.* The Secretary will no longer consider a borrower in default on a loan if—


(1) The borrower provides information necessary to calculate a payment under paragraph (f) of this section;


(2) The payment calculated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is $0; and


(3) The income information used to calculate the payment under paragraph (f) of this section includes the point at which the loan defaulted.
