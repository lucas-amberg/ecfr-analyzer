# § 685.214   Closed school discharge.

(a) *General.* (1) The Secretary discharges the borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) did not complete the program of study for which the loan was made because the school at which the borrower (or student) was enrolled closed, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) For purposes of this section—


(i) If a school has closed, the school's closure date is the earlier of: the date, determined by the Secretary, that the school ceased to provide educational instruction in programs in which most students at the school were enrolled, or a date determined by the Secretary that reflects when the school ceased to provide educational instruction for all of its students;


(ii) “School” means a school's main campus or any location or branch of the main campus, regardless of whether the school or its location or branch is considered title IV eligible;


(iii) “Program” means the credential defined by the level and Classification of Instructional Program code in which a student is enrolled, except that the Secretary may define a borrower's program as multiple levels or Classification of Instructional Program codes if:


(A) The enrollment occurred at the same institution in closely proximate periods;


(B) The school granted a credential in a program while the student was enrolled in a different program; or


(C) The programs must be taken in a set order or were presented as necessary for borrowers to complete in order to succeed in the relevant field of employment;


(b) *Relief pursuant to discharge.* (1) Discharge under this section relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any accrued charges or collection costs with respect to the loan.


(2) The discharge of a loan under this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on the loan.


(3) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under programs authorized by title IV of the Act.


(4) The Secretary reports the discharge of a loan under this section to all consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.


(c) *Discharge without an application.* (1) If the Secretary determines based on information in the Secretary's possession that the borrower qualifies for the discharge of a loan under this section, the Secretary discharges the loan without an application or any statement from the borrower 1 year after the institution's closure date if the borrower did not complete the program at another branch or location of the school or through a teach-out agreement at another school, approved by the school's accrediting agency and, if applicable, the school's State authorizing agency.


(2) If a borrower accepts but does not complete a continuation of the program at another branch or location of the school or a teach-out agreement at another school, approved by the school's accrediting agency and, if applicable, the school's State authorizing agency, then the Secretary discharges the loan 1 year after the borrower's last date of attendance at the other branch or location or in the teach-out program.


(d) *Borrower qualification for discharge.* (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section, to qualify for discharge of a loan under this section, a borrower must submit to the Secretary a completed application and the factual assertions in the application must be true and must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. The application explains the procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge and requires the borrower to—


(i) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)—


(A) Received the proceeds of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986, to attend a school;


(B) Did not complete the program of study at that school because the school closed while the student was enrolled, or the student withdrew from the school not more than 180 calendar days before the school closed. The Secretary may extend the 180-day period if the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances, as described in paragraph (h) of this section, justify an extension; and


(C) On or after July 1, 2023, state that the borrower did not complete the program at another branch or location of the school or through a teach-out agreement at another school, approved by the school's accrediting agency and, if applicable, the school's State authorizing agency.


(ii) State whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the borrower's loan obligation; and


(iii) State that the borrower (or student)—


(A) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this section; and


(B) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.


(2) [Reserved]


(e) *Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions.* (1) To obtain a discharge under this section, a borrower must cooperate with the Secretary in any judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the Secretary to recover amounts discharged or to take other enforcement action with respect to the conduct on which the discharge was based. At the request of the Secretary and upon the Secretary's tendering to the borrower the fees and costs that are customarily provided in litigation to reimburse witnesses, the borrower must—


(i) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the borrower to support a request for discharge;


(ii) Produce any documents reasonably available to the borrower with respect to those representations; and


(iii) If required by the Secretary, provide a sworn statement regarding those documents and representations.


(2) The Secretary denies the request for a discharge or revokes the discharge of a borrower who—


(i) Fails to provide the testimony, documents, or a sworn statement required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or


(ii) Provides testimony, documents, or a sworn statement that does not support the material representations made by the borrower to obtain the discharge.


(f) *Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery against third parties.* (1) Upon discharge under this section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower (or student) may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for the program for which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received from a private party.


(2) The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on those rights.


(3) Nothing in this section limits or forecloses the borrower's (or student's) right to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters unrelated to the discharged Direct Loan.


(g) *Discharge procedures.* (1) After confirming the date of a school's closure, the Secretary identifies any Direct Loan borrower (or student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) who appears to have been enrolled at the school on the school closure date or to have withdrawn not more than 180 days prior to the closure date.


(2) If the borrower's current address is known, the Secretary mails the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.


(3) If the borrower's current address is unknown, the Secretary attempts to locate the borrower and determines the borrower's potential eligibility for a discharge under this section by consulting with representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, the school's accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. If the Secretary learns the new address of a borrower, the Secretary mails to the borrower a discharge application and explanation and suspends collection, as described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.


(4) If a borrower fails to submit the application described in paragraph (d) of this section within 90 days of the Secretary's providing the discharge application, the Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended.


(5) Upon resuming collection on any affected loan, the Secretary provides the borrower another discharge application and an explanation of the requirements and procedures for obtaining a discharge.


(6) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a discharge meets the qualifications for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that determination.


(7) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a discharge does not meet the qualifications for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that determination and the reasons for the determination.


(h) *Exceptional circumstances.* For purposes of this section, exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to—


(1) The revocation or withdrawal by an accrediting agency of the school's institutional accreditation;


(2) The school is or was placed on probation or issued a show-cause order, or was placed on an equivalent accreditation status, by its accrediting agency for failing to meet one or more of the agency's standards;


(3) The revocation or withdrawal by the State authorization or licensing authority to operate or to award academic credentials in the State;


(4) The termination by the Department of the school's participation in a title IV, HEA program;

(6) A State or Federal court judgment that a School violated State or Federal law related to education or services to students;


(7) The teach-out of the student's educational program exceeds the 180-day look-back period for a closed school discharge;


(8) The school responsible for the teach-out of the student's educational program fails to perform the material terms of the teach-out plan or agreement, such that the student does not have a reasonable opportunity to complete his or her program of study;


(9) The school discontinued a significant share of its academic programs;


(10) The school permanently closed all or most of its in-person locations while maintaining online programs; and


(11) The school was placed on the heightened cash monitoring payment method as defined in § 668.162(d)(2) of this chapter.
