# § 685.406   Adjudication of borrower defense applications.

(a) *Adjudication.* The Department official adjudicates a borrower defense claim in accordance with this section.


(b) *Group process, adjudication.* (1) For a group formed under § 685.402, the Department official makes a recommendation to the Secretary regarding adjudication after considering any evidence related to the claim, including materials submitted as part of the group application, individual claims that are part of the group, evidence in the Secretary's possession, evidence provided by the institution during the institutional response process described in § 685.405, and any other relevant information.


(2) For a group of borrowers under § 685.402 for which the Department official determines that there may be a borrower defense under § 685.401(b), there is a rebuttable presumption that the act or omission giving rise to the borrower defense affected each member of the group in deciding to attend, or continue attending, the institution, and that such reliance was reasonable.


(c) *Individual process, adjudication.* For an individual process under § 685.403, the Department official adjudicates the borrower defense using the information available to the official and makes a recommendation to the Secretary regarding adjudication. The Department official considers any evidence related to the claim, including materials submitted as part of the individual application, evidence in the Secretary's possession, evidence provided by the institution during the institutional response process described in § 685.405, and any other relevant information.


(d) *Additional information needed from the school or individual.* If the Department official requests additional information from the school, the school must respond to the Department official's information request within 90 days. If the Department official requests additional information from the individual, the individual must respond to the Department official's information request within 90 days.


(e) *Secretary decision.* The Secretary makes a final decision after taking into account the Department official's recommendation and the record compiled under §§ 685.402, 685.403, 685.404, 685.405, and 685.407, as applicable.


(f) *Written decision.* The Secretary issues a written decision as follows:


(1) *Approval of a Borrower Defense Claim.* If the Secretary approves the borrower defense claim—


(i) The written decision states the Secretary's determination and the relief provided as defined in § 685.401 on the basis of that claim.


(ii) The Secretary places a borrower's Direct Loans associated with a group borrower defense claim into forbearance until the Secretary discharges the loan obligations under § 685.212(k). If any balance remains on the Direct Loans not associated with the borrower defense claim, those loans will return to their status prior to the claim process. The Secretary resumes collection activities on those Direct Loans not associated with the borrower defense claim no earlier than 90 days from the date the Department official issues a written decision. No interest will be charged on the loans during the forbearance period.


(2) *Denial of a Borrower Defense Claim*—(i) *Denial, group.* If the Secretary denies the borrower defense claim, the written decision states the reasons for the denial, the evidence upon which the decision was based, and the loans that are due and payable to the Secretary. The Secretary informs the borrowers that for the Direct Loans associated with the group borrower defense claim, those loans will return to their status prior to the group claim process. The Secretary resumes collection activities on the Direct Loans associated with the group borrower defense claim no earlier than 90 days from the date the Secretary issues a written decision. The Secretary also informs individual borrowers from the group claim initially adjudicated under § 685.406(b)(1) of their option to file a new borrower defense application under an individual process in accordance with § 685.403.


(ii) *Denial, individual.* If the Secretary denies the borrower defense claim, the written decision states the reasons for the denial and the evidence upon which the decision was based. The Secretary informs the borrowers that their loans will return to their status prior to the claim process. The Secretary resumes collection activities on the loans under which a forbearance or stopped collection was granted during adjudication of the claim in accordance with §§ 685.403(d) and (e), no earlier than 90 days from the date the Secretary issues a written decision. The Secretary also informs the borrower of the opportunity to request reconsideration of the claim pursuant to § 685.407.


(3) *Copies of written decisions.* The Secretary provides copies of the written decision in this subsection to:


(i) An individual whose claim was adjudicated under § 685.406(c), as applicable;

(g) *Adjudication, timelines.* (1) The Secretary will issue a decision on a group or individual borrower defense claim under the following timelines:


(i) For a group claim under § 685.402(c), within 1 year of the date the Department official notified the third-party requestor under § 685.402(c)(5).


(ii) For an individual claim under § 685.403, within the later of July 1, 2026 or 3 years after the date the Department determines the borrower submitted a materially complete application.


(2) The timelines in paragraph (g)(1) of this section will not apply for additional adjudications carried out as part of the reconsideration process in § 685.407.


(3) An individual claim under § 685.403 that is included in a group claim under § 685.402 will be subject to the adjudication timeline for that group under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, and any timelines associated with individual adjudication in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section will be tolled until the Secretary renders a decision on the claim under § 685.402.

Such notification will—


(i) Indicate the Department official's progress in adjudicating the claim or claims; and,


(ii) Provide an expected timeline for rendering a decision on the claim.


(5) If the Secretary does not issue a written decision under paragraph (e) of this section on loans covered by certain claims by the dates identified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the loans, or portion of the loans in the case of a Direct Consolidation Loan, will not be enforceable by the Department against the borrower and the school will not be liable for the loan amount.
