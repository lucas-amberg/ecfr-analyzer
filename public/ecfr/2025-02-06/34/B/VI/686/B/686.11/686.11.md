(*2*) A cumulative GPA of at least 3.25 on a 4.0 scale, or the numeric equivalent, based on courses taken at the institution through the most-recently completed payment period;


(B) If the student is beyond the first year of a program of undergraduate education as determined by the institution, a cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 3.25 on a 4.0 scale, or the numeric equivalent, through the most recently completed payment period;


(C) If the student is a graduate student during the first payment period, a cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 3.25 on a 4.0 scale, or the numeric equivalent;


(D) If the student is a graduate student beyond the first payment period, a cumulative graduate GPA of at least 3.25 on a 4.0 scale, or the numeric equivalent, through the most-recently completed payment period; or


(E) A score above the 75th percentile of scores achieved by all students taking the test during the period the student took the test on at least one of the batteries from a nationally-normed standardized undergraduate, graduate, or post-baccalaureate admissions test, except that such test may not include a placement test.


(2)(i) An institution must document the student's secondary school GPA under § 686.11(a)(1)(v)(A) using—


(A) Documentation provided directly to the institution by the cognizant authority; or


(B) Documentation from the cognizant authority provided by the student.

(c) *Transfer students.* If a student transfers from one institution to the current institution and does not qualify under § 686.11(a)(1)(v)(E), the current institution must determine that student's eligibility for a TEACH Grant for the first payment period using either the method described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or the method described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, whichever method coincides with the current institution's academic policy.

(i) Must calculate the student's GPA for the first payment period of enrollment using the grades earned by the student in the coursework from any prior postsecondary institution that it accepts; and


(ii) Must, for all subsequent payment periods, apply its academic policy and not incorporate the grades from the coursework that it accepts on transfer into the GPA at the current institution; or


(2) Incorporates grades from the coursework that it accepts on transfer into the student's GPA at the current institution, the current institution must use the grades assigned to the coursework accepted by the current institution as the student's cumulative GPA to determine eligibility for the first payment period of enrollment and all subsequent payment periods in accordance with its academic policy.
