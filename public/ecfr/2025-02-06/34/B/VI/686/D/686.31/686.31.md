(ii) Return the TEACH Grant proceeds, cancel the TEACH Grant, or both, if the institution receives a TEACH Grant cancellation request from the student by the later of the first day of a payment period or 14 days after the date it notifies the student of his or her right to cancel all or a portion of a TEACH Grant.


(2)(i) If a student requests cancellation of a TEACH Grant after the period of time in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, but within 120 days of the TEACH Grant disbursement date, the institution may return the TEACH Grant proceeds, cancel the TEACH Grant, or do both.
