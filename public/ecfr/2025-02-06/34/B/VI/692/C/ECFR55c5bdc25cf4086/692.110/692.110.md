# § 692.110   How does the Secretary allot funds to the States?

(a)(1) The Secretary allots to each State participating in the GAP Program an amount of the funds available for the GAP Program based on the ratio used to allot the State's Federal LEAP funds under § 692.10(a).


(2) If a State meets the requirements of § 692.113(b) for a fiscal year, the number of students under § 692.10(a) for the State is increased to 125 percent in determining the ratio in paragraph (a) of this section for that fiscal year.


(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section—


(i) If the Federal GAP funds available from the appropriation for a fiscal year are sufficient to allot to each State that participated in the prior year the same amount of Federal GAP funds allotted in the prior fiscal year, but are not sufficient both to allot the same amount of Federal GAP funds allotted in the prior fiscal year to these States and also to allot additional funds to additional States in accordance with the ratio used to allot the States' Federal LEAP funds under § 692.10(a), the Secretary allots—


(A) To each State that participated in the prior year, the amount the State received in the prior year; and

(ii) If the Federal GAP funds available from the appropriation for a fiscal year are not sufficient to allot to each State that participated in the prior year at least the amount of Federal GAP funds allotted in the prior fiscal year, the Secretary allots to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of Federal GAP funds available as the amount of Federal GAP funds allotted to each State in the prior fiscal year bears to the amount of Federal GAP funds allotted to all States in the prior fiscal year.


(4) For fiscal year 2011, the prior fiscal year allotment to a State for purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall include any fiscal year 2010 allotment made to that State under subpart B of this part.
