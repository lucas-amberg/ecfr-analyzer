# § 692.111   For what purposes may a State use its payment under the GAP Program?

(a) *Establishment of a partnership.* Each State receiving an allotment under this subpart shall use the funds to establish a partnership to award grants to eligible students in order to increase the amount of financial assistance students receive under this subpart for undergraduate education expenses.


(b) *Amount of LEAP Grants under GAP.* (1) The amount of a LEAP Grant under GAP by a State to an eligible student shall be not less than—


(i) The average undergraduate in-State tuition and mandatory fees for full-time students at the public institutions of higher education in the State where the student resides that are the same type of institution that the student attends (four-year degree-granting, two-year degree-granting, or non-degree-granting); minus


(ii) Other Federal and State aid the student receives.


(2) The Secretary determines the average undergraduate in-State tuition and mandatory fees for full-time students at public institutions in a State weighted by enrollment using the most recent data reported by institutions in the State to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) administered by the National Center for Educational Statistics.


(c) *Institutional participation.* (1) A State receiving an allotment under this subpart may restrict the use of LEAP Grants under GAP only to students attending institutions of higher education that are participating in the partnership.


(2) If a State provides LEAP Grants under subpart A of this part to students attending institutions of higher education located in another State, LEAP Grants under GAP may be used at institutions of higher education located in another State.


(d) *Early notification to potentially eligible students.* (1) Each State receiving an allotment under this subpart shall annually notify potentially eligible students in grades 7 through 12 in the State, and their families, of their potential eligibility for student financial assistance, including a LEAP Grant under GAP, to attend a LEAP-participating institution of higher education.


(2) The notice shall include—


(i) Information about early information and intervention, mentoring, or outreach programs available to the student;


(ii) Information that a student's eligibility for a LEAP Grant under GAP is enhanced through participation in an early information and intervention, mentoring, or outreach program;


(iii) An explanation that student and family eligibility for, and participation in, other Federal means-tested programs may indicate eligibility for a LEAP Grant under GAP and other student aid programs;


(iv) A nonbinding estimate of the total amount of financial aid that an eligible student with a similar income level may expect to receive, including an estimate of the amount of a LEAP Grant under GAP and an estimate of the amount of grants, loans, and all other available types of aid from the major Federal and State financial aid programs;


(v) An explanation that in order to be eligible for a LEAP Grant under GAP, at a minimum, a student shall—


(A) Meet the eligibility requirements under § 692.120; and


(B) Enroll at a LEAP-participating institution of higher education in the State of the student's residence or an out-of-state institution if the State elects to make LEAP Grants under GAP for attendance at out-of-State institutions in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;


(vi) Any additional requirements that the State may require for receipt of a LEAP Grant under GAP in accordance with § 692.120(a)(4); and


(vii) An explanation that a student is required to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid to determine his or her eligibility for Federal and State financial assistance and may include a provision that eligibility for an award is subject to change based on—


(A) A determination of the student's financial eligibility at the time of the student's enrollment at a LEAP-participating institution of higher education or an out-of-State institution in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;


(B) Annual Federal and State spending for higher education; and


(C) Other aid received by the student at the time of the student's enrollment at the institution of higher education.


(e) *Award notification.* (1) Once a student, including a student who has received early notification under paragraph (d) of this section, applies for admission to an institution that is a partner in the partnership of the State of the student's residence, files a Free Application for Federal Student Aid and any related State form, and is determined eligible by the State, the State shall—


(i) Issue the student a preliminary award certificate for a LEAP Grant under GAP with estimated award amounts; and


(ii) Inform the student that the payment of the grant is subject to certification of enrollment and eligibility by the institution.


(2) If a student enrolls in an institution that is not a partner in the partnership of the student's State of residence but the State has not restricted eligibility to students enrolling in partner institutions, including, if applicable, out-of-State institutions, the State shall, to the extent practicable, follow the procedures of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
