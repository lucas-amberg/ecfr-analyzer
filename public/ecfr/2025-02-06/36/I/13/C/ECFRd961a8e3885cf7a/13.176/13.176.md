# § 13.176   Cabins in wilderness areas.

The use and occupancy of a cabin or other structure located in a designated wilderness area are subject to the other applicable provisions of this subpart, and the following conditions:


(a) A previously existing public use cabin located within wilderness designated by ANILCA may be allowed to remain and may be maintained or replaced subject to such restrictions as the Superintendent finds necessary to preserve the wilderness character of the area. As used in this section, the term “previously existing public use cabin” means a cabin or other structure which, on November 30, 1978, was recognized and managed by a Federal land managing agency as a structure available for general public use.


(b) Within a wilderness area designated by ANILCA, a new public use cabin or shelter may be constructed, maintained and used only if necessary for the protection of the public health and safety.


(c) A cabin or other structure located in a designated wilderness area may not be designated, assigned or used for commercial purposes, except that designated public use cabins may be used in conjunction with commercial guided visitor services, but not to the exclusion of the general public.
