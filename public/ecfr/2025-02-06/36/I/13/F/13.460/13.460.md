# ยง 13.460   Use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses is permitted within park areas except at those times and in those areas restricted or closed by the Superintendent.


(b) The Superintendent may restrict or close a route or area to use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, or other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses if the Superintendent determines that such use is causing or is likely to cause an adverse impact on public health and safety, resource protection, protection of historic or scientific values, subsistence uses, conservation of endangered or threatened species, or the purposes for which the park area was established.


(c) No restrictions or closures shall be imposed without notice and a public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate. In the case of emergency situations, restrictions or closures shall not exceed sixty (60) days and shall not be extended unless the Superintendent establishes, after notice and public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, that such extension is justified according to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Notice of the proposed or emergency restrictions or closures and the reasons therefore shall be published in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least one local newspaper if appropriate, and information about such proposed or emergency actions shall also be made available for broadcast on local radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local rural residents in the affected vicinity. All restrictions and closures shall be designated on a map which shall be available for public inspection at the office of the Superintendent of the affected park area and the post office or postal authority of every affected community within or near the park area, or by the posting of signs in the vicinity of the restrictions or closures, or both.


(d) Motorboats, snowmobiles, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses shall be operated:


(1) In compliance with applicable State and Federal law;


(2) In such a manner as to prevent waste or damage to the park areas; and


(3) In such a manner as to prevent the herding, harassment, hazing or driving of wildlife for hunting or other purposes.


(e) At all times when not engaged in subsistence uses, local rural residents may use snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation in accordance with 43 CFR 36.11(c), (d), (e), and (g).
