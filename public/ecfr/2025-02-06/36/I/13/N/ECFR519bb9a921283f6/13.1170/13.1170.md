# ยง 13.1170   What are the rules for operating vessels?

(a) Operating a vessel within 
1/4 nautical mile of a whale is prohibited, except for a commercial fishing vessel authorized under this subpart that is actively trolling, setting, or pulling long lines, or setting or pulling crab pots.


(b) The operator of a vessel inadvertently positioned within 
1/4 nautical mile of a whale must immediately slow the vessel to ten knots or less, without shifting into reverse unless impact is likely. The operator must direct or maintain the vessel on as steady a course as possible away from the whale until at least 
1/4 nautical mile of separation is established. Failure to take such action is prohibited.


(c) The operator of a vessel or seaplane positioned within 
1/2 nautical mile of a whale is prohibited from altering course or speed in a manner that results in decreasing the distance between the whale and the vessel or seaplane.
