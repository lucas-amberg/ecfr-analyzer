# § 13.1136   How can an individual apply for a commercial fishing lifetime access permit?

An applicant for a lifetime access permit must provide information sufficient to establish eligibility as follows:


(a) The applicant's full name, date of birth, mailing address and phone number;


(b) A notarized affidavit (required), sworn by the applicant, attesting to his or her history of participation as a limited entry permit holder or crewmember in Glacier Bay during the qualifying period for each fishery for which a lifetime access permit is being sought;


(c) A copy of the applicant's current State of Alaska limited entry permit or, in the case of halibut, an international Pacific Halibut Commission quota share (required), that is valid for the area that includes Glacier Bay, for each fishery for which a lifetime access permit is sought;


(d) For qualifying years as a limited entry permit holder, available corroborating documentation of the applicant's permit and quota share history for the Glacier Bay fishery during the qualifying period, and/or for qualifying years as a crewmember, other available corroborating documentation of crewmember status. This may include a copy of the applicant's commercial crewmember license for each qualifying year, a notarized affidavit from their employer (generally a limited entry permit holder, or boat owner hired or contracted by a limited entry permit holder) stating the years worked by the applicant in a qualifying fishery in Glacier Bay, copies of tax forms W-2 or 1099, pay stubs, or other documentation; and


(e) For applicants qualifying as a limited entry permit holder, available corroborating documentation of commercial landings for the Glacier Bay fishery during the qualifying periods—i.e., within the statistical unit or area that includes Glacier Bay. For halibut, this includes regulatory sub-area 184. For Tanner crab, this includes statistical areas 114-70 through 114-77. For salmon, the Superintendent may need additional documentation that supports the applicant's declaration of Glacier Bay salmon landings. For halibut and Tanner crab, the Superintendent may consider documented commercial landings from the unit or area immediately adjacent to Glacier Bay (in Icy Strait) if additional documentation supports the applicant's declaration that landings occurred in Glacier Bay.


(f) Any additional corroborating documentation that might assist the superintendent in a timely determination of eligibility for the access permits.
