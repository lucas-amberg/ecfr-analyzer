(a) *Complete application requirement.* The NPS will not begin processing a right-of-way permit application until it has determined the applicant has complied with the requirements in this part, including the submission of all required information.

If materials required in this part were previously filed with the superintendent for the issuance of another right-of-way permit for the same System unit, the NPS may decide the applicant is not required to resubmit these materials, provided the previous date of filing, place of filing, and existing right-of-way permit number are included in the new application.
