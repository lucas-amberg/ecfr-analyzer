(a) No establishment offering food, drink, or lodging for sale on any privately owned lands under the legislative jurisdiction of the United States within Glacier, Lassen Volcanic, Mesa Verde, Denali, Mount Rainier, Olympic, Rocky Mountain, Sequoia-Kings Canyon, Yellowstone, and Yosemite National Parks may be operated without a permit obtained from the Superintendent. Such permit may include terms and conditions deemed necessary by the Superintendent to the health, safety and welfare of the public and it may be revoked upon failure to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or the conditions set forth in the permit. 


(b) Such establishment shall be maintained and operated in accordance with the rules and regulations recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service for such establishments, and the substantive requirements of State and local laws and regulations relating to such establishments, which would apply if such privately owned lands were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. In the event of conflict or inconsistency between such U.S. Public Health Service recommendations and State or local laws the former shall prevail. 


(c) The Superintendent shall have the right to inspect such establishments at reasonable times to determine whether the establishment is being operated in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations and in accordance with the provisions of the permit.
