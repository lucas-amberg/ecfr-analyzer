# ยง 51.17   What are the selection factors?

(a) The five principal selection factors are: 


(1) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives, as described in the prospectus, of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the park area; 


(2) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives, as described in the prospectus, of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services at reasonable rates; 


(3) The experience and related background of the offeror, including the past performance and expertise of the offeror in providing the same or similar visitor services as those to be provided under the concession contract; 


(4) The financial capability of the offeror to carry out its proposal; and


(5) The amount of the proposed minimum franchise fee, if any, and/or other forms of financial consideration to the Director. However, consideration of revenue to the United States will be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the park area and of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services to the public at reasonable rates. 


(b) The secondary selection factors are: 


(1) The quality of the offeror's proposal to conduct its operations in a manner that furthers the protection, conservation and preservation of park area and other resources through environmental management programs and activities, including, without limitation, energy conservation, waste reduction, and recycling. A prospectus may exclude this secondary factor if the prospectus solicits proposals for a concession contract that is anticipated to have annual gross receipts of less than $100,000 and the activities that will be conducted under the contract are determined by the Director as likely to have only limited impacts on the resources of the park area; and 


(2) Any other selection factors the Director may adopt in furtherance of the purposes of this part, including, where appropriate and otherwise permitted by law, the extent to which a proposal calls for the employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and/or involvement of businesses owned by Indians, Indian Tribes, Native Alaskans, or minority or women-owned businesses in operations under the proposed concession contract. When appropriate, the Director will include a secondary selection factor requesting suggestions for new services.


(c) A prospectus may include subfactors under each of the principal and secondary factors to describe specific elements of the selection factor.
