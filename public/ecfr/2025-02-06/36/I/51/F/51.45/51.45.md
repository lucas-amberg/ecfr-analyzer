# ยง 51.45   Will a concessioner that has operated for less than the entire term of a concession contract be considered a satisfactory operator?

The Director will determine that a concessioner has operated satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of a concession contract only if the concessioner (including a new concessioner resulting from an assignment as described in this part, including, without limit, an assignment of a controlling interest in a concessioner as defined in this part) has or will have operated for more than two years under a concession contract with a term of more than five years or for one year under a concession contract with a term of five years or less. For purposes of this section, a new concessioner's first day of operation under an assigned concession contract (or as a new concessioner after approval of an assignment of a controlling interest in a concessioner) will be the day the Director approves the assignment pursuant to this part. If the Director determines that an assignment was compelled by circumstances beyond the control of the assigning concessioner, the Director may make an exception to the requirements of this section.
