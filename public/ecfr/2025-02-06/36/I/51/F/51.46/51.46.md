# ยง 51.46   May the Director determine that a concessioner has not operated satisfactorily after a prospectus is issued?

The Director may determine that a concessioner has not operated satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of a current concession contract, and therefore is not a preferred offeror, after a prospectus for a new contract has been issued and prior to the selection of the best proposal submitted in response to a prospectus. In circumstances where the usual time of an annual evaluation of a concessioner's performance may not occur until after the selection of the best proposal submitted in response to a prospectus, the Director will make an annual performance evaluation based on a shortened operations period prior to the selection of the best proposal. Such shorter operations period, however, must encompass at least 6 months of operations from the previous annual performance evaluation. In the event the concessioner receives a second less than satisfactory annual evaluation (including, without limitation, one based on a shortened operations period), the prospectus must be amended to delete a right of preference or canceled and reissued without recognition of a right of preference to the new concession contract.
