# ยง 51.48   What happens to a right of preference in the event of termination of a concession contract for unsatisfactory performance or other breach?

Nothing in this part will limit the right of the Director to terminate a concession contract pursuant to its terms at any time for less than satisfactory performance or otherwise. If a concession contract is terminated for less than satisfactory performance or other breach, the terminated concessioner, even if otherwise qualified, will not be eligible to be a preferred offeror. The fact that the Director may not have terminated a concession contract for less than satisfactory performance or other breach will not limit the authority of the Director to determine that a concessioner did not operate satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of a concession contract.
