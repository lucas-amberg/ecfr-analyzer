# ยง 51.61   How is an existing concessioner who is not awarded a new concession contract paid for a leasehold surrender interest?

(a) When a concessioner is not awarded a new concession contract after expiration or termination of a leasehold surrender interest concession contract, or, the concessioner, prior to such termination or expiration, ceases to utilize under the terms of a concession contract capital improvements in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the concessioner will be entitled to be paid its leasehold surrender interest value in the related capital improvements. The leasehold surrender interest will not be transferred until payment of the leasehold surrender interest value. The date for payment of the leasehold surrender interest value, except in special circumstances beyond the Director's control, will be the date of expiration or termination of the leasehold surrender interest contract, or the date the concessioner ceases to utilize related capital improvements under the terms of a concession contract. Depreciation of the related capital improvements will be established as of the date of expiration or termination of the concession contract, or, if applicable, the date the concessioner ceases to utilize the capital improvements under the terms of a concession contract. 


(b) In the event that extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the Director prevent the Director from making the leasehold surrender interest value payment as of the date of expiration or termination of the leasehold surrender interest concession contract, or, as of the date a concessioner ceases to utilize related capital improvements under the terms of a concession contract, the payment when made will include interest on the amount that was due on the date of expiration or termination of the concession contract or cessation of use for the period after the payment was due until payment is made (in addition to the inclusion of a continuing Consumer Price Index adjustment until the date payment is made). The rate of interest will be the applicable rate of interest established by law for overdue obligations of the United States. The payment for a leasehold surrender interest value will be made within one year after the expiration or termination of the concession contract or the cessation of use of related capital improvements under the terms of a concession contract.
