# ยง 51.66   Under what conditions will a concessioner obtain a leasehold surrender interest in existing real property improvements in which no leasehold surrender interest exists?

(a) A concession contract may require the concessioner to replace fixtures in real property improvements in which there is no leasehold surrender interest (e.g., fixtures attached to an existing government facility assigned by the Director to the concessioner). A leasehold surrender interest will be obtained by the concessioner in such fixtures subject to the approval and determination of construction cost and other conditions contained in this part. 


(b) A concession contract may require the concessioner to undertake a major rehabilitation of a structure in which there is no leasehold surrender interest (*e.g.,* a government-constructed facility assigned to the concessioner). Upon substantial completion of the major rehabilitation, the concessioner will obtain a leasehold surrender interest in the structure. The initial construction cost of this leasehold surrender interest will be the construction cost of the major rehabilitation. Depreciation for purposes of leasehold surrender interest value will apply only to the rehabilitated components of the related structure.
