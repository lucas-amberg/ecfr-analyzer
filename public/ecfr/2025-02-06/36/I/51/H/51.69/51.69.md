# ยง 51.69   What happens if there is a dispute between the new concessioner and a prior concessioner as to the value of the prior concessioner's possessory interest?

In case of a dispute between a new concessioner and a prior concessioner as to the value of the prior concessioner's possessory interest, the dispute will be resolved under the procedures contained in the possessory interest concession contract. A new concessioner will not agree on the value of a prior concessioner's possessory interest without the prior written approval of the Director unless the value is determined through the binding determination process required by the possessory interest concession contract. The Director's written approval is to ensure that the value is consistent with the terms and conditions of the possessory interest concession contract. If a new concessioner and a prior concessioner engage in a binding process to resolve a dispute as to the value of the prior concessioner's possessory interest, the new concessioner must allow the Director to assist the new concessioner in the dispute process to the extent requested by the Director. Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the rights of the prior concessioner to be paid for its possessory interest or other property by a new concessioner in accordance with the terms of its concession contract.
