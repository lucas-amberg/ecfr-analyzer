# ยง 51.87   Does the concessioner have an unconditional right to receive the Director's approval of an assignment or encumbrance?

No, approvals of assignments or encumbrances are subject to the following determinations by the Director:

(b) That the encumbrance does not purport to provide the creditor or assignee any rights beyond those provided by the applicable concession contract, including, but not limited to, any rights to conduct business in a park area except in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable concession contract; 


(c) That the encumbrance does not purport to permit a creditor or assignee of a creditor, in the event of default or otherwise, to begin operations under the applicable concession contract or through a designated operator unless and until the Director determines that the proposed operator is a qualified person as defined in this part; 


(d) That an assignment or encumbrance does not purport to assign or encumber assets that are not owned by the concessioner, including, without limitation, park area entrance, user day, or similar use allocations made by the Director; 


(e) That the assignment is to a qualified person as defined in this part; 


(f) That the assignment or encumbrance would not have an adverse impact on the protection, conservation or preservation of park resources; 


(g) That the assignment or encumbrance would not have an adverse impact on the provision of necessary and appropriate facilities and services to visitors at reasonable rates and charges; and


(h) That the terms of the assignment or encumbrance are not likely, directly or indirectly, to reduce an existing or new concessioner's opportunity to earn a reasonable profit over the remaining term of the applicable concession contract, to affect adversely the quality of facilities and services provided by the concessioner, or result in a need for increased rates and charges to the public to maintain the quality of concession facilities and services.
