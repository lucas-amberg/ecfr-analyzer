# ยง 59.1   Applicability.

These post-completion responsibilities apply to each area or facility for which Land and Water Conservation Fund (L&WCF) assistance is obtained, regardless of the extent of participation of the program in the assisted area or facility and consistent with the contractural agreement between NPS and the State. Responsibility for compliance and enforcement of these provisions rests with the State for both State and locally sponsored projects. The responsibilities cited herein are applicable to the area depicted or otherwise described on the 6(f)(3) boundary map and/or as described in other project documentation approved by the Department of the Interior. In many instances, this mutually agreed to area exceeds that actually receiving L&WCF assistance so as to assure the protection of a viable recreation entity. For leased sites assisted under L&WCF, compliance with post-completion requirements of the grant ceases following lease expiration unless the grant agreement calls for some other arrangement.
