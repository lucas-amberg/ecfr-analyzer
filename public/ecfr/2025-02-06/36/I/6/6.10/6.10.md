The bond must be conditioned upon faithful compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and the permit requirements as approved.

The bond must be issued by a surety company listed and approved by the Department of the Treasury.

(f) The responsibility and liability of the operator (and the surety, if any) under the bond or security deposit must continue until the Regional Director determines that closure and post- closure care have been completed in accordance with the permit requirements. No portion of the performance bond or security deposit may be released until such a determination has been made. 


(g) Within 30 calendar days after the Regional Director determines that all closure and post-closure care requirements have been successfully completed according to the permit, the Regional Director will notify the operator (and the surety, if any) that liability under the bond or security deposit has been terminated and the bond or security deposit released.
