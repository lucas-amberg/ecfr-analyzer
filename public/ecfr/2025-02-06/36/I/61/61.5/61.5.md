# ยง 61.5   Grants to State programs.

(a) Each State with an approved State program is eligible for grants-in-aid from the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF).


(b) The National Park Service (NPS) will administer HPF matching grants-in-aid in accordance with the Act, OMB Circular A-133 and 43 CFR part 12, and related guidance that NPS issues. Failure by a State program to meet these requirements is cause for comment and appropriate action by the Secretary.
