The procedures in this part set forth the processes and criteria for the identification, evaluation, designation and monitoring of national natural landmarks.


(a) The National Natural Landmarks Program focuses attention on areas of exceptional natural value to the nation as a whole rather than to one particular State or locality. The program recognizes areas preserved by Federal, State and local agencies as well as private organizations and individuals and encourages the owners of national natural landmarks to voluntarily observe preservation precepts.


(b) The National Natural Landmarks Program identifies and preserves natural areas that best illustrate the biological and geological character of the United States, enhances the scientific and educational values of preserved areas, strengthens public appreciation of natural history, and fosters a greater concern for the conservation of the nation's natural heritage.
