(a) The Keeper of the National Register will make determinations of eligibility on properties nominated by Federal agencies under section 2(a) of Executive Order 11593 prior to returning the nominations for such properties to the agency for technical or professional revision or because of procedural requirements. Such determinations of eligibility will be made only if sufficient information exists to establish the significance of the property and its eligibility for the National Register


(b) Any property or district removed from the National Register for procedural deficiencies in the nomination and/or listing process shall automatically be considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register without further action and will be published as such in the _Federal Register._

(c) If necessary to assist in the protection of historic resources, the Keeper, upon consultation with the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer and concerned Federal agency, if any, may determine properties to be eligible for listing in the National Register under the Criteria established by 36 CFR part 60 and shall publish such determinations in the _Federal Register._ Such determinations may be made without a specific request from the Federal agency or, in effect, may reverse findings on eligibility made by a Federal agency and State Historic Preservation Officer. Such determinations will be made after an investigation and an onsite inspection of the property in question.
