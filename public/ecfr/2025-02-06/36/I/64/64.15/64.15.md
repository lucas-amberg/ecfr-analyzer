# § 64.15   Financial reporting requirements and reimbursements.

Payments to applicants will either be by reimbursement by Treasury check or advance by Treasury check. 


(a) *Reimbursement by Treasury Check.* The Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement (OMB Circular A-102, Attachment H) is the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for acquisition and development. Requests for reimbursement shall be submitted by “the grantee” not more frequently than monthly. The requests for reimbursement shall be submitted by the grantee in an original and three copies to the appropriate Regional Office. The Regions will forward to the Division of Budget and Finance in Washington, DC, the original and two copies. 


(b) *Advance by Treasury Check.* The Request for Advance or Reimbursement (OMB Circular A-102, Attachment H) is the standard form for all requests for advance. An advance by Treasury check is a payment made by Treasury check to a grantee upon its request, or through the use of a predetermined payment schedule. Advances shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and shall be timed to be in accord with only the actual cash requirements of the grantee in carrying out the purpose of the approved project. Advances shall be limited to one month's cash requirements. The request for advance shall be submitted by the grantee in an original and three copies to the appropriate Regional Office. The Region will forward to the Division of Budget and Finance in Washington, D.C., the original and two copies. 


Grantees must submit an “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs” monthly showing expenditures made the previous month from the funds advanced. 


Upon Bureau acceptance of the expenditures involved, these reports shall be used as the basis for liquidating obligations, reducing the advance account, and making charges to the appropriate cost account. 


(c) *Report of Federal Cash Transactions (OMB Circular A-102, Attachment H).* When funds are advanced with Treasury checks, the grantee shall submit a report to monitor the cash advance. Grantees shall submit the original and three copies no later than 15 working days following the end of each quarter.
