The Superintendent may adjust or terminate the Non-commercially Guided Snowmobile Access Program, or redistribute non-commercially guided transportation events, based upon impacts to park resources, park operations, utilization rates, visitor experiences, or other factors, after providing public notice in accordance with one or more methods listed in 36 CFR 1.7.


(v) Transportation events allocated to commercial tour operators may be exchanged among commercial tour operators, but only for the same entrance or location.


(vi) Commercial tour operators may decide whether to use their daily allocations of transportation events for snowmobiles or snowcoaches, subject to the limits in this section.

(i) Determine the start and end dates of the winter season, which will begin no earlier than December 15 and end no later than March 15 each year. The Superintendent will consider appropriate factors when determining the length of the winter season, including adequate snow cover, the location of wintering wildlife, public safety, resource protection, park operations, and use patterns. Based upon these factors, the Superintendent may determine that there will be no winter season for oversnow vehicles or that certain areas of the park may be closed to public OSV use.


(ii) Determine operating hours, dates, and use levels.


(iii) Notify the public of the start and end dates of the winter season, operating hours, dates, use levels, and any applicable changes through one or more of the methods listed in § 1.7 of this chapter.
