# ยง 72.52   Recovery Action Program grant applications.

The application procedure for Recovery Action Program grants differs from the procedure for Rehabilitation and Innovation grants. Ranking and selection for funding of Recovery Action Program grants will be initiated on the basis of a full application, preparation of which will be assisted through meetings with NPS regional staff.


(a) *Preapplication Conference.* In the preparation of a Recovery Action Program grant application, applicants are encouraged to discuss with NPS regional personnel, or State personnel, when an agreement between NPS and the State covers such action, the adequacy of the proposal in meeting the requirements for a Recovery Action Program. Prior to formal submission, the Recovery Action Program grant application should be reviewed with the appropriate NPS Regional Office.


(b) *Submission of Applications.* In addition to Standard Form 424 on Federal Assistance notification, applicants for Recovery Action Program grants shall submit the following documents and required attachments to NPS Regional Offices:


(1) OMB Form 80-RO190, completed as prescribed by OMB Circular A-102. (Application for Federal assistance, for non-construction programs).


(2) Grant agreement form.


(3) Narrative statements which will be used in evaluating grant applications in relationship to the selection criteria as defined in ยง 72.50(a), including:


(i) The need for the planning grant.


(ii) The jurisdiction's existing or proposed commitments to developing a full Recovery Action Program and an ongoing planning process.


(iii) The relationship of the planning program to overall community plans and programs.


(iv) Appropriateness of the proposed planning program's scope, timing and methodology in relation to UPARR planning requirements and the community's identified planning needs.


(v) Dollars and work years to be devoted to development of each element in the proposed Recovery Action Program, including some indications of the qualifications of staff members who will work on the program.


(vi) If appropriate, a discussion of work elements to be contracted out to other government agencies, private consultants or private non-profit agencies, including the reasons for contracting work elements instead of doing the work within the community's own planning agencies.


(4) Applications for RAP grants need a full 60 day A-95 clearinghouse review. Clearinghouse comments for RAP grants must then be submitted to NPS. Final RAP's also must be submitted to clearinghouses, in accordance with OMB Circular A-95.
