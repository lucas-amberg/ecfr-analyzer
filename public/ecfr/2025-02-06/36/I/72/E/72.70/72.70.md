# ยง 72.70   Applicability.

These post-completion responsibilities apply to each area or facility for which Urban Park and Recreation Recovery (UPARR) program assistance is obtained, regardless of the extent of participation of the program in the assisted area or facility. Responsibility for compliance with these provisions rests with the grant recipient. The responsibilities cited herein are applicable to the 1010 area depicted or otherwise described in the 1010 boundary map and/or as described in other project documentation approved by the Department of the Interior. In many instances, this area exceeds that actually receiving UPARR assistance so as to assure the protection of a viable recreation entity. For leased sites assisted under UPARR, compliance with post-completion requirements of the grant following lease expiration is dictated by the terms of the project agreement.
