# § 79.12   Determining which particular material remains are eligible for disposal.

(a) *Which material remains are eligible for disposal under this subpart?* In order to be eligible for disposal under this subpart, material remains from collections must be:


(1) Archaeological resources, as defined in the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470bb(1)), or other resources excavated and removed under the Reservoir Salvage Act (54 U.S.C. 312501-312508) or the Antiquities Act (54 U.S.C. 320301-320303); and


(2) Considered to be of insufficient archeological interest under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section, based on the definition of “of archaeological interest” in 43 CFR 7.3(a)(1).


(b) *Which material remains are not eligible for disposal under this subpart?* The following material remains from collections are not eligible for disposal under this subpart:


(1) Native American “cultural items” as defined in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (25 U.S.C. 3001(3)), because disposition is governed by that Act and its implementing regulations (43 CFR part 10);


(2) Other human remains not subject to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990;


(3) Material remains excavated and removed from Indian lands on or before the enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm) on October 31, 1979; and


(4) Material remains excavated and removed from Indian lands under the Antiquities Act (54 U.S.C. 320301-320303).


(c) *Who may propose the disposal of particular material remains?* The following individuals who meet the applicable Professional Qualification Standards set by the Secretary of the Interior may propose the disposal of particular material remains from a collection:


(1) Federal agency staff members with verifiable knowledge of the particular material remains, including archeologists, curators, and conservators; and


(2) Qualified museum professionals located in a repository that provides curatorial services for a collection held in that repository.


(d) *Who is responsible for the disposal of particular material remains?* The Federal Agency Official is responsible for ensuring that particular material remains are disposed of according to the requirements of this subpart.


(e) *When are particular material remains considered to be of insufficient archeological interest?* Particular material remains are considered to be of insufficient archeological interest when, on a case-by-case basis, at least one qualified archeological or museum professional who meets the Professional Qualification Standards set by the Secretary of the Interior and possesses verifiable knowledge of and experience in the type of material remains being evaluated makes a determination. The determination must follow the process established in § 79.15 and document that:


(1) Disposition of the material remains will not negatively impact the overall integrity of the original collection recovered during the survey, excavation, or other study of a prehistoric or historic resource; and


(2) At least one of the following three requirements—lack of provenience information; lack of physical integrity; or overly redundant and not useful for research—are met:


(i) *Lack of provenience information.* Lack of provenience information may be established after a concerted effort to recover the information in the related associated records is performed and documented and by one or more of the following circumstances:


(A) The labels on the material remains or the labels on the containers that hold the material remains do not provide adequate information to reliably establish meaningful archeological context for the material remains;


(B) The labels on the material remains or the labels on the containers that hold the material remains have been lost or destroyed over time and cannot be reconstructed through the associated records; or


(C) The associated records of the material remains never existed, have been lost, or have been destroyed.


(ii) *Lack of physical integrity.* Material remains lack physical integrity when, subsequent to recovery during the survey, excavation, or other study of a prehistoric or historic resource, the material remains were irreparably damaged through decay, decomposition, or inadvertent loss. Examples may include human-caused incidents, exposure to elements, or natural disaster.


(iii) *Overly redundant and not useful for research.* Material remains are overly redundant and not useful for research in light of the collection's archeological context, research questions, and research potential. These considerations may vary based on geography, time and culture period, scientific or cultural significance, prior analysis, and other factors. Because it is difficult to predict if future analytical methods will yield useful information about the material remains proposed for disposal, a sample of the material remains deemed to be overly redundant and not useful for research must be retained for curation, as required by § 79.15(f).
