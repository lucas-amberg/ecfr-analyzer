(a) Within 30 days after the date of submission of your application, we will notify you whether the application contains all information reasonably necessary to allow us to consider the application and, if not, will request that you provide additional information. After receiving this notification, you must either supply any reasonably necessary additional information or must notify us that you believe that the application contains all reasonably necessary information and is therefore complete; whereupon we may:


(1) Within 30 days after receipt of the notice from the applicant, determine that the application does not contain all reasonably necessary additional information and, on that basis, deny the application; or


(2) Review the application and take final action within 60 days after the date that you provided notification to the NPS that your application is complete.


(b) The Regional Director will take final action within 90 days after the date you submitted your application unless:


(1) We and you agree that final action can occur within a shorter or longer period of time; or


(2) We determine that an additional period of time is required to ensure that we have, in reviewing the permit application, complied with other applicable laws, executive orders, and regulations.
