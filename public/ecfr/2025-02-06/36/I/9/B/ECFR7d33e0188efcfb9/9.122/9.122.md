# ยง 9.122   What additional reports must I submit if my operation includes hydraulic fracturing?

If your operations include hydraulic fracturing, you must provide the Superintendent with a report including all of the following details of the stimulation within 30 days after the completion of the last stage of hydraulic fracturing operations for each well:


(a) The true vertical depth of the well; total water volume used; a description of the base fluid and each additive in the hydraulic fracturing fluid, including the trade name, supplier, purpose, ingredients; Chemical Abstract Service Number (CAS); maximum ingredient concentration in additive (percent by mass); and maximum ingredient concentration in hydraulic fracturing fluid (percent by mass). This information may be submitted to the Superintendent through FracFocus or another existing database available to the public;


(b) The actual source(s) and location(s) of the water used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid;


(c) The maximum surface pressure and rate at the end of each stage of the hydraulic fracturing operation and the actual flush volume;


(d) The actual, estimated, or calculated fracture length, height and direction;


(e) The actual measured depth of perforations or the open-hole interval;


(f) The actual volume of stimulation fluids recovered during flow back, including a description of how the volumes were measured or calculated;


(g) The following information concerning the handling of fluids recovered, covering the period between the commencement of hydraulic fracturing and the implementation of the approved permit for the disposal of produced water under NPS requirements:


(1) The methods of handling the recovered fluids, including, but not limited to, transfer pipes and tankers, holding pond use, re-use for other stimulation activities, or injection; and


(2) The disposal method of the recovered fluids, including, but not limited to, the percent injected, the percent stored at an off-lease disposal facility, and the percent recycled; and


(h) Continuous monitoring records of annulus pressure at the bradenhead and other annular pressures that document pressures before, during, and after injection operations. You must submit a signed certification that wellbore integrity was maintained throughout the operation.
