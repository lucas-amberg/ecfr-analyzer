(a) You must promptly clean up and remove any released contaminating substances and provide documentation to the Superintendent that the substances were disposed of in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws.


(b) You must perform partial reclamation of areas no longer necessary to conduct operations. You must begin final reclamation as soon as possible but no later than 6 months after you complete your permitted operations unless the Regional Director authorizes a longer period in writing.


(c) You must protect all survey monuments, witness corners, reference monuments, and bearing trees against destruction, obliteration, or damage from operations. You are responsible for reestablishing, restoring, and referencing any monuments, corners, and bearing trees that are destroyed, obliterated, or damaged by your operations.


(d) You must complete reclamation by:


(1) Plugging all wells;


(2) Removing all above-ground structures, equipment, and roads and all other man-made material and debris resulting from operations;


(3) Removing or neutralizing any contaminating substances;


(4) Reestablishing native vegetative communities, or providing for conditions where ecological processes typical of the ecological zone (*e.g.,* plant or wildlife succession) will reestablish themselves;


(5) Grading to reasonably conform the contours to preexisting elevations that are most appropriate to maximizing ecologic functional value;


(6) Restoring conditions to pre-disturbance hydrologic movement and functionality;


(7) Restoring natural systems using native soil material that is similar in character to the adjacent undisturbed soil profiles;


(8) Ensuring that reclaimed areas do not interfere with visitor use or with administration of the unit;


(9) Meeting conditions compatible with the management objectives of the park; and


(10) Ensuring proper and equitable apportionment of reclamation responsibilities by coordinating with us or with other operators who may be using a portion of your area of operations.
