If you conduct geophysical operations, you must do all of the following:


(a) Use surveying methods that minimize the need for vegetative trimming and removal;


(b) Locate source points using industry-accepted minimum safe-offset distances from pipelines, telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads, power lines, water wells, oil and gas wells, oil and gas-production facilities, and buildings;


(c) Use equipment and methods that, based upon the specific environment, will minimize impacts to federally owned or administered lands, waters, and resources of System units, visitor uses and experiences, and visitor and employee health and safety; and


(d) If you use shot holes, you must:


(1) Use biodegradable charges;


(2) Plug all shot holes to prevent a pathway for migration for fluids along any portion of the bore; and


(3) Leave the site in a clean and safe condition that will not impede surface reclamation or pose a hazard to human health and safety.
