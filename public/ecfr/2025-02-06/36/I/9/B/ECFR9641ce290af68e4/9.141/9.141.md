# ยง 9.141   How does the NPS establish the amount of financial assurance?

We base the financial assurance amount upon the estimated cost for a third-party contractor to complete reclamation in accordance with this subpart. If the cost of reclamation exceeds the amount of your financial assurance, you remain liable for all costs of reclamation in excess of the financial assurance.
