# ยง 9.89   What additional information must be included if I am proposing well stimulation operations, including hydraulic fracturing?

If you are proposing well stimulation operations, including hydraulic fracturing, you must submit the following additional information:


(a) The geologic names, a geologic description, and the estimated depths (measured and true vertical) to the top and bottom of the target formation(s). The estimated minimum vertical distance between the top of the completion zone and the nearest usable water zone, and the measured depth of the proposed perforated or open-hole interval.


(b) The estimated depths (measured and true vertical) to the top and bottom of the confining zone(s). Include a map showing the location, orientation, and extent of any known or suspected faults or fractures within one-half mile (horizontal distance) of the wellbore trajectory that may transect the confining zone(s).


(c) A map showing all existing wellbore trajectories, regardless of type, within one-half mile (horizontal distance) of any portion of the wellbore into which hydraulic fracturing fluids are to be injected. The true vertical depth of each wellbore identified on the map must be indicated.


(d) Steps to be taken before well completions to verify mechanical integrity of all downhole tubulars and tools and cement quality, including pressure tests, monitoring of cement returns to surface, and cement evaluation logs (or other logs acceptable to the Superintendent) demonstrating that the occurrences of usable water zones have been isolated to protect them from contamination.


(e) A detailed description of the proposed well-stimulation design, including:


(1) The total proposed volume of stimulation fluid to be used; total proposed base fluid volume, description of proposed base fluid, and each additive in the proposed stimulation fluid, including the trade name, supplier, purpose, ingredients; Chemical Abstract Service Number (CAS); maximum ingredient concentration in additive (percent by mass); and maximum ingredient concentration in hydraulic fracturing fluid (percent by mass);


(2) Proposed proppant system if applicable;


(3) The anticipated surface treating pressure range;


(4) The maximum anticipated surface pressure that will be applied during the hydraulic fracturing process;


(5) The trajectory of the wellbore into which hydraulic fracturing fluids are to be injected and the estimated direction and length of the fractures that will be propagated and a notation indicating the true vertical depth of the top and bottom of the fractures; and


(6) Any microseismic monitoring planned or proposed in conjunction with well stimulation.


(f) The source and location of water supply, such as reused or recycled water, rivers, creeks, springs, lakes, ponds, and water supply wells, and the source and location of water supply, such as reused or recycled water, rivers, creeks, springs, lakes, ponds, and water supply wells.


(g) The storage, mixing, pumping, and control equipment needed to perform the stimulation.


(h) The following information concerning the handling of recovered fluids:


(1) The estimated volume of stimulation fluids to be recovered during flow back;


(2) The proposed methods of handling the recovered fluids including any onsite treatment for re-use of fluids in other stimulation activities; and


(3) The proposed disposal method of the recovered fluids, including, but not limited to, injection, hauling by truck, or transporting by pipeline.
