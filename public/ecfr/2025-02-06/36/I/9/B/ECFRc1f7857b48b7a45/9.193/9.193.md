# § 9.193   Will filing a request for reconsideration or appeal stop the NPS from taking action under this subpart?

(a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, during the reconsideration and appeal processes, the decision at issue will be stayed (suspended). The decision will not become effective until the appeals process is completed.


(b) If NPS suspends your operation due to an emergency within your area of operation that poses an immediate threat of injury to federally owned or administered lands or waters, or to public health and safety, you have a right to request reconsideration and appeal the decision under §§ 9.190 through 9.194, but the suspension will not be stayed until the threat is eliminated.
