# ยง 9.132   Will I be charged a fee for emergency access to my operations?

The Regional Director will not charge a fee for access across federally owned or administered lands beyond the scope of your oil and gas right as necessary to respond to an emergency situation at your area of operations if the Regional Director determines that the circumstances require an immediate response to either:


(a) Prevent or to minimize injury to park resources; or


(b) Ensure public health and safety.
