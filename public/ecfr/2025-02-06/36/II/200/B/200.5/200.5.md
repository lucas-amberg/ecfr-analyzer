# ยง 200.5   Indexes.

Publication of the indexes described in ยง 200.4 is deemed both unnecessary and impractical because of the large volume of material involved. However, copies of the indexes are available for public review in the Forest Service headquarters office in Washington, DC, and at field offices listed under ยง 200.2(d). The Forest Service will provide copies of any index upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.
