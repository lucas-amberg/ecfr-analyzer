# ยง 218.6   Computation of time periods.

(a) *Computation.* All time periods are computed using calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. However, when the time period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time is extended to the end of the next Federal working day as stated in the legal notice (11:59 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving office for objections filed by electronic means such as email or facsimile).


(b) *Starting date.* The day after publication of the legal notice required by ยง 218.7(c) is the first day of the objection-filing period.


(c) *Publication date.* The publication date of the legal notice of the EA or final EIS in the newspaper of record or, when the Chief is the responsible official, the _Federal Register,_ is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection. Objectors may not rely on dates or timeframe information provided by any other source.


(d) *Extensions.* Time extensions are not permitted except as provided at paragraph (a) of this section, and ยง 218.26(b).
