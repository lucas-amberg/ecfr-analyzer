(2) The agency's electronically generated posted date and time for email and facsimiles;


(3) The shipping date for delivery by private carrier for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing period; or


(4) The official agency date stamp showing receipt of hand delivery.

If the sender does not receive an automated acknowledgment of receipt of the objection, it is the sender's responsibility to ensure timely filing by other means.
