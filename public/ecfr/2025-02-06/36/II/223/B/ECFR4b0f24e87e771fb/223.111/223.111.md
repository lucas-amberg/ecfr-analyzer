# § 223.111   Administration of contracts in designated disaster areas.

This section is to implement the provisions of section 242 (a), (b), and (c) of the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1956) which relate to contracts for the sale of National Forest timber in connection with areas damaged by major disaster as designated by the President pursuant to the Act.


(a) Where an existing contract for the sale of National Forest timber does not provide relief from major physical change not due to purchaser's negligence prior to approval of construction of any section of specified road or other specified development facility and, as a result of a major disaster in a designated area a major physical change results in additional construction work by the purchaser in connection with such a road or facility, the United States shall bear such increased construction cost if, as determined by the Chief, Forest Service, the estimated cost is—


(1) More than $1,000 for sales under 1 million board feet, or 


(2) More than $1 per thousand board feet for sales of 1 to 3 million board feet, or 


(3) More than $3,000 for sales over 3 million board feet.


(b) Where the Chief, Forest Service, determines that damages are so great that restoration, reconstruction, or construction is not practical under the cost-sharing arrangement in paragraph (a) of this section, he may allow cancellation of the contract notwithstanding provisions therein or in § 223.116.


(c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to reduce to 7 days the minimum time to advertise the sale of National Forest timber whenever he determines that—


(1) The sale of such timber will assist in the construction of any area of a State damaged by a major disaster, 


(2) The sale of such timber will assist in sustaining the economy of such area, or 


(3) The sale of such timber is necessary to salvage the value of timber damaged in such major disaster or to protect undamaged timber.


(d) Any request for relief under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be made in writing to the Forest Supervisor having administrative responsibility for the land involved.
