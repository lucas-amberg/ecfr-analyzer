Each Regional Forester shall monitor bidding patterns on timber sales to determine if speculative bidding is occurring or if Purchasers are bidding in such a way that they would be unable to perform their obligations under the timber sale contract. A Regional Forester shall propose to the Chief changes in service wide timber sale procedures, as they appear necessary, to discourage speculative bidding.
