# ยง 223.53   Urgent removal contract extensions.

(a) *Finding.* There is substantial, overriding public interest in extending National Forest System timber sale contracts for undamaged (green) timber not requiring expeditious removal in order to facilitate the rapid harvest of catastrophically damaged timber requiring expeditious removal on private or other non-National Forest System lands. Such an extension may be granted when a specific catastrophic event beyond the control of the landowner occurs on non-National Forest System lands that poses a threat to general forest health, public safety, and property. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, severe wildfire, wind, floods, insects and disease infestation, and drought.


(b) *Regional Forester determination.* If the Regional Forester determines that adequate cause for urgent removal extensions exists, Contracting Officers may extend National Forest System timber sale contracts, up to a maximum of 1 year, for the estimated amount of time required to harvest and process the damaged timber on non-National Forest System lands. Contracting Officers may grant urgent removal extensions only when the Regional Forester verifies in writing that: 


(1) A specific catastrophe occurred for which urgent removal extensions should be granted; 


(2) The manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to purchasers are insufficient to provide for both the rapid harvest of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and the continued harvest of undamaged (green) timber under contract with the Forest Service; and 


(3) Failure to harvest the damaged non-National Forest System timber promptly could result in the following: 


(i) Pose a threat to public safety, 


(ii) Create a threat of an insect or disease epidemic to National Forest System or other lands or resources, or 


(iii) Significant private or other public resource loss. 


(c) *Purchaser request.* To obtain an urgent removal extension on a National Forest System timber sale contract, a purchaser must make a written request to the Contracting Officer, which includes the following: 


(1) An explanation of why the harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber within the term of the existing National Forest System contract(s) will prevent or otherwise impede the removal of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal; and 


(2) Documentation that the manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to a purchaser would be insufficient to provide for both the rapid salvage of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and continued harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber under contract with the Forest Service. 


(d) *Contracting Officer determination.* To grant an urgent removal extension, the timber sale Contracting Officer must verify the following: 


(1) That it is likely that the undamaged (green) timber from National Forest System land would be delivered to the same manufacturing facilities as are needed to process the damaged non-National Forest System timber or the National Forest System timber sale contract would require the use of the same logging equipment as is needed to remove the damaged non-National Forest System timber from the area affected by the catastrophe; 


(2) That extension of the National Forest System contract will not be injurious to the United States and will protect, to the extent possible, the health of the National Forest System lands, including: 


(i) That urgent removal extension does not adversely affect other resource management objectives to be implemented by the National Forest System timber sale being extended; and 


(ii) That the National Forest System timber sale contract to be extended is not a sale containing damaged, dead, or dying timber subject to rapid deterioration. 


(3) That the purchaser has not been granted a previous urgent removal extension on the same National Forest System timber sale contract based on the current catastrophic event. Subsequent urgent removal extensions may be granted if there are subsequent Regional Forester determinations on other catastrophic events. 


(4) That the revised National Forest System timber sale contract term will not exceed 10 years from the date the National Forest System contract was awarded; and 


(5) That the purchaser is not in breach of the National Forest System contract, and all work items, payments, and deposits are current. 


(e) *Execution of contract extension.* An urgent removal extension of a National Forest System timber sale contract is executed through a mutual agreement contract modification pursuant to ยง 223.112, which must include specific contract provisions. An agreement to modify a contract must identify the specific provision(s) of the contract being modified and must include the requirement that purchasers make cash payment to cover the costs of remarking timber on the sale area or reestablishing cutting unit boundaries if the Contracting Officer determines such work is necessary. 


(f) *Information collection.* The information required of a purchaser to request an extension of an National Forest System timber sale contract, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section, to facilitate expeditious removal of timber from non-National Forest System lands constitutes an information collection requirement as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320 and has been assigned Office of Management and Budget control number 0596-0167.
