(a) The Forest Service shall solicit and consider timber sale bids from and award contracts only to responsible business concerns and individuals.

(b) Debarment and suspension shall be imposed only for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart. The serious nature of debarment and suspension requires that these actions be imposed only in the public interest, for the Government's protection, and not for the purpose of punishment.


(c) Debarment and suspension actions taken under this subpart shall be based on the administrative record, including any submissions and argument made by the purchaser or named affiliate in accordance with this subpart, and shall be limited in scope and duration to that necessary to protect the Government's interest.
