(1) The amount of such unprocessed timber was limited to whichever is less:


(i) The higher of the applicant's actual purchase receipts for unprocessed timber originating from National Forest System lands within Washington State or the Department's records, during fiscal years 1988, 1989, and 1990, divided by 3; or


(ii) 15 million board feet.


(2) Such limit shall not exceed such person's proportionate share of 50 million board feet.


(b) *Application, review and approval process.* To obtain a share of the 50 million board feet exempted from the prohibition against indirect substitution in section 490(b) of the Act, a person must have submitted an application. Applications were required to include at least the following:

(5) Prospective applicants could review Department records upon request prior to the deadline for submitting applications. An applicant could voluntarily submit information documenting the amount of purchases of unprocessed timber originating from National Forest System lands within Washington State. The Department then determined which amount is higher, verified by either the Department's records or the applicant's records.

Applicants could submit the information documenting the amount of purchases in the following manner:


(i) Actual receipts for purchasing unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands within Washington State; or


(ii) A statement by a certified public accountant of:


(A) A summary by fiscal year for 1988, 1989 and 1990 of the applicant's acquisitions of timber originating from National Forest System lands in the State of Washington, listing total volume for each of the three fiscal years; and


(B) The average volume for the three fiscal years. The volumes to be reported were the harvest volumes, except in the case of open sales. Advertised volumes had to be reported for open sales.


(C) The certified public accountant must have certified to the following:


(D) The certified public accountant's statement and certification must have been on the accountant's company letterhead, must have been notarized, and must have accompanied the applicant's application.


(c) *Selling and trading rights.* The purchase limit right obtained under this rule may be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged with any other person subject to the following conditions:


(1) Such rights may not be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged to persons already in possession of such rights:


(2) Any person selling, trading, or exchanging any or all of the rights obtained under this rule shall advise the Regional Forester of the amount being traded and the name(s) of the person(s) acquiring such rights within 15 days of the transaction; and


(3) No person may have or acquire more than 15 million board feet in one fiscal year.
