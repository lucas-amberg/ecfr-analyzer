(a) *General.* As part of the review of a proposed surface use plan of operations, the authorized Forest officer shall consider the estimated cost to the Forest Service to reclaim those areas that would be disturbed by operations and to restore any lands or surface waters adversely affected by the lease operations after the abandonment or cessation of operations on the lease. If at any time prior to or during the conduct of operations, the authorized Forest officer determines the financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land Management is not adequate to ensure complete and timely reclamation and restoration, the authorized Forest officer shall give the operator the option of either increasing the financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land Management or filing a separate instrument with the Forest Service in the amount deemed adequate by the authorized Forest officer to ensure reclamation and restoration. 


(b) *Standards for estimating reclamation costs.* The authorized Forest officer shall consider the costs of the operator's proposed reclamation program and the need for additional measures to be taken when estimating the cost to the Forest Service to reclaim the disturbed area. 


(c) *Release of reclamation liability.* An operator may request the authorized Forest officer to notify the Bureau of Land Management of reduced reclamation liability at any time after reclamation has commenced. The authorized Forest officer shall, if appropriate, notify the Bureau of Land Management as to the amount to which the liability has been reduced.
