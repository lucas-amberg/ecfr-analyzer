(a) Grant recipients shall submit a final Community Forest Plan for Forest Service review within 120 days of the land acquisition and update the plan periodically to guide the management and use of the community forest.


(b) Grantees are encouraged to work with their State Forester or equivalent official of their Indian Tribe for technical assistance when developing or updating the Community Forest Plan.

For the purposes of the calculation in this paragraph (d)(1), the parcel's appraised value will be the parcel's full fair market value. The impact of subsequent encumbrances, such as the imposition of conservation easements consistent with the purposes of the Community Forest Program, will not be considered in appraising the parcel's fair market value; and


(2) Not be eligible for additional grants under the Community Forest Program.


(e) For Indian Tribes, land acquired using a grant provided under the Community Forest Program must not be sold, converted to nonforest uses or a use inconsistent with the purpose of the Community Forest Program, or converted to land held in trust by the United States on behalf of any Indian Tribe.
