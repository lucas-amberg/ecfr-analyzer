(b) To the extent consistent with the conservation of fish and wildlife and their habitat in accordance with recognized scientific management principles, local rural residents who depend upon the Chugach National Forest for subsistence needs shall continue to have the opportunity to engage in a subsistence way of life on the lands to which this subpart applies pursuant to applicable State and Federal law.
