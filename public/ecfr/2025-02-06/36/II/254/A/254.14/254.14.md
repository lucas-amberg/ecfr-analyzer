(3) The agreed upon values of the involved lands, until consummation of the land exchange.


(b) An exchange agreement, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, is legally binding on all parties, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, provided:


(1) Acceptable title can be conveyed;


(2) No substantial loss or damage occurs to either property from any cause;


(3) No undisclosed hazardous substances are found on the involved Federal or non-Federal lands prior to conveyance;


(4) The exchange proposal receives any required Secretarial approval;

(7) The agreement is not terminated by mutual consent or upon such terms as may be provided in the agreement.


(c) In the event of a failure to perform or to comply with the terms of an exchange agreement, the noncomplying party is liable for all costs borne by the other party as a result of the proposed exchange, including, but not limited to, land surveys, appraisals, mineral examinations, timber cruises, title searches, title curative actions, cultural resource surveys and mitigation, hazardous substance surveys and controls, removal of encumbrances, arbitration, curing deficiencies preventing highest and best use of the land, and any other expenses incurred in processing the proposed land exchange.
