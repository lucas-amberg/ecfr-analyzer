# § 292.65   Plan of operations—suspension.

(a) The authorized officer may suspend mineral operations due to an operator's noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the approved plan of operations.


(1) In those cases that present a threat of imminent harm to public health, safety, or the environment, or where such harm is already occurring, the authorized officer may take immediate action to stop the threat or damage without prior notice. In such case, written notice and explanation of the action taken shall be given the operator as soon as reasonably practicable following the suspension.


(2) In those cases that do not present a threat of imminent harm to public health, safety, or the environment, the authorized officer must first notify the operator in writing of the basis for the suspension and provide the operator with reasonably sufficient time to respond to the notice of the authorized officer or to bring the mineral operations into conformance with applicable laws, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the approved plan of operations.


(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the authorized officer shall notify the operator not less than 30 days prior to the date of the proposed suspension.
