# ยง 294.44   Prohibition on linear construction zones.

(a) *General.* A linear construction zone may not be authorized in Colorado Roadless Areas except as provided in paragraph (b) and (c) of this section and ยง 294.48 (a).


(b) *Upper Tier Acres.* Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, a linear construction zone may only be authorized within Colorado Roadless Area upper tier acres if the Regional Forester determines the LCZ is needed:


(1) Pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for by statute or treaty.


(2) For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of an authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a pre-existing water court decree (see ยง 294.43(c)(1)(iv));


(c) *Non-Upper Tier Acres.* Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, a linear construction zone may only be authorized within Colorado Roadless Area non-upper tier acres if the Regional Forester determines the LCZ is needed:


(1) Pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for by statute or treaty.


(2) For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of an authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a pre-existing water court decree (see ยง 294.43(c)(1)(iv));


(3) For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of existing or future authorized electrical power lines or telecommunication lines. Electrical power lines or telecommunication lines within Colorado Roadless Areas will only be authorized if there is no opportunity for the project to be implemented outside of a Colorado Roadless Area without causing substantially greater environmental damage; or


(4) For the construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a pipeline associated with operation of an oil and gas lease that allows surface use within a Colorado Roadless Area or the construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a pipeline needed to connect to infrastructure within a Colorado Roadless Area from outside a Colorado Roadless Area where such a connection would cause substantially less environmental damage than alternative routes. The construction of pipelines for the purposes of transporting oil or natural gas through a Colorado Roadless Area, where the source(s) and destination(s) of the pipeline are located exclusively outside of a Colorado Roadless Area, shall not be authorized.


(d) *Proposed Linear Construction Zones.* If a proposed linear construction zone meets one of the above exceptions, then the following must be determined:


(1) Motorized access, without a linear construction zone, is not feasible;


(2) A linear construction zone is consistent with the applicable land management plan direction;


(3) A linear construction zone is no wider than its intended use;


(4) Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery watershed, a linear construction zone will not diminish, over the long-term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the occupied native cutthroat trout habitat;


(5) Reclamation of a linear construction zone will not diminish, over the long-term, roadless area characteristics; and


(6) That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all projects occurring in catchments with occupied native cutthroat trout habitat.


(e) *Linear construction zone decommissioning.* Where a linear construction zone is authorized in a Colorado Roadless Area, installation of the linear facility will be done in a manner that minimizes ground disturbance, including placement within existing right-of-ways where feasible. All authorizations approving the installation of linear facilities through the use of a linear construction zone shall include a responsible official approved reclamation plan for reclaiming the affected landscape while conserving roadless area characteristics over the long-term. Upon completion of the installation of a linear facility via the use of a linear construction zone, all areas of surface disturbance shall be reclaimed as prescribed in the authorization and the approved reclamation plan and may not be waived.
