# ยง 903.1   Purpose and scope.

The purpose of this part is to enable the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation to implement the Privacy Act of 1974, and in particular the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, as added by the Act. The Act was designed to insure that personal information about individuals collected by Federal agencies be limited to that which is legally authorized and necessary, and that the information is maintained in a manner which precludes unwarranted intrusions upon individual privacy. The regulations in this part establish, and make public, procedures whereby an individual can: 


(a) Request notification of whether or not the Corporation maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to him or her, 


(b) Request access to such a record or an accounting of its disclosure, 


(c) Request that the record be amended, and 


(d) Appeal any initial adverse determination of a request to amend a record.
