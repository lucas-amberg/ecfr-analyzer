(3) If the Chairman modifies or reverses the initial decision, he or she shall specify such findings of fact and conclusions of law as are different from those of the examiner.


(4) If no appeal is taken from an initial decision within thirty days, the initial decision shall become a final decision.


(i) *Sanctions.* The Chairman shall take appropriate action in the case of any individual who is found to be in violation of 18 U.S.C. 207 or 5 CFR part 737 after a final decision by:


(1) Prohibiting the individual from making, on behalf of any other person except the United States, any formal or informal appearance before, or, with the intent to influence, any oral or written communication to, the Corporation on any matter of business for a period not to exceed five years, which may be accomplished by directing employees of the Corporation to refuse to participate in any such appearance or to accept any such communication; or
