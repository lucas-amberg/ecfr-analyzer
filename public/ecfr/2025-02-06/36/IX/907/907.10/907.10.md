# ยง 907.10   Categorical exclusion.

The CEQ Regulations provide for the categorical exclusion (40 CFR 1508.4) of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required for such actions.


(a) *Criteria.* Criteria used to determine those categories of action that normally do not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment include:


(1) The action or proposal is consistent with the Plan or the Act, and the environmental effects have been previously analyzed in the Final EIS, a supplement thereto, or in an environmental assessment or an EIS previously prepared; or


(2) The total estimated cost directly attributable to the action or proposal does not exceed $500,000; or


(3) The action or proposal is related solely to internal administrative operations of the Corporation.


(b) *List of categorical exclusions.* Categories of action, identified in appendix A (attached) have been determined by PADC to have no significant effect on the human environment and are therefore categorically excluded from the preparation of environmental impact statements and environmental assessments.


(c) *Changes to the list of categorical exclusion.* (1) The PADC List of Categorical Exclusion will be continually reviewed and refined as additional categories are identified and as experience is gained in the categorical exclusion process.


(2) Additional categories of exclusion identified will be submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors for review and approval, and for amendments to this part, following public comment and review by the Council on Environmental Quality.
