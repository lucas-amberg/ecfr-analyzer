# § 908.1   Policy.

One of the goals of The Pennsylvania Avenue Plan—1974, as amended, (*The Plan*) is the reduction of hardships experienced by businesses and residents within the development area of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (*the Corporation*) when they are displaced as a result of implementation of The Plan. It is the policy of the Corporation to provide displaced businesses and residents with a preferential opportunity to relocate within the development area so that they may share in the benefits brought to the area by the implementation of The Plan. This rule shall not be construed to affect the eligibility, rights or responsibilities of persons who may be entitled to benefits provided under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 as implemented by the Corporation (36 CFR part 904).
