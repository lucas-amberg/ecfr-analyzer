# ยง 910.18   Vehicular circulation and storage systems.

(a) Improvement of the existing vehicular storage and circulation system is necessary in order to create the balanced transportation system called for in *the Plan,* which recognizes the need to maintain air quality, to encourage the use of mass transit, and to provide sufficient off-street parking and loading to make development economically viable.


(b) The general policies of the Corporation are as follows:


(1) To reduce impedance to traffic movement created by service vehicles by requiring well-integrated off-street loading facilities in terms of location of loading berths and access points on a block-by-block basis;


(2) To control the number of vehicles in the Development Area by limiting the number of parking spaces per *development;* and


(3) To encourage the use of public transportation by linking new *development* to transit stops through the system of pedestrian ways.
