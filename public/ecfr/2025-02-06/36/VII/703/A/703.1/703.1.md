# ยง 703.1   Purpose and scope of this subpart.

(a) This subpart implements the policy of the Library with respect to the public availability of Library of Congress records. Although the Library is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), this subpart follows the spirit of that Act consistent with the Library's duties, functions, and responsibilities to the Congress. The application of that Act to the Library is not to be inferred, nor should this subpart be considered as conferring on any member of the public a right under that Act of access to or information from the records of the Library. Nothing in this subpart modifies current instructions and practices in the Library with respect to handling Congressional correspondence. 


(b) The Copyright Office, although a service unit of the Library, is by law (17 U.S.C. 701) subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, only for purposes of actions taken under the copyright law. The Copyright Office has published its own regulation with respect to the general availability of information (*see* 37 CFR 201.2) and requests for copyright records made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (*see* 37 CFR 203.1 *et seq.*) and the Privacy Act (*see* 37 CFR 204.1 *et seq.*).
