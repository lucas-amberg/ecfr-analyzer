# § 703.16   Policy on presentation of testimony and production of documents.

No Library of Congress employee may provide testimony or produce documents in any proceeding to which this part applies concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the employee's official relationship with the Library of Congress, unless authorized by the General Counsel or his/her designee, or the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) with respect to records and testimony relating to CRS's work for Congress, or the Law Librarian for records and testimony relating to the Law Library's work for Congress or materials prepared for other federal agencies covered by evidentiary privileges. The aforementioned officials (hereinafter “deciding officials”) will consider and act upon demands under this part with due regard for the interests of Congress, where appropriate, statutory requirements, the Library's interests, and the public interest, taking into account factors such as applicable privileges and immunities, including the deliberative process privilege and the speech or debate clause, the need to conserve the time of employees for conducting official business, the need to avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes, the need to maintain impartiality among private litigants in cases where a substantial government interest is not involved, the established legal standards for determining whether or not justification exists for the disclosure of confidential information and records, and any other purpose that the deciding official deems to be in the interest of Congress or the Library of Congress.
