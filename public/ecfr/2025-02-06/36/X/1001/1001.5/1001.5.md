# ยง 1001.5   Closures and public use limits.

(a) Consistent with applicable legislation and Federal administrative policies, and based upon a determination that such action is necessary for the maintenance of public health and safety, protection of environmental or scenic values, protection of natural or cultural resources, aid to scientific research, implementation of management responsibilities, equitable allocation and use of facilities, or the avoidance of conflict among visitor use activities, the Board may:


(1) Establish, for all or a portion of the area administered by the Presidio Trust, a reasonable schedule of visiting hours, impose public use limits, or close all or a portion of the area administered by the Presidio Trust to all public use or to a specific use or activity.


(2) Designate areas for a specific use or activity, or impose conditions or restrictions on a use or activity.


(3) Terminate a restriction, limit, closure, designation, condition, or visiting hour restriction imposed under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.


(b) Except in emergency situations, a closure, designation, use or activity restriction or condition, or the termination or relaxation of such, which is of a nature, magnitude and duration that will result in a significant alteration in the public use pattern of the area administered by the Presidio Trust, adversely affect the natural, aesthetic, scenic or cultural values of the area administered by the Presidio Trust, require a long-term or significant modification in the resource management objectives of the area administered by the Presidio Trust, or is of a highly controversial nature, shall be published as rulemaking in the _Federal Register._

(c) Except in emergency situations, prior to implementing or terminating a restriction, condition, public use limit or closure, the Board shall prepare a written determination justifying the action. That determination shall set forth the reason(s) the restriction, condition, public use limit or closure authorized by paragraph (a) of this section has been established, and an explanation of why less restrictive measures will not suffice, or in the case of a termination of a restriction, condition, public use limit or closure previously established under paragraph (a) of this section, a determination as to why the restriction is no longer necessary and a finding that the termination will not adversely impact resources of the area administered by the Presidio Trust. This determination shall be available to the public upon request.


(d) To implement a public use limit, the Board may establish a permit, registration, or reservation system. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the criteria and procedures of ยง 1001.6.


(e) Except in emergency situations, the public will be informed of closures, designations, and use or activity restrictions or conditions, visiting hours, public use limits, public use limit procedures, and the termination or relaxation of such, in accordance with ยง 1001.7.
