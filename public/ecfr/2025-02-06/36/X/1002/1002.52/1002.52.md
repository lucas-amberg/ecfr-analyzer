(c) The Executive Director shall, without unreasonable delay, issue a permit on proper application unless:


(1) A prior application for a permit for the same time and location has been made that has been or will be granted and the activities authorized by that permit do not reasonably allow multiple occupancy of the particular area; or


(2) It reasonably appears that the sale or distribution will present a clear and present danger to the public health and safety; or


(3) The number of persons engaged in the sale or distribution exceeds the number that can reasonably be accommodated in the particular location applied for, considering such things as damage to resources or facilities of the area administered by the Presidio Trust, impairment of a protected area's atmosphere of peace and tranquillity, interference with program activities, or impairment of public use facilities; or


(4) The location applied for has not been designated as available for the sale or distribution of printed matter; or

Locations may be designated as not available only if the sale or distribution of printed matter would:


(1) Cause injury or damage to resources of the area administered by the Presidio Trust; or


(2) Unreasonably impair the atmosphere of peace and tranquillity maintained in wilderness, natural, historic, or commemorative zones; or


(3) Unreasonably interfere with interpretive, visitor service, or other program activities, or with the administrative activities of the Presidio Trust or the National Park Service; or


(4) Substantially impair the operation of public use facilities or services of Presidio Trust concessioners or contractors; or

(h) It is prohibited for persons engaged in the sale or distribution of printed matter under this section to obstruct or impede pedestrians or vehicles, harass visitors with physical contact or persistent demands, misrepresent the purposes or affiliations of those engaged in the sale or distribution, or misrepresent whether the printed matter is available without cost or donation.


(i) A permit may be revoked under any of those conditions, as listed in paragraph (c) of this section, that constitute grounds for denial of a permit, or for violation of the terms and conditions of the permit. Such a revocation shall be made in writing, with the reason(s) for revocation clearly set forth, except under emergency circumstances, when an immediate verbal revocation or suspension may be made, to be followed by written confirmation within 72 hours.
