# ยง 1007.10   Waiver of fees.

(a) *Statutory fee waiver.* Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below the fees chargeable under ยง 1007.9 if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it:


(1) Is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and

(c) *Notice of denial.* If a requested statutory fee waiver or reduction is denied, the requester shall be notified in writing. The notice shall include:


(1) A statement of the basis on which the waiver or reduction has been denied;


(2) A listing of the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial; and


(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Executive Director and a description of the procedures in ยง 1007.7 for appeal.
