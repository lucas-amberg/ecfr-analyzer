# ยง 1007.2   Records available.

(a) *Policy.* It is the policy of the Presidio Trust to make its records available to the public to the greatest extent possible consistent with the purposes of the Presidio Trust Act and the FOIA. The Presidio Trust administers the FOIA with a presumption of openness. As a matter of policy, the Presidio Trust may make discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court.


(b) *Statutory disclosure requirement.* The FOIA requires that the Presidio Trust, on a request from a member of the public submitted in accordance with the procedures in this part, make requested records available for inspection and copying.


(c) *Statutory exemptions.* Exempted from the FOIA's statutory disclosure requirement are matters that are:


(1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; and


(ii) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.


(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;


(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Privacy Act), provided that such statute:


(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or


(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.


(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;


(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;


(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:


(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;


(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair or an impartial adjudication;


(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;


(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or


(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.


(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or


(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.


(d) *Decisions on requests.* It is the policy of the Presidio Trust to withhold information falling within an exemption only if:


(1) Disclosure is prohibited by statute or Executive order; or


(2) Sound grounds exist for invocation of the exemption.


(e) *Disclosure of reasonably segregable nonexempt material.* If a requested record contains material covered by an exemption and material that is not exempt, and it is determined under the procedures in this part to withhold the exempt material, any reasonably segregable nonexempt material shall be separated from the exempt material and released. In such circumstances, the records disclosed in part shall be marked or annotated to show both the amount and the location of the information deleted wherever practicable.
