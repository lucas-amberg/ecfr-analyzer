# § 1011.4   What notice will the Presidio Trust send to a debtor when collecting a debt?

(a) *Notice requirements.* The Presidio Trust will aggressively collect debts. The Presidio Trust will send at least one written notice to a debtor informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to pay or otherwise resolve a debt.

(3) The date by which payment is due and that the debt will be considered delinquent if payment is not received by the Presidio Trust by the due date, which date will not be less than 30 days after the date of the notice, and the date by which payment must be received by the Presidio Trust to avoid the enforced collection actions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, which date will not be less than 60 days after the date of the notice;


(4) How the debtor may enter into a written agreement to repay the debt voluntarily under terms acceptable to the Presidio Trust (see § 1011.6 of this part);

(i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;


(ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th business day following the date of the notice will stay the commencement of administrative wage garnishment, but not necessarily other collection procedures; and


(iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a hearing should be sent.


(11) How a debtor who is a Federal employee subject to Federal salary offset may request a hearing (see § 1011.12(e) of this part), including:


(i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;


(ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th business day following the date of the notice will stay the commencement of salary offset, but not necessarily other collection procedures;


(iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a hearing should be sent;


(iv) That the Presidio Trust will refer the debt to the debtor's employing agency or to the FMS to implement salary offset, unless the employee files a timely request for a hearing;


(v) That a final decision on the hearing, if requested, will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the request for a hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;


(vi) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations or evidence may subject the Federal employee to penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) or other applicable statutory authority, and criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or other applicable statutory authority;

(16) That the debtor should advise the Presidio Trust of a bankruptcy proceeding of the debtor or another person liable for the debt being collected.


(b) *Exceptions to notice requirements.* The Presidio Trust may omit from a notice to a debtor one or more of the provisions contained in paragraphs (a)(6) through (a)(16) of this section if the Presidio Trust, in consultation with its General Counsel, determines that any provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be applied to a particular debt.


(c) *Respond to debtors.* The Presidio Trust will respond promptly to communications from debtors.
