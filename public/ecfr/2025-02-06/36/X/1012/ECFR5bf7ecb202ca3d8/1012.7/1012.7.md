# ยง 1012.7   Can I get an authenticated copy of a Presidio Trust record?

Yes. We may provide an authenticated copy of a Presidio Trust record, for purposes of admissibility under Federal, State or Tribal law. We will do this only if the record has been officially released or would otherwise be released under parts 1007 or 1008 of this chapter, or this part.
