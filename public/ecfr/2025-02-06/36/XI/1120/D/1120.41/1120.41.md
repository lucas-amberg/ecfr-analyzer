# § 1120.41   Exempt documents.

(a) Generally, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) establishes nine exclusive categories of matters which are exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a). No request under 5 U.S.C. 552 for an existing, located, unpublished record in the A&TBCB's control may be denied by any A&TBCB office or employee unless the record contains (or its disclosure would reveal) matters that are—


(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are in fact properly classified pursuant to the Executive order;


(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;


(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;


(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;


(5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;


(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would—


(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;


(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;


(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;


(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or


(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;


(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or


(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.


(b) The fact that the applicability of an exemption permits the withholding of a requested record (or portion of a record) does not necessarily mean that the record must or should be withheld. (See § 1120.42 *Release of exempt documents.)*
