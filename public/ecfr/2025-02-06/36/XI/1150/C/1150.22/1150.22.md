# ยง 1150.22   Signature of documents.

The signature of a party, authorized officer, employee or attorney constitutes a certification that he/she has read the document, that to the best of his/her knowledge, information, and belief there is a good ground to support it, and that it is not interposed for delay. If a document is not signed or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this section, it may be stricken as sham and false and the proceeding may proceed as though the document had not been filed.
