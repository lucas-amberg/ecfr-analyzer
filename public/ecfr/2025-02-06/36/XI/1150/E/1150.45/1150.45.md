# ยง 1150.45   Request for hearing.

When a citation does not state that a hearing will be scheduled, the respondent, either in a separate paragraph of the answer, or in a separate document, may request a hearing. Failure of a respondent to request a hearing within fifteen (15) days from service of the citation shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and shall constitute consent to the making of a decision on the basis of available information.
