# Appendix to Part 1190—Accessibility Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way


R101.1 *Purpose.* These guidelines contain scoping and technical requirements to ensure that *pedestrian facilities* located in the *public right-of-way* (including a *public right-of-way* that forms the boundary of a site or that lies within a site bounded by a property line), are readily *accessible* to and usable by *pedestrians* with disabilities.


R101.2 *Application to ADA-Covered Facilities.* These guidelines apply to *pedestrian facilities* in *public rights-of-way* to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (42 U.S.C. 12101 *et seq.*) (ADA).


R101.3 *Application to ABA-Covered Facilities.* These guidelines apply to *pedestrian facilities* in *public rights-of-way* to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 *et seq.*) (ABA).


R101.4 *Effect on Existing Pedestrian Facilities.* These guidelines do not address existing *pedestrian facilities* unless the *pedestrian facilities* are altered at the discretion of a covered entity. The Department of Justice has authority over existing facilities that are subject to the requirement for program access under title II of the ADA. Any determination that this document applies to existing facilities subject to the program access requirement is solely within the discretion of the Department of Justice and is effective only to the extent required by regulations issued by the Department of Justice.


R102.1 *ADA-Covered Facilities and Equivalent Facilitation.* The use of alternative designs, products, or technologies that result in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability than the requirements in these guidelines shall be permitted for *pedestrian facilities* in the *public right-of-way* subject to the ADA.


R102.2 *ABA-Covered Facilities and Waivers or Modifications.* Equivalent facilitation is not permitted for *pedestrian facilities* in the *public right-of-way* subject to the ABA. The ABA authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service to modify or waive the accessibility standards for buildings and facilities covered by the ABA on a case-by-case basis, upon application made by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States concerned and upon a determination that the waiver is clearly necessary. Pursuant to Section 502(b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 792(b), the Access Board shall ensure that modifications and waivers are based on findings of fact and are not inconsistent with the ABA.


R103.1 *Conventional Industry Tolerances.* All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where requirements are stated as a range with specific minimum or maximum endpoints.


R103.2 *Calculation of Percentages.* Where the required number of *elements* or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such *elements* or facilities shall be provided.


R103.3 *Units of Measurement.* Measurements are stated in U.S. customary units and metric units. The values stated in each system (U.S. customary units and metric units) may not be exact equivalents, and each system shall be used independently of the other. Slopes are expressed in terms of both ratios and percentages. Ratios and percentages may not be exact equivalents, and each shall be used independently of the other.


R104.1 *Undefined Terms.* Terms that are not defined in R104.3 or in regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation under the ADA, the four standard setting agencies under the ABA or other Federal agencies that adopt these guidelines as accessibility standards shall be given their ordinarily accepted meaning in the sense that the context implies.

R409.7.2 *Non-Circular Cross Section.* Handrail gripping surfaces with a non-circular cross section shall have a perimeter dimension of 4 inches (100 mm) minimum and 6
1/4 inches (160 mm) maximum, and a cross-section dimension of 2
1/4 inches (57 mm) maximum.


R409.8 *Surfaces.* Handrail gripping surfaces and any surfaces adjacent to them shall be free of sharp or abrasive *elements* and shall have rounded edges.


R409.9 *Fittings.* Handrails shall not rotate within their fittings. Where expansion joints are necessary for large spans of handrails, the expansion joint is permitted to rotate in its fitting.


R409.10 *Handrail Extensions.* Handrail gripping surfaces shall extend beyond and in the same direction of *ramp* runs and *stair* flights in accordance with R409.10. Handrail extensions shall not extend into the *roadway or pedestrian circulation path.* In *alterations,* if handrail extensions complying with R409.10 would reduce the clear width of a *pedestrian access route,* they shall extend as far as possible without reducing the clear width of the *pedestrian access route.*

*Exception:* Extensions shall not be required for continuous handrails at the inside turn of switchback or dogleg *ramps* and *stairs.*

R409.10.1 *Top and Bottom Extension at Ramps. Ramp* handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 12 inches (305 mm) minimum beyond the top and bottom of *ramp* runs. Extensions shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of an adjacent *ramp* run.


R409.10.2 *Top Extension at Stairs.* At the top of a *stair* flight, handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 12 inches (305 mm) minimum beginning directly above the first riser nosing. Extensions shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of an adjacent *stair* flight.


R409.10.3 *Bottom Extension at Stairs.* At the bottom of a *stair* flight, handrails shall extend at the slope of the *stair* flight for a horizontal distance at least equal to one tread depth beyond the last riser nosing. Extensions shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of an adjacent *stair* flight.


R410.1 *General.* Visual characters on signs shall comply with R410.


R410.2 *Finish and Contrast.* Characters and their background shall have a non-glare finish. Characters shall contrast with their background with either light characters on a dark background or dark characters on a light background.


R410.3 *Case.* Characters shall be uppercase or lowercase or a combination of both.


R410.4 *Style.* Characters shall be conventional in form. Characters shall not be italic, oblique, script, highly decorative, or of other unusual forms.


R410.5 *Character Proportions.* Characters shall be selected from fonts where the width of the uppercase letter “O” is 55 percent minimum and 110 percent maximum of the height of the uppercase letter “I”.


R410.6 *Character Height.* Minimum character height shall comply with Table R410.6. Viewing distance shall be measured as the horizontal distance between the character and an obstruction preventing further approach towards the sign. Character height shall be based on the uppercase letter “I”.


R410.7 *Stroke Thickness.* Stroke thickness of the uppercase letter “I” shall be 10 percent minimum and 30 percent maximum of the height of the character.


R410.8 *Character Spacing.* Character spacing shall be measured between the two closest points of adjacent characters, excluding word spaces. Spacing between individual characters shall be 10 percent minimum and 35 percent maximum of character height.


R410.9 *Line Spacing.* Spacing between the baselines of separate lines of characters within a message shall be 135 percent minimum and 170 percent maximum of the character height.


R410.10 *Height from Ground Surface.* Visual characters shall be 40 inches (1015 mm) minimum above the ground surface.


R411.1 *General.* The International Symbol of Accessibility shall comply with R411 and Figure R411.


R411.2 *Finish and Contrast.* The symbol and its background shall have a non-glare finish. The symbol shall contrast with its background with either a light symbol on a dark background or a dark symbol on a light background.
