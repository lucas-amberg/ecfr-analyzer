The following types of claims are excluded: 


(a) Debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 1 *et seq.*) or the tariff laws of the United States, or the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 *et seq.*); except as provided under sec. 204(f) and 1631 (42 U.S.C. 404(f) and 1383(b)(4)(A)). 


(b) Any case to which the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601 *et seq.*) applies; 


(c) Any case where collection of a debt is explicitly provided for or provided by another statute, e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108, or, as provided for by title 11 of the United States Code, when the claims involve bankruptcy; 


(d) Any debt based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, as described in the FCCS, unless DOJ authorizes NARA to handle the collection; 


(e) Claims between Federal agencies; 


(f) Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not be initiated more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued. (Exception: The 10-year limit does not apply if facts material to the Federal Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts.) The 10-year limitation also does not apply to debts reduced to a judgement; and 


(g) Unless otherwise stated, claims which have been transferred to Treasury or referred to the Department of Justice will be collected in accordance with the procedures of those agencies.
