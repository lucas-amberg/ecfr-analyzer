# ยง 1201.11   Will NARA refer claims to the Department of Justice?

NARA will refer to DOJ for litigation claims on which aggressive collection actions have been taken, but which could not be collected, compromised, suspended, or terminated. Referrals will be made as early as possible, consistent with aggressive NARA collection action, and within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor.
