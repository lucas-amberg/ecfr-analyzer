# § 1201.15   What will the notice tell me regarding collection actions that might be taken if the debt is not paid within 60 days of the notice, or arrangements to pay the debt are not made within 60 days of the notice?

The notice provided under § 1201.14 will advise you that within 60 days of the date of the notice, your debt (including any interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) must be paid or you must enter into a voluntary repayment agreement. If you do not pay the debt or enter into the agreement within that deadline, NARA may enforce collection of the debt by any or all of the following methods: 


(a) By referral to a credit reporting agency (*see* § 1201.12), private collection contractor (*see* § 1201.13), or the DOJ (*see* § 1201.11). 


(b) By transferring any debt to the Treasury for collection, including under a cross-servicing agreement with the Treasury (*see* § 1201.10). 


(c) If you are a NARA employee, by deducting money from your disposable pay account until the debt (and all accumulated interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is paid in full (*see* subpart C of this part). NARA will specify the amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the deduction. 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 govern such proceedings; 


(d) If you are an employee of a Federal agency other than NARA, by initiating certification procedures to implement a salary offset by that Federal agency (*see* subpart C of this part). 5 U.S.C. 5514 governs such proceedings; 


(e) By referring the debt to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax (*see* subpart D of this part); 


(f) By administrative offset (*see* subpart E of this part); 


(g) By administrative wage garnishment (*see* subpart F of this part); or 


(h) By liquidation of security or collateral. NARA has the right to hold security or collateral, liquidate it, and apply the proceeds to your debt through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a foreclosure. NARA will not follow the procedures in this paragraph (h) if the cost of disposing the collateral will be disproportionate to its value.
