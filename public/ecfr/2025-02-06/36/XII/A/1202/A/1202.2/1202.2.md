This part does not cover: 


(a) Records that have been transferred into the National Archives of the United States for permanent preservation. Archival records that are contained in systems of records that become part of the National Archives of the United States are exempt from most provisions of the Privacy Act (see 5 U.S.C. 552a(l)(2) and (l)(3)). See subchapter C of this chapter for rules governing access to these type records. 


(b) Records of other agencies that are stored in NARA record centers on behalf of that agency are governed by the Privacy Act rules of the transferring agency. Send your request for those records directly to those agencies. 


(c) Personnel and medical records held by the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management. Privacy Act requests for these records should come to the NPRC.
