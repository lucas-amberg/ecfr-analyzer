# ยง 1202.30   How does NARA safeguard its systems of records?

(a) The system manager ensures that appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are established to ensure the security and confidentiality of records. In order to protect against any threats or hazards to their security or loss of integrity, paper records are maintained in areas accessible only to authorized NARA personnel. Electronic records are protected in accordance with the Computer Security Act, OMB Circular A-11 requiring privacy analysis in reporting to OMB, and are accessed via passwords from terminals located in attended offices. After hours, buildings have security guards and/or doors are secured and all entrances are monitored by electronic surveillance equipment. 


(b) The system manager, at his/her discretion, may designate additional safeguards similar to or greater than those described in paragraph (a) of this section for unusually sensitive records. 


(c) The system manager only permits access to and use of automated or manual personnel records to persons whose official duties require such access, or to you or to a representative designated by you.
