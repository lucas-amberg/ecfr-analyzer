# § 1202.40   How can I gain access to NARA records about myself?

(a) If you wish to request access to information about yourself contained in a NARA Privacy Act system of records, you may do so in writing or electronically.


(1) Written requests must be directed to the NARA Privacy Act Officer, National Archives and Records Administration, Rm. 3110, 8601 Adelphi Rd., College Park, MD 20740-6001. Your request should be clearly marked on the letter and the envelope as a “Privacy Act Request.”


(2) Electronic requests may be initiated online at *https://www.archives.gov/privacy.*

(b) If you wish to allow another person to review or obtain a copy of your record, you must provide authorization in writing or electronically for that person to obtain access as part of your request.


(c) Your request must contain:


(1) The complete name and identifying number of the NARA system as published in the _Federal Register_;


(2) A brief description of the nature, time, place, and circumstances of your association with NARA;


(3) Any other information which you believe would help NARA to determine whether the information about you is included in the system of records;


(4) If you are authorizing another individual to have access to your records, the name of that person; and


(5) A Privacy Act certification of identity. When you make a request for access to records about yourself, you must verify your identity.


(i) If you are submitting a written request, you must sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. While no specific form is required, you may obtain a Certification of Identity form for this purpose from the NARA Privacy Act Officer. The following information is required:


(A) Your full name;


(B) An acknowledgment that you understand the criminal penalty in the Privacy Act for requesting or obtaining access to records under false pretenses (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3)); and


(C) A declaration that your statement is true and correct under penalty of perjury (18 U.S.C. 1001).


(ii) If you are submitting an electronic request, you must provide an electronically signed statement on the electronic form. The statement affirms your identity and the fact that you understand penalties associated with requesting information under false pretenses.


(d) The procedure for accessing an accounting of disclosure is identical to the procedure for access to a record as set forth in this section.
