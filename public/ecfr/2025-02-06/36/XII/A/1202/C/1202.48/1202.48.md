# ยง 1202.48   Will I have to pay for copies of records?

Yes. However NARA will waive fees for the first 100 pages copied or when the cost to collect the fee will exceed the amount collected. When a fee is charged, the charge per copy is $0.20 per page if NARA makes the copy or $0.15 per page if you make the copy on a NARA self-service copier. Fees for other reproduction processes are computed upon request.
