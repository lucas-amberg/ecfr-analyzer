# ยง 1202.50   Does NARA require prepayment of fees?

If the system manager determines that the estimated total fee is likely to exceed $250, NARA will notify you that the estimated fee must be prepaid before you can have copies of the records. If the final fee is less than the amount you prepaid, NARA will refund the difference.
