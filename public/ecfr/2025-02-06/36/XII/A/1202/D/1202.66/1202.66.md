(a) Except for disclosures made to NARA employees in the course of the performance of their duties or when required by the Freedom of Information Act (see ยง 1202.60(a) and (b)), NARA keeps an accurate accounting of each disclosure and retains it for 5 years after the disclosure or for the life of the record, whichever is longer. The accounting includes the: 


(1) Date of disclosure; 


(2) Nature, and purpose of each disclosure; and 


(3) Name and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure is made. 


(b) The system manager also maintains with the accounting of disclosures: 


(1) A full statement of the justification for the disclosures; 


(2) All documentation surrounding disclosure of a record for statistical or law enforcement purposes; and 


(3) Evidence of written consent by the subject individual to a disclosure, if applicable. 


(c) Except for the accounting of disclosures made for a law enforcement activity (see ยง 1202.60(g)) or of disclosures made from exempt systems (see subpart F of this part), the accounting of disclosures will be made available to the subject individual upon request. Procedures for requesting access to the accounting of disclosures are in subpart C.
