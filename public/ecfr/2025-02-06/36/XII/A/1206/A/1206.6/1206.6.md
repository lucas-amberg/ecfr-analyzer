# ยง 1206.6   How do you organize the grant program?

We offer grants to support publications projects (subpart B), and records projects (subpart C). State grants (subpart D) are made to designated state agencies for statewide archival services and may include subgrants to individuals and institutions. We also support a variety of professional development opportunities.
