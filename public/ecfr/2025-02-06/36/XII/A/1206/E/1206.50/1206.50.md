# ยง 1206.50   What types of funding and cost sharing arrangements does the Commission make?

(a) *Types of grants.* (1) *Matching grant.* A matching grant is a Federal grant awarded only after the applicant raises its share of non-Federal support for a project. We will match only funds raised from non-Federal sources, either monies provided by the applicant's own institution specifically for the project or from a non-Federal third-party source. The Commission does not ordinarily make matching grants.


(2) *Outright grant.* Outright grants are those awards we make without any matching requirement. However, outright grants usually include a cost-sharing requirement.


(b) *Cost sharing.* (1) Cost sharing consists of the applicant's contribution to the cost of the project. The Commission ordinarily expects the applicant to provide cost sharing in an amount equal to the amount of the Federal grant award. Exceptions to the one-to-one cost sharing requirement may be set by the Commission in specific grant opportunity announcements.


(2) Cost sharing may include cash or in-kind contributions provided by the applicant or by a non-Federal third party.


(3) As indicated in 2 CFR part 2600, we do not pay indirect costs from grant funds, but allow indirect costs to be used for cost sharing.
