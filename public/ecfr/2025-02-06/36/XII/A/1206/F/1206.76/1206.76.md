# ยง 1206.76   May I receive an extension to my grant project?

Yes, requests for extensions of the grant period should be signed by the grantee's authorized representative and submitted not more than two months before the scheduled end of the grant period. The NHPRC will not allow extensions unless a project is up-to-date in its submission of financial and narrative reports.
