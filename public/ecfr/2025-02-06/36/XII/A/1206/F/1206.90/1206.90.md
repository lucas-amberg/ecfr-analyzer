# ยง 1206.90   Must I acknowledge NHPRC grant support?

Yes, grantee institutions, grant project directors, or grant staff personnel may publish results of any work supported by an NHPRC grant without review by the Commission; however, publications or other products resulting from the project must acknowledge the assistance of the NHPRC grant and all copies paid for by grant funds must be distributed at a reasonable cost.
