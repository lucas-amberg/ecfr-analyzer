# § 1213.2   Definitions.

(a) *Guidance* or *guidance document* means any statement of agency policy or interpretation concerning a statute, regulation, or technical matter within our jurisdiction that we intend to have general applicability and future effect on the behavior of regulated parties, but which we do not intend to have the force or effect of law in its own right on non-Governmental regulated parties, and for which we are not otherwise required by statute to satisfy the rulemaking procedures in 5 U.S.C. 553 or 5 U.S.C. 556. The term is not confined to formal written documents; guidance may come in a variety of forms, including (but not limited to) letters, memoranda, circulars, bulletins, advisories, notices, handbooks and manuals, and may include video, audio, and web-based formats. *See* OMB Bulletin 07-02, Agency Good Guidance Practices, 72 FR 3432, 3434, 3439 (January 25, 2007) (“OMB Good Guidance Bulletin”).
