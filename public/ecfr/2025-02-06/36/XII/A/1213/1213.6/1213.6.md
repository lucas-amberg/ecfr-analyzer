# ยง 1213.6   Public access to guidance documents.

We post the cleared document on our centralized guidance portal at *www.archives.gov/guidance.* The portal contains a searchable, indexed database of our various kinds of guidance along with links to each document and an agency-unique identifier, title, date issued, z-RIN, if applicable, topic keywords, brief summary, date added to the portal, and any status information (for example, that it supersedes a previous guidance document).
