# ยง 1226.12   How do agencies disseminate approved schedules?

(a) Agencies must issue disposition authorities through their internal directives system within six months of approval of the SF 115 or GRS to ensure proper distribution and application of the schedule. The directive must cite the legal authority (GRS or SF 115 and item numbers) for each schedule item covering records.


(b) Agencies must send, via link or file, an electronic copy of each published agency schedule, directive, and other policy issuance relating to records disposition to NARA at *RM.Communications@nara.gov* when the directive, manual, or policy issuance is posted or distributed.


(c) The submission must include the name, title, agency, address, and phone number of the submitter. If the comprehensive records schedule or other policy issuance is posted on a publicly available Web site, the agency must provide the full Internet address (URL).
