# ยง 1235.14   May agencies retain records for the conduct of regular agency business after they are eligible for transfer?

(a) Agencies may retain records longer than specified on a records disposition schedule only with written approval from NARA.


(b) If the agency determines that the records are needed for the conduct of regular business, the records officer must submit a request certifying continuing need to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at *permanentrecords@nara.gov.* This certification must:


(1) Include a comprehensive description and location of records to be retained;


(2) Cite the NARA-approved disposition authority;


(3) Describe the current business for which the records are required;


(4) Estimate the length of time the records will be needed (if no date is provided by the agency, approved certification requests will be effective for a maximum of five years);


(5) Explain why agency needs cannot be met by NARA reference services or copies of records deposited in the National Archives of the United States; and


(6) If records are retained to enable routine public reference by the agency rather than NARA, cite the statutory authority authorizing this agency activity.
