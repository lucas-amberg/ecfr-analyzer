# ยง 1235.20   How do agencies indicate that transferred records contain information that is restricted from public access?

When completing an SF 258, agencies must indicate restrictions on the use and examination of records and attach a written justification. The justification must cite the statute or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption (5 U.S.C. 552(b) as amended), that authorizes the restrictions.
