# § 1236.2   Definitions that apply to this part.

(a) See § 1220.18 of this subchapter for definitions of terms used throughout Subchapter B, including part 1236.


(b) As used in part 1236—


*Administrative metadata* are elements of information used to manage records and relate them to one another. Administrative metadata elements describe how a record was created, any access and use restrictions that apply to it, information about the record series to which it belongs, and the disposition schedule that identifies its retention period.


*Checksum* is a value that is computed on data and is used to authenticate information by indicating when a file has been corrupted or modified. This value is also called a “hash value,” “hash code,” “digest,” or simply “hash.”


*Descriptive metadata* are elements of information that describe the records or set of records itself. They apply to both the source records and any versions produced through digitization. Descriptive metadata for individual source records include such elements as the title of a record, a description of its contents, its creator, and the date it was created. These elements support searching for and discovering records.




*Digitizing* is the process of converting paper or analog records into electronic records.


*Electronic information system* means an information system that contains and provides access to computerized Federal records and other information.


*Electronic mail system* means a computer application used to create, receive, and transmit messages and other documents. Excluded from this definition are file transfer utilities (software that transmits files between users but does not retain any transmission data), data systems used to collect and process data that have been organized into data files or data bases on either personal computers or mainframe computers, and word processing documents not transmitted on an e-mail system.


*Embedded metadata* are textual components that exist alongside the content (usually binary data) within the file. Embedded metadata may be used to make self-describing digital files that contain administrative rights, and technical metadata and can be appropriately managed outside of a recordkeeping system.


*Intellectual control* is the information necessary to identify and understand the content and context of the records.


*Media* are the physical forms on which records are stored, such as paper, photographs, compact discs, DVDs, analog tapes, flash drives, local hard drives, or servers.










*Metadata* consists of preserved contextual information describing the history, tracking, and/or management of an electronic document.






*Mixed-media files* are records in different forms of media. A file, when used in the phrase “mixed-media file,” is a group of records—regardless of location and type of media—that belong together or relate to a topic. For example, a mixed-media case file could be a box with paper notes, audio recordings of interviews, and a CD of photographs, along with physical evidence stored separately in an evidence locker. Records in a file may be in more than one media type because of how agencies create, maintain, and use records, shifts in technology, and the topic or activity involved.


*Physical characteristics* of source records include the media, the method that information is recorded, the physical condition of the material, and the smallest level of detail present. The physical characteristics of records printed on paper include: the type of paper (office paper, Thermofax, photographic print); the type of printing (laser printed, fax printed, typewritten, half-toned, handwritten); appearance (color, inks, continuous tone or monochrome images); size, and other methods of conveying information (embossed seals, stamps). These traits determine the methods and equipment used to digitize records.


*Physical control* is having the information necessary to physically manage records. This includes knowing where the records are housed, whether any records are missing or stored separately, and the records' physical form (media types, the records' dimensions, and the physical characteristics).


*Project plan* is a document that identifies the records that are to be digitized, an estimate of their volume and of the media types that are present, the image quality parameters selected to capture necessary information, the date range of the records, a copy of the applicable agency records schedule(s); any indexes used to maintain intellectual and physical control; and a quality management (QM) section that describes quality assurance (QA) objectives, quality control (QC) procedures to identify and correct errors during digitization, and the QC reports that will be used to identify and remediate errors when detected.


*Quality assurance (QA)* refers to proactive QM activities focused on preventing defects by ensuring that a particular product or service achieves certain requirements or specifications. A QA program is heavily dependent on QC data to search for patterns and trends. QA activities also include controlled experiments, design reviews of digitization workflows, and system tests. QA programs can improve quality by creating plans and policies or by creating and conducting training.


*Quality control (QC)* refers to QM activities that examine products through inspection or testing to determine if they meet predetermined specifications. The purpose is to detect defects (deviations from predetermined requirements) in products or processes.


*Quality management (QM)* refers to the overall management functions and underlying activities that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities, and that implement them through planning, control, assurance, and improvement methods within the quality system.


*Technical metadata* are elements of information that describe the properties of computer files, the hardware used to create them, and the parameters used by systems to render them. Technical metadata may include elements such as a file's byte size, file format and version, color encoding, and the type of equipment used to make the file (for example, camera name or scanner manufacturer).




*Unstructured electronic records* means records created using office automation applications such as electronic mail and other messaging applications, word processing, or presentation software.


*Validating* is the process of ensuring that the records meet the requirements of this part.
