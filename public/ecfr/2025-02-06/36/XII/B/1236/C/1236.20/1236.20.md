# ยง 1236.20   What are appropriate recordkeeping systems for electronic records?

(a) *General.* Agencies must use electronic or paper recordkeeping systems or a combination of those systems, depending on their business needs, for managing their records. Transitory e-mail may be managed as specified in ยง 1236.22(c).


(b) *Electronic recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping functionality may be built into the electronic information system or records can be transferred to an electronic recordkeeping repository, such as a DoD-5015.2 STD-certified product. The following functionalities are necessary for electronic recordkeeping:


(1) *Declare records.* Assign unique identifiers to records.


(2) *Capture records.* Import records from other sources, manually enter records into the system, or link records to other systems.


(3) *Organize records.* Associate with an approved records schedule and disposition instruction.


(4) *Maintain records security.* Prevent the unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of declared records, and ensure that appropriate audit trails are in place to track use of the records.


(5) *Manage access and retrieval.* Establish the appropriate rights for users to access the records and facilitate the search and retrieval of records.


(6) *Preserve records.* Ensure that all records in the system are retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct agency business and to meet NARA-approved dispositions. Agencies must develop procedures to enable the migration of records and their associated metadata to new storage media or formats in order to avoid loss due to media decay or technology obsolescence.


(7) *Execute disposition.* Identify and effect the transfer of permanent records to NARA based on approved records schedules. Identify and delete temporary records that are eligible for disposal. Apply records hold or freeze on disposition when required.


(c) *Backup systems.* System and file backup processes and media do not provide the appropriate recordkeeping functionalities and must not be used as the agency electronic recordkeeping system.
