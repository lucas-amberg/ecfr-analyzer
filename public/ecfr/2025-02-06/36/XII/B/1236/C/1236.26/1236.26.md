# ยง 1236.26   What actions must agencies take to maintain electronic information systems?

(a) Agencies must maintain inventories of electronic information systems and review the systems periodically for conformance to established agency procedures, standards, and policies as part of the periodic reviews required by 44 U.S.C. 3506. The review should determine if the records have been properly identified and described, and if the schedule descriptions and retention periods reflect the current informational content and use. If not, agencies must submit an SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, to NARA.


(b) Agencies must maintain up-to-date documentation about electronic information systems that is adequate to:


(1) Specify all technical characteristics necessary for reading and processing the records contained in the system;


(2) Identify all inputs and outputs;


(3) Define the contents of the files and records;


(4) Determine restrictions on access and use;


(5) Understand the purpose(s) and function(s) of the system;


(6) Describe update cycles or conditions and rules for adding, changing, or deleting information in the system; and


(7) Ensure the timely, authorized disposition of the records.
