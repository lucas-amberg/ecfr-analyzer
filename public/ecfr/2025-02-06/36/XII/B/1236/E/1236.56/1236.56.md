# § 1236.56   Validating digitized records and disposition authorities.

(a) When a digitization project is complete, the agency must validate that the digitized versions meet the standards in this subpart.


(b) Separate staff must conduct the validation, independent from the staff that performed the digitization QC inspections described in § 1236.46.


(c) Agencies must verify that:


(1) All records identified in the project's scope have either been digitized or have been identified in project documentation as missing or incomplete records (and the agency must note this information in the Details section of the ERA TR when transferring the records);


(2) All required metadata are accurate, complete, and correctly labeled;


(3) All image technical attributes specified in § 1236.50 have been met;


(4) All image files are legible and all physical characteristics necessary to understand and use the records have been captured;


(5) Mixed-media files are digitized appropriately for the material type, or if mixed-media components are retained in their original format, they are associated with digitized components through metadata, per the requirements specified in § 1236.54(c); and


(6) Project documentation has been created according to § 1236.44.


(d) Once validated, the digitized records are permanent records.


(e) After validating, the agency must determine whether the agency has any reasons for retaining the source records for a period of time once digitized, in keeping with § 1236.40(g).


(f) Unless source records will be retained for reasons identified in § 1236.40(g), the agency must dispose of the source records in accordance with an agency records schedule or GRS that addresses disposition after digitization.


(g) Agencies cannot use the GRS to dispose of source records if the digitized records do not meet the requirements in this subpart. In such cases, agencies should contact the Records Management Policy and Standards Team at *rmstandards@nara.gov* to determine what steps they must take.


(h) Agencies must transfer the digitized records to NARA according to the approved disposition authority and include the transfer metadata as described in § 1236.58.


(i) Agencies must retain the project documentation described in § 1236.44 until the National Archives confirms receipt of the records and legal custody of the records has been transferred.


(j) Agencies must transfer the administrative, technical, and descriptive metadata captured during the digitization project as CSV files, as described in § 1236.54(b)(6), with the resulting digitized records.
