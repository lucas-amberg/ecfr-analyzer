# ยง 1237.22   What are special considerations in the storage and maintenance of cartographic and related records?

Agencies must:


(a) Maintain permanent and unscheduled cartographic, architectural, and engineering records in an environment that does not exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit and with relative humidity under 50%.


(b) Create an identification scheme for each series and assign unique identification designations to each item within a series.


(c) Maintain lists or indexes for each series with cross-references to related textual records.


(d) Avoid interfiling separate series of maps, charts, or drawings, and file permanent cartographic and architectural records separately from temporary series unless hand-corrected versions have been systematically filed with other published maps in a central or master file.


(e) Avoid rolling and folding maps and drawings. Store permanent maps and drawings flat in shallow drawer map cases in acid-free folders.


(f) Do not laminate original oversize records. Consult 

NARA for preservation, storage, and treatment options, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Preservation Programs (RX); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.
