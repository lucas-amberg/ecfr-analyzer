# ยง 1239.22   How does NARA notify the agency of the inspection?

(a) Once NARA identifies the need to conduct an agency inspection, the Archivist of the United States sends a letter to the head of the agency. If the agency being inspected is a component of a cabinet department, the letter will be addressed to the head of the component, with a copy sent to the head of the department. NARA will also send copies to the agency's records officer. The letter will include:


(1) Notification that NARA intends to conduct an inspection, the records that will be inspected, and the issues to be addressed;


(2) A beginning date for the inspection that is no more than 30 days after the date of the letter; and


(3) A request that the agency appoint a point of contact who will assist NARA in conducting the inspection.


(b) If the agency does not respond to NARA's notification letter, NARA will use its statutory authority under 44 U.S.C. 2904(c)(8) to report the matter to the agency's congressional oversight committee and to the Office of Management and Budget.
