# ยง 1250.10   Do I need to use FOIA to gain access to records at NARA?

(a) Most *archival* records held by NARA have no restrictions to access and are available to the public for research without filing a FOIA request. You may either visit a NARA facility as a researcher to view and copy records or you may write to request copies of specific records. (See subpart B of 36 CFR part 1256 for more information about how to access archival records).


(b) If you are seeking access to *archival* records that are not yet available to the public, you need to file a FOIA request. (See 36 CFR 1256.22 for information on how to request access to restricted archival records. See paragraph (d) of this section, and part 1260, for additional procedures on access to classified records.)


(c) You must also file a FOIA request when you request access to NARA *operational* records (records NARA creates) that are not already available to the public.


(d) If you are requesting records that you know are classified to protect national security interests, you may wish to use the Mandatory Declassification Review process, which is set forth at 36 CFR 1260.70. (Please see NARA's FOIA Guide, available online at *http://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide.html,* for the differences between the FOIA and Mandatory Declassification Review access processes.)
