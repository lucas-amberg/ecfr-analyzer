# ยง 1250.50   General information on fees for all FOIA requests.

(a) If you have failed to pay FOIA fees in the past, we will require you to pay your past-due bill and we may also require that you pay the anticipated fee before we begin processing your current request. If we estimate that your fees may be greater than $250, we may also require advance payment or a deposit before we begin processing your request. If you fail to make an advance payment within 60 calendar days after the date of NARA's fee letter, we will close the request.


(b) If we determine that you (acting either alone or with other requesters) are breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid or reduce fees, we may aggregate all of these requests when calculating the fees. In aggregating requests, we may consider the subject matter of the requests and whether the requests were filed close in time to one another.


(c) If, in the course of negotiating fees, you do not respond to a NARA component within 60 calendar days, we reserve the right to administratively close the FOIA request after 60 calendar days have passed from the date of our last correspondence to you.
