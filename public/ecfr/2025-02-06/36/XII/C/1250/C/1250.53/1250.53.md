# § 1250.53   What is the FOIA fee schedule for operational records?

In responding to FOIA requests for operational records, NARA charges the following fees, where applicable, unless we have given you a reduction or waiver of fees under § 1250.56.


(a) *Search fees*—(1) *Manual searching.* When the search is relatively straightforward and can be performed by a clerical or administrative employee, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and must be done by a NARA professional employee, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).


(2) *Computer searching.* NARA bases the fees for computer searches on the actual cost to NARA of operating the computer and the salary of the operator. When the search is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can conduct it, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must perform it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).


(b) *Review fees.* (1) NARA charges review fees for time we spend examining documents that are responsive to a request to determine whether we must apply any FOIA exemptions to withhold information. NARA charges review fees even if we ultimately are unable to disclose a record.


(2) The review fee is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).


(3) NARA does not charge review fees for time we spend resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. However, NARA does charge review fees for time we spend obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter.


(c) *Reproduction fees*—(1) *Self-service photocopying.* At NARA facilities with self-service photocopiers, you may make reproductions of released paper records for $0.25 per page.


(2) *Photocopying standard-sized pages.* When we make the photocopies for operational records, the charge is $0.30 per page.


(3) *Reproductions of electronic records.* NARA charges you for our direct costs for staff time for programming, computer operations, and printouts or electromagnetic media to reproduce the requested electronic information. When the work is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can perform it, the rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must do it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).


(4) *Copying other media.* This is the direct cost to NARA of the reproduction. We provide specific rates on a case-by-case basis.
