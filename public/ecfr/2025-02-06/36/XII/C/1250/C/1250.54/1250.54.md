# § 1250.54   How does NARA calculate FOIA fees for operational records?

(a) If you are a commercial use requester, NARA charges you fees for searching, reviewing, and copying responsive records.


(b) If you are an educational or scientific institution requester, or a member of the news media, you are entitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of copying without charge. NARA charges copying fees only beyond the first 100 pages.


(c) If you do not fall into either of the categories in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and are an “other requester,” you are entitled to two hours of search and review time, and up to 100 pages of copying without charge. NARA may charge for search time beyond the first two hours and for copying beyond the first 100 pages.


(d) NARA does not charge a fee for processing a FOIA request if it exceeds any time limit under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) in processing that request, unless unusual or exceptional circumstances (defined under the FOIA statute) are relevant.
