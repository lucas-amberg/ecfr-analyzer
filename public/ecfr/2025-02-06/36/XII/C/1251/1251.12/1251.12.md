# ยง 1251.12   How does NARA process your demand?

(a) After service of a demand for production of records or for testimony, an appropriate NARA official reviews the demand and, in accordance with the provisions of this, determines whether, or under what conditions, to produce records or authorize the employee to testify on matters relating to agency information.


(b) NARA processes demands in the order in which we receive them. NARA will not complete and return certifications, affidavits, or similar documents submitted with a demand for records, but if requested will certify records in accordance with NARA's published fee schedule at 36 CFR part 1258. Absent exigent or unusual circumstances, NARA responds within 45 days from the date of receipt. The time for response depends upon the scope of the demand.


(c) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this part where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of NARA or the United States or for other good cause.
