# ยง 1253.9   Notification process for changes in hours.

(a) We follow the notification procedure in this section when proposing to change public operating hours for research rooms, exhibit areas, and museums.


(b) Proposed changes to operating hours for research rooms, exhibit areas, and museums must have a documented business need for the change.


(c) We notify people of the change in operating hours by:


(1) Posting a notice on *http://www.archives.gov;*

(2) Posting notices in areas visible to the public in the affected research room, exhibit areas, or museum;


(3) Issuing a press release, email notification, or other means normally used by that unit to notify the public of events at their location; and


(4) Including justification for the change in hours in these notices.


(d) In the event that research rooms, exhibit areas, or museums must make an emergency change to operating hours for reasons including, but not limited to, inclement weather, we will provide as much advance notice to the public as possible. We will post emergency notifications online at *http://www.archives.gov.*
