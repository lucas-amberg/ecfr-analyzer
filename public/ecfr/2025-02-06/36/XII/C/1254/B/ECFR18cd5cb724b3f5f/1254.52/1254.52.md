# ยง 1254.52   Can NARA extend the period of revoked research privileges?

We send you a written notice of an extension within 3 workdays of our decision to continue the revocation of research privileges.


(b) You have 30 calendar days after the decision to extend the revocation of research privileges to appeal the action in writing.

The Deputy Archivist has 30 calendar days from receipt of your appeal to decide whether to reinstate your research privileges and to respond to you in writing.
