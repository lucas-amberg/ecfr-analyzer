# ยง 1254.20   What general policies apply in all NARA facilities where archival materials are available for research?

(a) Researchers may use original documents only in the designated research room at the facility where they are stored.


(b) Researchers must use microfilm copies or other alternative copies of documents when available, rather than the original documents. Some of our microfilm publications are available in more than one NARA facility.


(c) We may limit the quantity of documents that we deliver to you at one time. In some research rooms, we furnish records according to a specific time schedule.
