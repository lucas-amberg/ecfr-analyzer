# ยง 1254.72   What procedures do I follow to copy documents?

(a) You must use paper tabs to designate individual documents you wish to copy. You must show the container including the tabbed documents to the research room attendant who determines whether they can be copied on the self-service copier. The manager of the staff administering the research room reviews the determination of suitability if you ask. After copying is completed, you must return documents removed from files for copying to their original position in the file container, you must refasten any fasteners removed to facilitate copying, and you must remove any tabs placed on the documents to identify items to be copied.


(b) If you are using a reserved copier, you must submit the containers of documents to the attendant for review before your appointment. The review time required is specified in each research room. Research room attendants may inspect documents after copying.


(c) You may copy from only one box and one folder at a time. After copying the documents, you must show the original documents and the copies to a research room attendant.
