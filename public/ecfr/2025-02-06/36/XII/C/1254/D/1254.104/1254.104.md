# ยง 1254.104   How does NARA determine fees to prepare documents for microfilming?

(a) As part of our evaluation of a request to microfilm documents, we determine the amount of microfilm preparation that we must do before you can microfilm the documents and the estimated cost of such preparation. We base fees for microfilm preparation on direct salary costs (including benefits) and supply costs when we perform the work. When a NARA contractor performs the work, the fees are the cost to NARA. Microfilm preparation includes:


(1) Removing document fasteners from documents when the fasteners can be removed without damage to the documents; and


(2) Taking any document conservation actions that must be accomplished in order to film the documents, such as document flattening or mending.


(b) We provide you detailed information on the fees for microfilm preparation in the letter of approval. You must pay fees in accordance with ยง 1258.14 of this chapter. When a body of documents requires extensive microfilm preparation, we may establish a different payment schedule at our discretion.
