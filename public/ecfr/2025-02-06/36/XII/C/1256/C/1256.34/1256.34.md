# ยง 1256.34   How long may access to some donated historical materials be denied?

Some donated historical materials are closed for long periods, either under the provisions of the deed of gift, our general restrictions described in subpart D of this part, or another governing authority. We are sometimes able to make a copy of materials with restricted information redacted.
