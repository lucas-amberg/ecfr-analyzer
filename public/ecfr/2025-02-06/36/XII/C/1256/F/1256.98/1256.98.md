# ยง 1256.98   Can I get access to and obtain copies of USIA audiovisual records transferred to the National Archives of the United States?

NARA provides access to USIA audiovisual records after the appropriate time period of restriction has passed.


(a) No USIA audiovisual records in the National Archives of the United States that were prepared for dissemination abroad are available for copying until at least 12 years after USIA first disseminated these materials abroad, or, in the case of materials prepared for foreign dissemination but not disseminated abroad, until at least 12 years after the preparation of the materials.


(b) If the appropriate time has passed, you may have access to USIA audiovisual records that do not have copyright protection and do not contain copyright material. USIA audiovisual records prepared for dissemination abroad that NARA determines do not have copyright protection nor contain copyrighted material are available for examination and copying as described in the regulations in parts 1252, 1253, 1254, 1256, and 1258 of this chapter. To determine whether materials have copyright protection or contain copyrighted material, NARA relies on information contained within or fastened to individual records (for example, copyright notices); information contained within relevant USIA production, title, or other files that USIA transferred to NARA; information provided by requesters under ยง 1256.100(b) (for example, evidence from the Copyright Office that copyright has lapsed or expired); and information provided by copyright or license holders.
