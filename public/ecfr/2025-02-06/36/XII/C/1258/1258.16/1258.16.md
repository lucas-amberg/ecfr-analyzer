# ยง 1258.16   What is NARA's refund policy?

Due to various factors, it is occasionally difficult for NARA to make a legible reproduction. NARA will notify customers and ask for approval to proceed if we anticipate a reproduction of questionable legibility. As a result, NARA does not provide refunds except in special cases. If a customer requests a refund, we review the order to determine if we properly notified the customer of the questionable nature of the original and if the product is a true representation of the original. If the product is a true representation of the original, we will not issue a refund. If you feel we processed your order incorrectly or it contains errors, please contact us within 30 days of your delivery date to have your issue verified. Once we verify the issue, we will correct the error and resend the documents. If we cannot correct the error, you will receive a refund.
