# ยง 1258.18   Where can I find NARA's current fees and information on how to order reproductions?

(a) NARA's fee schedule, methods of payment, and ordering portal are located at *http://www.archives.gov.*

(b) Fee schedules for reproductions made from the holdings of Presidential libraries may differ because of regional cost variations. Presidential library fee schedules are available at *http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/.* Some services may not be available at all NARA facilities.


(c) In order to preserve certain records which are in poor physical condition, NARA may restrict customers to photographic or other kinds of duplication instead of electrostatic copies.
