# ยง 1260.42   How does the NDC process referrals of Federal Records?

(a) All referrals are processed through the IRC.


(b) Agencies will have one year from the time they receive formal notification of referrals by the NDC to review their equity in the records. If an agency does not complete its review within one year of formal notification, its information will be automatically declassified in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3)(B) of the Order unless the information has been properly exempted by an equity holding agency under section 3.3 of the Order.


(c) Once notified, the agencies will coordinate their review with the NDC so the NDC can properly manage the workflow of the IRC.
