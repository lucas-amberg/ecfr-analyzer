# ยง 1260.50   How are records at NARA reviewed as part of the automatic declassification process?

(a) Consistent with the requirements of section 3.3 of Executive Order 13526 on automatic declassification, NARA staff may review for declassification records for which the originating agencies have provided written authority to apply their approved declassification guides. The originating agency must review records for which this authority has not been provided.


(b) Agencies may choose to review their own records that have been transferred to NARA's legal custody, by sending personnel to the NARA facility where the records are located to conduct the declassification review.


(c) Classified materials in the Presidential Libraries may be referred to agencies holding equity in the records through the RAC Project.
