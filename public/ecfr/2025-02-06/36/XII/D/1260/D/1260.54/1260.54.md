# ยง 1260.54   Will NARA loan accessioned records back to the agencies to conduct declassification review?

In rare cases, when agency reviewers cannot be accommodated at a NARA facility, NARA will consider a request to loan records back to an originating agency in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area for declassification review. Each request will be judged on a case-by-case basis. The requesting agency must:


(a) Ensure that the facility in which the documents will be stored and reviewed passes a NARA inspection to ensure that the facility maintains:


(1) The correct archival environment for the storage of permanent records; and


(2) The correct security conditions for the storage and handling of classified national security materials.


(b) Meet NARA requirements for ensuring the safety of the records;


(c) Abide by NARA procedures for handling of archival materials;


(d) Identify and mark documents that cannot be declassified in accordance with NARA procedures; and


(e) Obtain NARA approval for use of any equipment such as scanners, copiers, or cameras to ensure that they do not pose an unacceptable risk of damage to archival materials.
