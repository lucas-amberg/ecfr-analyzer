# ยง 1270.32   Disposing of Presidential records in the Archivist's custody.

(a) The Archivist may dispose of Presidential records in the Archivist's legal custody that the Archivist appraises and determines to have insufficient administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value to warrant continuing to preserve them.


(b) If the Archivist determines that Presidential records have insufficient value under paragraph (a) of this section, the Archivist publishes a proposed disposal notice in the _Federal Register_ with a public comment period of at least 45 days. The notice describes the records the Archivist proposes to dispose of, the reason for disposing of them, and the projected earliest disposal date.


(c) After the public comment period in paragraph (b) of this section, the Archivist publishes a final disposal notice in the _Federal Register_ at least 60 calendar days before the earliest disposal date. The notice includes:


(1) A reasonably specific description of the records scheduled for disposal;


(2) The earliest disposal date; and


(3) A concise statement of the reason for disposing of the records.


(d) Publishing the notice required by paragraph (c) of this section in the _Federal Register_ constitutes a final agency action for purposes of review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.
