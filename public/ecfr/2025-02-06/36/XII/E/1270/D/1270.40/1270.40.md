(1) The restricting President waives the restriction, in whole or in part;


(2) The restriction period in paragraph (a) of this section expires for the category of information; or


(3) The Archivist determines that the restricting President or an agent of that President has published the restricted record, a reasonably segregable portion of the record, or any significant element or aspect of the information contained in the record, in the public domain.
