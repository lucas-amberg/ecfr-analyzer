# ยง 1270.42   Appealing restricted access.

(a) If the Archivist denies a person access to a Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of it due to a restriction made under ยง 1270.40, that person may file an administrative appeal. To file an administrative appeal requesting access to Presidential records, send it to the director of the Presidential Library of the President during whose term of office the record was created, at the address listed in 36 CFR 1253.3. To file an administrative appeal requesting access to Vice Presidential records, send it to the director of the Presidential Materials Division at the address listed in 36 CFR 1253.1.


(b) An appeal must arrive to the director within 90 calendar days from the date on the access denial letter.


(c) Appeals must be in writing and must identify:


(1) The specific records the requester is seeking; and


(2) The reasons why the requester believes they should have access to the records.


(d) The director responds to the requester in writing and within 30 working days from the date they receive the appeal. The director's response states whether or not the director is granting access to the Presidential records and the basis for that decision. The director's decision to withhold release of Presidential records is final and is not subject to judicial review.
