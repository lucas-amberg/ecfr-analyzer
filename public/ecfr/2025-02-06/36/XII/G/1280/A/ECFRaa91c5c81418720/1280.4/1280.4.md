# ยง 1280.4   Children under the age of 14.

We admit children under the age of 14 to NARA facilities only if they are accompanied by an adult who will supervise them at all times. The director of a NARA facility may authorize a lower age limit for unaccompanied children to meet special circumstances (*e.g.,* students who have been given permission to conduct research without adult supervision).
