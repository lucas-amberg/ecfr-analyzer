# ยง 1280.84   Using the Rotunda.

(a) We do not allow private group event activities (*e.g.,* dinner/reception, program) to be held in the Rotunda or the exhibit galleries in the National Archives Museum. We may, at our discretion, allow attendees at private group events to enter the Rotunda and other Museum areas in conjunction with their event to view the exhibits, but the event activities themselves may not be held in those spaces. Whether during or outside of regular business hours, event attendees may film, photograph, or videotape in the Rotunda or other Museum areas, including group photographs or videos, for personal use only, in accordance with all applicable regulations contained in this part and unless otherwise posted.








(b) We may, upon application, permit other Federal agencies, quasi-Federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal governments to use the Rotunda for official functions, with NARA as a co-sponsor. Governmental groups that use the Rotunda for official functions must reimburse NARA for the cost of additional cleaning, security, and other staff services, as for use of any other public spaces.
