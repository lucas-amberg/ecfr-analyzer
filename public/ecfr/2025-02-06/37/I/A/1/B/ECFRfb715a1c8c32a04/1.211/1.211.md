(c) An application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) will not be published until it includes the basic filing fee (§ 1.16(a) or (c)) and any English translation required by § 1.52(d). The Office may delay publishing any application until it includes any application size fee required by the Office under § 1.16(s) or § 1.492(j), a specification having papers in compliance with § 1.52 and an abstract (§ 1.72(b)), drawings in compliance with § 1.84, a “Sequence Listing” in compliance with §§ 1.821 through 1.825 (if applicable) for an application filed before July 1, 2022, a “Sequence Listing XML” in compliance with §§ 1.831 through 1.835 (if applicable) for an application filed on or after July 1, 2022, and the inventor's oath or declaration or application data sheet containing the information specified in § 1.63(b).

(e) The publication fee set forth in § 1.18(d) must be paid in each application published under this section before the patent will be granted. If an application is subject to publication under this section, the sum specified in the notice of allowance under § 1.311 will also include the publication fee which must be paid within three months from the date of mailing of the notice of allowance to avoid abandonment of the application. This three-month period is not extendable. If the application is not published under this section, the publication fee (if paid) will be refunded.
