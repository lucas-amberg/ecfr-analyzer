# § 1.775   Calculation of patent term extension for a human drug, antibiotic drug or human biological product.

(a) If a determination is made pursuant to § 1.750 that a patent for a human drug, antibiotic drug or human biological product is eligible for extension, the term shall be extended by the time as calculated in days in the manner indicated by this section. The patent term extension will run from the original expiration date of the patent or any earlier date set by terminal disclaimer (§ 1.321).


(b) The term of the patent for a human drug, antibiotic drug or human biological product will be extended by the length of the regulatory review period for the product as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, reduced as appropriate pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section.


(c) The length of the regulatory review period for a human drug, antibiotic drug or human biological product will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B), it is the sum of—


(1) The number of days in the period beginning on the date an exemption under subsection (i) of section 505 or subsection (d) of section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective for the approved product and ending on the date the application was initially submitted for such product under those sections or under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act; and


(2) The number of days in the period beginning on the date the application was initially submitted for the approved product under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, subsection (b) of section 505 or section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and ending on the date such application was approved under such section.


(d) The term of the patent as extended for a human drug, antibiotic drug or human biological product will be determined by—


(1) Subtracting from the number of days determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be in the regulatory review period:


(i) The number of days in the periods of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section which were on and before the date on which the patent issued;


(ii) The number of days in the periods of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section during which it is determined under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(2)(B) by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that applicant did not act with due diligence;


(iii) One-half the number of days remaining in the period defined by paragraph (c)(1) of this section after that period is reduced in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section; half days will be ignored for purposes of subtraction;


(2) By adding the number of days determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the original term of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer;


(3) By adding 14 years to the date of approval of the application under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, or subsection (b) of section 505 or section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;


(4) By comparing the dates for the ends of the periods obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section with each other and selecting the earlier date;


(5) If the original patent was issued after September 24, 1984,


(i) By adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent or any earlier date set by terminal disclaimer; and


(ii) By comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(i) of this section with each other and selecting the earlier date;


(6) If the original patent was issued before September 24, 1984, and


(i) If no request was submitted for an exemption under subsection (i) of section 505 or subsection (d) of section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act before September 24, 1984, by—


(A) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent or earlier date set by terminal disclaimer; and


(B) By comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(i)(A) of this section with each other and selecting the earlier date; or


(ii) If a request was submitted for an exemption under subsection (i) of section 505 or subsection (d) of section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, or Cosmetic Act before September 24, 1984 and the commercial marketing or use of the product was not approved before September 24, 1984, by—


(A) Adding 2 years to the original expiration date of the patent or earlier date set by terminal disclaimer, and


(B) By comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(ii)(A) of this section with each other and selecting the earlier date.
