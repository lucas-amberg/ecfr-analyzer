(4) Include each disclosed nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, as defined in § 1.821(a).


(5) Assign a separate sequence identifier to each sequence, beginning with 1 and increasing sequentially by integers, and include the sequence identifier in numeric identifier <210>.


(6) Use the code “000” in place of the sequence where no sequence is present for a sequence identifier.


(7) Include the total number of SEQ ID NOs in numeric identifier <160>, as defined in appendix G to this subpart, whether followed by a sequence or by the code “000.”
