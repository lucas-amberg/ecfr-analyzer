# § 1.824   Form and format for a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence submission as an ASCII plain text file.

(a) A “Sequence Listing” under § 1.821(c)(1) and the CRF required by § 1.821(e) submitted as an ASCII plain text file may be created by any means, such as text editors, nucleotide/amino acid sequence editors, or other custom computer programs; however, the ASCII plain text file must conform to the following requirements:


(1) Must have the following compatibilities:


(i) Computer compatibility: PC or Mac®; and


(ii) Operating system compatibility: MS-DOS®, MS-Windows®, Mac OS®, or Unix®/Linux®.

No spaces or other types of characters are permitted in the file name.

(5) Pagination is not permitted; the ASCII plain text file must be one continuous file, with no “hard page break” codes and no page numbering.


(b) The ASCII plain text file must contain a copy of a single “Sequence Listing” in a single file and be submitted either:


(1) Electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, where the file must not exceed 100 MB, and file compression is not permitted; or


(2) On a read-only optical disc(s), in compliance with § 1.52(e), where:
