# ยง 11.30   Participation in the USPTO Diversion Program.

(a) Before or after a complaint under ยง 11.34 is filed, the OED Director may dispose of a disciplinary matter by entering into a diversion agreement with a practitioner. Diversion agreements may provide for, but are not limited to, law office management assistance, counseling, participation in lawyer assistance programs, and attendance at continuing legal education programs. Neither the OED Director nor the practitioner is under any obligation to propose or enter into a diversion agreement. To be an eligible party to a diversion agreement, a practitioner cannot have been disciplined by the USPTO or another jurisdiction within the past three years, except that discipline by another jurisdiction is not disqualifying if that discipline in another jurisdiction was based on the conduct forming the basis for the current investigation.


(b) For a practitioner to be eligible for diversion, the conduct at issue must not involve:


(1) The misappropriation of funds or dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation;


(2) Substantial prejudice to a client or other person as a result of the conduct;


(3) A serious crime as defined in ยง 11.1; or


(4) A pattern of similar misconduct unless the misconduct at issue is minor and related to a chronic physical or mental health condition or disease.


(c) The diversion agreement is automatically completed when the terms of the agreement have been fulfilled. A practitioner's successful completion of the diversion agreement bars the OED Director from pursuing discipline based on the conduct set forth in the diversion agreement.


(d) A material breach of the diversion agreement shall be cause for termination of the practitioner's participation in the diversion program. Upon a material breach of the diversion agreement, the OED Director may pursue discipline based on the conduct set forth in the diversion agreement.
