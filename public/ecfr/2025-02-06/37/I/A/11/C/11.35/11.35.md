(2) By mailing a copy of the complaint by Priority Mail Express®, first-class mail, or any delivery service that provides confirmation of delivery or attempted delivery to:


(i) A respondent who is a registered practitioner at the address provided to OED pursuant to § 11.11, or


(ii) A respondent who is not registered at the last address for the respondent known to the OED Director.
