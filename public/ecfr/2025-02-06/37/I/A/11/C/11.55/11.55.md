(o) Motions shall be served on the opposing party and filed with the USPTO Director. Each motion shall be accompanied by a written memorandum setting forth a concise statement of the facts and supporting reasons, along with a citation of the authorities upon which the movant relies. Unless extended by the USPTO Director for good cause, within 21 days of the date of service of the motion, an opposing party shall serve and file a response to the motion, and the moving party may file a reply within 14 days after service of the opposing party's responsive memorandum.

(p) The USPTO Director may extend the time for filing a brief upon the granting of a motion setting forth good cause warranting the extension.
