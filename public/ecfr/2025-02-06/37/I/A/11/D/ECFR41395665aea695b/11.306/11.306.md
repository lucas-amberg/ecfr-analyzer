(1) The claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited by law, the identity of the persons involved;


(2) Information contained in a public record;


(3) That an investigation of a matter is in progress;


(4) The scheduling or result of any step in litigation;


(5) A request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary thereto; and
