# ยง 11.107   Conflict of interest; Current clients.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a practitioner shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:


(1) The representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or


(2) There is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the practitioner's responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the practitioner.


(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a) of this section, a practitioner may represent a client if:


(1) The practitioner reasonably believes that the practitioner will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;


(2) The representation is not prohibited by law;


(3) The representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the practitioner in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and


(4) Each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.
