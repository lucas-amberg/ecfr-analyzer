# ยง 11.118   Duties to prospective client.

(a) A person who consults with a practitioner about the possibility of forming a client-practitioner relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.


(b) Even when no client-practitioner relationship ensues, a practitioner who has learned information from a prospective client shall not use or reveal that information, except as ยง 11.109 would permit with respect to information of a former client.


(c) A practitioner subject to paragraph (b) of this section shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the practitioner received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If a practitioner is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, no practitioner in a firm with which that practitioner is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.


(d) When the practitioner has received disqualifying information as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, representation is permissible if:


(1) Both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in writing; or


(2) The practitioner who received the information took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying information than was reasonably necessary to determine whether to represent the prospective client; and


(i) The disqualified practitioner is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and


(ii) Written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.
