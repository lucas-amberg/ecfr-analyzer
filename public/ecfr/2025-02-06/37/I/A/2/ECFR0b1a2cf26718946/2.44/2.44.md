(D) A verified statement alleging:


That the applicant believes the applicant is the owner of the mark; that the mark is in use in commerce; that the applicant is exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; that to the best of the signatory's knowledge and belief, no other persons except members have the right to use the mark in commerce, either in the identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods, services, or collective membership organization of such other persons to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive; that the specimen shows the mark as used in commerce by the applicant's members; and that the facts set forth in the application are true.


(ii) *Intent-to-use under section 1(b) of the Act.* The requirement for an application based on section 1(b) of the Act is a verified statement alleging:


That the applicant has a bona fide intention, and is entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; that to the best of the signatory's knowledge and belief, no other persons, except members, have the right to use the mark in commerce, either in the identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods, services, or collective membership organization of such other persons, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive; and that the facts set forth in the application are true.


(iii) *Registration of a mark in a foreign applicant's country of origin under section 44(e) of the Act.* The requirements for an application under section 44(e) of the Act are:

(b) *Verification not filed within reasonable time or omitted.* (1) If the verified statement in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(D), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(4)(iii)(B), or (a)(4)(iv)(B) of this section is not filed within a reasonable time after it is signed, the Office may require the applicant to submit a substitute verified statement attesting that, as of the application filing date, the mark was in use in commerce and the applicant was exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; or, as of the application filing date, the applicant had a bona fide intention, and was entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; or


(2) If the verified statement in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(D), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(4)(iii)(B), (a)(4)(iv)(B), or (a)(4)(v) of this section is not filed with the initial application, the verified statement must also allege that, as of the application filing date, the mark was in use in commerce and the applicant was exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; or, as of the application filing date, the applicant had a bona fide intention, and was entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce.


(c) *More than one basis.* In an application under section 1 or 44 of the Act, an applicant may claim more than one basis, provided the applicant satisfies all requirements for the bases claimed. In such case, the applicant must specify each basis, followed by the goods, services, or collective membership organization to which that basis applies. An applicant must specify the goods, services, or collective membership organization covered by more than one basis. Section 1(a) and 1(b) of the Act may not both be claimed for identical goods, or services, or the same collective membership organization in one application. A basis under section 66(a) of the Act may not be combined with another basis.


(d) *In an application for concurrent use under § 2.42,* the verified statement in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(D) of this section must be modified to indicate that no other persons except members and the concurrent users as specified in the application have the right to use the mark in commerce.
