(e) *Multiple-class applications.* For the requirements of a multiple-class application, see § 2.86.


(f) *Restriction on certification mark application.* A single application may not include a certification mark and another type of mark. The same mark for the same goods or services is not registrable as both a certification mark and another type of mark. See sections 4 and 14(5)(B) of the Act.
