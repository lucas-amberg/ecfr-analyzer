Additional fees may be submitted if the requirements of § 2.164 are met. If the additional fee(s) is not submitted within the time period set out in the Office action, and the class(es) to which the original fee(s) should be applied is not specified, the Office will presume that the fee(s) covers the classes in ascending order, beginning with the lowest numbered class;

(6)(i) State that the registered mark is in use in commerce; or

(7) Include one specimen showing how the mark is in use in commerce for each class in the registration, unless excusable nonuse is claimed under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. When requested by the Office, additional specimens must be provided. The specimen must meet the requirements of § 2.56.

(c) *Fee for deletions of goods, services, and/or classes from a registration.* Deletions by the owner of goods, services, and/or classes from a registration after submission and prior to acceptance of the affidavit or declaration must be accompanied by the relevant fee in § 2.6(a)(12)(iii) or (iv).
