# ยง 4.5   Notice by publication.

If the copy of the complaint that is mailed to the invention promoter is returned undelivered, then the USPTO will primarily publish a Notice of Complaint Received on the USPTO's Internet home page at *http://www.uspto.gov.* Only where the USPTO's Web site is unavailable for publication will the USPTO publish the Notice of Complaint in the *Official Gazette* and/or the _Federal Register._ The invention promoter will be given 30 days from such notice to submit a reply to the Notice of Complaint. If the USPTO does not receive a reply from the invention promoter within 30 days, the complaint alone will become publicly available.
