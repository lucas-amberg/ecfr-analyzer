(2) Include a verified statement attesting to the use in commerce or excusable nonuse of the mark within the period set forth in section 71 of the Act. The verified statement must be executed on or after the beginning of the filing period specified in § 7.36(b). A person who is properly authorized to sign on behalf of the holder is:

(ii) A person with firsthand knowledge of the facts and actual or implied authority to act on behalf of the holder; or

Additional fees may be submitted if the requirements of § 7.39 are met. If the additional fee(s) is not submitted within the time period set out in the Office action, and the class(es) to which the original fee(s) should be applied is not specified, the Office will presume that the fee(s) covers the classes in ascending order, beginning with the lowest numbered class;

(6)(i) State that the registered mark is in use in commerce; or


(ii) If the registered mark is not in use in commerce on or in connection with all the goods, services, or classes specified in the registration, set forth the date when such use of the mark in commerce stopped and the approximate date when such use is expected to resume, and recite facts to show that nonuse as to those goods, services, or classes is due to special circumstances that excuse the nonuse and is not due to an intention to abandon the mark; and


(7) Include one specimen showing how the mark is in use in commerce for each class in the registration, unless excusable nonuse is claimed under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. When requested by the Office, additional specimens must be provided. The specimen must meet the requirements of § 2.56 of this chapter.
