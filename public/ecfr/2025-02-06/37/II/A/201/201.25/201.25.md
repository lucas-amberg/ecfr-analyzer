# § 201.25   Visual Arts Registry.

(a) *General.* This section prescribes the procedures relating to the submission of Visual Arts Registry Statements by visual artists and owners of buildings, or their duly authorized representatives, for recordation in the Copyright Office under section 113(d)(3) of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Public Law 101-650, effective June 1, 1991. Statements recorded in the Copyright Office under this regulation will establish a public record of information relevant to an artist's integrity right to prevent destruction or injury to works of visual art incorporated in or made part of a building.


(b) *Forms.* The Copyright Office does not provide forms for the use of persons recording statements regarding works of visual art that have been incorporated in or made part of a building.


(c) *Recordable statements*—(1) *General.* Any statement designated as a “Visual Arts Registry Statement” and which pertains to a work of visual art that has been incorporated in or made part of a building may be recorded in the Copyright Office provided the statement is accompanied by the fee for recordation of documents specified in section 708(a)(4) of title 17 of the United States Code. Upon their submission, the statements and an accompanying documentation or photographs become the property of the United States Government and will not be returned. Photocopies are acceptable if they are clear and legible. Information contained in the Visual Arts Registry Statement should be as complete as possible since the information may affect the enforceability of valuable rights under the copyright law. Visual Arts Registry Statements which are illegible or fall outside of the scope of section 113(d)(3) of title 17 may be refused recordation by the Copyright Office.


(2) *Statements by artists.* Statements by artists regarding a work of visual art incorporated or made part of a building should be filed in a document containing the head: “Registry of Visual Art Incorporated in a Building—Artist's Statement.” The statement should contain the following information:


(i) Identification of the artist, including name, current address, age, and telephone number, if publicly listed.


(ii) Identification of the work or works, including the title, dimensions, and physical description of the work and the copyright registration number, if known. Additionally, it is recommended that one or more 8 × 10 photographs of the work on good quality photographic paper be included in the submission; the images should be clear and in focus.


(iii) Identification of the building, including its name and address. This identification may additionally include 8 × 10 photographs of the building and the location of the artist's work in the building.


(iv) Identification of the owner of the building, if known.


(3) *Statements by the owner of the building.* Statements of owners of a building which incorporates a work of visual art should be filed in a document containing the heading: “Registry of Visual Art Incorporated in a Building—Building Owner's Statement.” The statement should contain the following information:


(i) Identification of the ownership of the building, the name of a person who represents the owner, and a telephone number, if publicly listed.


(ii) Identification of the building, including the building's name and address. This identification may additionally include 8 × 10 photographs of the building and of the works of visual art which are incorporated in the building.


(iii) Identification of the work or works of visual art incorporated in the building, including the works' title(s), if known, and the dimensions and physical description of the work(s). This identification may include one or more 8 × 10 photographs of the work(s) on high quality photographic paper; the images should be clear and in focus.


(iv) Identification of the artist(s) who have works incorporated in the building, including the current address of each artist, if known.


(v) Photocopy of contracts, if any, between the artist and owners of the building regarding the rights of attribution and integrity.


(vi) Statement as to the measures taken by the owner to notify the artist(s) of the removal or pending removal of the work of visual art, and photocopies of any accompanying documents.


(4) *Updating statements.* Either the artist or owner of the building or both may record statements updating previously recorded information by submitting an updated statement and paying the recording fee specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Such statements should repeat the information disclosed in the previous filing as regarding the name of the artist(s), the name of the work(s) of visual art, the name and address of the building, and the name of the owner(s) of the building. The remaining portion of the statement should correct or supplement the information disclosed in the previously recorded statement.


(d) *Fee.* The fee for recording a Visual Arts Registry Statement, a Building Owner's Statement, or an updating statement is the recordation fee for a document, as prescribed in § 201.3(c).


(e) *Date of recordation.* The date of recordation is the date when all of the elements required for recordation, including the prescribed fee have been received in the Copyright Office. After recordation of the statement, the sender will receive a certificate of recordation from the Copyright Office. Any documentation or photographs accompanying any submission will be retained and filed by the Copyright Office. They may also be transferred to the Library of Congress, or destroyed after preparing suitable copies, in accordance with usual procedures.


(f) *Effect of recordation.* The Copyright Office will record statements in the Visual Arts Registry without examination or verification of the accuracy or completeness of the statement, if the statement is designated as a “Visual Arts Registry Statement” and pertains to a work of visual art incorporated in or made part of a building. Recordation of the statement and payment of the recording fee shall establish only the fact of recordation in the official record. Acceptance for recordation shall not be considered a determination that the statement is accurate, complete, and otherwise in compliance with section 113(d), title 17, U.S. Code. The accuracy and completeness of the statement is the responsibility of the artist or building owner who submits it for recordation. Artists and building owners are encouraged to submit accurate and complete statements. Omission of any information, however, shall not itself invalidate the recordation, unless a court of competent jurisdiction finds the statement is materially deficient and fails to meet the minimum requirements of section 113(d) of title 17, U.S. Code.
