# ยง 222.13   Consolidation.

(a) *Consolidation.* Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if a claimant has multiple *active proceedings* against the same respondent or multiple active proceedings that arise out of the same facts and circumstances, the Board may consolidate the proceedings for purposes of conducting discovery, submitting evidence to the Board, or holding hearings. Consolidated proceedings shall remain separate for purposes of Board determinations and any damages awards.




(b) *Timing.* The Board may consolidate proceedings at any time upon its own authority or following consideration of a request by any party, with reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard provided to all affected parties.


(c) *Procedure.* The party seeking consolidation must submit a request to the Board setting forth the reasons for the request, requesting a conference with the Board and the parties from each affected case, and providing the Board with the docket numbers for each affected proceeding. Requests for consolidation and any responses thereto shall follow the procedures set forth in ยง 220.5(a)(2) of this subchapter.


(d) *Standard for granting request.* In determining whether to grant a request to consolidate, the Board shall balance the need for and benefits of consolidation with the timeliness of the request and whether any undue prejudice has resulted from the delay in making the request.


(e) *Smaller claims proceedings.* Where the Board becomes aware that a standard proceeding and a smaller claims proceeding involve the same or substantially similar parties and arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, one or more Officers may hold a conference to determine whether the parties are willing to voluntarily consolidate the separate proceedings into a single proceeding using either the smaller claims procedures or the standard Board procedures. The Board will consolidate proceedings only where the parties agree, doing so would be in the interests of justice, and the proceedings involve the same or substantially similar parties and arise out of the same transaction or occurrence. If the proceedings involve the same or substantially similar parties and arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, but the parties do not agree to voluntarily consolidate the separate proceedings into a single proceeding, then each proceeding shall be considered separately.
