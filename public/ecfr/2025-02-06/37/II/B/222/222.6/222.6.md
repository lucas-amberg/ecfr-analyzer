# § 222.6   Designated service agents.

(a) *In general.* A corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association that is entitled under 17 U.S.C. 1506(g)(5)(B) to designate a service agent to receive notice of a claim may designate such an agent by submitting the designation electronically through the Board's designated service agent directory, which shall be available on the Board's website.


(b) *Designation fee.* A service agent designation shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in 37 CFR 201.3.


(c) *Trade names and affiliated entities*—(1) *Trade names.* Each corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association that submits a service agent designation may include up to 50 trade names that function as alternate business names (*i.e.,* “doing business as” or “d/b/a” names) under which such registered corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association is doing business.


(2) *Affiliated entities.* Affiliated corporations, partnerships, or unincorporated associations that are separate legal entities but are under direct or indirect common control (*e.g.,* parent and subsidiary companies) of the filing corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association may also be included in the same service agent designation, but only if all of the information required in paragraph (d)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v) through (vii) of this section is the same for the filing corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association and the affiliated corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association. Otherwise, those separate legal entities must file separate service agent designations, although a submitter may designate the same service agent for multiple corporations, partnerships, or unincorporated associations.


(d) *Content of submission*—(1) *In general.* The designated service agent submission shall include:


(i) The legal name, business address, email address, and telephone number of the corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association;


(ii) The state in which the principal place of business of the corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association is located;


(iii) For corporations, the state or territory (including the District of Columbia) of incorporation;


(iv) Up to 50 additional names, consisting of either the names of affiliated entities or trade names, or both, as described in paragraph (c) of this section;


(v) The name, business address (or, if the agent does not have a business address, the address of the residence of such agent), email address, and telephone number of the designated service agent;


(vi) The submitter's name, email address, and telephone number; and


(vii) The corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association's service method election, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.


(2) *Certification.* To complete the designation, the person submitting the designation shall certify, under penalty of perjury, that the submitter is authorized by law to make the designation on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association, including any other affiliated entities for which the filing is made.


(e) *Service on designated agents.* A corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association that designates a service agent shall, as a condition of designating a service agent, consent to receive service upon the agent by means of certified or priority mail at the identified mailing address. It may also indicate in its designation that it consents to receive service by email at the identified email address.


(1) *Service by mail.* The corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association shall identify the service agent's place of business or, if there is no place of business, the address of the service agent's residence for purposes of service by mail. The service agent's place of business or address of the service agent's residence must be located within the United States.


(2) *Service by email.* (i) If a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association indicates that it consents to receive service by email, the designated service agent's email address shall be displayed on the designated service agent directory.


(ii) In cases where the designation states that service may be made by email, the person submitting the designation shall affirm under penalty of perjury that the corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association for which the agent has been designated waives the right to personal service by means other than email and that the person making the designation has been authorized to waive that right on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association and any other affiliated entity for which the filing is made for Board proceedings.


(f) *Amendments.* A corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association shall have a duty to maintain current information in the directory. A corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association may amend a designation of a service agent by following directions on the Board's website. Such amendment shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in 37 CFR 201.3. The requirements found in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply to the service agent designation amendment. If current information is not timely maintained and, as a result, the identification or address of the service agent in the directory is no longer accurate, the Board may, in its discretion and subject to any reasonable conditions that the Board may decide to impose, determine whether service upon that agent or at that address was effective.


(g) *Public directory*—(1) *In general.* After a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association submits a service agent designation, such designation shall be made available on the public designated service agent directory after payment has been remitted and the Board has reviewed the submission to determine whether the submission qualifies for the designated agent provision.


(2) *Removal from directory.* If the Board determines that a submitted service agent designation does not qualify under this section or if it has reason to believe that the submitter was not authorized by law to make the designation on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association, it shall notify the submitter that it intends not to add the record to the directory, or that it intends to remove the record from the directory, and shall provide the submitter 10 calendar days to respond. If the submitter fails to respond, or if, after reviewing the response, the Board determines that the submission does not qualify for the designated service agent directory, the entity shall not be added to, or shall be removed from, the directory.


(3) *Content of public listing.* The designation shall be indexed under the names of each corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association for which an agent has been designated and shall be made available on the Board's website. The email address and telephone number of the corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association provided under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shall not be made publicly available on the designated service agent directory website, but such information shall be made available to Board staff.


(4) *Designation date.* A designation filed in accordance with this section before April 7, 2022 will become effective on that date.
