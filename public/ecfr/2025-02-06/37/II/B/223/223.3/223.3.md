# § 223.3   Class action opt-out procedures.

(a) *Opt-out or dismissal procedures.* Any party to an active proceeding before the Copyright Claims Board (“Board”) who receives notice of a pending or putative class action, arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as the proceeding before the Board, in which the party is a class member, shall either opt out of the class action or seek written dismissal of the proceeding before Board within 14 days of receiving notice of the pending class action. If a party seeks written dismissal of the proceeding before the Board, upon notice to all claimants and counterclaimants, the Board shall dismiss the proceeding without prejudice.


(b) *Filing requirement.* A copy of the notice indicating a party's intent to opt out of a class action proceeding must be filed with the Board within 14 days after the filing of the notice with the court.


(c) *Timing.* The time periods provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be extended by the Board for good cause shown.


(d) *Failure to notify Board.* If a party fails to make a timely election under paragraph (a) of this section, the Board is authorized to take corrective action as it deems necessary, which may include dismissal of a pending claim before the Board with or without prejudice, notifying the class action court of any final determination by the Board, or vacating a final determination of the Board. The Board may, in its discretion, direct a party to show cause why action under paragraph (a) of this section was not taken.
