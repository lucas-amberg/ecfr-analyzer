# § 224.1   Compliance review.

(a) *Compliance review by Copyright Claims Attorney.* Upon the filing of a claim or counterclaim with the Copyright Claims Board (Board), a Copyright Claims Attorney shall review the claim for compliance with 17 U.S.C. chapter 15 and this subchapter, as provided in this section.


(b) *Substance of compliance review.* The Copyright Claims Attorney shall review the claim or counterclaim for compliance with all legal and formal requirements for a claim or counterclaim before the Board, including:


(1) The provisions set forth under this subchapter;


(2) The requirements set forth in 17 U.S.C. 1504(c), (d), and (e)(1); and


(3) Whether the allegations in the claim or the counterclaim clearly do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.


(c) *Issuing finding.* Upon completing a compliance review, the Copyright Claims Attorney shall notify the party that submitted the document in accordance with 37 CFR 222.5 and 17 U.S.C. 1506(f) by—


(1) Informing the claimant or counterclaimant that the claim or counterclaim has been found to comply with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and instructing the claimant to proceed with service under 37 CFR 222.5 and 17 U.S.C. 1506(g); or


(2) Informing the claimant or counterclaimant that the claim or counterclaim, respectively, does not comply with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and identifying the noncompliant issue(s) according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.C. 1506(f).


(d) *Dismissal without prejudice.* If the original claim and an amended claim were previously reviewed by the Copyright Claims Attorney and were found not to comply with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and if the Copyright Claims Attorney concludes, following the submission of a second amended claim, that the claim still does not comply with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the claim shall be referred to a Copyright Claims Officer who shall confirm whether the second amended claim complies with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. If the Copyright Claims Officer concurs with the conclusion of the Copyright Claims Attorney, the proceeding shall be dismissed without prejudice.


(e) *Clearance is not endorsement.* The finding that a claim or counterclaim complies with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements does not constitute a determination as to the validity of the allegations asserted or other statements made in the claim or counterclaim.


(f) *No factual investigations.* For the purpose of the compliance review, the Copyright Claims Attorney shall accept the facts stated in the claim or counterclaim materials, unless they are clearly contradicted by information provided elsewhere in the materials or in the Board's records. The Copyright Claims Attorney shall not conduct an investigation or make findings of fact; however, the Copyright Claims Attorney may take administrative notice of facts or matters that are well known to the general public, and may use that knowledge during review of the claim or counterclaim.
