Once the claimant has served the *initial notice* on any respondent, the claimant may not amend its choice without consent of the other parties and leave of the Board. A claimant's request to change its choice as to whether to have its claim considered under the smaller claims procedures or the standard Board procedures shall follow the procedures set forth in ยง 220.5(a)(1) of this subchapter. If the request is made following service of the *initial notice* on any respondent, the claimant's request shall indicate whether the other parties consent to the request.
