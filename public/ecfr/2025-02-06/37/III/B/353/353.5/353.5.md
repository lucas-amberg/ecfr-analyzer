# ยง 353.5   Participation not required.

In any case in which a response to a rehearing motion is allowed, or rehearing is granted, an opposing party shall not be required to participate in the rehearing. The Copyright Royalty Judges will not draw any negative inference from a lack of participation in a rehearing.
