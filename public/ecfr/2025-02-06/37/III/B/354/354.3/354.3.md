# § 354.3   Register of Copyrights' authority to redesignate referrals.

If, during the 14-day period of a discretionary referral of a material question of law under § 354.1, the Register of Copyrights determines that the question is a “novel” one within the meaning of § 354.2(a), the Register may notify the Copyright Royalty Judges of that determination. The Copyright Royalty Judges will be bound by such a determination by the Register of Copyrights and will regard the Register's decision as timely delivered if it is received within the 30-day period applicable to novel question referrals.
