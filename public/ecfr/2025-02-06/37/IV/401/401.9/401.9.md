# § 401.9   Contractor and contractor employee inventor requests for rights in inventions.

(a) Agencies shall allow a contractor to request greater rights in an invention, including a request to return title to an invention to the contractor, when the funding agreement contains alternate provisions in accordance with § 401.3(a)(2):


(1) The agency shall consider if the circumstances which originally led the agency to invoke an exception under § 401.3(a) are currently valid and applicable to the actual subject invention.


(i) The agency shall provide the contractor the opportunity to submit information on its plans and intentions to bring the subject invention to practical application pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 200.


(ii) The agency shall assess whether government ownership of the invention will better promote the policies and objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200 than the plans and intentions submitted by the contractor.


(iii) The agency shall consider whether to allow the standard clause at § 401.14 to apply with additional conditions imposed upon the contractor's use of the invention for specific uses or applications, or with expanded government license rights in such uses or applications.


(2) The agency shall reply to the contractor with its determination within 90 days after receiving a request and any supporting information from the contractor. If a bar to patenting is sooner than 90 days from receipt of a request, the agency may either file a patent application on the subject invention or authorize the contractor to file a patent application at its own risk and expense.


(3) The Department of Energy is authorized to process deferred determinations either in accordance with its waiver regulations or this section.


(b) Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 202(d), a contractor is required to obtain approval from a funding Agency before assigning rights to a subject invention made under a funding agreement to an employee/inventor. When an employee/inventor retains rights to a subject invention made under a funding agreement, either the Agency or the contractor must ensure compliance by the employee/inventor with at least those conditions that would apply under paragraphs (b), (d), (f)(4), (h), (i), and (j) of the clause at § 401.14.
