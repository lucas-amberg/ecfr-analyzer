# ยง 404.1   Scope of part.

(a) This part prescribes the terms, conditions, and procedures upon which a federally owned invention, other than an invention in the custody of the Tennessee Valley Authority, may be licensed. This part does not affect licenses which:


(1) Were in effect prior to April 7, 2006;


(2) May exist at the time of the Government's acquisition of title to the invention, including those resulting from the allocation of rights to inventions made under Government research and development contracts;


(3) Are the result of an authorized exchange of rights in the settlement of patent disputes, including interferences; or


(4) Are otherwise authorized by law or treaty, including 35 U.S.C. 202(e), 35 U.S.C. 207(a)(3) and 15 U.S.C. 3710a, which also may authorize the assignment of inventions. Although licenses on inventions made under a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) are not subject to this regulation, agencies are encouraged to apply the same policies and use similar terms when appropriate. Similarly, this should be done for licenses granted under inventions where the agency has acquired rights pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 207(a)(3).


(b) Royalties collected pursuant to this part, and used in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 3710c(a)(1)(B), are not intended as an alternative to appropriated funding or as an alternative funding mechanism.
