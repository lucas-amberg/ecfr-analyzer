(2) Whether the official had received explicit instructions to continue or cease incurring obligations;


(3) Whether any action was taken in contravention of or with disregard for, instructions to monitor obligations incurred;


(4) Whether the official had the authority to curtail obligations by directing a change in the manner of operations of the department or staff office; or


(5) Any other facts which tend to fix the responsibility for the obligations which resulted in the allotment or apportionment being exceeded.
