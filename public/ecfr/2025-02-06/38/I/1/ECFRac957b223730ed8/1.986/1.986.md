# § 1.986   Result if employee fails to meet deadlines.

An employee waives the right to a hearing, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with the offset schedule, if the employee: 


(a) Fails to file a request for a hearing as prescribed in § 1.982, § 1.984, or §§ 19.1 through 19.200, whichever is applicable, unless such failure is excused as provided in § 1.984(b); or 


(b) Fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she had been notified unless the administrative law judge or hearing official determines that failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.
