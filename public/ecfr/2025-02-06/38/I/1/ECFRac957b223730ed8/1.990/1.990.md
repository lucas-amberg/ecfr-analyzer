# ยง 1.990   Written agreement to repay debt as alternative to salary offset.

(a) *Notification by employee.* The employee may propose, in response to a notice under ยง 1.983, a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to do this must submit a proposed written agreement to repay the debt which is received by the office which sent the notice of the debt within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice. 


(b) *VA response.* In response to timely notice by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, VA will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within VA's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, VA will balance its interest in collecting the debt against the hardship to the employee. VA will accept a repayment agreement instead of offset only if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in extreme hardship.
