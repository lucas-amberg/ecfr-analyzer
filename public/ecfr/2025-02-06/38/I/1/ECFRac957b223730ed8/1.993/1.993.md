# ยง 1.993   Non-waiver of rights.

So long as there are not statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary, an employee's involuntary payment (of all or a portion of a debt) under these regulations will not be interpreted as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514.


VA will refund promptly to the appropriate individual amounts offset under these regulations when: 


(a) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owed the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or 


(b) VA is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.
