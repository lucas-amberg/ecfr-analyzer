# ยง 1.995   Requesting recovery through centralized administrative offset.

(a) Under 31 U.S.C. 3716, VA and other creditor agencies must notify Treasury of all debts over 180 days delinquent so that recovery of such debts may be made by centralized administrative offset. This includes those debts that VA and other agencies seek from the pay account of an employee of another Federal agency via salary offset. Treasury and other disbursing officials will match payments, including Federal salary payments, against these debts. Where a match occurs, and all the requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be offset to satisfy the debt in whole or part.


(b) Prior to submitting a debt to Treasury for the purpose of collection by offset, including salary offset, VA shall provide written certification to Treasury that:


(1) The debt is past due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted to Treasury and that VA will ensure that any subsequent collections are credited to the debt and that Treasury shall be notified of such;


(2) Except in the case of a judgment debt or as otherwise allowed by law, the debt is referred to Treasury for offset within 10 years after VA's right of action accrues;


(3) VA has complied with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 38 CFR 1.912 and 1.912a including, but not limited to, those provisions requiring that VA provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a review of the debt; and


(4) VA has complied with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514 (salary offset) and 38 CFR 1.980 through 1.994 including, but not limited to, those provisions requiring that VA provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a hearing.


(c) Specific procedures for notifying Treasury of debts for purposes of collection by centralized administrative offset are contained in the 31 CFR 285.7. VA and other creditor agencies may notify Treasury of debts that have been delinquent for 180 days or less, including debts that VA and other creditor agencies seek to recover from the pay of an employee via salary offset.
