# § 1.603   Revocation and reconsideration.

(a)(1) VA may revoke access of an attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, affiliated support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter to a particular claimant's records because the principal individual or organization no longer represents the claimant, and, therefore, the claimant's consent is no longer in effect.


(2) VA may revoke access of a previously affiliated attorney or agent to a particular claimant's records because the attorney or agent is no longer affiliated with the principal individual, and, therefore, the claimant's consent is no longer in effect.


(3) VA may revoke access privileges of a previously affiliated support-staff person to all claimants' records because the support-staff person is no longer affiliated with the principal individual or VA-recognized service organization, and, therefore, the claimants' consent is no longer in effect.






(b) VA may revoke the access privileges of an attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, affiliated support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter, either to an individual claimant's records or to all claimants' records via the VA IT systems, if the individual, or, additionally in the case of the affiliated support-staff personnel of an attorney or agent, the principal individual:




(1) Violates any of the provisions of §§ 1.600 through 1.603; 


(2) Accesses or attempts to access data for a purpose other than representation or assistance in the representation of an individual claimant;


(3) Accesses or attempts to access data of a claimant whom he, she, or the VA-recognized service organization neither represents nor is authorized to assist in representing;




(4) Accesses or attempts to access a VA IT system by a method that has not been approved by VA; or




(5) Modifies or attempts to modify data in a VA IT system without authorization.






(c)(1) To initiate the process for denial of access under § 1.601(a)(3) or revocation of access under paragraph (b) of this section, VA will notify the attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter of the proposed denial or revocation. If VA is initiating the process to deny or revoke access privileges for a representative of a VA-recognized service organization or any support-staff person, VA will notify the service organization(s) through which the representative is accredited, or the employer of the support-staff person, of the proposal. If VA is initiating the process to revoke access privileges for an attorney or agent based on conduct related to the attorney's or agent's authorized assistance in the representation of one or more claimants, VA will notify the claimants' attorney or agent of record of the revocation proposal. VA's notice will include the procedures applicable to the proposed denial or revocation, including instructions for submitting an optional response and identification of the official making the final decision. VA will allow 30 days for an optional response to the proposal.


(2) After considering any timely-received response, VA will issue a final decision based on a preponderance of the evidence. The decision will describe in detail the facts found and state the reasons for VA's final decision. If VA denies or revokes access privileges for a representative of a VA-recognized service organization or any support-staff person, VA will notify the service organization(s) through which the representative is accredited, or the employer of the support-staff person, of the denial or revocation of access. If VA revokes access privileges for an attorney or agent based on conduct related to the attorney's or agent's authorized assistance in the representation of one or more claimants, VA will notify the claimants' attorney or agent of record of the revocation of access.


(3) The attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter may request reconsideration of a denial or revocation of access by submitting a written request to VA. VA will consider the request if it is received by VA not later than 30 days after the date that VA notified the attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter of its decision.


(4) The attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter may submit additional information not previously considered by VA, provided that the additional information is submitted with the written request and is pertinent to the prohibition of access.


(5) VA will close the record regarding reconsideration at the end of the 30-day period described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and furnish the request, including any new information submitted by the attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter to the Director of the VA regional office or center with jurisdiction over the final decision.


(6) VA will reconsider access based upon a review of the information of record as of the date of its prior denial or revocation, with any new information submitted with the request. The decision will:


(i) Identify the attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter,


(ii) Identify the date of VA's prior decision,


(iii) Describe in detail the facts found as a result of VA's review of its decision with any new information submitted with the reconsideration request, and


(iv) State the reasons for VA's final decision, which may affirm, modify, or overturn its prior decision.


(7) VA will provide notice of its final decision on access to:


(i) The attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter requesting reconsideration, and


(ii) if the conduct that resulted in denial or revocation of the authority of an attorney, agent, representative of a VA-recognized service organization, support-staff person, or individual authorized by the General Counsel under § 14.630 of this chapter to access VA IT systems merits potential inquiry into the individual's conduct or competence, or in the case of an affiliated support-staff person of an attorney or agent, the principal individual's conduct or competence, pursuant to § 14.633 of this chapter, the VA regional office or center of jurisdiction will immediately inform VA's Office of General Counsel in writing of the fact that it has denied or revoked the individual's access privileges and provide the reasons why.


(d) VA may immediately suspend access privileges prior to any determination on the merits of a proposed revocation where VA determines that such immediate suspension is necessary to protect, from a reasonably foreseeable compromise, the integrity of the system or confidentiality of the data in VA IT systems. However, in such case, VA shall offer the individual an opportunity to respond to the charges that led to the immediate suspension and the proposed revocation after the temporary suspension.
