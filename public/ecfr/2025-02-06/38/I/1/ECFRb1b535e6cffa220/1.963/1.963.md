# ยง 1.963   Waiver; other than loan guaranty.

(a) *General.* Recovery of overpayments of any benefits made under laws administered by the VA shall be waived if there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the person or persons having an interest in obtaining the waiver and recovery of the indebtedness from the payee who received such benefits would be against equity and good conscience.


(b) *Application.* A request for waiver of an indebtedness under this section shall only be considered:


(1) If made within 2 years following the date of a notice of indebtedness issued on or before March 31, 1983, by the Department of Veterans Affairs to the debtor, or 


(2) Except as otherwise provided herein, if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness issued on or after April 1, 1983, by the Department of Veterans Affairs to the debtor. The 180 day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrated to the Chairperson of the Committee on Waivers and Compromises that, as a result of an error by either the Department of Veterans Affairs or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing (including forwarding). If the requester does substantiate that there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the Chairperson shall direct that the 180 day period be computed from the date of the requester's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness.
