# ยง 1.910   Aggressive collection action.

(a) VA will take aggressive collection action on a timely basis, with effective follow-up, to collect all claims for money or property arising from its activities.


(b) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and the procedures set forth at 31 CFR 285.12, VA shall transfer to Treasury any non-tax debt or claim that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so that Treasury may take appropriate action to collect the debt or terminate collection action. This requirement does not apply to any debt that:


(1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;


(2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;


(3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary of the Treasury;


(4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary of the Treasury;


(5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within 3 years after the debt first became delinquent; or
