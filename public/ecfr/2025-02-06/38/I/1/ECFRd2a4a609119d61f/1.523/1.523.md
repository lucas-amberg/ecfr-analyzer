When a request is received in a Department of Veterans Affairs regional office, center, or medical center from the commanding officer of a State soldiers' home for information other than information relative to the character of the discharge from a Department of Veterans Affairs center or medical center concerning a veteran formerly domiciled or hospitalized therein, the provisions of ยง 1.500 are applicable, and no disclosure will be made unless the request is accompanied by the authorization outlined in ยง 1.503.
