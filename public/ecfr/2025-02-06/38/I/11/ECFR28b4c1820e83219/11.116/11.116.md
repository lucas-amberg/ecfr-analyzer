# ยง 11.116   Death of veteran before final settlement.

If the veteran dies after making application under the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, 1936, but before it is filed, it may be filed by any person and will be considered valid if found to bear the bona-fide signature of the applicant, discloses an intention to claim benefits under the Act, and is filed before the maturity of the certificate and before payment is made to the beneficiary. An application made by the veteran or his legal representative shall evidence his intention to claim the benefits of this Act; no other evidence shall be acceptable.

(b) If the veteran dies without filing a valid application under this Act, no payment under this Act shall be made. In such case, payment of the certificate will be made under the World War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended, in accordance with ยง 11.128; however, in making any settlement there shall be deducted from the face value of the certificate the amount of any outstanding loans and so much of the unpaid interest as accrued prior to October 1, 1931.
