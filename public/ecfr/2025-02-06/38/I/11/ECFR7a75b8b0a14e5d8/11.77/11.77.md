# ยง 11.77   By whom loans may be made.

Any national bank or any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of any State, Territory, possession, or the District of Columbia, hereinafter referred to as any *bank,* is authorized to loan to any veteran upon his promissory note secured by his Adjusted Service Certificate any amount not in excess of the loan value of the certificate at the date the loan is made. Each certificate contains on its face a table for determining the loan value of the certificate, but it is provided by amendment to the World War Adjusted Compensation Act dated February 27, 1931, that the loan value of any certificate shall at no time be less than 50 percent of the face value. Upon the making of such loan, the lending bank shall promptly notify the Department of Veterans Affairs of the name of the veteran, the A-number shown immediately after the name, the number of the certificate, the amount, the rate of interest, and date of loan: However, this requirement may be waived by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
