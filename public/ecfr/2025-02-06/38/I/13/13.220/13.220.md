# ยง 13.220   Fiduciary fees.

(a) *Authority.* The Hub Manager with jurisdiction over a fiduciary appointment may determine whether a fee is necessary to obtain the services of a fiduciary. A fee is necessary only if no other person or entity is qualified and willing to serve without a fee and the beneficiary's interests would be served by the appointment of a qualified paid fiduciary. The Hub Manager will not authorize a fee if the fiduciary:


(1) Is a spouse, dependent, or other relative of the beneficiary; or


(2) Will receive any other form of payment in connection with providing fiduciary services for the beneficiary.


(b) *Limitation on fees.* The Hub Manager will authorize a fiduciary to whom a fee is payable under paragraph (a) of this section to deduct from the beneficiary's account a reasonable monthly fee for fiduciary services rendered.


(1) For purposes of this section, *reasonable monthly fee* means a monetary amount that is authorized by the Hub Manager and does not exceed 4 percent of the monthly VA benefit paid to the fiduciary on behalf of the beneficiary for a month in which the fiduciary is eligible under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to collect a fee.


(2) A monthly fee may be collected for any month during which the fiduciary:


(i) Provides fiduciary services on behalf of the beneficiary,


(ii) Receives a recurring VA benefit payment for the beneficiary, and


(iii) Is authorized by the Hub Manager to receive a fee for fiduciary services.


(3) Fees may not be computed based upon:


(i) Any one-time, retroactive, or lump-sum payment made to the fiduciary on behalf of the beneficiary;


(ii) Any funds conserved by the fiduciary for the beneficiary in the beneficiary's account under ยง 13.200 or invested by the fiduciary for the beneficiary under ยง 13.210, to include any interest income and return on investment derived from any account; or


(iii) Any funds transferred to the fiduciary by a prior fiduciary for the beneficiary, or from the personal funds of patients or any other source.


(4) The Hub Manager will not authorize a fee for any month for which:


(i) VA or a court with jurisdiction determines that the fiduciary misused or misappropriated benefits, or


(ii) The beneficiary does not receive a VA benefit payment. However, the Hub Manager may authorize a fee for a month in which the beneficiary did not receive a benefit payment if VA later issues benefits for that month and the fiduciary:


(A) Receives VA approval to collect a fee for the month for which payment was made,


(B) Provided fiduciary services during the month for which payment was made, and


(C) Was the beneficiary's fiduciary when VA made the retroactive payment.
