# ยง 14.504   Domestic relations questions, authority and exceptions.

(a) Regional Counsels have the same authority with respect to domestic relations questions as they do with respect to matters covered by ยง 14.503 except as specifically excluded by the provisions of paragraph (a) of that section.


(b) In the following instances the Regional Counsel, regardless of whether State law is wholly controlling or a Department of Veterans Affairs precedent is available, will prepare a tentative opinion, researched as completely as possible with reasonably available facilities, and forward two copies thereof directly to the General Counsel for review and disposition (as provided in ยง 14.503 respecting other than domestic relations matters):


(1) Where it is not clear under applicable State law: (i) Whether the marriage of a veteran's child or the remarriage of a veteran's widow was void without decree of annulment, or (ii) whether an annulment decree was rendered by a court with basic authority to render annulment decrees;


(2) When fraud or collusion by either party appears to have influenced the granting of an annulment decree;


(3) Cases in which there are contesting claims;


(4) Unusual situations, such as those involving proxy marriages, the law of two or more jurisdictions or of a foreign country;


(5) Cases involving difference of opinion between Regional Counsels or between a Regional Counsel and the official who submitted the question involved.
