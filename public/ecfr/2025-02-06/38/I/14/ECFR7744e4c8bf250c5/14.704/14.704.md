# ยง 14.704   Authorization of transportation necessary for commitment of a veteran beneficiary.

When a mentally ill veteran who should be committed is hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs and under the law of the State wherein the hospital is located, a commitment may not be had locally, the veteran may be returned temporarily to the jurisdiction of the appropriate court in order that the commitment can be accomplished. If the veteran is in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, the Hospital Director may authorize travel of the veteran and an attendant or attendants, if necessary, upon request of the Regional Counsel. If the veteran is being maintained in a non-Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, the Director of the facility authorizing and paying for the care may authorize such travel upon request of the Regional Counsel.
