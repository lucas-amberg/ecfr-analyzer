# ยง 14.707   Authorization of transportation of a veteran beneficiary for appointment of a fiduciary.

When the appointment of a fiduciary is required for an incompetent veteran hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs and, under the law of the State wherein the hospital is located, the appointment cannot be had locally, the veteran may be returned temporarily to the jurisdiction of the appropriate court in order that the appointment can be accomplished. If the veteran is in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, the Hospital Director, upon request of the Regional Counsel, may authorize travel of the veteran and an attendant or attendants, if necessary. If the veteran is being maintained in a non-Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, the Director of the facility authorizing and paying for the care may authorize such travel upon request of the Regional Counsel.
