# ยง 17.142   Authority to approve sharing agreements, contracts for scarce medical specialist services and contracts for other medical services.

The Under Secretary for Health is delegated authority to enter into

(b) Contracts with schools and colleges of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, podiatry, optometry, and nursing, clinics, and any other group or individual capable of furnishing such services to provide scarce medical specialist services at Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities (including, but not limited to, services of physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, nurses, physicians' assistants, expanded function dental auxiliaries, technicians, and other medical support personnel); and


(c) When a sharing agreement or contract for scarce medical specialist services is not warranted, contracts authorized under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 8153 for medical and ancillary services. The authority under this section generally will be exercised by approval of proposed contracts or agreements negotiated at the health care facility level. Such approval, however, will not be necessary in the case of any purchase order or individual authorization for which authority has been delegated in 48 CFR 801.670-3. All such contracts and agreements will be negotiated pursuant to 48 CFR chapters 1 and 8.
