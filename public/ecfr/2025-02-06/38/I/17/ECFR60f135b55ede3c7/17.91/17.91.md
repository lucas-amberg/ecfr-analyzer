# ยง 17.91   Protection of health-care eligibility.

Any veteran whose entitlement to VA pension is terminated by reason of income from work or training shall, subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, retain for 3 years after the termination, the eligibility for hospital care, nursing home care and medical services (not including dental) which the veteran otherwise would have had if the pension had not been terminated as a result of the veteran's receipt of earnings from activity performed for remuneration or gain by the veteran but only if the veteran's annual income from sources other than such earnings would, taken alone, not result in the termination of the veteran's pension.


(a) A veteran who participates in a vocational training program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 15 is eligible for the one-time 3 year retention of hospital care, nursing home care and medical services benefits at any time that the veteran's pension is terminated by reason of income from the veteran's employment.


(b) A veteran who does not participate in a vocational training program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 15 is eligible for the one-time 3 year retention of hospital care and medical services benefits only if the veteran's pension is terminated by reason of income from the veteran's employment during the period February 1, 1985 through January 31, 1989.
