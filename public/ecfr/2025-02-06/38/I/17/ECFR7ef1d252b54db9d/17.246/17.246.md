# ยง 17.246   Consideration factors for placement of residents.

(a) *General.* When determining in which covered facilities residents will be placed, VA shall consider the clinical need for health care providers in an area, as determined by VA's evaluation of the following factors:


(1) The ratio of veterans to VA providers for a standardized geographic area surrounding a covered facility, including a separate ratio for general practitioners and specialists.


(i) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, standardized geographic area means the county in which the covered facility is located.


(ii) VA may consider either or both of the ratio(s) for general practitioners and specialists, where a higher ratio of veterans to VA providers indicates a higher need for health care providers in an area.


(2) The range of clinical specialties of VA and non-VA providers for a standardized geographic area surrounding a covered facility, where the presence of fewer clinical specialties indicates a higher need for health care providers in an area.


(3) Whether the specialty of a provider is included in the most recent staffing shortage determination by VA under 38 U.S.C. 7412.


(4) Whether the covered facility is in the local community of a VA facility that has been designated by VA as an underserved facility pursuant to criteria developed under section 401 of Public Law 115-182.


(5) Whether the covered facility is located in a community that is designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a health professional shortage area under 42 U.S.C. 254e.


(6) Whether the covered facility is in a rural or remote area, where:


(i) A rural area means an area identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as rural; and


(ii) A remote area means an area within a zip-code designated as a frontier and remote area (FAR) code by the Economic Research Service within the United States Department of Agriculture, based on the most recent decennial census and to include all identified FAR code levels.


(7) Such other criteria as VA considers important in determining those covered facilities that are not adequately serving area veterans. These factors may include but are not limited to:


(i) Proximity of a non-VA covered facility to a VA health care facility, such that residents placed in non-VA covered facilities may also receive training in VA health care facilities.


(ii) Programmatic considerations related to establishing or maintaining a sustainable residency program, such as: whether the stated objectives of a residency program align with VA's workforce needs; the likely or known available educational infrastructure of a new residency program or existing residency program (including the ability to attract and retain qualified teaching faculty); and the ability of the residency program to remain financially sustainable after the cessation of funding that VA may furnish under ยง 17.248.


(b) *Priority in placements.* For the duration in which the PPGMER is administered, no fewer than 100 residents will be placed in covered facilities operated by either the Indian Health Service, an Indian tribe, a tribal organization, or covered facilities located in the same areas as VA facilities designated by VA as underserved pursuant to criteria developed under section 401 of Public Law 115-182.
