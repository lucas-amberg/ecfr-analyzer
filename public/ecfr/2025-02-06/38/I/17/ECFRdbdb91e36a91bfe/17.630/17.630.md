# ยง 17.630   Selection of VIOMPSP participants.

(a) *General.* In deciding which VIOMPSP applications to approve, VA will first consider applications submitted by applicants entering their final year of education or training. Applicants will be evaluated and selected using the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If there are a larger number of equally qualified applicants than there are awards to be made, then VA will first select veterans, and then use a random method as the basis for further selection.


(b) *Selection criteria.* In evaluating and selecting participants, VA will take into consideration those factors determined necessary to assure effective participation in the VIOMPSP. These factors will include, but are not limited to, the following:


(1) Academic performance;


(2) Work/volunteer experience, including prior rehabilitation or health care employment and VA employment;


(3) Faculty and employer recommendations; or


(4) Career goals.


(c) *Notification of approval.* VA will notify the individual in writing that his or her application has been accepted and approved. An individual becomes a participant in the program upon receipt of such approval by VA.


(d) *Duration of VIOMPSP award.* VA will award a VIOMPSP scholarship for a period of time equal to the number of years required to complete a program of study leading to a degree in orientation and mobility, low vision therapy, or vision rehabilitation therapy, or a dual degree. The number of years covered by an individual scholarship award will be based on the number of school years that the participant has yet to complete his or her degree at the time the VIOMPSP scholarship is awarded. Subject to the availability of funds, VA will award the VIOMPSP as follows:


(1) *Full-time scholarship.* A full-time scholarship is awarded for a minimum of 1 school year to a maximum of 4 school years;


(2) *Part-time scholarships.* A part-time scholarship is awarded for a minimum of 1 school year to a maximum of 6 school years.
