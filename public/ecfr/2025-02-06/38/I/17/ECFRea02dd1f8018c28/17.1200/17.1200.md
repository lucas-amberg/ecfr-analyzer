# § 17.1200   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Purpose.* Sections 17.1200 through 17.1230 implement VA's authority under 38 U.S.C. 1720J to provide emergent suicide care.


(b) *Scope.* If an individual is eligible under § 17.1210, VA will provide emergent suicide care under §§ 17.1200 through 17.1230 and not under other regulations in title 38 CFR through which emergent or other care could be provided. Eligibility under § 17.1210, however, does not affect eligibility for other care under chapter 17 of title 38, U.S.C.
