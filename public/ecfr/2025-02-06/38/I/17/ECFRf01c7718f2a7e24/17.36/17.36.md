# § 17.36   Enrollment—provision of hospital and outpatient care to veterans.

(a) *Enrollment requirement for veterans.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in § 17.37, a veteran must be enrolled in the VA healthcare system as a condition for receiving the 'medical benefits package' set forth in § 17.38.


(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a veteran enrolled under this section and who, if required by law to do so, has agreed to make any applicable copayment is eligible for VA hospital and outpatient care as provided in the “medical benefits package” set forth in § 17.38.


(3) A veteran enrolled based on having a disorder associated with exposure to a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War (the period between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998), or any illness associated with service in combat in a war after the Gulf War or during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as provided in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e), is eligible for VA care provided in the “medical benefits package” set forth in § 17.38 for the disorder.


(b) *Categories of veterans eligible to be enrolled.* The Secretary will determine which categories of veterans are eligible to be enrolled based on the following order of priority:


(1) Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 50 percent or greater based on one or more service-connected disabilities or unemployability; and veterans awarded the Medal of Honor.


(2) Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 30 percent or 40 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities.


(3) Veterans who are former prisoners of war; veterans awarded the Purple Heart; veterans with a singular or combined rating of 10 percent or 20 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities; veterans who were discharged or released from active military service for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; veterans who receive disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose entitlement to disability compensation is suspended pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 1151, but only to the extent that such veterans' continuing eligibility for that care is provided for in the judgment or settlement described in 38 U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose entitlement to disability compensation is suspended because of the receipt of military retired pay; and veterans receiving compensation at the 10 percent rating level based on multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities that clearly interfere with normal employability.


(4) Veterans who receive increased pension based on their need for regular aid and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound and other veterans who are determined to be catastrophically disabled by the Chief of Staff (or equivalent clinical official) at the VA facility where they were examined.


(5) Veterans not covered by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section who are determined to be unable to defray the expenses of necessary care under 38 U.S.C. 1722(a).


(6) Veterans of World War II; veterans solely seeking care for a disorder associated with exposure to a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War (the period between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998), or for any illness associated with service in combat in a war after the Gulf War or during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as provided and limited in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e); Camp Lejeune veterans pursuant to § 17.400; and veterans with 0 percent service-connected disabilities who are nevertheless compensated, including veterans receiving compensation for inactive tuberculosis.


(7) Veterans who agree to pay to the United States the applicable copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g) if their income for the previous year constitutes “low income” under the geographical income limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the fiscal year that ended on September 30 of the previous calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph, VA will determine the income of veterans (to include the income of their spouses and dependents) using the rules in §§ 3.271, 3.272, 3.273, and 3.276. After determining the veterans' income and the number of persons in the veterans' family (including only the spouse and dependent children), VA will compare their income with the current applicable “low-income” income limit for the public housing and section 8 programs in their area that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development publishes pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2). If the veteran's income is below the applicable “low-income” income limits for the area in which the veteran resides, the veteran will be considered to have “low income” for purposes of this paragraph. To avoid a hardship to a veteran, VA may use the projected income for the current year of the veteran, spouse, and dependent children if the projected income is below the “low income” income limit referenced above. This category is further prioritized into the following subcategories: 


(i) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who are in an enrolled status on a specified date announced in a _Federal Register_ document promulgated under paragraph (c) of this section and who subsequently do not request disenrollment; 


(ii) Nonservice-connected veterans who are in an enrolled status on a specified date announced in a _Federal Register_ document promulgated under paragraph (c) of this section and who subsequently do not request disenrollment; 


(iii) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section; and 


(iv) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section. 


(8) Veterans not included in priority category 4 or 7, who are eligible for care only if they agree to pay to the United States the applicable copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g). This category is further prioritized into the following subcategories:


(i) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who were in an enrolled status on January 17, 2003, or who are moved from a higher priority category or subcategory due to no longer being eligible for inclusion in such priority category or subcategory and who subsequently do not request disenrollment;


(ii) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section and whose income is not greater than ten percent more than the income that would permit their enrollment in priority category 5 or priority category 7, whichever is higher;


(iii) Nonservice-connected veterans who were in an enrolled status on January 17, 2003, or who are moved from a higher priority category or subcategory due to no longer being eligible for inclusion in such priority category or subcategory and who subsequently do not request disenrollment;


(iv) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section and whose income is not greater than ten percent more than the income that would permit their enrollment in priority category 5 or priority category 7, whichever is higher;


(v) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(i) or paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section; and


(vi) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) or paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section.


(c) _Federal Register_*notification of eligible enrollees. * (1) It is anticipated that each year the Secretary will consider whether to change the categories and subcategories of veterans eligible to be enrolled. The Secretary at any time may revise the categories or subcategories of veterans eligible to be enrolled by amending paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The preamble to a _Federal Register_ document announcing which priority categories and subcategories are eligible to be enrolled must specify the projected number of fiscal year applicants for enrollment in each priority category, projected healthcare utilization and expenditures for veterans in each priority category, appropriated funds and other revenue projected to be available for fiscal year enrollees, and projected total expenditures for enrollees by priority category. The determination should include consideration of relevant internal and external factors, e.g., economic changes, changes in medical practices, and waiting times to obtain an appointment for care. Consistent with these criteria, the Secretary will determine which categories of veterans are eligible to be enrolled based on the order of priority specified in paragraph (b) of this section.


(2) Unless changed by a rulemaking document in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, VA will enroll the priority categories of veterans set forth in § 17.36(b) beginning June 15, 2009, except that those veterans in subcategories (v) and (vi) of priority category 8 are not eligible to be enrolled.


(d) *Enrollment and disenrollment process*—(1) *Application for enrollment.* A veteran who wishes to be enrolled must apply by submitting a VA Form 10-10EZ:


(i) To a VA medical facility or by mail it to the U.S. Postal address on the form; or


(ii) Online at the designated World Wide Web internet address; or


(iii) By calling a designated telephone number and submitting application information verbally. To complete a telephone application, the veteran seeking enrollment must attest to the accuracy and authenticity of their verbal application for enrollment and consent to VA's copayment requirements and third-party billing procedures. 


(2) *Action on application.* Upon receipt of a completed VA Form 10-10EZ, a VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health Eligibility Center, will accept a veteran as an enrollee upon determining that the veteran is in a priority category eligible to be enrolled as set forth in § 17.36(c)(2). Upon determining that a veteran is not in a priority category eligible to be enrolled, the VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health Eligibility Center, will inform the applicant that the applicant is ineligible to be enrolled.


(3) *Placement in enrollment categories.* (i) Veterans will be placed in priority categories whether or not veterans in that category are eligible to be enrolled.


(ii) A veteran will be placed in the highest priority category or categories for which the veteran qualifies.


(iii) A veteran may be placed in only one priority category, except that a veteran placed in priority category 6 based on a specified disorder or illness will also be placed in priority category 7 or priority category 8, as applicable, if the veteran has previously agreed to pay the applicable copayment, for all matters not covered by priority category 6.


(iv) A veteran who had been enrolled based on inclusion in priority category 5 and became no longer eligible for inclusion in priority category 5 due to failure to submit to VA a current VA Form 10-10EZ will be changed automatically to enrollment based on inclusion in priority category 6 or 8 (or more than one of these categories if the previous principle applies), as applicable, and be considered continuously enrolled. To meet the criteria for priority category 5, a veteran must be eligible for priority category 5 based on the information submitted to VA in a current VA Form 10-10EZ. To be current, after VA has sent a form 10-10EZ to the veteran at the veteran's last known address, the veteran must return the completed form (including signature) to the address on the return envelope within 60 days from the date VA sent the form to the veteran.


(v) Veterans will be disenrolled, and reenrolled, in the order of the priority categories listed with veterans in priority category 1 being the last to be disenrolled and the first to be reenrolled. Similarly, within priority categories 7 and 8, veterans will be disenrolled, and reenrolled, in the order of the priority subcategories listed with veterans in subcategory (i) being the last to be disenrolled and first to be reenrolled.


(4) [Reserved]


(5) *Disenrollment.* A veteran enrolled in the VA health care system under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be disenrolled only if:


(i) The veteran submits to a VA Medical Center or to the VA Health Eligibility Center, 2957 Clairmont Road, NE., Suite 200, Atlanta, Georgia 30329-1647, a signed and dated document stating that the veteran no longer wishes to be enrolled; or


(ii) A VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health Eligibility Center, determines that the veteran is no longer in a priority category eligible to be enrolled, as set forth in § 17.36(c)(2).


(6) *Notification of enrollment status.* Notice of a decision by a VA network or facility director, or the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management or Chief, Health Administration Service or equivalent official at a VA medical facility, or Director, Health Eligibility Center, regarding enrollment status will be provided to the affected veteran by letter and will contain the reasons for the decision. The letter will include an effective date for any changes and a statement regarding appeal rights. The decision will be based on all information available to the decisionmaker, including the information contained in VA Form 10-10EZ.


(e) *Catastrophically disabled.* For purposes of this section, catastrophically disabled means to have a permanent severely disabling injury, disorder, or disease that compromises the ability to carry out the activities of daily living to such a degree that the individual requires personal or mechanical assistance to leave home or bed or requires constant supervision to avoid physical harm to self or others. This definition is met if an individual has been found by the Chief of Staff (or equivalent clinical official) at the VA facility where the individual was examined to have a permanent condition specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; to meet permanently one of the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section by a clinical evaluation of the patient's medical records that documents that the patient previously met the permanent criteria and continues to meet such criteria (permanently) or would continue to meet such criteria (permanently) without the continuation of on-going treatment; or to meet permanently one of the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section by a current medical examination that documents that the patient meets the permanent criteria and will continue to meet such criteria (permanently) or would continue to meet such criteria (permanently) without the continuation of on-going treatment.
