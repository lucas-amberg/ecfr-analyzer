# ยง 18.2   Application of this part.

This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this subpart. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of this part pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this part, (c) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary, or (d) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in ยง 18.3. The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A to this subpart shall not mean, if Title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to appendix A to this subpart by notice published in the _Federal Register._
