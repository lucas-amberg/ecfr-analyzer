# Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 18—Illustrative Applications


The following examples, without being exhaustive, will illustrate the application of the nondiscrimination provisions to certain grants of the Department of Veterans Affairs. (In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this part, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance.) 


(a) In grants which support the provision of health or welfare services for veterans in State homes, discrimination in the selection or eligibility of individuals to receive the services, and segregation or other discriminatory practices in the manner of providing them, are prohibited. This prohibition extends to all facilities and services provided by the State as grantee under the program or by a political subdivision of the State. It extends also to services purchased or otherwise obtained by the grantee (or political subdivision) from hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and similar institutions for beneficiaries of the program, and to the facilities in which such services are provided, subject, however, to the provisions of § 18.3(c). 


(b) In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the provision of health or welfare services assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be prohibited as a condition of Federal operating grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of a State home for furnishing nursing home care, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of patients. In the case of such grants the assurance will apply to patients, to interns, residents, student nurses, and other trainees, and to the privilege of physicians, dentists, and other professionally qualified persons to practice in the nursing home, and will apply to the entire facility for which, or for a part of which, the grant is made, and to facilities operated in connection therewith. 


(c) Upon transfers of real or personal surplus property for health or educational uses, discrimination is prohibited to the same extent as in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision of equipment for like purposes. 


(d) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this part forbids it to accomplish directly. Thus a State, in selecting or approving projects or sites for the construction of a nursing home which will receive Federal financial assistance, may not base its selections or approvals on criteria which have the effect of defeating or of substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the Federal assistance program with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.
