# § 18.439   Private education.

(a) A recipient that provides private elementary or secondary education may not on the basis of handicap, exclude a qualified handicapped person if the person can, with minor adjustments, be provided an appropriate education, as defined in § 18.433(b)(1), within that recipient's program or activity. 


(b) A recipient may not charge more for providing an appropriate education to handicapped persons than to nonhandicapped persons except to the extent that any additional charge is justified by a substantial increase in cost to the recipient. 


(c) A recipient to which this section applies that provides special education shall do so in accordance with §§ 18.435 and 18.436. Each recipient to which this section applies is subject to §§ 18.434, 18.437, and 18.438.
