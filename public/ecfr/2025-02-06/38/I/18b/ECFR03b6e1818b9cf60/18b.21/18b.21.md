# ยง 18b.21   Signature of documents.

The signature of a party, authorized officer, employee, or attorney constitutes a certificate that one of them has read the document, that to the best of that person's knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it, and that it is not interposed for delay. If a document is not signed or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this section, it may be stricken as sham and false and the proceeding may proceed as though the document had not been filed. Similar action may be taken if scandalous or indecent matter is inserted.
