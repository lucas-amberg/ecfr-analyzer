# § 21.214   Furnishing supplies for special programs.

(a) *General.* A veteran pursuing one of the following types of vocational rehabilitation programs is eligible for any types of supplies listed in § 21.212. The following paragraphs clarify the applicability of the general provisions of § 21.212 to these special situations.


(b) *Supplies furnished to veterans pursuing training in the home.* VA may furnish to veterans training in the home:


(1) Books, tools, and supplies which schools or training establishments that train individuals outside the home for the objective the veteran is pursuing at home ordinarily require all students and trainees to personally possess;


(2) Supplies and equipment which are essential to the prescribed course of training because the veteran is pursuing the course at home. Equipment in this category consists of items which ordinarily are not required by a school or training establishment;


(3) Special equipment, such as a vise or drafting table;


(4) Supplies needed to enable the veteran to function more independently in his or her home and community.


(c) *Supplies furnished to a veteran in farm cooperative training.* The books and related training supplies which VA may furnish a veteran in farm cooperative training depend upon the type of instruction he or she is receiving:


(1) When organized, group instruction is part of a veteran's course, VA will furnish those books and supplies which the school requires all students in the school portion of the course to own personally or on a rental basis;


(2) When all instruction is given on the veteran's farm by an individual instructor, VA will furnish to a student only those textbooks and other supplies which would ordinarily be required by a school.


(d) *Obtaining and maintaining employment.* A veteran being furnished employment services may receive supplies which: 


(1) The employer requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans to own upon beginning employment to the extent that the items were not furnished during the period in which the veteran was training for the objective, or the items that were furnished for training purposes are not adequate for employment;


(2) VA determines that special equipment is necessary for the veteran to perform his or her duties, subject to the obligation of the employer to make reasonable accommodation to the disabling effects of the veteran's condition.


(e) *Self-employment.* The supplies and related assistance which may be furnished, subject to the requirements prescribed under §§ 21.257 and 21.258, to a veteran for whom self-employment has been approved as the occupational objective, are generally limited to those necessary to begin operations:


(1) Minimum stocks of materials, e.g., inventory of saleable merchandise or goods, expendable items required for day-to-day operations, and items which are consumed on the premises;


(2) Essential equipment, including machinery, occupational fixtures, accessories, and appliances; and
