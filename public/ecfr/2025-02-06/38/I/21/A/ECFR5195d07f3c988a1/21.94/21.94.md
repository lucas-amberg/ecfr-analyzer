# § 21.94   Changing the plan.

(a) *General.* The veteran, the Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) or the vocational rehabilitation specialist may request a change in the plan at any time.


(b) *Long-range goals.* A change in the statement of a long-range goal may only be made following a reevaluation of the veteran's rehabilitation program by the CP or VRC. A change may be made when: 


(1) Achievement of the current goal(s) is no longer reasonably feasible; or 


(2) The veteran's circumstances have changed or new information has been developed which makes rehabilitation more likely if a different long-range goal is established; and


(3) The veteran fully participates and concurs in the change.


(c) *Intermediate objectives or services.* A change in intermediate objectives or services provided under the plan may be made by the case manager when such change is necessary to carry out the statement of long-range goals. The veteran must concur in the change.


(d) *Minor changes.* Minor changes in the plan (e.g., changing the date of a scheduled evaluation) by the case manager may be made without the participation and concurrence of the veteran.


(e) *Changes in duration of the plan.* Any change in the total duration of a veteran's rehabilitation plan is subject to provisions on duration of a rehabilitation program described in §§ 21.70-21.78.
