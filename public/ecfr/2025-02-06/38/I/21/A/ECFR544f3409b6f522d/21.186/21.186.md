# § 21.186   “Ineligible” status.

(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of *ineligible* status is to identify the cases in which a veteran requests services under Chapter 31, but the request is denied by VA, usually, on the basis of information developed when the veteran was in *evaluation and planning* status.


(b) *Assignment to ineligible* status. A veteran's case will be assigned to *ineligible* status following a finding by VA that the veteran is not eligible for or entitled to services under Chapter 31. The finding must preclude all possible Chapter 31 services.


(c) *Termination of ineligible* status. The assignment of the veteran's case to *ineligible* status should be terminated if the veteran thereafter becomes eligible to receive any Chapter 31 service. Placement of the case in *ineligible* status is a bar to reconsideration of eligibility unless a material change in circumstances occurs.
