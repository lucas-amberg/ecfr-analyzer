# ยง 21.350   Unauthorized absences.

A veteran who is unable to obtain an authorized leave of absence in advance may seek to have the unauthorized absence excused.


(a) *Excusing unauthorized absences.* VA may excuse an unauthorized absence and make proper charges against the veteran's leave when:


(1) The veteran has absented himself or herself when advance approval from VA is impracticable; and


(2) Conditions for approval of leave are otherwise met.


(b) *Unexcused, unauthorized absences.* When an unauthorized absence is not satisfactorily explained, VA will take necessary action, including recoupment of subsistence allowance for that period of absence.
