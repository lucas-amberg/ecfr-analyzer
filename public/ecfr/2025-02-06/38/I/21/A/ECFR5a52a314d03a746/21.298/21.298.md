(8) Provide for the landowner or leasor to share the costs of improved practices put into effect in proportion to the returns he or she will receive from such practices. 


(b) *Farms on which more than one person trains—farm operator.* If a veteran in training is a partner of another person or if more than one person is involved in operating the farm, the farm shall be of such size and character that the farm:
