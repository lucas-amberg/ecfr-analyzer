# ยง 21.443   Permissible uses of VEPFS grant funds.

(a) VEPFS grant funds may be used only to fund outcomes payments if an intervention achieves outcomes at a pre-set target level that has been agreed to in a PFS agreement before service delivery begins for a PFS project with a goal to improve employment outcomes for Veterans with service-connected disabilities.


(b) To pay for the indirect costs of administering a grant, regardless of whether an intervention achieves outcomes at a pre-set target level, a recipient may:


(1) Use a Federally approved indirect cost rate (a rate already negotiated with the Federal Government);


(2) Use a 10% de minimis rate of modified total direct costs;


(3) Negotiate an indirect cost rate for the first time; or


(4) Claim certain costs directly following 2 CFR 200.413.
