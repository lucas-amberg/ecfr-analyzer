# § 21.314   Pursuit of training under special conditions.

A veteran is required to pursue a rehabilitation program at a rate which meets the requirement for full- or part-time participation described in §§ 21.310 and 21.312. However, a veteran may pursue a rehabilitation program at a lesser rate, if such pursuit is a part of the veteran's plan. Subsistence allowance is not payable during such periods.
