# § 21.162   Participation in a program of independent living services.

(a) *Approval of a program of independent living services.* A program of independent living services and assistance is approved when:


(1) The VA determines that achievement of a vocational goal is not currently reasonably feasible;


(2) The VA determines that the veteran's independence in daily living can be improved, and the gains made can reasonably be expected to continue following completion of the program;


(3) All steps required by §§ 21.90 and 21.92 of this part for the development and preparation of an Individualized Independent Living Plan (IILP) have been completed; and


(4) The Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Officer concurs in the IILP.


(b) *Considerations for the VR&E Officer.* The VR&E Officer will consider the following factors in administering programs providing independent living services: 


(1) If VA resources available limit the number of veterans who may be provided a program of independent living services and assistance, the first priority shall be given to veterans for whom the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal is precluded solely as a result of service-connected disability; and


(2) To the maximum extent feasible, a substantial portion of veterans provided with programs of independent living services and assistance shall be receiving long-term care in VA medical centers and nursing homes.
