# ยง 21.124   Combination course.

(a) *General.* A combination course is a course which combines training on the job with training in school. For the purpose of VA vocational rehabilitation, a course will be considered to be a combination course, if the student spends full-time on the job and one or more times a week also attends school on a part-time basis. A veteran may pursue the components of a combination course in the following manner:


(1) Concurrent school and on-job training;


(2) Primarily on-job with some related instruction in school;


(3) In a school as a preparatory course to entering on-job training; or


(4) First training on-job followed by the school portion. 


(b) *Cooperative course.* A cooperative course is a special type of combination course which usually:


(1) Has an objective which the student attains primarily through school instruction with the on-job portion being supplemental to the school course;


(2) Is at the college or junior college level although some cooperative courses are offered at post-secondary schools which do not offer a college degree or at secondary schools;


(3) Requires the student to devote at least one-half of the total training period to the school portion of the course; and


(4) Includes relatively long periods each of training on the job and in school such as a full term in school followed by a full term on the job.
