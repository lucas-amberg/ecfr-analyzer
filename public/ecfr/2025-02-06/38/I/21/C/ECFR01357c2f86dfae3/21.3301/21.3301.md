# § 21.3301   Need.

(a) *Determination of need.* When special restorative training has been requested or is being considered for an eligible person with a disability who is a child, spouse, or surviving spouse, a counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will obtain all information necessary to determine the need for and feasibility of special restorative training. After the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor completes this task, he or she will refer the case to the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel. The panel will consider whether—


(1) There exists a handicap which will interfere with pursuit of a program of education;


(2) The period of special restorative training materially will improve the child's, spouse's, or surviving spouse's ability to:


(i) Pursue a program of education,


(ii) Pursue a program of specialized vocational training,


(iii) Obtain continuing employment in a sheltered workshop, or


(iv) Adjust in his or her family or community;


(3) The special restorative training may be pursued concurrently with a program of education; 


(4) Training will affect adversely the child's, spouse's, or surviving spouse's mental or physical condition;


(5) In the case of a child, whether it is in the best interest of the child to begin special restorative training after his or her 14th birthday; and


(6) The Department of Veterans Affairs:


(i) Has considered assistance available under provisions of State-Federal programs for education of individuals with disabilities; and 


(ii) Has determined that it is in the eligible person's interest to receive benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.


(b) *Report.* The Vocational Rehabilitation Panel will prepare a written report of its findings and recommendations as to the need for assistance and the types of assistance which should be provided. The report will be sent to the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor.


(c) *Development and implementation.* Following consultation with the panel and receipt of the panel's report, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will determine the need for and feasibility of special restorative training. If this determination is affirmative, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will prepare an individualized written plan comparable to a plan for an extended evaluation under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31. In the case of an eligible person who is a spouse or surviving spouse, or a child who has attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, the plan will be developed jointly with the spouse or surviving spouse, or the child, respectively. In the case of an eligible person who has a guardian or has not attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, the plan will be developed jointly with the eligible person and his or her parent or guardian (see § 21.3021(d)).


(d) *Notification of disallowance.* When an eligible person, or a parent or guardian on behalf of an eligible person, has requested special restorative training, and the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor finds that this training is not needed or will not materially improve the eligible person's condition, VA will inform the eligible person, except that VA will inform his or her parent or guardian (see § 21.3021(d)) if the eligible person has a guardian or has not attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, in writing of the finding and of his or her appeal rights.


(e) *Reentrance after interruption.* The case of an eligible person shall be referred to the panel for consideration of whether the eligible person may be permitted reentrance into special restorative training following interruption. The panel will recommend approval to the Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) if there is a reasonable expectation that the purpose of special restorative training will be accomplished. See § 21.3306.
