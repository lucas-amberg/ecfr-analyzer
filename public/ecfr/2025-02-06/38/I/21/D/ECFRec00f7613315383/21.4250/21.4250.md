# § 21.4250   Course and licensing and certification test approval; jurisdiction and notices.

(a) *General.* The statements made in this paragraph are subject to exceptions found in paragraph (c) of this section.


(1) If an educational institution offers a resident course in a State, only the State approving agency for the State where the course is being offered may approve the course for VA training. If the State approving agency chooses to approve a resident course (other than a flight course) not leading to a standard college degree, it must also approve the class schedules of that course.


(2) If an educational institution with a main campus in a State offers a resident course not located in a State, only the State approving agency for the State where the educational institution's main campus is located may approve the course for VA training. If the State approving agency chooses to approve a resident course (other than a flight course) not leading to a standard college degree, it must also approve the class schedules of that course.


(3) If an educational institution offers a course by independent study or by correspondence, only the State approving agency for the State where the educational institution's main campus is located may approve the course for VA training.


(4) If a training establishment offers a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training, only the State approving agency for the State where the training will take place may approve the course for VA training.


(5) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, if a State or political subdivision of a State offers a licensing test, only the State approving agency for the State where the license will be valid may approve the test for VA payment.


(6)(i) If an organization or entity offers a licensing or certification test and applies for approval of that test, only the State approving agency for the State where the organization or entity has its headquarters may approve the test and the organization or entity offering the test for VA payment. This approval will be valid wherever the test is given.


(ii) If the organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test does not apply for approval, and a State or political subdivision of a State requires that an individual take the test in order to obtain a license, the State approving agency for the State where the license will be valid may approve the test for VA payment. This approval will be valid for the purpose of VA payment only if the veteran takes the test in the State or political subdivision of the State where the license is valid.


(7) A course approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 36 will be deemed to be approved for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.


(8) Any course that was approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 (as in effect before February 1, 1965), or under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 before March 3, 1966, and was not or is not disapproved for failure to meet any of the requirements of the applicable chapters, will be deemed to be approved for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.


(9) VA may make tuition assistance top-up payments of educational assistance to an individual to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance, even though a State approving agency has not approved the course in which the individual was enrolled. 


(b) *State approving agencies.* Approval by State approving agencies will be in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. Chapter 36 and such regulations and policies as the agency may adopt not in conflict therewith. 


(1) *Notice of approval.* (i) Each State approving agency must provide to VA:


(A) A list of schools specifying which courses it has approved;


(B) A list of licensing and certification tests and organizations and entities offering these tests that it has approved; and


(C) Any other information that it and VA may determine to be necessary.


(ii) The lists and information must be provided on paper or electronically as VA may require. 


(2) *Notice of suspension of approval or disapproval.* Each State approving agency will notify the Department of Veterans Affairs of the suspension of approval or disapproval of any course or licensing or certification test previously approved and will set forth the reasons for such suspension of approval or disapproval. See § 21.4259.


(3) *Failure to act.* If notice has been furnished that the State approving agency does not intend to act on the application of a school, the school may request approval by the Department of Veterans Affairs.


(c) *Department of Veterans Affairs approval.* (1) The Executive Director, Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Service may approve special restorative training in excess of 12 months to overcome or lessen the effects of a physical or mental disability to enable an eligible child to pursue a program of education under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.
