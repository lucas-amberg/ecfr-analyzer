(a) *Subsistence allowance.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, VA will pay subsistence allowance to a veteran, spouse, surviving spouse or dependent child during any period for which he or she is entitled to educational assistance. No subsistence allowance is payable to:


(1) A servicemember, even if he or she is entitled to educational assistance, or


(2) A spouse or dependent child of a servicemember, even if the spouse or dependent child is entitled to educational assistance.


(b) *Amount of subsistence allowance.* (1) The following rules govern the amount of subsistence allowance payable to veterans and to spouses and dependent children of veterans who are alive during the period for which subsistence allowance is payable. As stated in paragraph (a) of this section, these amounts are payable only for periods during which the veterans, spouses or dependent children are entitled to educational assistance.


(i) If a person is pursuing a course of instruction on a full-time basis, his or her subsistence allowance is $1,051 per month for training pursued during the 2003-04 academic year.


(ii) If a person is pursuing a course of instruction on other than a full-time basis, his or her subsistence allowance is $525.50 per month for training pursued during the 2003-04 academic year.


(iii) If a person does not pursue a course of instruction for a complete month VA will prorate the subsistence allowance for that month on the basis of 1/30th of the monthly rate for each day the person is pursuing the course.


(2) The following rules govern the amount of subsistence allowance payable to surviving spouses and dependent children of deceased veterans and servicemembers.


(i) VA will determine the monthly rate of subsistence allowance payable to a person for a day during which he or she is pursuing a course of instruction full-time during the 2003-04 academic year by dividing $1,051 per month by the number of the deceased veteran's dependents pursuing a course of instruction on that day.


(ii) VA will determine the monthly rate of subsistence allowance payable to a person for a day during which he or she is pursuing a course of instruction on other than a full-time basis during the 2003-04 academic year by dividing $525.50 per month by the number of the deceased veteran's dependents pursuing a course of instruction on that day.


(iii) The total amount of subsistence allowance payable to a person for a month is the sum of the person's daily rates for the month.


(c) *Time of subsistence allowance payments.* VA will make payments of subsistence allowance on the first day of the month following the month for which subsistence allowance is due, provided that VA receives a timely enrollment certification. If VA receives the enrollment certification so late that payment cannot be made on the first day of the month following the month for which subsistence allowance is due, VA will make payment as soon as practicable.
