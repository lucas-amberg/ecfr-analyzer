(4) In which it becomes feasible for the veteran to commute to school with family, friends or fellow students.


(e) *Amount which may be paid.* VA will reimburse the veteran for his or her actual cost, not to exceed $70 per month. Necessary supportive documentation must be submitted with each request for reimbursement. Payment will be made monthly or at longer intervals as may be agreed to in the IWRP.
