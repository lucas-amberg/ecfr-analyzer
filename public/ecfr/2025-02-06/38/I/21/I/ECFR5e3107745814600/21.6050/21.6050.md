# § 21.6050   Participation of eligible veterans in an evaluation.

(a) *Veterans under age 45.* A veteran under age 45 awarded pension during the program period shall be provided an evaluation of his or her rehabilitation potential to determine whether achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible. The veteran must report for and participate in the evaluation unless the failure to do so is for reasons beyond the veteran's control. Failure to report for and participate in the evaluation, for reasons other than those beyond the veteran's control, will result in suspension of the veteran's pension under § 3.342 of this chapter. See § 21.6056.


(b) *Evaluating other qualified veterans.* An evaluation shall be accorded each qualified veteran as described in § 21.6005(c) of this part who seeks to become a program participant provided VA first determines the veteran has good potential for achieving employment. Failure to choose to participate in an evaluation shall have no adverse effect upon the veteran's continued receipt of pension under § 3.342 of this chapter.


(c) *Notice to eligible veteran.* (1) A qualified veteran under age 45 awarded pension during the program period for whom participation in an evaluation is not clearly precluded by reasons beyond the veteran's control shall be sent a notice at the time he or she is awarded pension. The notice will inform the veteran of the provisions of this temporary program, the conditions under which participation in an evaluation is required, and the consequences of nonparticipation.


(2) A qualified veteran age 45 or older awarded pension during the program period will be informed of the provisions of this temporary program and the procedure for requesting an evaluation.


(d) *Scheduling the evaluation.* (1) An evaluation will be arranged as promptly as practicable for each qualified veteran:


(i) Under age 50 who is sent the notice required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(ii) [Reserved]


(2) Other qualified veterans identified in § 21.6005(c) who are found to have good employment potential under § 21.6054.


(e) *Followup of qualified veterans who do not complete an evaluation.* The case of each qualified veteran under age 45 awarded pension during the program period for whom an evaluation was not scheduled or who does not complete an evaluation shall be reviewed for followup action by Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) staff as provided in §§ 21.197(c)(4) and 21.198(d).


(f) *Limitation on the number of evaluations.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, the number of evaluations which may be provided under this temporary program is subject to the limitations contained in § 21.6059 of this part.
