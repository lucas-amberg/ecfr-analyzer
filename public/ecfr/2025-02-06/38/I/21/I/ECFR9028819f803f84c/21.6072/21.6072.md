(b) *Maximum number of months for which a program for new participants may be approved.* If a veteran had never participated in this temporary program of vocational training, the originally planned period of training may be extended to a total period consisting of the number of months necessary to attain the vocational goal, but in no case will a program be extended for:

(2) If a finding of prior *rehabilitation to the point of employability* is set aside to enable a veteran to pursue a program of on-job training or work experience, including the provision of employer incentives under § 21.256 of this part, the number of months for which assistance may be authorized under this program shall be established as provided in § 21.256 of this part to the extent consistent with the rules of this section;


(3) If the determination of *rehabilitation to the point of employability* has been set aside under § 21.6284 (a) or (b) of this part, additional training may be provided subject to the same provisions as apply to new participants.

(2) The Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) may approve any other extensions of the vocational training program, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, if it is determined that the additional time is needed and the conditions for extension under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met;


(3) The VR&E Officer must also concur in an extension of the vocational training program beyond 24 months when paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are met.
