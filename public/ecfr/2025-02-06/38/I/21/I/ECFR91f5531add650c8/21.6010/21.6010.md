# § 21.6010   Applicability of rules and administrative procedures under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 31.

(a) *General.* Title 38 U.S.C., section 1524(b)(2)(A) provides, in part, that a vocational training program shall consist of vocationally oriented services and assistance of the kind provided service-disabled veterans under chapter 31, Title 38 U.S.C., and other services and assistance of the kind provided under that chapter as are necessary to enable the veteran to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment.


(b) *Applicable chapter 31 rules—general.* The rules and procedures in force for administration of the chapter 31 program (§§ 21.1-21.430) are deemed to be applicable to administration of this program in so far as their use shall not conflict with 38 U.S.C. 1524 or the rules under this subpart. Where a particular grouping of chapter 31 rules are generally applicable, without modification, the rules under this subpart will be deemed to incorporate the chapter 31 rules. The chapter 31 rules may be read as written, but terms such as *chapter 31* and *service-connected disability* shall be understood to read *chapter 15* and *disabilities* whenever used. References in the chapter 31 rules to benefits (subsistence allowances, loans) or eligibility (dependents, service-connection, serious employment handicap) are to be considered inapplicable to this program and do not confer benefits or rights not provided by 38 U.S.C. 1524.
