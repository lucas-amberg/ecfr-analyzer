# § 21.6015   Claims and elections.

(a) *Claims by veterans under age 45 for whom participation in an evaluation is required.* A veteran under age 45 who is awarded pension during the program period will be scheduled for an evaluation to determine whether achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, unless it is determined that the veteran is unable to participate in an evaluation for reasons beyond his or her control. If VA, as a result of the evaluation, determines that achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, the veteran may elect to pursue a vocational training program. To make this election, the veteran must file a claim, in a form prescribed by VA, for services under this temporary program.


(b) *Claims by qualified veterans for whom participation in an evaluation is not required.* Qualified veterans in the following categories will be provided an evaluation if they request assistance under the temporary program, and are found to have good employment potential. These veterans include:


(1) Veterans age 45 and more who are awarded pension during the program period;


(2) Veterans awarded pension prior to the beginning of the program period on February 1, 1985, who meet the conditions contained in § 21.6005(c) of this part.


(c) *Filing a claim.* A veteran in one of the categories identified in paragraph (b) of this section must file a claim in the form prescribed by VA in order to be considered for an evaluation of his or her ability to achieve a vocational goal through participation in this temporary program. The veteran's claim is considered a request for both the evaluation, and if achievement of a vocational goal is found reasonably feasible, for participation in the vocational training program.


(d) *Claims following failure to timely pursue a vocational training program.* (1) If a veteran for whom achievement of a vocational goal is found reasonably feasible does not undertake a vocational training program within the time limits specified in § 21.32, he or she must file an original or reopened claim, as appropriate, in a form prescribed by VA in order to be considered for such services to determine if achievement of the previous vocational goal or a new vocational goal is reasonably feasible.


(2) If a veteran has been placed in discontinued case status by the VA, he or she must file a new claim in a form prescribed by the VA to reopen the case.


(e) *Informal claims.* Informal claims shall be governed by § 21.31 of this part.


(f) *Time limit.* The time limit for making a claim to pursue a vocational training program shall be governed by § 21.32 of this part.
