# § 21.6160   Independent living services.

(a) *Services must be part of a vocational training program.* Independent living services may be provided as a part of a veteran's IWRP when such services are indispensable to the achievement of the vocational goal, but may not be provided as the sole program of rehabilitation for the veteran, since a vocational training program for the veteran must be found reasonably feasible before the IWRP is prepared.


(b) *Independent living services which may be furnished under this program.* The independent living services which may be furnished include:


(1) Training in independent living skills;


(2) Health management programs;


(3) Identification of appropriate housing accommodations; and


(4) Personal care service for a transitional period not to exceed two months.


(c) *Coordination with other VA elements and other Federal, State, and local programs.* Provision of independent living services and assistance will generally require extensive coordination with other VA and non-VA programs. The resources of VA medical centers shall be utilized as prescribed in § 21.6242 of this part. If appropriate arrangements cannot be made to provide these services through VA medical centers, other governmental and private nonprofit programs may be used to secure necessary services if the facility or individual providing services meets the requirements of § 21.294 of this part.


(d) *Applicability of chapter 31 rules.* Neither § 21.160 nor § 21.162 of this part are applicable to provision of independent living services under this program.
