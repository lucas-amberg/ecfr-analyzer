# § 21.7042   Basic eligibility requirements.

An individual must meet the requirements of this section, § 21.7044, or § 21.7045 in order to be eligible for basic educational assistance. This section requires an individual to complete certain academic requirements before applying for educational assistance. If the individual applies before completing those requirements, VA will disallow the application. However, the individual's premature application will not prevent the individual from establishing eligibility at a later time by applying for educational assistance again after having completed those academic requirements. In determining whether an individual has met the service requirements of this section, VA will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service for the periods of time specified in § 3.15.

(d) *Dual eligibility.* (1) An individual who has established eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section through serving at least two years of continuous active duty of an obligated period of active duty of less than three years, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may attempt to establish eligibility under paragraph (b) of this section through service in the Selected Reserve.

(2) An individual must elect, in writing, whether he or she wishes service in the Selected Reserve to be credited towards establishing eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 or under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 when:


(i) The individual:

(f) *Restrictions on establishing eligibility.* (1) An individual who, after June 30, 1985, first becomes a member of the Armed Forces or first enters on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces, may elect not to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30. This election must be made at the time the individual initially enters on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces. An individual who makes such an election is not eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 unless he or she withdraws the election as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or in § 21.7045(b) or (c) of this part.


(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, an individual is not eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 if after December 31, 1976, he or she receives a commission as an officer in the Armed Forces upon graduation from: 


(i) The United States Military Academy; 


(ii) The United States Naval Academy; 


(iii) The United States Air Force Academy; or 


(iv) The United States Coast Guard Academy. 


(3) Except as provided in this paragraph and in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, an individual who after December 31, 1976, receives a commission as an officer in the Armed Forces upon completion of a program of educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 (the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program) is not eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30. This bar to eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 does not apply to an individual who entered active duty after September 30, 1996, and received—


(i) $2,000 or less in educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 for at least one year of the individual's participation in that program of educational assistance; or


(ii) $3,400 or less in educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 for at least one year of the individual's participation in that program of educational assistance. This provision applies to payment of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 for months after December 31, 2001.


(4) Paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section do not apply to a veteran who has met the requirements for educational assistance under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section before receiving a commission in the Armed Forces upon graduation from the United States Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, the United States Coast Guard Academy; or upon completion of a program of educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 (the Senior Reserve Officers Training Corps Scholarship Program).


(g) *Reduction in basic pay.* (1) Except as elsewhere provided in this paragraph, the basic pay of any individual described in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall be reduced by $100 for each of the first 12 months that the individual is entitled to basic pay. If the individual does not serve 12 months, it shall be reduced by $100 for each month that the individual is entitled to basic pay. 


(2) The basic pay of an individual who withdraws an election not to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 as described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be reduced by


(i) $1,200, or


(ii) In the case of an individual whose discharge or release from active duty prevents the reduction of the individual's basic pay by $1,200, an amount less than $1,200.


(3) The basic pay of any individual who makes the election described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and who does not withdraw that election will not be subject to the reduction described in either paragraph (g)(1) or paragraph (g)(2) of this section.


(4) The individual who makes the election described in either paragraph (a)(7) or (b)(10) of this section shall have his or her basic pay reduced by $1,200 in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. To the extent that basic pay is not so reduced before the individual's discharge or release from active duty, VA will collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the reductions described in this paragraph. If the basic pay of an individual is not reduced and/or VA does not collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the pay reductions, that individual is ineligible for educational assistance.


(5) If through administrative error, or other reason— 


(i) The basic pay of an individual described in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(6), (b)(1) through (b)(9), (c), or (d) of this section is not reduced as provided in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, the failure to make the reduction will have no effect on his or her eligibility, but will negate or reduce the individual's entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 determined as provided in § 21.7073 for an individual described in paragraph (c) of this section; 


(ii) The basic pay of an individual, described in paragraph (a)(7) or (b)(10) of this section, is not reduced as described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section and/or VA does not collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the pay reductions described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, that individual is ineligible for educational assistance. If the failure to reduce the individual's basic pay and/or the failure to collect from the individual was due to administrative error on the part of the Federal government or any of its employees, the individual may be considered for equitable relief depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. See § 2.7 of this chapter.
