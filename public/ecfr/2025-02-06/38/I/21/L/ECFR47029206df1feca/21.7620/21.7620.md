Restrictions on this general rule are stated in the other paragraphs in this section and in § 21.7722(b) of this part, however.


(b) *Flight training.* (1) VA may pay educational assistance for an enrollment in a flight training course when—


(i) An institution of higher learning offers the course for credit toward the standard college degree the reservist is pursuing; or


(ii) When:


(A) The reservist is eligible to pursue flight training as provided in § 21.7540(b)(1) and (b)(3);


(B) The State approving agency has approved the course;


(C) A flight school is offering the course;


(D) The reservist's training meets the requirements of § 21.4263(b)(1);


(E) The reservist meets the requirements of § 21.4263(a); and


(F) The training for which payment is made occurs after September 29, 1990.


(2) VA will not pay educational assistance for an enrollment in a flight training course when the reservist is pursuing an ancillary flight objective.


(c) *Independent study.* (1) VA will pay educational assistance to a reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue, as provided in § 21.7540(b)(2) and (b)(3), for an enrollment in any course or unit subject offered by independent study only when the reservist is enrolled concurrently in one or more courses or unit subjects offered by resident training.


(2) Only a reservist who meets the requirements of § 21.7540(b)(1) may be paid educational assistance for an enrollment in an independent study course or unit subject without a simultaneous enrollment in a course or unit subject offered by resident training.

(i) Successful completion of the nonaccredited course or unit subject is required in order for the reservist to complete his or her program of education and the reservist:


(A) Was receiving educational assistance on October 29, 1992, for pursuit of the program of education of which the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject forms a part; and


(B) Has remained continuously enrolled in the program of education of which the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject forms a part from October 29, 1992, to the date the reservist enrolls in the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject; or

(B) Remains continuously enrolled in that course or unit subject.


(4) Whether or not the reservist is enrolled will be determined by the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the educational institution offering the course or unit subject.


(d) *Graduate study.* VA will pay educational assistance for an enrollment in a course or subject leading to a graduate degree or certificate when the training occurs after November 29, 1993.
