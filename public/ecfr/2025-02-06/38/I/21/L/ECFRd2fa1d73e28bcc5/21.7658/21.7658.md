# § 21.7658   False, late, or missing reports.

(a) *Reservist.* Payments may not be based on false or misleading statements, claims or reports. VA will apply the provisions of §§ 21.4006 and 21.4007 of this part to a reservist or any other person who submits false or misleading claims, statements or reports in connection with benefits payable under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 in the same manner as they are applied to people who make similar false or misleading claims for benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 or 36.


(b) *Educational institution or training establishment.* (1) VA may hold an educational institution liable for overpayments which result from a willful or negligent:


(i) Failure of the educational institution to report, excessive absences from a course or discontinuance or interruption of a course by a reservist; or


(ii) False certification by the educational institution. See § 21.7644(c).


(2) If an educational institution or training establishment willfully and knowingly submits a false report or certification, VA may disapprove that institution's or establishment's courses for further enrollments and may discontinue educational assistance to reservists already enrolled. In doing so, VA will apply §§ 21.4210 through 21.4216.
