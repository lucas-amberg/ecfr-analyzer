# ยง 21.8072   Authorizing training, services, and assistance beyond the initial individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.

(a) *Extension of the duration of a vocational training program.* VA may authorize an extension of a vocational training program when necessary to provide additional training, services, and assistance to enable the child to achieve the vocational or employment goal identified before the end of the child's basic entitlement period, as stated in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation under ยง 21.8080. A change from one occupational objective to another in the same field or occupational family meets the criterion for prior identification in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation. 


(b) *Extensions for prior participants in the program.* (1) Except as paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides, VA may authorize additional training, limited to the use of remaining program entitlement including any allowable extension, for an eligible child who previously participated in vocational training under this subpart. The additional training must: 


(i) Be designed to enable the child to complete the prior vocational goal or a different vocational goal; and 


(ii) Meet the same provisions as apply to training for new participants. 


(2) An eligible child who has previously achieved a vocational goal in a vocational training program under this subpart may not receive additional training under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless a CP or VRC sets aside the child's achievement of that vocational goal under ยง 21.8284. 


(c) *Responsibility for authorizing a program extension.* A CP or VRC may approve extensions of the vocational training program the child is pursuing up to the maximum program limit of 48 months if the CP or VRC determines that the child needs the additional time to successfully complete training and obtain employment, and the following conditions are met: 


(1) The child has completed more than half of the planned training; and 


(2) The child is making satisfactory progress.
