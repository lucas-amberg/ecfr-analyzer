(a) *Purpose of leave of absence.* The purpose of the leave system is to enable the child to maintain his or her status as an active program participant. 


(b) *Basis for leave of absence.* The VR&E case manager may grant the child leaves of absence for periods during which the child fails to pursue a vocational training program. For prolonged periods of absence, the VR&E case manager may approve leaves of absence only if the case manager determines the child is unable to pursue a vocational training program through no fault of the child. 


(c) *Effect on entitlement.* During a leave of absence, VA suspends the running of the basic 24-month period of entitlement, plus any extensions thereto, until the child resumes the program.
