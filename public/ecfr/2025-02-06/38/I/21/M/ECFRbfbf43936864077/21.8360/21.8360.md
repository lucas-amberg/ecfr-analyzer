# § 21.8360   Satisfactory conduct and cooperation.

The provisions for satisfactory conduct and cooperation in §§ 21.362 and 21.364, except as otherwise provided in this section, apply to children under this subpart in a manner comparable to the way they apply to veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program. If an eligible child fails to meet these requirements for satisfactory conduct or cooperation, the VR&E case manager will terminate the child's vocational training program. VA will not grant an eligible child reentrance to a vocational training program unless the reasons for unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation have been removed.
