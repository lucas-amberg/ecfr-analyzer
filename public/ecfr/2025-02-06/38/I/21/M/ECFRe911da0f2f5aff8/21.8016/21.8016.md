# § 21.8016   Nonduplication of benefits.

(a) *Election of benefits—chapter 35.* An eligible child may not receive benefits concurrently under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 and under this subpart. If the child is eligible for both benefits, he or she must elect in writing which benefit to receive. 


(b) *Reelections of benefits—chapter 35.* An eligible child receiving benefits under this subpart or under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 may change his or her election at any time. A reelection between benefits under this subpart and under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 must be prospective, however, and may not result in an eligible child receiving benefits under both programs for the same period of training. 


(c) *Length of benefits under multiple programs—chapter 35.* The aggregate period for which an eligible child may receive assistance under this subpart and under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 together may not exceed 48 months of full-time training or the part-time equivalent. 


(d) *Nonduplication of benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1804 and 1814.* An eligible child may only be provided one program of vocational training under this subpart.
