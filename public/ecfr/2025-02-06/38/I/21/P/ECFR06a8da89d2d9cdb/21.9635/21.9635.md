# § 21.9635   Discontinuance dates.

The effective date of a reduction or discontinuance of educational assistance will be as stated in this section. If more than one type of reduction or discontinuance is involved, VA will reduce or discontinue educational assistance using the earliest of the applicable dates.


(a) *Death of eligible individual.* (1) If the eligible individual receives a lump sum payment under § 21.9640(b)(1)(iii), (b)(2)(iii), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2)(ii) and dies before the end of the period covered by the lump sum payment, the discontinuance date of educational assistance for the purpose of that lump sum payment will be the last date of the period covered by the lump sum payment.


(2) If the institution of higher learning receives a lump sum payment for established charges on behalf of an eligible individual and the individual dies before the end of the period covered by the lump sum payment, the discontinuance date for the purpose of that lump sum payment will be the last date of the period covered by the lump sum payment. The institution of higher learning will be required to return to VA any portion of the established charges paid by VA that would normally be refunded to a similarly circumstanced individual according to the regularly established practices of the institution of higher learning.


(3) If the eligible individual receives an advance payment of the monthly housing allowance pursuant to § 21.9680(b)(2) and dies before the period covered by the advance payment ends, the discontinuance date of educational assistance shall be the last date of the period covered by the advance payment.


(4) For all other payments, if the eligible individual dies while pursuing a program of education, the discontinuance date of educational assistance will be the end of the month during which the individual last attended.


(b) *First instance of withdrawal of course.* In the first instance of a withdrawal from a course or courses for which the eligible individual received educational assistance, VA will consider mitigating circumstances to exist with respect to the withdrawal of a course or courses totaling no more than six semester hours or the equivalent. In determining whether a withdrawal is the first instance of withdrawal, VA will not consider a course or courses dropped during an institution of higher learning's drop-add period in accordance with § 21.4200(l). If mitigating circumstances are considered to exist in accordance with this paragraph, VA will terminate or reduce educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the withdrawal occurred.


(c) *Withdrawal or unsatisfactory completion of all courses.* (1) If the eligible individual, for reasons other than being called or ordered to active duty service, withdraws from all courses or receives all nonpunitive grades and, in either case, there are no mitigating circumstances, VA will terminate educational assistance effective the first date of the term in which the withdrawal occurs or the first date of the term for which nonpunitive grades are assigned.


(2) If the eligible individual withdraws from all courses with mitigating circumstances or withdraws from all courses for which a punitive grade is or will be assigned, VA will terminate educational assistance for—


(i) Residence training effective the last date of attendance; and


(ii) Independent study or distance learning effective on the official date of change in status under the practices of the institution of higher learning.


(3) When an eligible individual withdraws from an approved correspondence course offered by an institution of higher learning, VA will terminate educational assistance effective the date the last lesson was serviced.


(d) *Reduction in the rate of pursuit of a program of education.* If the eligible individual reduces the rate of pursuit by withdrawing from one or more courses in a program of education but continues training in one or more courses, VA will apply the provisions of this paragraph.


(1) If the reduction in the rate of pursuit occurs other than on the first date of the term, VA will reduce the eligible individual's educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the reduction occurred when the circumstances in either paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) apply—


(i) A nonpunitive grade is assigned for the course from which the eligible individual withdraws and the withdrawal occurs with mitigating circumstances.


(ii) A punitive grade is assigned for the course from which the eligible individual withdraws.


(2) VA will reduce educational assistance effective the first date of the enrollment in which the reduction occurs when—


(i) The reduction occurs on the first date of the term; or


(ii) A nonpunitive grade is assigned for the course from which the eligible individual withdraws, and—


(A) The eligible individual does not withdraw because he or she is called to active duty service, or in the case of an individual serving on active duty, he or she is not ordered to a new duty location or assignment, or is not ordered to perform an increased amount of work, and


(B) The withdrawal occurs without mitigating circumstances.


(3) An eligible individual enrolled in several courses within a program of education, who reduces his or her rate of pursuit by completing one or more of the courses while continuing training in others, may receive an interval payment based on the total number of enrolled courses he or she completed if the requirements of § 21.9680(b)(5) are met. If those requirements are not met, VA will reduce the eligible individual's educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the individual completed each course (or courses).


(e) *End of course or period of enrollment.* If an eligible individual's course or period of enrollment ends, the effective date of reduction or discontinuance of the individual's award of educational assistance will be the ending date of the course or period of enrollment as certified by the institution of higher learning.


(f) *Nonpunitive grade.* (1) If an eligible individual does not officially withdraw from a particular course and the individual receives a nonpunitive grade for that course, VA will reduce the individual's educational assistance effective the first date of enrollment for the term in which the grade applies unless mitigating circumstances are found.


(2) If an eligible individual does not officially withdraw from a particular course and the individual receives a nonpunitive grade for that course, VA will reduce the individual's educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the student last attended when mitigating circumstances are found.


(3) If an eligible individual receives an incomplete grade for a course or courses, VA will delay creating an overpayment for such course or courses to allow the individual an opportunity to complete the course or courses. However, if the incomplete grade is not replaced with a punitive grade, VA will reduce the individual's educational assistance in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section effective the earliest of—
