# § 21.9640   Rates of payment of educational assistance.

VA will determine the amount of educational assistance payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 as provided in this section.


(a) *Percentage of maximum amounts payable.* Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, VA will apply the applicable percentage of the maximum amounts payable under this section for pursuit of an approved program of education, in accordance with the following table—


(b) *Maximum amounts payable for training at more than one-half time.* An individual, other than one on active duty, who is pursuing a program of education at more than one-half time (at a rate of pursuit greater than 50 percent) and who—


(1) Is enrolled at an institution of higher learning located in the United States, or at a branch of such institution that is located outside the United States, may receive—


(i) A lump sum amount for established charges paid directly to the institution of higher learning for the entire quarter, semester, or term, as applicable. The amount payable will be the sum of the lower amount of tuition as determined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) and the lower amount of fees as determined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.


(A) The amount of tuition payable is the lesser of—


(*1*) The actual amount of tuition charged by the institution of higher learning; or


(*2*) The maximum amount of tuition regularly charged per credit hour to full-time undergraduate in-State students by the public institution of higher learning having the highest rate of regularly-charged tuition per credit hour in the State in which the individual is enrolled or, if the individual is enrolled at a branch located outside the United States, in the State where the main campus of the institution of higher learning is located, multiplied by the number of credit hours in which the individual is enrolled.


(B) The amount of fees payable is the lesser of—


(*1*) The actual amount of fees charged by the institution of higher learning; or


(*2*) The maximum amount of fees regularly charged full-time undergraduate in-State students in a term, quarter, or semester by the public institution of higher learning having the highest rate of regularly-charged fees in a term, quarter, or semester in the State in which the individual is enrolled or, if the individual is enrolled at a branch located outside the United States, in the State where the main campus of the institution of higher learning is located.


(C) The lesser amount of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, divided by the number of days in the individual's quarter, semester, or term, as applicable, to determine the individual's daily rate which will then be multiplied by the individual's remaining months and days of entitlement to educational assistance in accordance with § 21.4020 and § 21.9635(o);


(ii) Except for individuals pursuing a program of education offered entirely through distance learning, a monthly housing allowance. The monthly housing allowance will be equal to the monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing payable under 37 U.S.C. 403 for a member of the military with dependents in pay grade E-5 using the ZIP code area in which all, or a majority, of the primary institution of higher learning in which the individual is enrolled is located or, if the individual is only pursuing distance learning courses at the primary institution of higher learning, the ZIP code area in which all, or a majority of the institution of higher learning in which the individual is enrolled in one or more resident courses is located; and


(iii) An amount for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs (referred to as the “book stipend”) payable as a lump sum for each quarter, semester, or term. The maximum amount payable to an eligible individual with remaining entitlement is based on pursuit of twenty-four credit hours (the minimum number of credit hours generally considered to be full-time training at the undergraduate level for an academic year). An individual may receive an amount for each credit hour pursued up to twenty-four credit hours (or the equivalent number of credit hours if enrollment is reported in clock hours) in a single academic year. The lump sum payment for each quarter, semester, or term is equal to—


(A) $41.67 ($1,000 divided by 24 credit hours); multiplied by—


(B) The number of credit hours (or the equivalent number of credit hours if enrollment is reported in clock hours) taken by the individual in the quarter, semester, or term, up to a cumulative total of twenty-four credit hours for the academic year.


(2) Is enrolled at an institution of higher learning not located in the United States, may receive—


(i) A lump sum amount for established charges paid directly to the institution of higher learning for the entire quarter, semester, or term, as applicable. The amount payable will be the sum of the lower amount of tuition as determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) and the lower amount of fees as determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section. Prior to comparing the amounts in paragraph ((b)(2)(i)(A) and in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, foreign currency must be converted into United States dollars using the foreign exchange conversion rate as published by the Federal Reserve effective on the first day of the month of July that precedes the beginning date of the individual's enrollment period.


(A) The amount of tuition payable is the lesser of—


(*1*) The actual amount of tuition charged by the institution of higher learning (converted into United States dollars); or


(*2*) The average (*i.e.*, unweighted arithmetic mean) amount of tuition per credit hour regularly charged full-time undergraduate in-State students by public institutions of higher learning throughout the United States as published by VA for the relevant academic year.


(B) The amount of fees payable is the lesser of—


(*1*) The actual amount of fees charged by the institution of higher learning (converted into United States dollars); or

(C) The lesser amount of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, divided by the number of days in the individual's quarter, semester, or term, as applicable, to determine the individual's daily rate which will then be multiplied by the individual's remaining months and days of entitlement to educational assistance in accordance with § 21.4020 and § 21.9635(o);


(ii) Except for individuals pursuing a program of education offered entirely through distance learning, a monthly housing allowance. The monthly housing allowance will be equal to the average (*i.e.*, unweighted arithmetic mean) monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing payable under 37 U.S.C. 403 for a member of the military with dependents in pay grade E-5 residing in the United States; and

The maximum amount payable to an eligible individual with remaining entitlement is based on pursuit of twenty-four credit hours (the minimum number of credit hours generally considered to be full-time training at the undergraduate level for an academic year). An individual may receive an amount for each credit hour pursued up to twenty-four credit hours (or the equivalent number of credit hours if enrollment is reported in clock hours) in a single academic year. The lump sum payment for each quarter, semester, or term is equal to—


(A) $41.67 ($1,000 divided by 24 credit hours); multiplied by—


(B) The number of credit hours (or the equivalent number of credit hours if enrollment is reported in clock hours) taken by the individual in the quarter, semester, or term, up to a cumulative total of twenty-four credit hours for the academic year.


(c) *Maximum amounts payable for training at one-half time or less.* An individual, other than one on active duty, who is pursuing a program of education at one-half time or less (at a rate of pursuit of 50 percent or less) and who—

(*2*) The maximum amount of tuition regularly charged per credit hour to full-time undergraduate in-State students by the public institution of higher learning having the highest rate of regularly-charged tuition per credit hour in the State in which the individual is enrolled or, if the individual is enrolled at a branch located outside the United States, in the State where the main campus of the institution of higher learning is located, multiplied by the number of credit hours in which the individual is enrolled.
