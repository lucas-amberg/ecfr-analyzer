# § 21.9715   Advance payment certification.

All certifications required by this section shall be in a form specified by the Secretary and shall contain such information as specified by the Secretary. An advance payment under this chapter is only permissible to an individual whose rate of pursuit is greater than half-time, and who is entitled to the monthly housing allowance as provided in § 21.9640(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(ii).


(a) *Certification needed before an advance payment can be made.* In order for an individual to receive an advance payment of the monthly housing allowance, an application or other document must be signed by the individual or the enrollment certification must be signed by an authorized official of the institution of higher learning.


(b) *Advance payments.* All verifications required by this paragraph shall be in a form specified by the Secretary and shall contain such information as specified by the Secretary.


(1) For each eligible individual receiving an advance payment, an institution of higher learning must—


(i) Verify enrollment for the individual; and


(ii) Verify the delivery of the advance payment check to the individual.


(2) Once the institution of higher learning has initially verified the enrollment of the individual, the individual, not the institution of higher learning, must make subsequent verifications in order to release further payment for that enrollment as provided in § 21.9730.
