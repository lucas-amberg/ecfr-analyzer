# § 21.9740   False, late, or missing reports.

(a) *Eligible individual.* Payments may not be based on false or misleading statements, claims or reports. VA will apply the provisions of §§ 21.4006 and 21.4007 to any individual who submits false or misleading claims, statements, or reports in connection with benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 in the same manner as they are applied to people who make similar false or misleading claims for benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.


(b) *Institution of higher learning.* (1) VA may hold an institution of higher learning liable for overpayments that result from the institution of higher learning's willful or negligent failure to report excessive absences from a course, discontinuance of a course, or interruption of a course by an individual or from willful or negligent false certification by the institution of higher learning. See § 21.9695(b).


(2) If an institution of higher learning willfully and knowingly submits a false report or certification, VA may disapprove that institution of higher learning's programs of education for further enrollments and may discontinue educational assistance to eligible individuals already enrolled. In doing so, VA will apply §§ 21.4210 through 21.4216.
