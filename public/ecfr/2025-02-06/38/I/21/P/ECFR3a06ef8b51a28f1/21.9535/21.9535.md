# § 21.9535   Extended period of eligibility.

VA will extend an individual's period of eligibility in accordance with the following provisions.


(a) *Disability extension.* (1) VA will grant an extension of the period of eligibility, as determined in § 21.9530 (except for paragraphs (d) and (e)) provided—


(i) The individual applies for the extension within the time specified in § 21.1033(c); and


(ii) The medical evidence clearly establishes that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the original period of eligibility because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the individual's willful misconduct. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. VA will not consider an individual's disability for a period of 30 days or less as having prevented the individual from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the individual was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance due to the short-term disability.


(2) *Length of extension.* An individual's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education. This will be determined as follows—


(i) If the individual is pursuing a program of education organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date the individual was prevented from initiating or completing training during his or her original period of eligibility to the earliest of—


(A) The beginning date of the ordinary term, quarter, or semester following the day the individual's training became medically feasible;


(B) The last date of the individual's original period of eligibility as determined in § 21.9530; or


(C) The date the individual resumed training.


(ii) If the individual is pursuing a program of education that is not organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility will contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date the individual was prevented from initiating or completing training during his or her original period of eligibility to the earliest of—


(A) The date the individual's training became medically feasible; or


(B) The last date of the individual's original period of eligibility as determined in § 21.9530.


(b) *Forcibly detained extension.* (1) VA will grant an extension of the period of eligibility, as determined in § 21.9530, equal to the period of time the individual—


(i) Was captured and forcibly detained by a foreign government or power, and


(ii) Was hospitalized at a military, civilian, or medical facility immediately following release from the foreign government or power.


(2) [Reserved]
