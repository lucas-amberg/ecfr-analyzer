# § 21.9560   Entitlement charges.

(a) *Overview.* Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, VA will base entitlement charges on the principle that an eligible individual who is paid educational assistance for one day of full-time pursuit should be charged one day of entitlement.


(b) *Determining entitlement charge.* (1) VA will make a charge against entitlement as follows:


(i) *Full-time pursuit.* If the individual is pursuing a program of education on a full-time basis, the entitlement charge will be one of the following—


(A) During any period for which VA pays established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the entitlement charge will be one day for each day of the certified enrollment period;


(B) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the entitlement charge will be one day for each day of the certified enrollment period and/or interval period for which the individual receives the monthly housing allowance; or


(C) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1 day for every $41.67 paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the nearest amount evenly divisible by $41.67.


(ii) *Less than full-time pursuit.* If the individual is pursuing a program of education on a less than a full-time basis, the entitlement charge will be one of the following—


(A) During any period for which VA pays established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the individual will be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the certified enrollment period determined by dividing the number of course hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours required for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth);


(B) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the individual will be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the certified enrollment period and/or interval period for which the individual receives the monthly housing allowance determined by dividing the number of course hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours required for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth); or


(C) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1 day for every $41.67 paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the nearest amount evenly divisible by $41.67.


(2) If the individual changes his or her rate of pursuit after the beginning date of the award, VA will—


(i) Divide the certified enrollment period into separate periods of time so that the individual's rate of pursuit is constant within each period; and


(ii) Compute the rate of pursuit separately for each time period.


(c) *Individuals eligible for, or in receipt of, educational assistance other than that authorized under chapter 33.* If an individual elected 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 by relinquishing educational assistance under another program but receives educational assistance for a program of education that is approved under the relinquished chapter but not approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33, VA will make a charge against entitlement equivalent to the entitlement charge—


(1) That would be made under the provisions of § 21.7076, if the individual relinquished eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30;


(2) That would be made under the provisions of § 21.7576 if the individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606; or


(3) That would be made under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607 if the individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607.


(d) *No entitlement charge.* VA will not make a charge against an individual's entitlement—


(1) For an approved licensing or certification test as provided under § 21.9665; or


(2) For tutorial assistance as provided under § 21.9685; or


(3) For the rural relocation benefit as provided under § 21.9660; or


(4) For pursuit of a course or courses when the individual—


(i) Had to discontinue the course or courses as a result of being ordered to—


(A) Active duty service under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304; or


(B) A new duty location or assignment or to perform an increased amount of work; and


(ii) Did not receive credit or lost training time for any portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the eligible individual was pursuing to complete his or her approved educational, professional, or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue pursuit.


(e) *Interruption to conserve entitlement.* An individual may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An institution of higher learning may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter, or semester if the individual is enrolled for the entire term, quarter, or semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the individual is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted for any of the following conditions:


(1) Enrollment is terminated;


(2) The individual cancels his or her enrollment and does not negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for any part of the certified period of enrollment;


(3) The individual interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter, or semester within a certified period of enrollment and does not negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for the succeeding term, quarter, or semester; or


(4) The individual requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation regardless of whether or not the individual negotiated a check or received a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for any part of the certified enrollment period.


(f) *Overpayment cases.* VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy, is waived and not recovered, or is compromised.


(1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).


(2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).


(3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—


(i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees;


(ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balances as determined in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, course costs and marshal fees);


(iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees); and


(iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of entitlement otherwise chargeable for the period of the original overpayment.
