(b) Pending the appointment of a guardian or other fiduciary. 


(c)(1) Where an incompetent veteran without a fiduciary is receiving institutional care by the United States or a political subdivision, his or her benefit may be apportioned for a spouse or child, or, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2), for a dependent parent, unless such benefit is paid to a spouse (“as wife” or “as husband”) for the use of the veteran and his or her dependents. 


(2) Where a married veteran is receiving section 306 or improved pension and the amount payable is reduced under § 3.551(c) because of hospitalization, an apportionment may be paid to the veteran's spouse as provided in § 3.454(b).
