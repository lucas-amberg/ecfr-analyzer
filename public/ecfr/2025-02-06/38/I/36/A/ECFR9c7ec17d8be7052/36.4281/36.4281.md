# ยง 36.4281   Refunding of loans in default.

Upon receiving a notice of default the Secretary may at any time prior to the termination of the borrower's interest in the property require the holder upon penalty of otherwise losing the guaranty to transfer and assign the loan and the security therefor to the Secretary or to another designated by him or her upon receipt of payment of the balance of the indebtedness remaining unpaid to the date of such assignment. Such assignment may be made without recourse but the transferor shall not thereby be relieved from the provisions of ยง 36.4286.
