(a) There shall be no guaranty liability on the part of the Secretary in respect to any loan as to which a signature to the note, the mortgage or other security instrument is a forgery. Except as to a holder who acquired the loan instrument before maturity, for value, and without notice, and who has not directly or by agent participated in the fraud, or in the misrepresentation hereinafter specified, any willful and material misrepresentation or fraud by the lender, or by a holder, or the agent of either, in procuring the guaranty shall relieve the Secretary of liability, or shall constitute a defense against liability on account of the guaranty of the loan in respect to which the willful misrepresentation, or the fraud, is practiced: *Provided,* That if a misrepresentation, although material, is not made willfully, or with fraudulent intent, it shall have only the consequences prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. 


(b) In taking security required by 38 U.S.C. 3712 and the § 36.4200 series, a holder shall obtain the required lien on real property the title to which is such as to be acceptable to prudent lending institutions, informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally in the community in which the property is situated: *Provided,* That a title will not be unacceptable by reason of any of the limitations on the quantum or quality of the property or title stated in § 36.4253. If such holder fails in this respect or fails to comply with any of the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3712 and the § 36.4200 series with respect to: 


(1) Obtaining and retaining a lien of the dignity prescribed on all property upon which a lien is required by 38 U.S.C. 3712 or the § 36.4200 series,

(10) The taking into consideration of limitations upon the quantum or quality of the estate or property, 


(11) Any other requirement of 38 U.S.C. 3712 or the § 36.4200 series which does not by the terms of said section or regulations result in relieving the Secretary of all liability with respect to the loan, 


(c) If after the payment of a guaranty, or after a loan is transferred pursuant to § 36.4281, the fraud, misrepresentation, or failure to comply with the regulations concerning guaranty of loans to veterans as provided in this section is discovered and the Secretary determines that an increased loss to the Government resulted therefrom, the transferee or person to whom such payment was made shall be liable to the Secretary for the amount of the loss caused by such misrepresentation or failure.
