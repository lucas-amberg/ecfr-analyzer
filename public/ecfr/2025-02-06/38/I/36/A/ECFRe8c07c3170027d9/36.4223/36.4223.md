(a) A veteran may refinance [38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F)] an existing Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan to reduce the interest rate payable on the Department of Veterans Affairs loan provided the following requirements are met:


(1) The loan application must be submitted to the Secretary for prior approval unless the veteran is not charged a discount, in which case the loan application may be processed on the automatic basis; 


(2) The loan must be secured by the same real property and/or personal property as the loan being refinanced and the veteran must own the manufactured home and/or manufactured home lot securing the loan; and 


(i) Presently occupy or have previously occupied the manufactured home, a manufactured home on the lot securing the loan, or the manufactured home and the lot securing the loan as his or her home and must certify in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe that the veteran presently or has previously so occupied the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot; or 


(ii) When a veteran is on Active Duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot securing the loan as a home because of such status, the veteran's spouse must occupy or must have previously occupied the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot as the spouse's home and must certify such occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe. 


(3) The amount of the refinancing loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced and such closing costs as authorized in § 36.4232 or § 36.4254, as appropriate, and a discount not to exceed 2 percent of the loan amount;


(4) The dollar amount of the guaranty of the 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) loan may not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced, or 25 percent of the loan; and


(5) The term of the refinancing loan 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced.


(b) Notwithstanding any other regulatory provision, the interest rate reduction refinancing loan may be guaranteed without regard to the amount of guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes available for use by the veteran, and the amount of the veteran's remaining guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes shall not be charged for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan. The interest rate reduction refinancing loan will be guaranteed with the entitlement used by the veteran to obtain the loan being refinanced. The veteran's loan guaranty entitlement used originally for a purpose as enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(A) through (E) or (G) and subsequently transferred for use on an interest rate reduction refinancing loan (38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F)) shall be eligible for restoration when the interest rate reduction refinancing loan or subsequent interest rate reduction refinancing loan on the same property meets the requirements of § 36.4203(a).


(c) Title to the security which is refinanced for the purpose of an interest rate reduction must be in conformity with § 36.4234, and/or § 36.4253, as appropriate.
