In cases where intervening circumstances make it impracticable to complete the actual paying out of the loan originally proposed, or justify the lender in declining to make further disbursements on a construction loan, evidence of guaranty or of insurance of the loan or the proper pro rata part thereof will be issuable if the loan is otherwise eligible for automatic guaranty or a certificate of commitment was issued thereon: Provided,


(a) A report of the loan is submitted to the Secretary within a reasonable time subsequent to the last disbursement, but in no event more than 90 days thereafter, unless report of the facts and circumstances is made and an extension of time obtained from the Secretary.


(b) There has been no default on the loan, except that the existence of a default shall not preclude issuance of a guaranty certificate or insurance advice if a certificate of commitment was issued with respect to the loan.


(c) The Secretary determines that a person of reasonable prudence similarly situated would not make further disbursements in the situation presented.


(d) There has been full compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and of the applicable regulations up to the time of the last disbursement.


(e) In the case of a construction loan when the construction is not fully completed, the amount and percentage of the guaranty and the amount of the loan for the purposes of insurance or accounting to the Secretary shall be based upon such portion of the amount disbursed out of the proceeds of the loan which, when added to any other payments made by or on behalf of the veteran to the builder or the contractor, does not exceed 80 percent of the value of that portion of the construction performed (basing value on the contract price) plus the sum, if any, disbursed by the lender out of the proceeds of the loan for the land on which the construction is situated: And provided further, That the lender shall certify as follows:


(1) Any amount advanced for land is protected by title or lien as provided in the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans; and


(2) No enforceable liens, for any work done or material furnished for that part of the construction completed and for which payment has been made out of the proceeds of the loan, exist or can come into existence.
