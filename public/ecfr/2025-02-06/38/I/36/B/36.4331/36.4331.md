# § 36.4331   Capacity of parties to contract.

Nothing in §§ 36.4300 through 36.4380 shall be construed to relieve any lender of responsibility otherwise existing, for any loss caused by the lack of legal capacity of any person to contract, convey, or encumber, or caused by the existence of other legal disability or defects invalidating, or rendering unenforceable in whole or in part, either the loan obligation or the security therefor.
