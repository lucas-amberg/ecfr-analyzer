# ยง 36.4802   General purpose of the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program.

The COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program is a temporary program to help veterans who have suffered a COVID-19 financial hardship. Notwithstanding the requirements elsewhere in this part regarding payment of a guaranty claim or refunding a loan, VA may assist a veteran exiting a COVID-19 forbearance by purchasing from the servicer the veteran's COVID-19 indebtedness. Such a purchase is called a partial claim payment. In exchange for VA's partial claim payment on behalf of the veteran, the veteran must agree to repay the Secretary, in the amount of such partial claim payment, upon loan terms established by the Secretary.
