(i) Chemical restraint is the inappropriate use of a sedating psychotropic drug to manage or control behavior.


(ii) Physical restraint is any method of physically restricting a person's freedom of movement, physical activity or normal access to his or her body. Bed rails and vest restraints are examples of physical restraints.


(2) The facility management uses a system to achieve a restraint-free environment.


(3) The facility management collects data about the use of restraints.


(4) When alternatives to the use of restraint are ineffective, a restraint must be safely and appropriately used.


(b) *Abuse.* The resident has the right to be free from mental, physical, sexual, and verbal abuse or neglect, corporal punishment, and involuntary seclusion.


(1) Mental abuse includes humiliation, harassment, and threats of punishment or deprivation.


(2) Physical abuse includes hitting, slapping, pinching, or kicking. Also includes controlling behavior through corporal punishment.


(3) Sexual abuse includes sexual harassment, sexual coercion, and sexual assault.


(4) Neglect is any impaired quality of life for an individual because of the absence of minimal services or resources to meet basic needs. Includes withholding or inadequately providing food and hydration (without physician, resident, or surrogate approval), clothing, medical care, and good hygiene. May also include placing the individual in unsafe or unsupervised conditions.


(5) Involuntary seclusion is a resident's separation from other residents or from the resident's room against his or her will or the will of his or her legal representative.


(c) *Staff treatment of residents.* The facility management must develop and implement written policies and procedures that prohibit mistreatment, neglect, and abuse of residents and misappropriation of resident property.


(1) The facility management must:


(i) Not employ individuals who—


(A) Have been found guilty of abusing, neglecting, or mistreating individuals by a court of law; or


(B) Have had a finding entered into an applicable State registry or with the applicable licensing authority concerning abuse, neglect, mistreatment of individuals or misappropriation of their property; and


(ii) Report any knowledge it has of actions by a court of law against an employee, which would indicate unfitness for service as a nurse aide or other facility staff to the State nurse aide registry or licensing authorities.


(2) The facility management must ensure that all alleged violations involving mistreatment, neglect, or abuse, including injuries of unknown source, and misappropriation of resident property are reported immediately to the administrator of the facility and to other officials in accordance with State law through established procedures.


(3) The facility management must have evidence that all alleged violations are thoroughly investigated, and must prevent further potential abuse while the investigation is in progress.


(4) The results of all investigations must be reported to the administrator or the designated representative and to other officials in accordance with State law within 5 working days of the incident, and appropriate corrective action must be taken if the alleged violation is verified.
