# ยง 61.5   Implementation of VA Limits on Payments due to Funding Restrictions.

(a) *Continuing payments.* Once a grant agreement is awarded by VA, payments will continue for the time frame specified in the federal award, subject to the availability of funds, as long as the recipient continues to provide the supportive services and housing described in its grant application, meets VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem (GPD) Program performance goals, and meets the applicable requirements of this part.


(b) *Factors.* (1) In cases of limited availability of funding during the time frame specified in the federal award, VA may terminate the payment of per diem payments to recipients after weighing the following factors:


(i) Non-duplication of ongoing services and equitable distribution of grant agreements across geographic regions, including rural communities and tribal lands;


(ii) Receipt by recipient of any capital investment from VA or any other source; and


(iii) Recipient's demonstrated compliance with GPD performance goals.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, when an awarded grant agreement is terminated during the time frame specified in the federal award due to no fault by the recipient, VA shall refrain from applying the recapture provisions of 38 CFR 61.67.
