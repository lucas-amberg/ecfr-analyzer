(2) Verification of veteran status (DD214, Department of Veterans Affairs confirmation report and/or identification card).

To calculate the occupancy rate, divide the actual number of bed days of care for veterans eligible to reside in the project, by the total number of possible bed days of care (the previous 180 days from the most current 6 month period).
