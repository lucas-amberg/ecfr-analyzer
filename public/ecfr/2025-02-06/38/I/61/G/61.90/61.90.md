# § 61.90   Grant for case management services—program.

(a) *General.* VA may award grants for case management services to non-profit organizations and State, local and tribal governments for the provision of case management services to improve the retention of housing by veterans who were previously homeless and are transitioning to permanent housing and to veterans who are at risk of becoming homeless. (For purposes of this program, the term “tribal government” means an entity described in paragraph (2) of the definition of “public entity” in 38 CFR 61.1.) The goals of the grant program are: The maintenance of permanent housing by a veteran following discharge from homeless residential services, a reduction in recidivism, and an increase in exits to permanent housing. These grant funds may not be used for veterans who are receiving case management services from permanent supportive housing programs (*e.g.* Housing and Urban Development—VA Supportive Housing) or rapid re-housing/homeless prevention programs (*e.g.* Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF)).


(b) *Case management services.* Case management services include, but are not limited to, the following:


(1) Making home visits by the case manager to monitor housing stability;


(2) Providing or coordinating educational activities related to meal planning, tenant responsibilities, the use of public transportation, community resources, financial management, and the development of natural supports;


(3) Making referrals to needed services, such as mental health, substance use disorder, medical, and employment services; and


(4) Participating in case conferencing with other service providers who are working with the veteran.


(c) *Time limit.* Case management services may be provided for a particular veteran for up to 6 months, unless VA receives and approves a written request for additional time before the 6-month time limit expires.
