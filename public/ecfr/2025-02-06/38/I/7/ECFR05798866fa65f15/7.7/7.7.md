(a) The phrase *maturity of a policy as a death claim or otherwise* (SSCRA, as amended) will not include a termination or maturity of a policy as a disability claim, and the policy will continue under the provisions of the Act as if there had been no maturity, but the Government shall not be liable for any premiums that the insured would have been relieved of paying under any provisions for payment of premiums in the policy. 


(b) Upon the expiration of the period of protection, the insurer will submit to the Department of Veterans Affairs a complete statement of the account on each policy, which will show the amount of indebtedness by reason of the premiums with interest and the credits, if any, then available and will be subject to audit and approval by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The statement of account will include the rate of interest charged on all indebtedness, the date of debit and credit entries, and such other information as may be deemed necessary in making an audit of the account.
