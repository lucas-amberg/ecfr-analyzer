# ยง 76.2   Assistance allowance.

(a) VA will pay an allowance to a veteran with a disability who is:


(1) Invited by the United States Paralympics (USP) to compete for a slot on, or selected for, the USP Team for any month or part of any month in which the veteran is training or competing in any event sponsored by the USP or the IPC; or


(2) Residing at a USP training center in connection with any paralympic training or competition for the period certified under ยง 76.3.


(b) In providing this allowance, VA will periodically assess funding for the allowance. If a periodic assessment reveals that funding is insufficient to pay all applicants, VA will first pay in full veterans with service-connected disabilities, and then pay others in full in the order in which their completed applications are received.
