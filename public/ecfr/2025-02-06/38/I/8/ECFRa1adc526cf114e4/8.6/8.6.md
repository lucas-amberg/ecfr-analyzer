(d) For purposes of determining a veteran's eligibility for VALife under 38 U.S.C. 1922B(a)(3)(B), with respect to a veteran who has attained 81 years of age, an initial grant of service connection for a new or secondary condition for which the veteran applied for disability compensation before attaining 81 years of age will satisfy the eligibility criteria; however, VA will not grant insurance to such a veteran based on an increase in an existing disability rating, a grant of individual unemployability under 38 CFR 4.18, or a finding of incompetency under 38 CFR 3.353. VA will not issue a VALife policy to a veteran over age 95.
