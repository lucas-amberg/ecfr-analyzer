# § 80.12   Grantee reporting requirements.

(a) *Quarterly reports.* All grantees must submit to VA quarterly reports, as required in the NOFO, within 30 days after the last day of each quarter based on the Federal fiscal year—with the first report due not later than 30 days after the last day of the quarter for which a grant is paid under this part—which includes the following information:


(1) Record of time and resources expended in outreach activities and the methods used;


(2) The number of participants served, including demographics of this population;


(3) Types of assistance provided;


(4) A full accounting of VSTAGP grant funds received from VA and used or unused funds during the quarter; and


(5) Results of routine monitoring and any project variations.


(b) *Final report.* Per 2 CFR 200.344, all grantees must submit to VA, not later than 120 days after the last day of the grant period (as defined in the NOFO) for which a grant is awarded under this part, a final report that meets the requirement set forth in the NOFO. The last quarterly performance and financial report received will be recorded as the final report. The financial report shall be noted as “Final” on the SF-425 Federal Financial Report.


(c) *Additional reports.* VA may request additional reports to allow VA to assess project accountability and effectiveness. In addition, recipients are required to participate in a VA-led evaluation if selected, which may be carried out by a third-party on behalf of VA.
