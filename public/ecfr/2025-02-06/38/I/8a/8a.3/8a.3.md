(a) Where the grant was approved prior to August 11, 1971, VMLI shall be effective August 11, 1971, if on that date, the eligible individual was obligated under a mortgage loan, and any such eligible individual is automatically insured, unless he or she elects in writing not to be insured, or fails to respond within 60 days after the date a final request is made or mailed to the eligible individual for information on which his or her premium can be based. 


(b) Where the grant is approved on or after August 11, 1971, VMLI shall be effective on the date of approval of the grant, if on that date the eligible individual is obligated under a mortgage loan, and any such eligible individual is automatically insured, unless he or she elects in writing not to be insured, or fails to respond within 60 days after the date a final request is made or mailed to the eligible individual for information on which his or her premium can be based. 


(c) In any case in which an individual would have been eligible for VMLI on August 11, 1971, or on the date of approval of his or her grant, whichever date is the later date, but such insurance did not become effective because he or she was not obligated under a mortgage loan on that date, or because he or she elected in writing not to be insured, or failed to timely respond to a request for information on which his or her premium could be based, the insurance will be effective on a date agreed upon by the individual and the Secretary, but only if the individual files an application in writing with the Department of Veterans Affairs for such insurance, submits evidence that he or she meets the health requirements of the Secretary, together with information on which his or her premiums can be based, and is or becomes obligated under a mortgage loan upon the date agreed upon as the effective date of his or her insurance. 


(d) In any case in which an eligible individual disposes of the housing unit purchased, constructed or remodeled in part with a grant, or a subsequently acquired housing unit, and becomes obligated under a mortgage loan on another housing unit occupied or to be occupied by the eligible individual, the insurance will be effective upon a date requested by the individual and agreed to by the Secretary, but only if the eligible individual files an application for such insurance, submits evidence that he or she meets the health requirements of the Secretary, furnishes information on which his or her premium can be based, and is or becomes obligated under a mortgage loan on the date the insurance is to become effective. 


(e) In any case where an eligible individual insured under VMLI, refinances the mortgage loan which is the basis for such insurance on his or her life, any increase in the amount of insurance or any delay in the rate of reduction of insurance will be effective only if the eligible individual files an application for insurance, submits evidence that he or she meets the health requirements of the Secretary, and furnishes information on which his or her premium can be based.
