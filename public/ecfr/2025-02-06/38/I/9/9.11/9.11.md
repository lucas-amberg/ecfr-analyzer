In the event of a merger, the 5-year requirement may be satisfied by either the surviving company or by one of the absorbed companies. Upon joint application by a subsidiary of a participating company, together with the parent company, the 5-year requirement may be waived provided such parent company owns more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of the subsidiary and has been a legal reserve life insurance company for a period of 10 years or more. 


(c) The company must be licensed to engage in life insurance in at least one State of the United States or the District of Columbia.

(2) That solicits life insurance applications as conversion or other replacement of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group Life Insurance coverage in jurisdictions in which it is not licensed. 


(3) That fails to take effective action to correct an improper practice followed by it or its agents within 30 days after written receipt of notice issued by the insurer or the Assistant Director for Insurance. Improper practice includes:
