# ยง 9.24   Insurable dependents who become eligible members, and eligible members who marry eligible members.

(a) A Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance-covered member (member) who marries another Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance eligible member (member spouse) after January 1, 2013, or is married to a person who becomes a Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance eligible member after January 1, 2013, shall receive Family Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance spousal coverage at the statutory maximum amount or a lesser amount, or receive increased existing spousal coverage on their member spouse, upon an election of such coverage if made within 240 days following the member's marriage to another member, or the member's spouse entering service, without having to provide proof of the member spouse's good health. If a member does not elect coverage for a member spouse within 240 days following the member's marriage to another member, or the member's spouse entering service, then the member may still receive spousal coverage at the statutory maximum amount or a lesser amount, or increase existing spousal coverage, by applying and submitting proof of the member spouse's good health.


(b) A spouse shall remain eligible to be covered by any existing Family Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance spousal coverage without the member electing such coverage or applying for such coverage with proof of the member spouse's good health in a case where the spouse is enrolled in coverage under 38 U.S.C. 1967(a)(1)(A)(ii) or (C)(ii) prior to becoming a member married to another member.


(c) A member's spouse who was insured under the member's Family Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance at the time the spouse separates from service will continue to be covered under the spousal Family Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance carried while in service, and the member will not need to elect such coverage. If a member seeks to enroll a former member spouse who did not have such spousal insurance coverage when the former member spouse separates from service, or seeks to increase existing spousal coverage on their former member spouse, the member shall receive such spousal coverage on their former member spouse, upon an election of such coverage if made within 240 days following the former member spouse's separation from service, without having to provide proof of the former member spouse's good health. If a member does not elect coverage for a former member spouse within 240 days following the former member spouse's separation from service, then the member may still receive spousal coverage at the statutory maximum amount or a lesser amount, or increase existing spousal coverage, by applying and submitting proof of the former member spouse's good health.


(d) After January 1, 2013, an insurable child who is a member at the time a parent's Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance coverage commences is not eligible for automatic dependent coverage under 38 U.S.C. 1967(a)(1)(A)(ii) or (C)(ii). Dependent coverage in effect for an insurable child prior to becoming a member shall remain in effect so long as the child remains an insurable dependent. If an insurable child was not covered prior to becoming a member, the child cannot be covered under 38 U.S.C. 1967(a)(1)(A)(ii) or (C)(ii) after the child becomes a member.
