# § 6.3   Notice of meetings.

The Chairman or the members of the Board may give the notice required under § 6.1 or § 6.2 of these bylaws in oral, written, or e-mail form. Oral notice to a member may be delivered by telephone and is sufficient if made to the member personally or to a responsible person in the member's home or office. Any oral notice to a member must be subsequently confirmed by written or e-mail notice. Written notice to a member may be delivered by mail addressed to the member's mailing address of record filed with the Secretary. Notice by e-mail may be addressed to the member's e-mail address of record filed with the Secretary. Except for written or e-mail notice confirming a previous oral notice, a written or e-mail notice must be sent in sufficient time to reach the address of record at least 2 days before the meeting date under normal delivery conditions. A member waives notice of any meeting by attending the meeting, and may otherwise waive notice of any meeting at any time. No notice—whether oral, written, or e-mail—to the Secretary is sufficient until actually received by the Secretary. The Secretary may not waive notice of any meeting.
