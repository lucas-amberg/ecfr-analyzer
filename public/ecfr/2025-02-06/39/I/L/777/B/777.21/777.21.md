# ยง 777.21   General procedures.

(a) *Planning Prior to Site Selection.* When acquisition of a site under consideration would likely involve displacement of a person eligible under ยง 777.13 for relocation assistance, the Postal Service representative shall prepare a relocation needs and availability analysis. The Postal Service representative shall include in the analysis a complete inventory of persons who may be displaced and specifically identify their needs.


(b) *Planning Subsequent to Site Selection.* Subsequent to site selection, the Postal Service must review the relocation needs and availability analysis and establish a specific plan for providing the assistance covered by these regulations to any eligible displaced persons. It will further determine the necessity of establishing an on-site relocation office which would be accessible to displaced persons and would be staffed with relocation personnel qualified to render all relocation services. The Postal Service will assure that cost estimates reflect current market conditions and that funding is available for all relocation assistance and activities.


(c) *Contracting for Relocation Services.* When the Postal Service determines it to be advantageous, it may enter into a relocation assistance service contract with a public agency or private firm having expertise in relocation assistance. The contract must require the contractor to follow Postal Service relocation assistance regulations.


(d) *Notice to Vacate, Ninety Day Requirement.* Postal Service notices to vacate must be issued at least 90 days prior to the date the property must be vacated. Any such notice must be in writing and delivered in person with receipt acknowledged, or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The 90-day requirement does not apply to any such notice issued subsequent to a valid notice to vacate issued by the prior owner of the property. A 90-day notice may be given with, or such notice may be combined with, but such notice must not be given before, the notice of displacement referred to in paragraph (f) of this section.


(e) *Shorter Notice Period, Unusual Circumstances.* An occupant may be required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written notice if the Postal Service determines that a 90-day notice is impracticable. An example of such a situation is when the person's continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial danger to the person's health or safety.


(f) *Notice of Displacement.* Normally, a notice of displacement will be given at the time of acquisition or later. Such notice must not be given earlier than the time of contracting, except in the case of acquisitions by eminent domain or by the threat of eminent domain. Such notice may be given at the time of contracting or between the time of contracting and the time of acquisition if the Postal Service considers it wise to start the displacement process then and if, in the judgment of the Postal Service, it is clear that person will in fact be a displaced person.


(g) *Notice of Availability of Advisory Services.* The notice of displacement will state that relocation assistance advisory services will be available to the displaced person and will designate who will provide such services.


(h) *Eviction for cause.* Any person occupying real property and not in unlawful occupancy on the date of initiation of negotiations is presumed to be entitled to relocation payments and other assistance unless the Postal Service determines that:


(1) The person received an eviction notice prior to initiation of negotiations and, as a result of that notice, is later evicted; or


(2) The person is evicted after initiation of negotiations for serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement; and 


(3) In either case the eviction is not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to make the relocation payments and other assistance available.
