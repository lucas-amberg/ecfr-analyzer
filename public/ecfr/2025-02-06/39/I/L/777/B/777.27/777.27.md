# § 777.27   Last resort housing.

(a) *Basic Determination to Provide Last Resort Housing.* A displaced person cannot be required to move from his or her dwelling unless at least one comparable replacement dwelling is made available to him or her which is within his or her financial means. When such comparable replacement dwelling is not available, additional measures may be taken to provide for “last resort” housing for eligible displaced persons.


(b) *Basic Rights of Persons to be Displaced.* The provisions of this section do not deprive any displaced person of any rights the person may have under these regulations such as the right to accept the maximum replacement housing payment available under these regulations and to move to a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling even if such dwelling is beyond the person's financial means.


(c) *Methods of Providing Replacement Housing.* The Postal Service has broad latitude in implementing this section, but implementation must be on a reasonable cost basis. The Postal Service may provide last resort housing using the following methods:


(1) Rehabilitation of and/or additions to an existing replacement dwelling.


(2) The construction of a new replacement dwelling.


(3) The provision of a direct loan which requires regular amortization or deferred repayment. Terms of such loan will be at the discretion of the Postal Service.


(4) A replacement housing payment in excess of the $5,250 and $22,500 limitations contained in § 777.24. A rental subsidy under this section may be provided in installments.


(5) The relocation and any needed rehabilitation of a replacement dwelling.


(6) The purchase or lease of land and/or a replacement dwelling by the Postal Service and subsequent sale or lease to, or exchange with, a displaced person.


(7) The removal of barriers to the handicapped.


(8) Any other method determined by the Postal Service to be reasonable.


(d) *Proof of Financial Need.* Last Resort Housing benefits exceeding the limitations under § 777.24(b)(2) and § 777.24(e)(2) will not be paid unless required to provide housing within the displaced person's financial means. To establish financial means, the displaced person must furnish the Postal Service proof of gross monthly income through income tax returns, certified financial statements or other reasonable evidence which the Postal Service determines is satisfactory.
