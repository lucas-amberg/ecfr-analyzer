# § 778.1   What is the purpose of these regulations?

(a) The regulations in this part implement Executive Order 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,” issued July 14, 1982 and amended on April 8, 1983. These regulations also implement applicable provisions of section 401 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968, which the Postal Service follows as a matter of policy.


(b) These regulations are intended to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened Federalism by relying on state processes and on state, areawide, regional and local coordination for review of proposed direct federal development projects.


(c) These regulations are not intended to create any right or benefit enforceable at law by a party against the Postal Service or its officers.


(d) These regulations implement Executive Order 12372 and are adopted under the Postal Reorganization Act rather than the statute and Executive Order listed in paragraph (a) of this section to the extent the statute and Executive Order do not apply to the Postal Service under 39 U.S.C. 410(a).
