Where an apparent owner of property subject to this part is known, the Chief Postal Inspector or delegate will mail, by certified mail to the apparent owner's last known address, written notice describing the property and the procedure for filing a claim for its return (see §§ 946.3 and 946.7). Such claims must be filed within 30 days from the date the notice is postmarked.
