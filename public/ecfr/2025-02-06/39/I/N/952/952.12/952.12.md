# ยง 952.12   Amendment of pleadings.

(a) Amendments shall be filed with the Recorder.


(b) By consent of the parties, a pleading may be amended at any time. Also, a party may move to amend a pleading at any time prior to the close of the hearing and, provided that the amendment is reasonably within the scope of the proceeding initiated by the complaint, the presiding officer rule on the motion as he or she deems to be fair and equitable to the parties.


(c) When issues not raised by the pleadings but reasonably within the scope of the proceedings initiated by the complaint are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendments as may be necessary to conform the pleadings to the evidence and to raise such issues may be allowed at any time upon the motion of any party.


(d) If a party objects to the introduction of evidence at the hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, but fails to satisfy the presiding officer that an amendment of the pleadings would prejudice him or her on the merits, the presiding officer may allow the pleadings to be amended and may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to rebut the evidence presented.


(e) The presiding officer may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit service of a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions, occurrences, or events which have occurred since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented and which are relevant to any of the issues involved.
