# ยง 3006.101   Commission policy.

(a) The Commission shall be proactive and timely in identifying and posting public records and other frequently requested records to its website.


(b) It is the stated policy of the Commission that FOIA requests shall be administered with a clear presumption of openness. The Commission will only withhold information if it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, such as information specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (for example 39 U.S.C. 410(c)), or disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law. Publicly available information regarding exemptions and examples of exempt information are available at the Department of Justice's FOIA website, *https://www.foia.gov.*

(c) This Commission policy does not create any right enforceable in court.
