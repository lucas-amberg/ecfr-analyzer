# § 3006.200   Procedures for submitting requests.

(a) *Electronic submission requirements.* A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is submitted electronically. An electronic request may be submitted via the Commission's online FOIA request form that is accessible through the Commission's website (*https://www.prc.gov*), emailing *FOIA@prc.gov,* or the web portal at *https://www.foia.gov/.* Each electronic request must:


(1) Reasonably describe the records sought;


(2) Identify the request category under § 3006.301; and


(3) Include the requester's name, daytime telephone number, and a valid email or mailing address to receive records and written communications from the Commission regarding the request.


(b) *Hard copy submission requirements.* A requester may also submit a request for records via hard copy. Each hard copy request must:


(1) Be in writing;


(2) Be clearly identified as “Freedom of Information Act Request” both in the text of the request and on the envelope;


(3) Be submitted to the Commission's office (901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001);


(4) Reasonably describe the records sought; and


(5) Include the requester's name, daytime telephone number, and a valid email or mailing address to receive records and written communications from the Commission regarding the request.


(c) *Content of request.* Each request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Commission personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should include specific information about each record sought that might assist the Commission in responding to the request, such as the type of record (*e.g.,* contract, report, memorandum, etc.); the title or docket number of a specific document or report; the topic or subject matter; the name of the office and/or employees most likely to possess the record; the date or general timeframe of the record's creation; and any details related to the purpose of the record. Requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. Before submitting requests, a requester may contact the Chief FOIA Officer (or the individual's designee) or the FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records sought and to receive assistance in describing the records. The request may also specify the requester's preferred method of communication (telephone, email, or mailing address) and the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the requested records.


(d) *Improper requests.* A request that does not reasonably describe the records sought or does not comply with the published rules regarding the procedures to be followed for submitting a request will be deemed to be an improper FOIA request. If the Commission does not receive the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort, then the Commission will administratively close the file.


(1) If after receiving a request, the Commission determines that it is improper, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will provide one written notification to the requester using the contact information included in the request. The notification will inform the requester of all the following:


(i) The reason(s) why the request is improper;


(ii) The additional information needed from the requester that would reasonably describe the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort;


(iii) The Commission will not be able to comply with the request unless the Commission receives such additional information in writing within the specified timeframe and if the Commission does not receive a written response containing the additional information needed within the specified timeframe, then it will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the records and will administratively close the file on the request;


(iv) The preferred method for the requester to provide the additional information is by emailing *FOIA@prc.gov;*

(v) The requester may also provide the additional information by mailing or by hand delivery during regular business hours (which are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, except for Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) to the Office of Secretary and Administration, Postal Regulatory Commission, 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001); and


(vi) The contact information for the Chief FOIA Officer (or the individual's designee) and the FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought.


(2) If the requester provides the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort by the timeframe specified in the notification, then the Commission will confirm receipt of the information and process the request.


(3) After administrative closure, if the Commission receives the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort, then the Commission will notify the requester that the request will be processed as a new request.


(e) *Expedited processing.* At any time, a requester that has satisfied all applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section may seek expedited processing of a request or an administrative appeal. To seek expedited processing, the requester must:


(1) Include “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Request” or “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Appeal” in the body of the submission;


(2) For any hard copy submission, include “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Request” or “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Appeal” on the envelope;


(3) Demonstrate a compelling need as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(v); and


(4) Certify the statement of compelling need to be true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. The Commission has discretion to waive the certification requirement.
