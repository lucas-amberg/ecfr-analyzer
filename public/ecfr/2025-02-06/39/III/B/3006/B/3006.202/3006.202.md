# ยง 3006.202   Responses to requests.

(a) *In general.* To the extent practicable and unless the request indicates a different preferred method of communication, the Commission will communicate with the requester electronically (such as via email). In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission will include only records in its possession and control on the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the Commission shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to the request.


(b) *Acknowledgments of requests.* The Commission shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) to process. The acknowledgment must include a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to keep track of their requests more easily.


(c) *Grants of requests.* Once the Commission makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee shall notify the requester in writing. The Commission also shall inform the requester of any fees charged and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Commission must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.


(d) *Adverse determinations of requests.* If the Commission makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, then the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.


(e) *Content of denials.* The denial shall be signed by the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee and shall include:


(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;


(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the Commission in denying the request;


(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;


(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under ยง 3006.203, and a description of the requirements; and


(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.


(f) *Markings on released documents.* Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part shall be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.


(g) *Use of record exclusions.* (1) If the Commission identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the Commission must confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.


(2) Upon invoking an exclusion, the Commission must maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of exclusion by OIP.
