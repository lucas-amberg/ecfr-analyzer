# § 3010.100   Applicability and scope.

(a) The rules in this part apply to practice before the Postal Regulatory Commission.


(b) When a general rule conflicts with a rule governing a specific practice area, the rule governing the specific practice area shall take precedence.


(c) The rules in this part shall be liberally construed to secure a just and speedy determination of issues. They permit the informal disposition of any matter for which formal procedures are not specifically required by statute.


(d) Except when specifically required by statute, the rules in this part may be waived for good cause and appropriate alternative procedures may be prescribed.


(e) The rules in this part shall be referred to as the “rules of practice.” Rules are to be cited using only the numbers and letters to the right of the decimal point. For example, paragraph (a) of “§ 3010.120 Filing material with the Commission” shall be referred to as “section 120(a) of the rules of practice (39 CFR 3-1-.120(a))” or as “rule 120(a)” (39 CFR 3010.120(a)).
