(b) *Authority to act.* When an officer or an attorney acting in a representative capacity appears in person, submits a document to the Commission using the Filing Online system as a principal account holder, or signs a paper filed with the Commission, the personal appearance, online submission, or signature, shall constitute a representation to the Commission that that individual is authorized to represent the particular person on whose behalf the individual acts. Any individual appearing before or transacting business with the Commission in a representative capacity may be required by the Commission or the presiding officer to file evidence of the individual's authority to act in such capacity.


(c) *Notice of appearance and withdrawal of appearance.* An individual intending to appear before the Commission or its presiding officer in a representative capacity in a proceeding before the Commission shall file with the Commission a notice of appearance in the form prescribed by the Secretary unless that individual is named in an initial filing of the person whom the individual represents as the individual to whom communications from the Commission in regard to the filing are to be addressed. An individual whose authority to represent a person in a specific Commission proceeding has been terminated shall file a timely notice of withdrawal of appearance with the Commission.

Contumacious conduct at any hearing before the Commission or its presiding officer shall be grounds for exclusion of any individual from such hearing and for summary suspension for the duration of the hearing by the Commission or the presiding officer.
