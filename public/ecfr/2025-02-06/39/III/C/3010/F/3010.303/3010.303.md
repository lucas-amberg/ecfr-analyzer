# ยง 3010.303   Hearing format.

(a) In any case noticed for a proceeding to be determined on the record, the Commission or the presiding officer, if one has been appointed, may determine whether to hold a public hearing, or to hold a hearing by written submission of material only. A public hearing may be held if a hearing is requested by any party to the proceeding or if the Commission determines that a hearing is in the public interest. Generally, public hearings provide an opportunity for oral cross-examination of witnesses whereas hearings held by written submission of material only do not.


(b) Once established, requests to change the hearing format may be proposed by motion, or by the Commission's or presiding officer's own motion.


(c) Only representatives of the Commission, parties that have intervened in a proceeding, or persons intending to intervene prior to the deadline for notices of intervention may participate in a public hearing. However, public hearings are generally open to the public for observation. Public hearings may be closed to the public for good cause, or when confidential material is being presented.
