# ยง 3010.313   Requests for admissions for purpose of discovery.

(a) *Service and content.* In the interest of expedition, any party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only, of any relevant, unprivileged facts, including the genuineness of any documents or exhibits to be presented in the hearing. Each requested admission shall be set forth separately and shall be deemed admitted unless within 14 days after the request is filed (or such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer) the party to whom the request is directed files a written answer denying the requested admission pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or objecting pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The party requesting an admission shall file its request with the Commission and serve the request on the responding party.


(b) *Answers.* Answers that fail to admit a matter as requested shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission. When a party qualifies an answer or denies only a part of the admission requested, the party shall specify so much of the requested admission as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. A failure to admit or deny for lack of information or knowledge shall not be made unless the responding party states that it has made a reasonable inquiry and that information known or readily obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny. A party who answers a request for admission shall file its answer with the Commission and serve the answer on the requesting party.


(c) *Objections.* If an objection is made, the grounds for such objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If an objection is made to part of an item, the part to which an objection is made shall be specified. A party claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege asserted and state the reasons for its applicability. A party claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the effort that would be required to answer the request, providing estimates of cost and work hours required to the extent possible. Objections shall be filed with the Commission and served on the requesting party, within ten days of the request for admissions.


(d) *Motions to compel responses to requests for admissions.* The party who has requested an admission may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Motions to compel a more responsive answer, or an answer to a request to which an objection was interposed, shall be filed within 14 days of the answer or objection to the request for admissions. The text of the request for admissions, and any answer provided, should be provided as an attachment to the motion to compel. Parties who have objected to requests for admissions which are the subject of a motion to compel shall have seven days to file a response. Responses will be considered supplements to the arguments presented in the initial objection.


(e) *Compelled answers.* The Commission or the presiding officer may compel answers to a request for admissions to which an objection has been raised if the objection is overruled. Such compelled answers shall be filed with the Commission and served on the requesting party within seven days of the date of the order compelling production or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or the presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing. If the Commission or presiding officer determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be filed.
