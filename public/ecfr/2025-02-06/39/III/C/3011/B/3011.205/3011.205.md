# § 3011.205   Non-public materials inadvertently submitted publicly.

(a) Any filer or person with a proprietary interest that discovers the inclusion of materials that could have been subject to a claim for non-public treatment are contained within a public filing made in accordance with subpart B to part 3010 of this chapter shall telephone Dockets personnel immediately to request that the non-public materials be removed from the publicly available materials. Upon receipt of that telephone request, Dockets personnel will remove from the publicly available materials those materials for which non-public treatment are being requested until the end of the next business day in order to provide the filer or person with a proprietary interest an opportunity to file an application for non-public treatment and the non-public materials in accordance with the requirements of this subpart. If any filer makes repeated use of this rule, the Secretary has discretion to impose additional requirements on this filer as necessary to ensure secure filing of non-public materials.


(b) Any submitter or person with a proprietary interest that discovers the inclusion of materials that could have been subject to a claim for non-public treatment are contained within a publicly available submission made to the Commission in circumstances other than through a public filing made in accordance with subpart B to part 3010 of this chapter shall telephone the Commission personnel to whom the submission was directed immediately to request that the non-public materials be removed from the publicly available materials. Upon receipt of that telephone request, the Commission personnel will remove from the publicly available materials those materials for which non-public treatment are being requested until the end of the next business day in order to provide the submitter or person with a proprietary interest an opportunity to submit an application for non-public treatment and the non-public materials in accordance with the requirements of this subpart. If any submitter makes repeated use of this rule, the Secretary has discretion to impose additional requirements on this submitter as necessary to ensure secure submission of non-public materials.


(c) An application for non-public treatment made under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall also clearly indicate if any special relief is sought. Examples of special relief include a request that any person not granted access to the materials under § 3011.300 or § 3011.301 perform any or all of the following actions:


(1) Immediately destroy or return all versions of the materials that are claimed to have been inadvertently submitted publicly;


(2) Refrain from disclosing or using the materials, and the information contained therein, that are claimed to be non-public; and


(3) Take reasonable steps to retrieve any materials, and the information contained therein, that are claimed to be non-public and were disclosed to any person not granted access to the materials under § 3011.300 or § 3011.301 prior to the submission of application for non-public treatment.
