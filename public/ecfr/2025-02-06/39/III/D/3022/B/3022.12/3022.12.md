# ยง 3022.12   Pleadings filed in response to a complaint.

(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the Postal Service shall file its answer to a complaint within 20 days after the complaint is filed.


(b) If appropriate, the Postal Service may file a dispositive motion or otherwise move to delay disposition of the complaint. If the Postal Service files such a motion, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the period of time for filing its answer is altered as follows:


(1) If the Commission denies the motion or postpones disposition, the answer is due within 10 days of the Commission's action; or


(2) If the Commission invokes the rate or service inquiry special procedures under ยง 3022.13 to the complaint, the answer is due contemporaneously with the Postal Service's report under ยง 3023.11 of this chapter if the complaint has not been resolved by that date.


(c) If the Postal Service answer is delayed by the filing of a motion under paragraph (b) of this section, it may not obtain a further delay by filing another motion under paragraph (b) of this section raising an issue or objection that was available to the Postal Service but omitted from its earlier motion.
