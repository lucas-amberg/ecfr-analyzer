# § 3022.13   Conditions for applying rate or service inquiry procedures to complaints.

(a) This section applies to complaints that concern rate or service matters that are isolated incidents affecting few mail users provided that the complaint does not either:


(1) Raise unfair competition issues;


(2) Raise issues affecting a significant number of mail users;


(3) Represent a pattern, practice, or systemic issue that affects a significant number of mail users (or is reasonably likely to be evidence that such a pattern has begun); or


(4) Impact a substantial region of the nation.


(b) The Commission may in its discretion, *sua sponte,* attempt to resolve a complaint through the rate or service inquiry procedures of § 3023.11 of this chapter if the Commission finds that there is a reasonable likelihood that such procedures may result in resolution of the complaint. The Commission will issue an order to apply the procedures of § 3023.11 of this chapter prior to the due date for the Postal Service answer set forth in § 3022.12.


(c) If the Commission determines that application of paragraph (a) of this section is appropriate and the Postal Service is unable to resolve the complaint within 45 days, or such other period of time as ordered by the Commission, the Postal Service shall file its answer in accordance with § 3022.12(b)(2).
