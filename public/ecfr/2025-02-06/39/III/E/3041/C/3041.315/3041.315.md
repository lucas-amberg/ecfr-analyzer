(2) An active negotiated service agreement added to the competitive product list following a request pursuant to § 3041.310.


(3) An expired or terminated negotiated service agreement, other than an included contract in a non-published rates product or a standardized distinct product, that the Commission authorized to serve as a baseline agreement before its expiration or termination.


(c) Only the Postal Service is permitted to propose to add an included contract to an umbrella product.


(d) A proposal to add an included contract to an umbrella product must include:


(1) A copy of the proposed included contract;


(2) The rate and class decision of the Postal Service Board of Governors under 39 U.S.C. 3632 relating to the proposed included contract and the record of the proceedings in connection with such decision;


(3) A statement identifying the applicable baseline agreement;


(4) A copy of the applicable sections of the Mail Classification Schedule and the proposed addition thereto in legislative format;


(5) A description clearly explaining the operative components of the included contract;


(6) An explanation of the reason for initiating the docket and of why the proposed negotiated service agreement is not inconsistent with the applicable requirements of this part and any applicable Commission directives and orders;


(7) An explanation of the reasons why the addition of the included contract to the umbrella product will not result in a violation of the standards of 39 U.S.C. 3633;


(8) A demonstration that the proposed included contract is functionally equivalent to the baseline agreement;


(9) The information required by § 3035.105(a) of this chapter;


(10) The information required by § 3035.105(b) of this chapter;


(11) The information required by § 3035.105(c) of this chapter;


(12) All other supporting justification upon which the Postal Service proposes to rely; and


(13) Such other information and data, and such statements of reasons and bases, as are necessary and appropriate to fully inform the Commission of the nature, scope, significance, and impact of the proposed included contract.


(e) In order to authorize the addition of an included contract to an umbrella product, the Commission must make the following findings:


(1) The proposed included contract is functionally equivalent to the baseline agreement; and


(2) With the addition of the proposed included contract, the umbrella product is not inconsistent with the standards of 39 U.S.C. 3633.
