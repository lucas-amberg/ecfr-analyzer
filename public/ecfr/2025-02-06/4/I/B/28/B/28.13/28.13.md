# ยง 28.13   Special procedure for Reduction in Force.

In the event of a Reduction in Force (RIF) resulting in an individual's separation from employment, an aggrieved employee may choose to file a petition directly with the Personnel Appeals Board, without first filing the charge with the PAB's Office of General Counsel pursuant to ยง 28.11. Pursuant to ยง 28.98, individuals raising discrimination issues in connection with a RIF action need not file a complaint with GAO's Office of Opportunity and Inclusiveness before pursuing a RIF challenge alleging discrimination, either by filing directly with the PAB or by filing a charge with the Board's Office of General Counsel.
