# § 13.30   Standards for suspension.

(a) *Inability to locate debtor.* The Administrator may suspend collection on a debt where he determines that the debtor cannot be located presently but that there is a reasonable belief that the debtor can be located in the future.


(b) *Financial condition of debtor.* The Administrator may suspend collection action on a claim when the debtor owns no substantial equity in real or personal property and is unable to make payment on the claim or effect a compromise but the debtor's future financial prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review, provided that:


(1) The applicable statute of limitations will not expire during the period of the suspension, can be tolled or has started running anew;


(2) Future collection can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the 10-year statute of limitations for administrative offsets; or


(3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date.


(c) *Request for waiver or administrative review*—*mandatory.* The Administrator will suspend collection activity where a statute provides for mandatory waiver consideration or administrative review prior to agency collection of a debt. The Administrator will suspend EPA's collection actions during the period provided for the debtor to request review or waiver and during the period of the Agency's evaluation of the request.


(d) *Request for waiver or administrative review*—*permissive.* The Administrator may suspend collection activities on debts of $20,000 or less during the pendency of a permissive waiver or administrative review where he determines that:


(1) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted and the debtor may be found not owing the debt (in whole or in part);


(2) The Government's interest is protected, if suspension is granted, by the reasonable assurance that the debt can be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; or


(3) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship to the debtor.


(e) *Refund barred by statute or regulation.* The Administrator will ordinarily suspend collection action during the pendency of his consideration of a waiver request or administrative review where statute and regulation preclude refund of amounts collected by the Agency should the debtor prevail. The Administrator may decline to suspend collection where he determines that the request for waiver or administrative review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.
