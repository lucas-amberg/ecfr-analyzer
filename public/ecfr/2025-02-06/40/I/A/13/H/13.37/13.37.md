(b) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of EPA's Notice of Intent, EPA intends to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges;


(c) That the debtor has a right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable; and
