# ยง 16.4   Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.

(a) If an individual requesting access under ยง 16.3 asks for personal inspection of records, and if EPA grants the request, the individual may appear at the time and place specified in EPA's response or arrange another time with the appropriate Agency official.

(d) An individual may request a copy of the requested record.


(e) No verification of identity will be required where the records sought have been determined to be publicly available under the Freedom of Information Act.
