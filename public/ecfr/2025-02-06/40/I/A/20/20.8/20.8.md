(3) Local government requirements for control of air pollution, including emission standards;

(d) A facility that removes elements or compounds from fuels that would be released as pollutants when such fuels are burned is eligible for certification if the facility is—


(1) Used in connection with a plant or other property in operation before January 1, 1976 (whether located and used at a particular plant or as a centralized facility for one or more plants), and


(2) Is otherwise eligible for certification.


(e) Where a facility is used in connection with more than one plant or other property, one or more of which were not in operation before January 1, 1976, or where a facility will perform a function other than the removal, alteration, storage, disposal, or prevention of pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat, the Regional Administrator will so indicate on the notice of certification and will approve or disapprove the applicant's suggested method of allocating costs. If the Regional Administrator disapproves the applicant's suggested method, he shall identify the proportion of costs allocable to each such plant, or to the removal, alteration, storage, disposal, or prevention of pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat.
