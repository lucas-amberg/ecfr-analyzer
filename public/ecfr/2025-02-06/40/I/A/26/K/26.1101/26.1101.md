# ยง 26.1101   To what does this subpart apply?

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this subpart applies to all research initiated on or after September 23, 2019 involving intentional exposure of a human subject to:


(1) Any substance if, at any time prior to initiating such research, any person who conducted or supported such research intended either to submit results of the research to EPA for consideration in connection with any action that may be performed by EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136-136y) or section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a), or to hold the results of the research for later inspection by EPA under FIFRA or section 408 of FFDCA; or


(2) A pesticide if, at any time prior to initiating such research, any person who conducted or supported such research intended either to submit results of the research to EPA for consideration in connection with any action that may be performed by EPA under any regulatory statute administered by EPA other than those statutes designated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or to hold the results of the research for later inspection by EPA under any regulatory statute administered by EPA other than those statutes designated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) For purposes of determining a person's intent under paragraph (a) of this section, EPA may consider any available and relevant information. EPA must rebuttably presume the existence of intent if:


(1) The person or the person's agent has submitted or made available for inspection the results of such research to EPA; or


(2) The person is a member of a class of people who, or whose products or activities, are regulated by EPA and, at the time the research was initiated, the results of such research would be relevant to EPA's exercise of its regulatory authority with respect to that class of people, products, or activities.


(c) Unless otherwise required by the Administrator, research is exempt from this subpart if it involves only the collection or study of existing data, documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens from previously conducted studies, and if these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.


(d) The EPA Administrator retains final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this subpart and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the


ethical principles of the Belmont Report.


(e) Compliance with this subpart requires compliance with pertinent Federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.


(f) This subpart does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.


(g) This subpart does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.


(h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, nothing in this section alters the previous obligation to comply with EPA regulations in this subpart that governed research involving intentional exposure of human subjects initiated prior to September 23, 2019 and that were in effect and applicable to such research at the time it was initiated.
