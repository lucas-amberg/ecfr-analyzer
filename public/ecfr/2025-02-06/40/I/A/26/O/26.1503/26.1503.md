# ยง 26.1503   Disqualification of an IRB or an institution.

(a) Whenever the IRB or the institution has failed to take adequate steps to correct the noncompliance stated in the letter sent by the Agency under ยง 26.1502(a) and the EPA Administrator determines that this noncompliance may justify the disqualification of the IRB or of the parent institution, the Administrator may institute appropriate proceedings.


(b) The Administrator may disqualify an IRB or the parent institution from studies subject to this part if the Administrator determines that:


(1) The IRB has refused or repeatedly failed to comply with any of the regulations set forth in this part, and


(2) The noncompliance adversely affects the rights or welfare of the human subjects of research.


(c) If the Administrator determines that disqualification is appropriate, the Administrator will issue an order that explains the basis for the determination and that prescribes any actions to be taken with regard to ongoing human research, covered by subparts A through L of this part, conducted under the review of the IRB. EPA will send notice of the disqualification to the IRB and the parent institution. Other parties with a direct interest, such as sponsors and investigators, may also be sent a notice of the disqualification. In addition, the agency may elect to publish a notice of its action in the _Federal Register._

(d) EPA may refuse to consider in support of a regulatory decision the data from human research, covered by subparts A through L of this part, that was reviewed by an IRB or conducted at an institution during the period of disqualification, unless the IRB or the parent institution is reinstated as provided in ยง 26.1505, or unless such research is deemed scientifically sound and crucial to the protection of public health, under the procedure defined in ยง 26.1706.
