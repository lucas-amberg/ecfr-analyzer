(3) The Environmental Appeals Board may extend the initial 30 day period for an additional 30 days if the defendant files a request for an extension within the initial 30 day period and shows good cause.


(c) If the defendant filed a timely notice of appeal, and the time for filing motions for reconsideration under ยง 27.38 has expired, the presiding officer shall forward the record of the proceeding to the Environmental Appeals Board.

(g) There is no right to appeal any interlocutory ruling by the presiding officer.


(h) In reviewing the initial decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall not consider any objection that was not raised before the presiding officer unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection.


(i) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Environmental Appeals Board that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at such hearing, the Environmental Appeals Board shall remand the matter to the presiding officer for consideration of such additional evidence.


(j) The Environmental Appeals Board may affirm, reduce, reverse, compromise, remand, or settle any penalty or assessment, determined by the presiding officer in any initial decision.


(k) The Environmental Appeals Board shall promptly serve each party to the appeal with a copy of the decision of the Environmental Appeals Board and a statement describing the right of any person determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to seek judicial review.


(l) Unless a petition for review is filed as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3805 after a defendant has exhausted all administrative remedies under this part and within 60 days after the date on which the Environmental Appeals Board serves the defendant with a copy of the Environmental Appeals Board's decision, a determination that a defendant is liable under ยง 27.3 is final and is not subject to judicial review.
