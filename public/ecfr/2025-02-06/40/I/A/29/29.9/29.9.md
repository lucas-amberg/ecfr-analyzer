# § 29.9   How does the Administrator receive and respond to comments?

(a) The Administrator follows the procedures in § 29.10 if:


(1) A State office or official is designated to act as a single point of contact between a State process and all Federal agencies, and


(2) That office or official transmits a State process recommendation for a program selected under § 29.6. 


(b) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit comments from State, areawide, regional or local officials and entities where there is no State process recommendation. However, if a State process recommendation is transmitted by a single point of contact, all comments from State, area-wide, regional, and local officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.


(c) If a State has not established a process, or is unable to submit a State process recommendation, the State, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments directly either to the applicant or to EPA.


(d) If a program or activity is not selected for a State process, the State, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments either directly to the applicant or to EPA. In addition, if a State process recommendation for a nonselected program or activity is transmitted to EPA by the single point of contact, the Administrator follows the procedures of § 29.10 of this part.


(e) The Administrator *considers* comments which do not constitute a State process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for which the Administrator is not required to apply the procedures of § 29.10 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single point of contact, by the applicant, or directly to the Agency by a commenting party.
