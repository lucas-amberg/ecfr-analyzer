(a) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.,* as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508), requires that Federal agencies include in their decision-making processes appropriate and careful consideration of all environmental effects of proposed actions, analyze potential environmental effects of proposed actions and their alternatives for public understanding and scrutiny, avoid or minimize adverse effects of proposed actions, and restore and enhance environmental quality to the extent practicable. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall integrate these NEPA requirements as early in the Agency planning processes as possible. The environmental review process shall be the focal point to ensure NEPA considerations are taken into account.


(b) Through this part, EPA adopts the CEQ Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508) implementing NEPA; subparts A through C of this part supplement those regulations, for actions proposed by EPA that are subject to NEPA requirements. Subparts A through C supplement, and are to be used in conjunction with, the CEQ Regulations.
