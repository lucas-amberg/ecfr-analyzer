# ยง 33.408   May a recipient use race and/or gender conscious measures as part of this program?

(a) Should the good faith efforts described in subpart C of this part or other race and/or gender neutral measures prove to be inadequate to achieve an established fair share objective, race and/or gender conscious action (e.g., apply the subcontracting suggestion in ยง 33.301(c) to MBEs and WBEs) is available to a recipient and its prime contractor to more closely achieve the fair share objectives, subject to ยง 33.409. Under no circumstances are race and/or gender conscious actions required by EPA.


(b) Any use of race and/or gender conscious efforts must not result in the selection of an unqualified MBE or WBE.
