# ยง 33.503   How does a recipient calculate MBE and WBE participation for reporting purposes?

(a) *General.* Only certified MBEs and WBEs are to be counted towards MBE/WBE participation. Amounts of MBE and WBE participation are calculated as a percentage of total financial assistance agreement project procurement costs, which include the match portion of the project costs, if any. For recipients of financial assistance agreements that capitalize revolving loan programs, the total amount is the total procurement dollars in the amount of identified loans equal to the capitalization grant amount.


(b) *Ineligible project costs.* If all project costs attributable to MBE and WBE participation are not eligible for funding under the EPA financial assistance agreement, the recipient may choose to report the percentage of MBE and WBE participation based on the total eligible and non-eligible costs of the project.


(c) *Joint ventures.* For joint ventures, MBE and WBE participation consists of the portion of the dollar amount of the joint venture attributable to the MBE or WBE. If an MBE's or WBE's risk of loss, control or management responsibilities is not commensurate with its share of the profit, the Agency may direct an adjustment in the percentage of MBE or WBE participation.


(d) *Central Purchasing or Procurement Centers.* A recipient must report MBE and WBE participation from its central purchasing or procurement centers.


(e) *Brokers.* A recipient may not count expenditures to a MBE or WBE that acts merely as a broker or passive conduit of funds, without performing, managing, or supervising the work of its contract or subcontract in a manner consistent with normal business practices.


(1) *Presumption.* If 50% or more of the total dollar amount of a MBE or WBE's prime contract is subcontracted to a non-DBE, the MBE or WBE prime contractor will be presumed to be a broker, and no MBE or WBE participation may be reported.


(2) *Rebuttal.* The MBE or WBE prime contractor may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that its actions are consistent with normal practices for prime contractors in its business and that it will actively perform, manage and supervise the work under the contract.


(f) *MBE or WBE Truckers/Haulers.* A recipient may count expenditures to an MBE or WBE trucker/hauler only if the MBE or WBE trucker/hauler is performing a commercially useful function. The following factors should be used in determining whether an MBE or WBE trucker/hauler is performing a commercially useful function:


(1) The MBE or WBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking/hauling operation for which it is responsible on a particular contract, and there cannot be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting MBE or WBE objectives.


(2) The MBE or WBE must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured, and operational truck used on the contract.
