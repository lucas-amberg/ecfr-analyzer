EPA Regions award Pollution Prevention Grant funds to Tribes and Intertribal Consortia through a competitive process in accordance with EPA guidance. When evaluating a Tribe's or Intertribal Consortium's application, EPA must consider, among other criteria, whether the proposed program would: 


(a) Make specific technical assistance available to businesses seeking information about source reduction opportunities, including funding for experts to provide onsite technical advice to businesses seeking assistance in the development of source reduction plans; 


(b) Target assistance to businesses for whom lack of information is an impediment to source reduction; and 


(c) Provide training in source reduction techniques. Such training may be provided through local engineering schools or other appropriate means.
