If these optional reserves are not obligated or released and obligated for other purposes before the reallotment date, they shall be subject to reallotment under § 35.2010(b).


(c) Sums deobligated from the mandatory portion of reserves under paragraphs (b) through (e) of § 35.2020 which are reissued by the Comptroller to the Regional Administrator before the initial reallotment date for those funds shall be returned to the same reserve. (See § 35.2010(c)).
