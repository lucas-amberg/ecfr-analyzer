# § 35.2024   Combined sewer overflows.

(a) *Grant assistance from State allotment.* As provided in § 35.2015(b)(2)(iv), after September 30, 1984, upon request from a State, the Administrator may award a grant under section 201(n)(1) of the Act from the State allotment for correction of combined sewer overflows provided that the project is on the project priority list, it addresses impaired uses in priority water quality areas which are due to the impacts of the combined sewer overflows and otherwise meets the requirements of this subpart. The State must demonstrate to the Administrator that the water quality goals of the Act will not be achieved without correcting the combined sewer overflows. The demonstration shall as a minimum prove that significant usage of the water for fishing and swimming will not be possible without the proposed project, and that the project will result in substantial restoration of an existing impaired use.


(b) *Separate fund for combined sewer overflows in marine waters.* (1) After September 30, 1982, the Administrator may award grants under section 201(n)(2) of the Act for addressing impaired uses or public health risks in priority water quality areas in marine bays and estuaries due to the impacts of combined sewer overflows. The Administrator may award such grants provided that the water quality benefits of the proposed project have been demonstrated by the State. The demonstration shall as a minimum prove that significant usage of the water for shellfishing and swimming will not be possible without the proposed project for correction of combined sewer overflows, and the proposed project will result in substantial restoration of an existing impaired use.


(2) The Administrator shall establish priorities for projects with demonstrated water quality benefits based upon the following criteria:


(i) Extent of water use benefits that would result, including swimming and shellfishing;


(ii) Relationship of water quality improvements to project costs; and


(iii) National and regional significance.


(3) If the project is a phase or segment of the proposed treatment works described in the facilities plan, the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be applied to the treatment works described in the facilities plan and each segment proposed for funding.


(4) All requirements of this subpart apply to grants awarded under section 201(n)(2) of the Act except §§ 35.2010, 35.2015, 35.2020, 35.2021, 35.2025(b), 35.2042, 35.2103, 35.2109, and 35.2202.
