# § 35.2300   Grant payments.

Except as provided in § 35.2206, the Regional Administrator shall pay the Federal share of the allowance under § 35.2025 and the allowable project costs incurred to date and currently due and payable by the grantee, as certified in the grantee's most recent payment request.


(a) *Adjustment.* The Regional Administrator may at any time review and audit request for payment and payments and make appropriate adjustments as provided in 2 CFR 200.305.


(b) *Refunds, rebates and credits.* The Federal share of any refunds, rebates, credits, or other amounts (including any interest) that accrue to or are received by the grantee for the project, and that are properly allocable to costs for which the grantee has been paid under a grant, must be credited to the current State allotment or paid to the United States. Examples include rebates for prompt payment and sales tax refunds. Reasonable expenses incurred by the grantee securing such refunds, rebates, credits, or other amounts shall be allowable under the grant when approved by the Regional Administrator.


(c) *Release.* By its acceptance of final payment, the grantee releases and discharges the United States, its officers, agents, and employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of the project work or under the grant, subject only to exceptions previously specified in writing between the Regional Administrator and the grantee.


(d) *Payment of costs incurred under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act.* Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory paragraph of this section, if the Regional Administrator determines it is necessary for the expeditious completion of a project, he may make advance payment after grant award for the Federal share of the eligible cost of any payment of relocation assistance under § 4.502(c) of this chapter by the grantee. The requirements in 2 CFR 200.305 apply to any advances of funds for assistance payments.


(e) *Payment under grants to States for advances of allowance*—(1) *Advance payment to State.* Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory paragraph of this section, the Regional Administrator, under a State grant for advances of allowance (see § 35.2025), may make payments on an advance or letter-of-credit payment method in accordance with the requirements under 2 CFR 200.305. The State and the Regional Administrator shall agree to the payment terms.


(2) *Assignment.* If the State chooses to assign its payments to a potential grant applicant, it shall execute an agreement with the potential grant applicant authorizing direct payment from EPA and establishing appropriate terms for payment. The State shall provide a copy of the agreement to EPA.


(f) *Design/build projects.* For design/build projects, the Regional Administrator shall not pay more than 95 percent of the grant amount until completion of building and the RA's final project approval (see § 35.2036(a)(6)).
