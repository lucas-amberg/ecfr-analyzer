# Appendix A to Subpart I of Part 35—Determination of Allowable Costs


(a) *Purpose.* The information in this appendix represents Agency policies and procedures for determining the allowability of project costs based on the Clean Water Act, EPA policy, appropriate Federal cost principles of 2 CFR part 200 and reasonableness.


(b) *Applicability.* This cost information applies to grant assistance awarded on or after the effective date of this regulation. Project cost determinations under this subpart are not limited to the items listed in this appendix. Additional cost determinations based on applicable law and regulations must of course be made on a project-by-project basis. Those cost items not previously included in program requirements are not mandatory for decisions under grants awarded before the effective date. They are only to be used as guidance in those cases.


1. Allowable costs related to sub- agreements include:


a. The costs of subagreements for building the project.

g. Change orders and the costs of meritorious contractor claims for increased costs under subagreements as follows:


(1) Change orders and the costs of meritorious contractor claims provided the costs are:


(i) Within the scope of the project;


(ii) Not caused by the grantee's mismanagement; and

(2) Provided the requirements of paragraph g(1) are met, the following are examples of allowable change orders and contractor claim costs:


(i) Building costs resulting from defects in the plans, design drawings and specifications, or other subagreement documents only to the extent that the costs would have been incurred if the subagreement documents on which the bids were based had been free of the defects, and excluding the costs of any rework, delay, acceleration, or disruption caused by such defects;


(ii) Costs of equitable adjustments under Clause 4, Differing Site Conditions, of the model subagreement clauses required under § 33.1030 of this subchapter.


(3) Settlements, arbitration awards, and court judgments which resolve contractor claims shall be reviewed by the grant award official and shall be allowable only to the extent that they meet the requirements of paragraph g(1), are reasonable, and do not attempt to pass on to EPA the cost of events that were the responsibility of the grantee, the contractor, or others.
