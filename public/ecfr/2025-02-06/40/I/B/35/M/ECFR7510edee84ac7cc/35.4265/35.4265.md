# ยง 35.4265   How does my group close out our TAG?

(a) Within 90 calendar days after the end of the approved project period of the TAG, your group must submit all financial, performance and other reports as required by ยง 35.4180. Upon request from your group, EPA may approve an extension of this time period. 


(b) Unless EPA authorizes an extension, your group must pay all your bills related to the TAG by no later than 90 calendar days after the end of the funding period. 


(c) Your group must promptly return any unused cash that EPA advanced or paid; OMB Circular A-129, Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables, governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.
