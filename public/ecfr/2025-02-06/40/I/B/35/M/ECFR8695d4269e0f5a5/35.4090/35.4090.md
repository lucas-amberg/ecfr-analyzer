(a) Your group must submit in writing a request for an advance payment and identify what activities, goods or services your group requires. 


(b) Your EPA regional office project officer identified in your award document must approve the items for which your group seeks advance funding. 


(c) Upon approval of your request, EPA will advance cash (in the form of a check or electronic funds transfer) to your group, up to $5,000, to cover its estimated need to spend funds for an initial period generally geared to your group's cycle of spending funds. 


(d) After the initial advance, EPA reimburses your group for its actual cash disbursements.
