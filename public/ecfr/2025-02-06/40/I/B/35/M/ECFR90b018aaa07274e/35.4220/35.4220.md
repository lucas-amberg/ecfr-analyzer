# ยง 35.4220   How does my group ensure a prospective contractor does not have a conflict of interest?

Your group must require any prospective contractor on any contract to provide, with its bid or proposal: 


(a) Information on its financial and business relationship with all PRPs at the site, with PRP parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, subcontractors, contractors, and current clients or attorneys and agents. This disclosure requirement includes past and anticipated financial and business relationships, and services provided to or on behalf of such parties in connection with any proposed or pending litigation; 


(b) Certification that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, it has disclosed such information or no such information exists; and


(c) A statement that it will disclose to you immediately any such information discovered after submission of its bid or after award.
