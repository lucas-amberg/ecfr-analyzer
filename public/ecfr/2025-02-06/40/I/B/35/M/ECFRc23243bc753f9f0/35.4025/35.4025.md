# ยง 35.4025   Is there any way my group can get a TAG if it is currently ineligible?

You can make your group eligible by establishing an identity separate from that of the PRP or other ineligible entity by making a reasonable demonstration of independence from the ineligible entity. Such a demonstration requires, at a minimum, a showing that your group has a separate and distinct: 


(a) Formal legal identity (for example, your group has different officers); and 


(b) Substantive existence (meaning, is not affiliated with an ineligible entity), including its own finances. 


(1) In determining whether your group has a different substantive existence from the ineligible entity, you must establish for us that your group: 


(i) Is not controlled either directly or indirectly, by the ineligible entity; and 


(ii) Does not control, either directly or indirectly, an ineligible entity. 


(2) You must also establish for EPA that a third group does not have the power to control both your group and an ineligible entity.
