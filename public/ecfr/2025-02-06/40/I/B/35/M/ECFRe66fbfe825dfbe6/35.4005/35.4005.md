# § 35.4005   What is a Technical Assistance Grant?

A Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) provides money for your group to obtain technical assistance in interpreting information with regard to a Superfund site. EPA awards TAGs to promote public participation in decision making at eligible sites. A TAG allows your group to procure independent technical advisors to help you interpret and comment on site-related information and decisions. Examples of how a technical advisor can help your group include, but are not limited to: 


(a) Reviewing preliminary site assessment/site investigation data; 


(b) Participating in public meetings to help interpret information about site conditions, proposed remedies, and the implementation of a remedy; 


(c) Visiting the site vicinity periodically during cleanup, if possible, to observe progress and provide technical updates to your group; and 


(d) Evaluate future land use options based on land use assumptions found in the “remedial investigation/feasibility study.”
