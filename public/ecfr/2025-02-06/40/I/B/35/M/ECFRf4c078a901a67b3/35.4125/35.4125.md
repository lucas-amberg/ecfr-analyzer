# § 35.4125   What else does my group need to do?

Once you've determined whether Federal intergovernmental review requirements apply, you must prepare a TAG application on EPA SF-424, Application for Federal Assistance, or those forms and instructions provided by EPA that include:


(a) A “budget”;


(b) A scope of work;


(c) Assurances, certifications and other pre-award paperwork as 2 CFR part 200 requires. Your EPA regional office will provide you with the required forms.
