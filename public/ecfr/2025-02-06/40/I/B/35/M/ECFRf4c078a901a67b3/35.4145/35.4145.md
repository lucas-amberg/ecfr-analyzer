# ยง 35.4145   How much time do my group or other interested groups have to submit a TAG application to EPA?

(a) Your group must file your application with your EPA regional office within the second 30 days after the date the public notice appears in your local newspaper announcing that EPA has received an LOI. This second 30-day period begins on the day after the first 30-day period ยง 35.4115 describes ends. EPA will only accept applications from groups that submitted an LOI within 30 days from the date of that public notice. 


(b) If your group requires more time to file a TAG application, you may submit a written request asking for an extension. If EPA decides to extend the time period for applications in response to your request, it will notify, in writing, all groups that submitted an LOI of the new deadline for submitting TAG applications. 


(c) EPA will not accept other applications or requests for extensions after the final application deadline has passed.
