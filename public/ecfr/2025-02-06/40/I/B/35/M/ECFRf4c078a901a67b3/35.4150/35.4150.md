# ยง 35.4150   What happens after my group submits its application to EPA?

(a) EPA will review your application and send you a letter containing written comments telling you what changes need to be made to the application to make it complete. 


(b) Your group has 90 days from the date on the EPA letter to make the changes to your application and resubmit it to EPA. 


(c) Once the 90-day period ends, EPA will begin the process to select a TAG recipient, or, in the case of a single applicant, if, EPA does not receive a complete application (meaning, an application that does not have the changes provided in the letter described in paragraph (b) of this section), then EPA will readvertise the fact that a TAG is available and the award process will begin again.
