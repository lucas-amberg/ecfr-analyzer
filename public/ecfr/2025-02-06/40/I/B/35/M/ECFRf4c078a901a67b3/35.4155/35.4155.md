# ยง 35.4155   How does EPA decide whether to award a TAG to our group?

Once EPA determines your group meets the eligibility requirements in ยง 35.4020 the Agency considers whether and how successfully your group meets these criteria, each of which are of equal weight: 


(a) Representation of groups and individuals affected by the site; 


(b) Your group's plans to use the services of a technical advisor throughout the Superfund response action; and 


(c) Your group's ability and plan to inform others in the community of the information provided by the technical advisor.
