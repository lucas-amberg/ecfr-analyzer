# ยง 35.4165   When does EPA award a TAG?

(a) EPA may award TAGs throughout the Superfund process, including during operation and maintenance, but we will not award a TAG before the start of your site's response action if the site is proposed for listing on the NPL. 


(b) Based on the availability of funds, EPA may delay awards of grants to qualified applicants.
