# § 35.4065   How can my group get more than $50,000?

(a) The EPA regional office award official for your grant may waive your group's $50,000 limit if your group demonstrates that: 


(1) If it received previous TAG funds, you managed those funds effectively; and 


(2) Site(s) characteristics indicate additional funds are necessary due to the nature or volume of site-related information. In this case, three of the ten factors below must occur: 


(i) A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) costing more than $2 million is performed; 


(ii) Treatability studies or evaluation of new and innovative technologies are required as specified in the Record of Decision; 


(iii) EPA reopens the Record of Decision; 


(iv) The site public health assessment (or related activities) indicates the need for further health investigations and/or health promotion activities; 


(v) EPA designates one or more additional operable units after awarding the TAG; 


(vi) The agency leading the cleanup issues an “Explanation of Significant Differences” (ESD); 


(vii) A legislative or regulatory change results in new site information after EPA awards the TAG; 


(viii) EPA expects a cleanup lasting more than eight years from the beginning of the RI/FS through construction completion; 


(ix) Significant public concern exists, where large groups of people in the community require many meetings, copies, etc.; and 


(x) Any other factor that, in EPA's judgment, indicates that the site is unusually complex. 


(b) Your group can also receive more than $50,000 if you are geographically close to more than one eligible site (for example, two or more sites × $50,000 = grant of $100,000) and your group wishes to receive funding for technical assistance to address multiple eligible sites.
