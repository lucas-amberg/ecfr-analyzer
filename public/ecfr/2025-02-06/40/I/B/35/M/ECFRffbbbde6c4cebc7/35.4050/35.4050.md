# § 35.4050   Must my group contribute toward the cost of a TAG?

(a) Yes, your group must contribute 20 percent of the total cost of the TAG project unless EPA waives the match under § 35.4055. 


(b) Under 2 CFR 200.306, your group may use “cash” and/or “in-kind contributions” (for example, your board members can count their time toward your matching share) to meet the matching funds requirement. Without specific statutory authority, you may not use Federal funds to meet the required match.
