(a) EPA may award a Cooperative Agreement to a recipient for:


(1) A single activity, or multiple activities;


(2) A single activity at multiple sites; and


(3) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, multiple activities at multiple sites.


(b) EPA will not award or amend a Cooperative Agreement to a political subdivision to conduct multiple activities at multiple sites. Before awarding or amending a Cooperative Agreement to permit multiple activities at multiple sites, EPA must determine that the State or Indian Tribe has adequate administrative, technical, and financial management and tracking capabilities. A State's or Indian Tribe's request for such a Cooperative Agreement will be considered only if EPA determines that consolidating these activities under one Cooperative Agreement would be in the Agency's best interests.


(c) EPA will not award a single Cooperative Agreement to conduct multiple remedial actions at multiple sites.


(d) EPA will require separate Cooperative Agreements for eligible removal actions that exceed the statutory monetary ceiling or whenever a consistency waiver is likely to be sought.
