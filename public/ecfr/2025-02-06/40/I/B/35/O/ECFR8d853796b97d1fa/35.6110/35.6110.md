# § 35.6110   Indian Tribe-lead remedial Cooperative Agreements.

(a) *Application requirements.* The Indian Tribe must comply with all of the requirements described in § 35.6105(a). Indian Tribes are not required to comply with the intergovernmental review requirements included in the “Application for Federal Assistance” (SF-424). Consistent with the NCP (40 CFR 300.510(e)(2)), this subpart does not address whether Indian Tribes are States for the purpose of CERCLA section 104(c)(9).


(b) *Cooperative Agreement requirements.* (1) The Indian Tribe must comply with all terms and conditions in the Cooperative Agreement.


(2) If it is designated the lead for remedial action, the Indian Tribe must provide the notification required at § 35.6120, substituting the term “Indian Tribe” for the term “State” in that section, and “out-of-an-Indian-Tribal-area-of-Indian-country” for “out-of-State”.


(3) Indian Tribes are not required to share in the cost of CERCLA-funded remedial actions.
