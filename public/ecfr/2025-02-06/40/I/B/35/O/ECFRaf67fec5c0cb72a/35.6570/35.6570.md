# ยง 35.6570   Use of the same engineer during subsequent phases of response.

(a) If the public notice clearly stated the possibility that the firm or individual selected could be awarded a contract for follow-on services and initial procurement complied with the procurement requirements, the recipient of a CERCLA remedial response Cooperative Agreement may use the engineer procured to conduct any or all of the follow-on engineering activities without going through the public notice and evaluation procedures.


(b) The recipient may also use the same engineer during subsequent phases of the project in the following cases:


(1) Where the recipient conducted the RI, FS, or design activities without EPA assistance but is using CERCLA funds for follow-on activities, the recipient may use the engineer for subsequent work provided the recipient certifies:


(i) That it complied with the procurement requirements in ยง 35.6565 when it selected the engineer and the code of conduct requirements described in 2 CFR 200.318(c)(1).


(ii) That any CERCLA-funded contract between the engineer and the recipient meets all of the other provisions as described in the procurement requirements in this subpart.


(2) Where EPA conducted the RI, FS, or design activities but the recipient will assume the responsibility for subsequent phases of response under a Cooperative Agreement, the recipient may use, with the award official's approval, EPA's engineer contractor without further public notice or evaluation provided the recipient follows the rest of the procurement requirements to award the contract.
