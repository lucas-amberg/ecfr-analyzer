(a) *Prohibited contracts.* The recipient's procurement system must not allow cost-plus-percentage-of-cost (e.g., a multiplier which includes profit) or percentage-of-construction-cost types of contracts.


(b) *Removal.* Under a removal Cooperative Agreement, the recipient must award a fixed-price contract (lump sum, unit price, or a combination of the two) when procuring contractor support, regardless of the procurement method selected, unless the recipient obtains the award official's prior written approval.


(c) *Time and material contracts.* The recipient may use time and material contracts only if no other type of contract is suitable, and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.
