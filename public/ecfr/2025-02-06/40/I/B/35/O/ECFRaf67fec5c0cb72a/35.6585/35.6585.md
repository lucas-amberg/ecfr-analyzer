# ยง 35.6585   Cost and price analysis.

(a) *General.* The recipient must conduct and document a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modification.


(1) *Cost analysis.* The recipient must conduct and document a cost analysis for all negotiated contracts over the simplified acquisition threshold and for all change orders regardless of price. A cost analysis is not required when adequate price competition exists and the recipient can establish price reasonableness. The recipient must base its determination of price reasonableness on a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public, or on prices set by law or regulation.


(2) *Price analysis.* In all instances other than those described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the recipient must perform a price analysis to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.


(b) *Profit analysis.* For each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases in which cost analysis is performed, the recipient must negotiate profit as a separate element of the price. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
