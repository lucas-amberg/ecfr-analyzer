# ยง 35.6225   Activities eligible for funding under Core Program Cooperative Agreements.

(a) To be eligible for funding under a Core Program Cooperative Agreement, activities must develop and maintain a recipient's abilities to implement CERCLA. Once the recipient has in place program functions described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, EPA will evaluate the recipient's program needs to sustain interaction with EPA in CERCLA implementation as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The amount of funding provided under the Core Program will be determined by EPA based on the availability of funds and the recipient's program needs in the areas described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section:


(1) Procedures for emergency response actions and longer-term remediation of environmental and health risks at hazardous waste sites (including but not limited to the development of generic health and safety plans, quality assurance project plans, and community relation plans);


(2) Provisions for satisfying all requirements and assurances (including the development of a fund or other financing mechanism(s) to pay for studies and remediation activities);


(3) Legal authorities and enforcement support associated with proper administration of the recipient's program and with efforts to compel potentially responsible parties to conduct or pay for studies and/or remediation (including but not limited to the development of statutory authorities; access to legal assistance in identifying applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements of other laws; and development and maintenance of the administrative, financial and recordkeeping systems necessary for cost recovery actions under CERCLA);


(4) Efforts necessary to hire and train staff to manage publicly-funded cleanups, oversee responsible party-lead cleanups, and provide clerical support; and


(5) Other activities deemed necessary by EPA to develop and maintain sustained EPA/recipient interaction in CERCLA implementation (including but not limited to general program management and supervision necessary for a recipient to implement CERCLA activities, and interagency coordination on all phases of CERCLA response).


(b) Continued funding of tasks in subsequent years will be based on an evaluation of demonstrated progress toward the goals in the existing Core Program Cooperative Agreement Statement of Work.
