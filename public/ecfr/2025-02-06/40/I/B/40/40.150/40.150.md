# ยง 40.150   Evaluation of applications.

Every application for a research or demonstration grant will be evaluated by appropriate EPA staff in terms of relevancy and the applicable criteria set forth in ยง 40.140. Only applications considered relevant to EPA research and demonstration objectives will receive further consideration and be subjected to additional review. Relevancy will be measured by program needs and priorities as defined in the Agency's current planned objectives. Relevancy, coupled with the results of technical review, will provide the basis for funding recommendations.


(a) *New applications.* Applications considered relevant to EPA research and demonstration objectives will be reviewed for technical merit by at least one reviewer within EPA and at least two reviewers outside EPA. Review by a National Advisory Council is statutorily required for radiation grants.


(b) *Continuation applications.* Continuation applications will be reviewed by appropriate EPA staff only. Recommendations for continuation of funding will be based on progress toward the accomplishment of the goals set forth for the project and continued Agency needs and priorities.
