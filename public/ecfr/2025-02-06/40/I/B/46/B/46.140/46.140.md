# ยง 46.140   Benefits.

EPA fellowships may include funds to help you pay such things as: 


(a) A part, or all, of your tuition and fees, as determined appropriate by EPA. 


(b) An expense allowance for books, supplies, and equipment (equipment is an item with a unit acquisition cost of more than $5,000) as determined appropriate by EPA. You may use this allowance for expenses that are necessary for your education, such as the cost of health insurance, supplies, and travel to conduct research and attend technical meetings relating to the fellowship. You may acquire equipment only with EPA's written approval and there will be very few instances where the purchase of equipment is authorized (see ยง 46.225.) 


(c) A stipend determined by the EPA program office based on EPA's resources and your course load.
