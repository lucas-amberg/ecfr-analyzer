# § 46.185   Activation notice.

(a) Each fellowship includes a “Fellowship Activation Notice” (EPA Form 5770-7). You must complete, sign, and obtain other appropriate signatures on the Activation Notice when the program supported by the fellowship agreement begins. In certain instances, e.g., if your program of study is at an EPA facility, the EPA project officer may sign as sponsor on the Activation Notice. You must submit the Activation Notice to the award official. 


(b) If you do not submit the Activation Notice (EPA Form 5770-7) within 90 days after the date of the award, the award official may initiate action to terminate the fellowship agreement in accordance with § 46.210.
