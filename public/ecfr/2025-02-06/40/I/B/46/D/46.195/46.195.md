# § 46.195   Project period.

Based on the “Date Fellow Will Enter on Duty” which you enter on the Activation Notice (see § 46.185(a)), EPA will establish the project period for the fellowship. If you incur costs before the date of the fellowship award, the date on the Activation Notice must reflect that fact (see also § 46.170(b)).
