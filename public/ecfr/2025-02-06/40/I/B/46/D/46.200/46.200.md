# § 46.200   Payment.

EPA will not make payments under a fellowship agreement until the award official receives the signed “Fellowship Activation Notice” (EPA Form 5770-7) as required by § 46.185. Unless the fellowship provides another payment process, EPA makes payments as follows: 


(a) EPA pays tuition and fees directly to the educational institution. 


(b) EPA pays any stipend directly to you on a monthly or other basis approved by the project officer and included in the fellowship agreement. 


(c) EPA pays any book or other expense allowance to you or to the educational institution, as specified in the fellowship agreement. If EPA pays your expense allowance to the educational institution, the institution may deduct not more than two percent of the expense allowance as a handling fee.
