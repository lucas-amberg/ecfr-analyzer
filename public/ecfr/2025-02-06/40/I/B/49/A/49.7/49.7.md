(iii) Identify the source of the tribal government's authority to carry out the governmental functions currently being performed.


(3) A descriptive statement of the Indian tribe's authority to regulate air quality. For applications covering areas within the exterior boundaries of the applicant's reservation the statement must identify with clarity and precision the exterior boundaries of the reservation including, for example, a map and a legal description of the area.

(4) A narrative statement describing the capability of the applicant to administer effectively any Clean Air Act program for which the tribe is seeking approval. The narrative statement must demonstrate the applicant's capability consistent with the applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act and implementing regulations and, if requested by the Regional Administrator, may include:


(i) A description of the Indian tribe's previous management experience which may include the administration of programs and services authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450, *et seq.*), the Indian Mineral Development Act (25 U.S.C. 2101, *et seq.*), or the Indian Sanitation Facility Construction Activity Act (42 U.S.C. 2004a);

(5) A tribe that is a member of a tribal consortium may rely on the expertise and resources of the consortium in demonstrating under paragraph (a)(4) of this section that the tribe is reasonably expected to be capable of carrying out the functions to be exercised consistent with § 49.6(d). A tribe relying on a consortium in this manner must provide reasonable assurances that the tribe has responsibility for carrying out necessary functions in the event the consortium fails to.


(6) Where applicable Clean Air Act or implementing regulatory requirements mandate criminal enforcement authority, an application submitted by an Indian tribe may be approved if it meets the requirements of § 49.8.


(7) Additional information required by the EPA Regional Administrator which, in the judgment of the EPA Regional Administrator, is necessary to support an application.


(8) Where the applicant has previously received authorization for a Clean Air Act program or for any other EPA-administered program, the applicant need only identify the prior authorization and provide the required information which has not been submitted in the previous application.


(b) A tribe may simultaneously submit a request for an eligibility determination and a request for approval of a Clean Air Act program.


(c) A request for Clean Air Act program approval must meet any applicable Clean Air Act statutory and regulatory requirements. A program approval request may be comprised of only partial elements of a Clean Air Act program, provided that any such elements are reasonably severable, that is, not integrally related to program elements that are not included in the plan submittal, and are consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
