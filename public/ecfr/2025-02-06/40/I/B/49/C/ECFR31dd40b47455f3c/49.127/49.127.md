# ยง 49.127   Rule for woodwaste burners.

(a) *What is the purpose of this section?* This section phases out the operation of woodwaste burners (commonly known as wigwam or teepee burners), and in the interim, limits the visible emissions from woodwaste burners within the Indian reservation to control emissions of particulate matter to the atmosphere and ground-level concentrations of particulate matter.


(b) *Who is affected by this section?* This section applies to any person who owns or operates a woodwaste burner.


(c) *What are the requirements for woodwaste burners?* (1) Except as provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of a woodwaste burner must shut down and dismantle the woodwaste burner by no later than two years after the effective date of this section. The requirement for dismantling applies to all woodwaste burners regardless of whether or not the woodwaste burners are currently operational. Until the woodwaste burner is shut down, visible emissions from the woodwaste burner must not exceed 20% opacity, averaged over any consecutive six-minute period.


(2) Until the woodwaste burner is shut down, only wood waste generated on-site may be burned or disposed of in the woodwaste burner.


(3) If there is no reasonably available alternative method of disposal for the wood waste other than by burning it on-site in a woodwaste burner, the owner or operator of the woodwaste burner that is in compliance with the opacity limit in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may apply to the Regional Administrator for an extension of the two-year deadline. If the Regional Administrator finds that there is no reasonably available alternative method of disposal, then a two-year extension of the deadline may be granted. There is no limit to the number of extensions that may be granted by the Regional Administrator.


(d) *What is the reference method for determining compliance with the opacity limit?* (1) The reference method for determining compliance with the opacity limit is EPA Method 9. A complete description of this method is found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.


(2) [Reserved]


(e) *Are there additional requirements that must be met?* A person subject to this section must submit a plan to shut down and dismantle the woodwaste burner to the Regional Administrator within 180 days after the effective date of this section. Unless an extension has been granted by the Regional Administrator, the woodwaste burner must be shut down and dismantled within two years after the effective date of this section. The owner or operator of the woodwaste burner must notify the Regional Administrator that the woodwaste burner has been shut down and dismantled within 30 days after completion.


(f) *Definitions of terms used in this section.* The following terms that are used in this section are defined in ยง 49.123 General provisions: Air pollutant, ambient air, emission, opacity, owner or operator, particulate matter, PM10, PM2.5, reference method, Regional Administrator, stationary source, uncombined water, visible emissions, wood, and woodwaste burner.
