# § 49.103   Delegation of authority of administration to Indian tribes.

(a) *What is the purpose of this section*? The purpose of this section is to establish the process by which a Regional Administrator may delegate to a federally-recognized tribe the authority to assist the EPA with administration of this FIP (§§ 49.101 through 49.105). This section provides for administrative delegation and does not affect the eligibility criteria under § 49.6 for treatment in the same manner as a state or a tribe's ability to obtain approval of a tribal implementation plan under § 49.7.


(b) *How does a tribe request delegation*? In order to be delegated authority to assist us with administration of this FIP, the authorized representative of a federally-recognized tribe must submit a request to a Regional Administrator that:


(1) Identifies the specific provisions for which delegation is requested;


(2) Identifies the Indian Reservation or other affected areas of Indian country for which delegation is requested;


(3) Includes a statement by the applicant's legal counsel (or equivalent official) that includes the following:


(i) A statement that the applicant is a tribe recognized by the Secretary of the Interior;


(ii) A descriptive statement that is consistent with the type of information described in § 49.7(a)(2) demonstrating that the applicant is currently carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers over a defined area;


(iii) A description of the laws of the tribe that provide adequate authority to administer the Federal rules and provisions for which delegation is requested; and


(iv) A demonstration that the tribal agency that will be responsible for administration has the technical capability and adequate resources to administer the FIP provisions for which delegation is requested.


(c) *How is the delegation of administrative authority accomplished*? (1) A Delegation of Authority Agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the administrative delegation, will specify the rule and provisions that the tribe shall be authorized to implement on behalf of the EPA, and shall be entered into by the Regional Administrator and the tribe. The Agreement will become effective upon the date that both the Regional Administrator and the authorized representative of the tribe have signed the Agreement. Once the delegation becomes effective, the tribe will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for assisting us with administration of this FIP and shall act as the Regional Administrator as that term is used in these regulations. Any Delegation of Authority Agreement will clarify the circumstances in which the term “Regional Administrator” found throughout this FIP is to refer only to the EPA Regional Administrator and when it is intended instead to refer to the EPA Regional Administrator or a federally-recognized tribe.


(2) A Delegation of Authority Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Regional Administrator after consultation with a tribe.


(d) *How will any Delegation of Authority Agreement be publicized*? The Regional Administrator shall publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ informing the public of any Delegation of Authority Agreement with a tribe to assist us with administration of all or a portion of this FIP and will identify such delegation in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Regional Administrator shall also publish an announcement of the Delegation of Authority Agreement in local newspapers.
