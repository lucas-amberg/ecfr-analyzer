(A) All spray booths, preparation stations, and mobile enclosures must be equipped with an exhaust filter certified by the manufacturer to achieve at least 98 percent capture of paint overspray. The procedure used to demonstrate filter efficiency must be consistent with the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Method 52.1, “Gravimetric and Dust-Spot Procedures for Testing Air-Cleaning Devices Used in General Ventilation for Removing Particulate Matter, June 4, 1992.” The test coating for measuring filter efficiency shall be a high solids bake enamel delivered at a rate of at least 135 grams per minute from a conventional (non-HVLP) air-atomized spray gun operating at 40 pounds per square inch (psi) air pressure; the air flow rate across the filter shall be 150 feet per minute. Owners and operators may use published filter efficiency data provided by filter vendors to demonstrate compliance with this requirement and are not required to perform this measurement. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to water wash spray booths that are operated and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications.


(B) Spray booths and preparation stations used to refinish complete motor vehicles or mobile equipment must be fully enclosed with a full roof and four complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be ventilated at negative pressure so that air is drawn into any openings in the booth walls or preparation station curtains. However, if a spray booth is fully enclosed and has seals on all doors and other openings and has an automatic pressure balancing system, it may be operated at up to, but not more than, 0.05 inches water gauge positive pressure.


(C) Spray booths and preparation stations that are used to coat miscellaneous parts and products or vehicle subassemblies must have a full roof, at least three complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be ventilated so that air is drawn into the booth. The walls and roof of a booth may have openings, if needed, to allow for conveyors and parts to pass through the booth during the coating process.


(D) Mobile ventilated enclosures within the site that are used to perform spot repairs must enclose and, if necessary, seal against the surface around the area being coated such that paint overspray is retained within the enclosure and directed to a filter to capture paint overspray.


(E) The exhaust filters of spray booths shall be equipped with pressure gauges that indicate, in inches of water, the static pressure differential across the exhaust filters.


(F) Each spray booth located in a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area that uses greater than 4 gallons per day of VOC-containing material shall install add-on controls (with greater than or equal to 90 percent collection efficiency and greater than or equal to 95 percent destruction efficiency) or use material with less than 5 percent VOC by weight or low VOC materials that result in an equivalent emission reduction.


(x) Except for serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas, all spray-applied coating operations must be applied with a high volume, low pressure (HVLP) spray gun, electrostatic application, airless spray gun, or air-assisted airless spray gun. An equivalent spray technology may be used if it that has been demonstrated by the spray gun manufacturer to achieve a transfer efficiency comparable to that of an HVLP spray gun and for which the spray gun manufacturer has obtained written approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The requirements of this condition do not apply to spray guns with a cup capacity less than 3.0 fluid ounces (89 cc).


(xi) In serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas, all spray-applied coating operations must be applied with an HVLP spray gun, low volume low pressure (LVLP) spray gun, or air brush spray operation. An equivalent spray technology may be used if it has been demonstrated by the spray gun manufacturer to achieve a transfer efficiency comparable to that of an HVLP spray gun and for which the spray gun manufacturer has obtained written approval from the EPA.


(xii) All paint spray gun cleaning must be done so that an atomized mist or spray of gun cleaning solvent and paint residue is not created outside of a container that collects used gun cleaning solvent. Spray gun cleaning may be done with, for example, hand cleaning of parts of the disassembled gun in a container of solvent, by flushing solvent through the gun without atomizing the solvent and paint residue, or by using a fully enclosed spray gun washer. A combination of non-atomizing methods may also be used.


(xiii) All VOC-containing material (*e.g.,* coatings, thinners, and clean-up solvents) shall be stored in closed containers.


(xiv) All waste materials containing VOC (*e.g.,* soiled rags) shall be stored in sealed containers until properly disposed.


(xv) Each permitted source located in a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area, shall not apply a coating that has VOC content in excess of the limits listed in the Table 1 below. Compliance with the VOC limits shall be based on VOC content, including any VOC material added to the original coating supplied by the manufacturer, less water.


(xvi) For each batch-loaded cold cleaner degreaser, the permittee shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.


(xvii) Each permitted source located in a serious, extreme, or severe ozone nonattainment area, shall use cleaning materials in the batch-loaded cold cleaner degreaser that have a VOC content of less than 25 grams per liter.


(3) *Monitoring and testing requirements*—(i) *Initial performance tests.* (A) Within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the permitted source will operate the affected emissions unit(s), but not later than 180 days after the first day of operation under the permit by rule, the permittee shall perform an initial performance test to verify compliance with the emission limitations in paragraphs (d)(2)(v) and (d)(2)(ix)(F) of this section (including capture efficiency requirements), if applicable. Performance tests shall be performed:


(*1*) According to a test plan submitted at least 30 days in advance of the test date to the reviewing authority;


(*2*) While the permitted source is operating under typical operating conditions;


(*3*) Using test methods from 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. In lieu of the test methods from 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, measurements for NO_X_ and CO may be taken using portable analyzers according to ASTM D6522-00, as incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 63.14(b)(27);


(*4*) Using Method 5 with a sample volume of at least 31.8 dscf to determine particulate matter concentration; and


(*5*) Simultaneously for CO and NO_X_ whenever either one needs to be tested.


(B) Compliance with each limit shall be demonstrated by averaging the results of at least three test runs of at least 1 hour duration each, unless the permittee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the reviewing authority that the result of one of the test runs should be discarded. The test results the permittee submits must contain at least two test runs.


(ii) The permitted source shall demonstrate compliance with the paint overspray capture efficiency requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(ix)(A) of this section using published filter efficiency data provided by filter vendors, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ix)(A) of this section.

The reviewing authority may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified, according to 40 CFR 49.156(e)(8).


(e) *Standards for batch-loaded cold cleaner degreasers.* (1) Each degreaser shall be operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and shall be used with tightly fitting covers that are free of cracks, holes, or other defects. In addition, the cover shall be closed at all times when the degreaser contains solvent, except during parts entry and removal or performing maintenance or monitoring that requires the removal of the cover.


(2) The solvent container shall be free of all liquid leaks. Auxiliary degreaser equipment, such as pumps, water separators, steam traps, or distillation units, shall not have any liquid leaks, visible tears, or cracks. In addition, any liquid leak, visible tear, or crack detected pursuant to the provisions of this condition shall be repaired within 48 hours, or the degreaser shall be drained of all solvent and shut down until replaced or repaired.


(3) All waste solvents shall be stored in properly identified and sealed containers. All associated pressure relief devices shall not allow liquid solvents to drain out.


(4) Solvent flow cleaning shall be done within the freeboard area, and shall be done by a liquid stream rather than a fine, atomized, or shower-type spray. Solvent flow shall be directed downward to avoid turbulence at the air-solvent interface and to prevent liquid solvent from splashing outside of the degreaser.


(5) Degreasing of porous or absorbent materials, such as cloth, leather, wood, or rope is prohibited.


(6) Workspace and ventilation fans shall not be positioned in such a way as to direct airflow near the degreaser openings.


(7) Spills during solvent transfer shall be wiped up immediately and the used wipe rags shall be stored in closed containers that are handled in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(8) Solvent levels shall not exceed the fill line.


(9) The parts to be cleaned shall be racked in a manner that will minimize the drag-out losses.


(10) The freeboard ratio shall be 0.75 or greater. Parts shall be drained immediately after the cleaning until at least 15 seconds have elapsed; or dripping of solvent ceases; or the parts become visibly dry. Parts with blind holes or cavities shall be tipped or rotated before being removed from a degreaser, such that the solvents in the blind holes or cavities are drained in accordance with the above requirements.


(11) Draining or filling of solvent containers shall be performed beneath the liquid solvent surface.


(12) Solvent agitation, where necessary, shall be carried out only by pump recirculation, ultrasonics, a mixer, or by air agitation. Air agitation shall be accomplished under the following conditions:


(i) The air agitation unit shall be equipped with a gauge and a device that limits air pressure into the degreaser to less than two pounds per square inch gauge;


(ii) The cover must remain closed while the air agitation system is in operation; and


(iii) Pump circulation shall be performed without causing splashing.


(13) Airless/Air-tight Cleaning System Requirements—In lieu of meeting the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (12) of this section, the permittee may use an airless/air-tight batch cleaning system provided that all of the following applicable requirements are met:


(i) The equipment is operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and operated with a door or other pressure sealing apparatus that is in place during all cleaning and drying cycles.


(ii) All waste solvents are stored in properly identified and sealed containers.


(iii) All associated pressure relief devices shall not allow liquid solvents to drain out.


(iv) Spills during solvent transfer shall be wiped up immediately, and the used wipe rags shall be stored in closed containers that are handled in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(v) The equipment is maintained in a vapor-tight, leak-free condition and any leak is a violation.


(f) *Training and certification requirements for spray-applied surface coating personnel.* The owner or operator of the permitted source must ensure and certify that all new and existing personnel, including contract personnel, who spray apply surface coatings are trained in the proper application of surface coatings as required by this permit by rule. The training program must include, at a minimum, the items listed in this paragraph (f). All personnel must be trained no later than 180 days after hiring.


(1) A list of all current personnel by name and job description who are required to be trained.


(2) Hands-on and classroom instruction that addresses, at a minimum, initial and refresher training in the following topics:


(i) Spray gun equipment selection, set up, and operation, including measuring coating viscosity, selecting the proper fluid tip or nozzle, and achieving the proper spray pattern, air pressure and volume, and fluid delivery rate.


(ii) Spray technique for different types of coatings to improve transfer efficiency and minimize coating usage and overspray, including maintaining the correct spray gun distance and angle to the part, using proper banding and overlap, and reducing lead and lag spraying at the beginning and end of each stroke.


(iii) Routine spray booth and filter maintenance, including filter selection and installation.


(iv) Compliance with the requirements of this Permit by Rule.


(3) A description of the methods to be used at the completion of initial or refresher training to demonstrate, document, and provide certification of successful completion of the required training. Owners and operators who can show by documentation or certification that a painter's work experience and/or training has resulted in training equivalent to the training required in paragraph (f)(2) of this section are not required to provide the initial training required by that same paragraph to the painter.


(4) Painter training that was completed within 5 years prior to the date training is required, and that meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section satisfies this requirement and is valid for a period not to exceed 5 years after the date the training was completed.


(5) Training and certification will be valid for a period not to exceed 5 years after the date the training is completed, and all personnel must receive refresher training that meets the requirements of this § 49.162(f) and be re-certified every 5 years.


(g) *List of reviewing authorities and areas of coverage.*
