# § 49.4169   Introduction.

(a) *What is the purpose of §§ 49.4169 through 49.4184?* Sections 49.4169 through 49.4184 establish legally and practicably enforceable requirements for oil and natural gas sources on Indian country lands within the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation (U&O Reservation) to address ozone air quality. Section 49.4170 establishes provisions for delegation of authority to allow the Ute Indian Tribe to assist the EPA with administration of this Federal Implementation Plan (U&O FIP). Section 49.4171 contains general provisions and definitions applicable to oil and natural gas sources. Sections 49.4173 through 49.4184 establish legally and practicably enforceable requirements to control and reduce VOC emissions from oil and natural gas well production and storage operations, natural gas processing, and gathering and boosting operations at oil and natural gas sources that are located on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation.


(b) *Am I subject to §§ 49.4169 through 49.4184?* Sections 49.4169 through 49.4184, as appropriate, apply to each owner or operator of an oil and natural gas source (as defined at 40 CFR 49.102) located on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation that has equipment or activities that meet the applicability thresholds specified in each section. Generally, the equipment and activities at oil and natural gas sources that are already subject to and in compliance with VOC emission control requirements under another EPA standard or other federally enforceable requirement, as specified in each appropriate subsection later, are considered to be in compliance with the requirements to control VOC emissions from that same equipment under this U&O FIP.


(c) *When must I comply with §§ 49.4169 through 49.4184?* For oil and natural gas sources that commence construction before February 6, 2023, compliance with §§ 49.4169 through 49.4171 and §§ 49.4173 through 49.4184, as applicable, is required no later than February 6, 2024. You may submit a written request to the EPA for an extension of the compliance date for existing sources. The extension request must be submitted to the EPA at least 60 days before the compliance deadline, must identify the specific provision(s) for which you seek an extension, must include an alternative compliance deadline(s), and must provide the rationale for the requested extension with supporting information explaining how you will effectively meet all applicable requirements after the requested alternative compliance deadline. Any decision to approve or deny a request, including the length of time of an approved request, will be based on the merits of case-specific circumstances. For oil and natural gas sources that commence construction on or after February 6, 2023, compliance with §§ 49.4169 through 49.4171 and §§ 49.4173 through 49.4184, as applicable, is required upon startup.
