# § 49.4176   VOC emissions control requirements for covers and closed-vent systems.

(a) *Applicability.* The VOC emissions control requirements in this section apply to each cover on a storage vessel that is subject to § 49.4173, and to each closed-vent system that is used to convey VOC emissions from the collection of all storage vessels, glycol dehydration units, or pneumatic pumps (to a vapor recovery system or control device) that are subject to §§ 49.4173 through 49.4175.


(b) *Exemptions.* This section does not apply to covers and closed-vent systems that are subject to the requirements for covers and closed-vent systems in 40 CFR part 60, subparts OOOO or OOOOa, or 40 CFR part 63, subpart HH.


(c) *Covers.* Each owner or operator must equip all openings on each storage vessel with a cover to ensure that all flashing, working, standing and breathing loss emissions are routed through a closed-vent system to a vapor recovery system, an enclosed combustor, or a flare.


(1) Each cover and all openings on the cover (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, pressure relief valves (PRV), and gauge wells) must form a continuous impermeable barrier over the entire surface area of the crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water in the storage vessel.


(2) Each cover opening must be secured in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a gasketed lid or cap) whenever material is in the unit on which the cover is installed except when it is necessary to use an opening as follows:


(i) To add fluids to, or remove fluids from the unit (this includes openings necessary to equalize or balance the internal pressure of the unit following changes in the level of the material in the unit);


(ii) To inspect or sample the fluids in the unit; or


(iii) To inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located inside the unit.


(3) Each thief hatch cover must be weighted and properly seated to ensure that flashing, working, standing, and breathing loss emissions are routed through the closed-vent system to the vapor recovery system, the enclosed combustor, or the flare under normal operating conditions.


(4) Each PRV must be set to release at a pressure that will ensure that flashing, working, standing, and breathing loss emissions are routed through the closed-vent system to the vapor recovery system, the enclosed combustor, or the flare under normal operating conditions.


(d) *Closed-vent systems.* Each owner or operator must meet the following requirements for closed-vent systems:


(1) Each closed-vent system must route all captured storage vessel emissions from flashing, working, standing, and breathing losses; glycol dehydration unit process vent emissions; and pneumatic pump emissions from the oil and natural gas source to a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or to a VOC emission control device, as specified in §§ 49.4173 through 49.4175.


(2) All vent lines, connections, fittings, valves, relief valves, and any other appurtenances employed to collect or contain captured storage vessel emissions from flashing, working, standing, and breathing losses; glycol dehydration unit process vent emissions; or pneumatic pump emissions; or to transport such emissions to a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or to a VOC emission control device, as specified in §§ 49.4173 through 49.4175, must be maintained and operated properly at all times.


(3) Each closed-vent system must be designed to operate with no detectable emissions, as demonstrated by the closed-vent system monitoring requirements in § 49.4182(c).


(4) If any closed-vent system contains one or more bypass devices that could be used to divert all or a portion of the captured storage vessel flashing, working, standing, and breathing losses; glycol dehydration unit process vent emissions; or pneumatic pump emissions from entering a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or from being transferred to the VOC emissions control device, the owner or operator must meet one of the requirements in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section for each bypass device. Low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and safety devices are not subject to the requirements applicable to bypass devices.


(i) At the inlet to a bypass device the owner or operator must properly install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that is capable of taking continuous readings and sounding an alarm when the bypass device is open such that emissions are being, or could be, diverted away from a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or the VOC emission control device and into the atmosphere; or


(ii) The owner or operator must secure the bypass device valve installed at the inlet to the bypass device in the non-diverting position using a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration.
