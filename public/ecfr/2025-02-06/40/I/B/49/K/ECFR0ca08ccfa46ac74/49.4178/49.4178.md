# § 49.4178   VOC emissions control requirements for fugitive emissions.

(a) *Applicability.* The requirements of this section apply to all owners or operators of the collection of fugitive emissions components, as defined in § 49.4171, located at any oil and natural gas source, as identified in § 49.4169(b), except that this section does not apply to owners or operators of the collection of fugitive emissions components at an oil and natural gas source that is subject to the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOOa.


(b) Owners or operators of the collection of fugitive emissions components must comply with paragraph (d) of this section if either of the following is true:


(1) The collection of fugitive emissions components is located at an oil and natural gas source that is required to control VOC emissions according to §§ 49.4173 through 49.4177 of this section (*i.e.,* the source-wide potential for VOC emissions from the collection of all storage vessels, glycol dehydrators, and pneumatic pumps is equal to or greater than 4 tpy, as determined according to § 49.4173(a)(1)); or


(2) The collection of fugitive emissions components is located at a well site, as defined in 40 CFR 60.5430a, that at any time has total production greater than 15 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day based on a rolling 12-month average.


(c) Owners or operators of the collection of fugitive emissions components for which neither (b)(1) nor (b)(2) is true must comply with either paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(1) You must monitor all fugitive emissions components and repair all sources of fugitive emissions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. You must keep records in accordance with § 49.4183 and report in accordance with § 49.4184; or


(2) You must maintain the total production for the well site at or below 15 boe per day based on a rolling 12-month average. You must demonstrate that the total daily oil and natural gas production from the collection of all wells producing to the well site is at or below 15 boe per day, based on a 12-month rolling average, according to the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section. You must maintain records as specified in § 49.4183(a)(11).


(d) *Monitoring requirements.* (1) Each owner or operator must develop and implement a fugitive emissions monitoring plan to reduce emissions from fugitive emissions components at all of their oil and natural gas sources on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation. This Reservation-wide monitoring plan must include the following elements, at a minimum:


(i) A requirement to perform an initial monitoring of the collection of fugitive emissions components at each oil and natural gas source by February 6, 2024;


(ii) A requirement to perform subsequent monitoring of the collection of fugitive emissions components at each oil and natural gas source once every 6 months after the initial monitoring survey, with consecutive monitoring surveys conducted at least 4 months apart and no more than 7 months apart.


(iii) A description of the technique used to identify leaking fugitive emission components, which must be limited to:


(A) Onsite EPA Reference Method 21, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, where an analyzer reading of 500 parts per million volume (ppmv) VOC or greater is considered a leak in need of repair;


(B) Onsite optical gas imaging instruments, as defined in 40 CFR 60.18(g)(4), where any visible emissions are considered a leak in need of repair, unless the owner or operator evaluates the leak with an analyzer meeting EPA Reference Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and the concentration is less than 500 ppmv. The optical gas imaging instrument must be capable of meeting the optical gas imaging equipment requirements specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOOa; or


(C) Another method approved by the Administrator to demonstrate compliance with the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements. To be approved, you must demonstrate that the alternative method achieves emissions reductions that equal or exceed those that would result from the application of either Method 21 or optical gas imaging instruments. Approval of an alternative method will be subject to public notice and comment.


(iv) The manufacturer and model number of any fugitive emissions monitoring device to be used;


(v) Procedures and timeframes for identifying and repairing components from which leaks are detected, including:


(A) A requirement to repair any leaks identified from components that are safe to repair and do not require source shutdown as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 calendar days after discovering the leak;


(B) Timeframes for inspecting and repairing leaking components that are difficult-to-monitor, unsafe-to-monitor, or require source shutdown, to be no later than the next required monitoring event, as noted in paragraphs (c)(1)(v)(B)(*1*) through (*3*) of this section:


(*1*) If using Method 21, fugitive emissions components that cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters above the surface may be designated as difficult-to-monitor and must meet the specifications in paragraphs (c)(1)(v)(B)(*1*)*(i)* through *(iv)* of this section:


*(i)* For all fugitive emissions components designated difficult-to-monitor, a written plan must be developed and incorporated into the fugitive emissions monitoring plan.


*(ii)* The plan must include the identification and location of each fugitive emissions component designated difficult-to-monitor.


*(iii)* The plan must include an explanation of why each fugitive emissions component designated as difficult-to-monitor is difficult-to-monitor.


*(iv)* The plan must include a schedule for monitoring the difficult-to-monitor fugitive emissions components at least once per calendar year and a schedule for repairing such fugitive emissions components according to paragraph (c)(1)(v)(B)(*3*) of this section;


(*2*) Fugitive emissions components that cannot be monitored because monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger while conducting a monitoring survey may be designated as unsafe-to-monitor and must meet the specification in paragraphs (c)(1)(v)(B)(*2*)*(i)* through *(iv)* of this section:


*(i)* A written plan must be developed for all of the fugitive emissions components designated unsafe-to-monitor and incorporated into the fugitive emissions monitoring plan;


*(ii)* The plan must include the identification and location of each fugitive emissions component designated unsafe-to-monitor.


*(iii)* The plan must include an explanation of why each fugitive emissions component designated as unsafe-to-monitor is unsafe-to-monitor.


*(iv)* The plan must include a schedule for monitoring the unsafe-to-monitor fugitive emissions components as frequently as practicable during safe to inspect times and for repairing such fugitive emissions components according to paragraph (c)(1)(v)(B)(*3*) of this section;


(*3*) If the repair or replacement of a fugitive emissions component designated difficult-to-monitor or unsafe-to-monitor is technically infeasible; would require a vent blowdown, a compressor station shutdown, a well shutdown, or well shut-in; or would be unsafe to repair during operation of the unit, the repair or replacement must be completed during the next scheduled compressor station shutdown, well shutdown, or well shut-in; after a planned vent blowdown; or within 2 years, whichever is earlier; and


(C) Procedures for verifying leaking component repairs, no more than 30 calendar days after repairing the leak;


(vi) Training and experience needed before performing surveys;


(vii) Procedures for calibration and maintenance of any fugitive emissions monitoring device to be used; and


(viii) Standard monitoring protocols for each type of typical oil and natural gas source (e.g., well site, tank battery, compressor station), including a general list of component types that will be inspected and what supporting data will be recorded (e.g., wind speed, detection method device-specific operational parameters, date, time, and duration of inspection).


(2) The owner or operator is exempt from inspecting and repairing a fugitive emissions component under any of the following circumstances:


(i) The contacting process stream only contains glycol, amine, methanol, or produced water; or


(ii) The component to be inspected is buried, insulated in a manner that prevents access to the components by a monitor probe or optical gas imaging device, or obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the components by a monitor probe or optical gas imaging device.


(e) *Procedures for determining total well site production.* The total well site production must be determined according to the following procedures:


(1) Calculate the total average boe per day for each calendar month using:


(i) For existing well sites, the records of production for the first 30 days after becoming subject to this section.


(ii) For well sites that commence construction, reconstruction or modification on or after February 6, 2023, the first 30 days of production, performing the calculation within 45 days of the end of the first 30 days of production.


(2) Determine the daily oil and natural gas production for each individual well at the well site for the month. To convert gas production to equivalent barrels of oil, divide the cubic feet of gas produced by 6,000.


(3) Sum the daily production for each individual well at the well site to determine the total well site production and divide by the total number of days in the calendar month. This is the average daily total well site production for the month.


(4) Use the result determined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and average with the daily average well site production values determined for each of the preceding 11 months to calculate the rolling 12-month average of the total well site production.
