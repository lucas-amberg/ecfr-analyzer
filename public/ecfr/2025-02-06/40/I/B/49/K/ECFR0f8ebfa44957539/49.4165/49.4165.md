# § 49.4165   Control equipment requirements.

(a) *Covers.* Each owner or operator must equip all openings on each produced oil storage tank and produced water storage tank interconnected with produced oil storage tanks with a cover to ensure that all natural gas emissions are efficiently being routed through a closed-vent system to a vapor recovery system, an enclosed combustor, a utility flare, or a pit flare.


(1) Each cover and all openings on the cover (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, pressure relief valves (PRV), and gauge wells) shall form a continuous impermeable barrier over the entire surface area of the produced oil and produced water in the storage tank.


(2) Each cover opening shall be secured in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a gasketed lid or cap) whenever material is in the unit on which the cover is installed except during those times when it is necessary to use an opening as follows:


(i) To add material to, or remove material from the unit (this includes openings necessary to equalize or balance the internal pressure of the unit following changes in the level of the material in the unit);


(ii) To inspect or sample the material in the unit; or


(iii) To inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located inside the unit.


(3) Each thief hatch cover shall be weighted and properly seated.


(4) Each PRV shall be set to release at a pressure that will ensure that natural gas emissions are routed through the closed-vent system to the vapor recovery system, the enclosed combustor, or the utility flare under normal operating conditions.


(b) *Closed-vent systems.* Each owner or operator must meet the following requirements for closed-vent systems:


(1) Each closed-vent system must route all produced natural gas and natural gas emissions from production and storage operations to the natural gas sales pipeline or the control devices required by paragraph (a) of this section.


(2) All vent lines, connections, fittings, valves, relief valves, or any other appurtenance employed to contain and collect natural gas, vapor, and fumes and transport them to a natural gas sales pipeline and any VOC control equipment must be maintained and operated properly at all times.


(3) Each closed-vent system must be designed to operate with no detectable natural gas emissions.


(4) If any closed-vent system contains one or more bypass devices, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, that could be used to divert all or a portion of the natural gas emissions, from entering a natural gas sales pipeline and/or any control devices, the owner or operator must meet the one of following requirements for each bypass device:


(i) At the inlet to the bypass device that could divert the natural gas emissions away from a natural gas sales pipeline or a control device and into the atmosphere, properly install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a natural gas flow indicator that is capable of taking continuous readings and sounding an alarm when the bypass device is open such that natural gas emissions are being, or could be, diverted away from a natural gas sales pipeline or a control device and into the atmosphere;


(ii) Secure the bypass device valve installed at the inlet to the bypass device in the non-diverting position using a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration;


(iii) Low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and safety devices are not subject to the requirements applicable to bypass devices.


(c) *Enclosed combustors and utility flares.* Each owner or operator must meet the following requirements for enclosed combustors and utility flares:


(1) For each enclosed combustor or utility flare, the owner or operator must follow the manufacturer's written operating instructions, procedures and maintenance schedule to ensure good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions;


(2) For each enclosed combustor or utility flare, the owner or operator must ensure there is sufficient capacity to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to it by at least 98.0 percent for the minimum and maximum natural gas volumetric flow rate and BTU content routed to the device;


(3) Each enclosed combustor or utility flare must be operated to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to it by at least 98.0 percent;


(4) The owner or operator must ensure that each utility flare is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.18(b) for such flares, except for § 60.18(c)(2) and (f)(2) for those utility flares operated with an electronically controlled automatic igniter.


(5) The owner or operator must ensure that each enclosed combustor is:


(i) A model demonstrated by a manufacturer to the meet the VOC destruction efficiency requirements of §§ 49.4161 through 49.4168 using the procedure specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOO at § 60.5413(d) by the due date of the first annual report as specified in § 49.4168(b); or


(ii) Demonstrated to meet the VOC destruction efficiency requirements of §§ 49.4161 through 49.4168 using EPA approved performance test methods specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOO at § 60.5413(b) by the due date of the first annual report as specified in § 49.4168(b).


(6) The owner or operator must ensure that each enclosed combustor and utility flare is:


(i) Operated properly at all times that produced natural gas and/or natural gas emissions are routed to it;


(ii) Operated with a liquid knock-out system to collect any condensable vapors (to prevent liquids from going through the control device);


(iii) Equipped with a flash-back flame arrestor;


(iv) Equipped with one of the following:


(A) A continuous burning pilot flame.


(B) An electronically controlled automatic igniter;


(v) Equipped with a monitoring system for continuous recording of the parameters that indicate proper operation of each enclosed combustor, utility flare, continuous burning pilot flame, and electronically controlled automatic igniter, such as a chart recorder, data logger or similar devices;


(vi) Maintained in a leak-free condition; and


(vii) Operated with no visible smoke emissions.


(d) *Pit Flares.* Each owner or operator must meet the following requirements for pit flares:


(1) The owner or operator must develop written operating instructions, operating procedures and maintenance schedules to ensure good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions from the pit flare based on the site-specific design.


(2) The owner or operator must only use a pit flare for the following operations:


(i) To control produced natural gas and natural gas emissions during well completion operations or recompletion operations;


(ii) To control produced natural gas and natural gas emissions in the event that natural gas recovered for pipeline injection must be diverted to a backup control device because injection is temporarily infeasible and there is no operational enclosed combustor or utility flare at the oil and natural gas production facility. Use of the pit flare for this situation is limited to a maximum of 500 hours in any twelve (12) consecutive months; or


(iii) Control of standing, working, breathing, and flashing losses from the produced oil storage tanks and any produced water storage tank interconnected with the produced oil storage tanks if the uncontrolled potential VOC emissions from the aggregate of all produced oil storage tanks and produced water storage tanks interconnected with produced oil storage tanks is less than, and reasonably expected to remain below, 20 tons in any consecutive 12-month period.


(3) The owner or operator must only use the pit flare under the following conditions and limitations:


(i) The pit flare is operated to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to it by at least 90.0 percent;


(ii) The pit flare is operated in accordance with the site-specific written operating instructions, operating procedures, and maintenance schedules to ensure good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions;


(iii) The pit flare is operated with no visible smoke emissions;


(iv) The pit flare is equipped with an electronically controlled automatic igniter;


(v) The pit flare is visually inspected for the presence of a flame anytime produced natural gas or natural gas emissions are being routed to it. Should the flame fail, the flame must be relit as soon as safely possible and the electronically controlled automatic igniter must be repaired or replaced before the pit flare is utilized again; and


(vi) The owner or operator does not deposit or cause to be deposited into a flare pit any oil field fluids or oil and natural gas wastes other than those designed to go to the pit flare.


(e) *Other Control Devices.* Upon prior written approval by the EPA, the owner or operator may use control devices other than those listed above that are determined by EPA to be capable of reducing the mass content of VOC in the natural gas routed to it by at least 98.0 percent, provided that:


(1) In operating such control devices, the owner or operator must follow the manufacturer's written operating instructions, procedures and maintenance schedule to ensure good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions; and


(2) The owner or operator must ensure there is sufficient capacity to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to such other control devices by at least 98.0 percent for the minimum and maximum natural gas volumetric flow rate and BTU content routed to each device.


(3) The owner or operator must operate such a control device to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to it by at least 98.0 percent.
