# ยง 49.4167   Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator must maintain the following records:


(1) The measured barrels of oil produced at the oil and natural gas production facility each time the oil is unloaded from the produced oil storage tanks;


(2) The volume of produced natural gas sent to each enclosed combustor, utility flare, and pit flare at all times;


(3) The volume of natural gas emissions from the produced oil storage tanks and produced water storage tanks sent to each enclosed combustor, utility flare, and pit flare at all times;


(4) A summary of each oil and natural gas well completion operation and recompletion operation at an oil and natural gas production facility. Each summary shall include:


(i) The latitude and longitude location of the oil and natural gas well in decimal format;


(ii) The date, time, and duration in hours of flowback from the oil and natural gas well;


(iii) The date, time, and duration in hours of any venting of casinghead natural gas from the oil and natural gas well; and


(iv) Specific reasons for each instance of venting in lieu of capture or combustion.


(5) For each enclosed combustor, utility flare, and pit flare at an oil and natural gas production facility:


(i) Written, site-specific designs, operating instructions, operating procedures and maintenance schedules;


(ii) Records of all required monitoring of operations;


(iii) Records of any deviations from the operating parameters specified by the written site-specific designs, operating instructions, and operating procedures. The records must include the enclosed combustor, utility flare, or pit flare's total operating time during which a deviation occurred, the date, time and length of time that deviations occurred, and the corrective actions taken and any preventative measures adopted to operate the device within that operating parameter;


(iv) Records of any instances in which the pilot flame is not present, electronically controlled automatic igniter is not functioning, or the monitoring equipment is not functioning in the enclosed combustor, the utility flare, or the pit flare, the date and times of the occurrence, the corrective actions taken, and any preventative measures adopted to prevent recurrence of the occurrence;


(v) Records of any instances in which a recording device installed to record data from the enclosed combustor, utility flare, or pit flare is not operational; and


(vi) Records of any time periods in which visible smoke emissions are observed emanating from the enclosed combustor, utility flare, or pit flare.


(6) For each pit flare at an oil and natural gas production facility, a demonstration of compliance with the use restrictions set forth in ยง 49.4165(d)(2)(ii) is made by keeping records in a log book, or similar recording system, during each period of time that the pit flare is operating. The records must contain the following information:


(i) Date and time the pit flare was started up and subsequently shut down;


(ii) Total hours operated when pipeline injection was temporarily infeasible for the current calendar month plus the previous consecutive eleven (11) calendar months; and


(iii) Brief descriptions of the justification for each period of operation.


(7) Records of any instances in which any closed-vent system or control device was bypassed or down, the reason for each incident, its duration, the volume of natural gas emissions released, and the corrective actions taken and any preventative measures adopted to avoid such bypasses or downtimes; and


(8) Documentation of all produced oil storage tank and produced water storage tank inspections required in ยง 49.4166(e) and (f). All inspection records must include, at a minimum, the following information:


(i) The date of the inspection;


(ii) The findings of the inspection;


(iii) Any adjustments or repairs made as a result of the inspections, and the date of the adjustment or repair; and


(iv) The inspector's name and signature.


(b) Each owner or operator must keep all records required by this section onsite at the facility or at the location that has day-to-day operational control over the facility and must make the records available to the EPA upon request.


(c) Each owner or operator must retain all records required by this section for a period of at least five (5) years from the date the record was created.
