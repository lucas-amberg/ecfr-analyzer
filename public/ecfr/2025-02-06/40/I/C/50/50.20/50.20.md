# § 50.20   National primary ambient air quality standards for PM

(a) The national primary ambient air quality standards for PM_2.5_ are 9.0 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3) annual arithmetic mean concentration and 35 µg/m
3 24-hour average concentration measured in the ambient air as PM_2.5_ (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) by either:


(1) A reference method based on appendix L to this part and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter; or


(2) An equivalent method designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.


(b) The primary annual PM_2.5_ standard is met when the annual arithmetic mean concentration, as determined in accordance with appendix N to this part, is less than or equal to 9.0 µg/m
3.


(c) The primary 24-hour PM_2.5_ standard is met when the 98th percentile 24-hour concentration, as determined in accordance with appendix N to this part, is less than or equal to 35 µg/m
3.
