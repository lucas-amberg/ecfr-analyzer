All measurements of air quality that are expressed as mass per unit volume (*e.g.,* micrograms per cubic meter) other than for particulate matter (PM_2.5_) standards contained in §§ 50.7, 50.13, 50.18, and 50.20, and lead standards contained in § 50.16 shall be corrected to a reference temperature of 25 (deg) C and a reference pressure of 760 millimeters of mercury (1,013.2 millibars). Measurements of PM_2.5_ for purposes of comparison to the standards contained in §§ 50.7, 50.13, 50.18, and 50.20, and of lead for purposes of comparison to the standards contained in § 50.16 shall be reported based on actual ambient air volume measured at the actual ambient temperature and pressure at the monitoring site during the measurement period.
