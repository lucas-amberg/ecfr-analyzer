# § 50.6   National primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for PM

(a) The level of the national primary and secondary 24-hour ambient air quality standards for particulate matter is 150 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3), 24-hour average concentration. The standards are attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 µg/m
3, as determined in accordance with appendix K to this part, is equal to or less than one.


(b) [Reserved] 


(c) For the purpose of determining attainment of the primary and secondary standards, particulate matter shall be measured in the ambient air as PM_10_ (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) by:


(1) A reference method based on appendix J and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter, or


(2) An equivalent method designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.
