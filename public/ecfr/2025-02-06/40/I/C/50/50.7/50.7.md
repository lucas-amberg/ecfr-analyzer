# § 50.7   National primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for PM

(a) The national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for particulate matter are 15.0 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3) annual arithmetic mean concentration, and 65 µg/m
3 24-hour average concentration measured in the ambient air as PM_2.5_ (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) by either:


(1) A reference method based on appendix L of this part and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter; or


(2) An equivalent method designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.


(b) The annual primary and secondary PM_2.5_ standards are met when the annual arithmetic mean concentration, as determined in accordance with appendix N of this part, is less than or equal to 15.0 micrograms per cubic meter.


(c) The 24-hour primary and secondary PM_2.5_ standards are met when the 98
th percentile 24-hour concentration, as determined in accordance with appendix N of this part, is less than or equal to 65 micrograms per cubic meter.
