# Appendix D to Part 50—Reference Measurement Principle and Calibration Procedure for the Measurement of Ozone in the Atmosphere (Chemiluminescence Method)




1.0 *Applicability.*

1.1 This chemiluminescence method provides reference measurements of the concentration of ozone (O_3_) in ambient air for determining compliance with the national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for O_3_ as specified in 40 CFR part 50. This automated method is applicable to the measurement of ambient O_3_ concentrations using continuous (real-time) sampling and analysis. Additional quality assurance procedures and guidance are provided in 40 CFR part 58, appendix A, and in Reference 14.


2.0 *Measurement Principle.*

2.1 This reference method is based on continuous automated measurement of the intensity of the characteristic chemiluminescence released by the gas phase reaction of O_3_ in sampled air with either ethylene (C_2_H_4_) or nitric oxide (NO) gas. An ambient air sample stream and a specific flowing concentration of either C_2_H_4_ (ET-CL method) or NO (NO-CL method) are mixed in a measurement cell, where the resulting chemiluminescence is quantitatively measured by a sensitive photo-detector. References 8-11 describe the chemiluminescence measurement principle.


2.2 The measurement system is calibrated by referencing the instrumental chemiluminescence measurements to certified O_3_ standard concentrations generated in a dynamic flow system and assayed by ultraviolet (UV) photometry to be traceable to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference photometer for O_3_ (see Section 4, Calibration Procedure, below) with a specified ozone absorption cross-section value. The absorption cross-section value stated in section 4.1 and section 4.5.3.10 of this appendix (304.39 atm_−1_ cm_−1_ ± 0.94 atm_−1_ cm_−1_) will begin use in all U.S. Standard Reference Photometers (SRPs) on January 1, 2025. It is expected that implementation across all other ozone transfer standards and ozone monitors in the field will be completed by December 31, 2026.








2.3 An analyzer implementing this measurement principle is shown schematically in Figure 1. Designs implementing this measurement principle must include: an appropriately designed mixing and measurement cell; a suitable quantitative photometric measurement system with adequate sensitivity and wavelength specificity for O_3_; a pump, flow control, and sample conditioning system for sampling the ambient air and moving it into and through the measurement cell; a sample air dryer as necessary to meet the water vapor interference limit requirement specified in subpart B of part 53 of this chapter; a means to supply, meter, and mix a constant, flowing stream of either C_2_H_4_ or NO gas of fixed concentration with the sample air flow in the measurement cell; suitable electronic control and measurement processing capability; and other associated apparatus as may be necessary. The analyzer must be designed and constructed to provide accurate, repeatable, and continuous measurements of O_3_ concentrations in ambient air, with measurement performance that meets the requirements specified in subpart B of part 53 of this chapter.


2.4 An analyzer implementing this measurement principle and calibration procedure will be considered a federal reference method (FRM) only if it has been designated as a reference method in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.


2.5 *Sampling considerations.* The use of a particle filter on the sample inlet line of a chemiluminescence O_3_ FRM analyzer is required to prevent buildup of particulate matter in the measurement cell and inlet components. This filter must be changed weekly (or at least often as specified in the manufacturer's operation/instruction manual), and the sample inlet system used with the analyzer must be kept clean, to avoid loss of O_3_ in the O_3_ sample air prior to the concentration measurement.


3.0 *Interferences.*

3.1 Except as described in 3.2 below, the chemiluminescence measurement system is inherently free of significant interferences from other pollutant substances that may be present in ambient air.


3.2 A small sensitivity to variations in the humidity of the sample air is minimized by a sample air dryer. Potential loss of O_3_ in the inlet air filter and in the air sample handling components of the analyzer and associated exterior air sampling components due to buildup of airborne particulate matter is minimized by filter replacement and cleaning of the other inlet components.


4.0 *Calibration Procedure.*

4.1 *Principle.* The calibration procedure is based on the photometric assay of O_3_ concentrations in a dynamic flow system. The concentration of O_3_ in an absorption cell is determined from a measurement of the amount of 254 nm light absorbed by the sample. This determination requires knowledge of (1) the absorption coefficient (α) of O_3_ at 254 nm, (2) the optical path length (l) through the sample, (3) the transmittance of the sample at a nominal wavelength of 254 nm, and (4) the temperature (T) and pressure (P) of the sample. The transmittance is defined as the ratio I/I_0_, where I is the intensity of light which passes through the cell and is sensed by the detector when the cell contains an O_3_ sample, and I_0_ is the intensity of light which passes through the cell and is sensed by the detector when the cell contains zero air. It is assumed that all conditions of the system, except for the contents of the absorption cell, are identical during measurement of I and I_0_. The quantities defined above are related by the Beer-Lambert absorption law,


A stable O_3_ generator is used to produce O_3_ concentrations over the required calibration concentration range. Each O_3_ concentration is determined from the measurement of the transmittance (I/I_0_) of the sample at 254 nm with a photometer of path length l and calculated from the equation,


The calculated O_3_ concentrations must be corrected for O_3_ losses, which may occur in the photometer, and for the temperature and pressure of the sample.






4.2 *Applicability.* This procedure is applicable to the calibration of ambient air O_3_ analyzers, either directly or by means of a transfer standard certified by this procedure. Transfer standards must meet the requirements and specifications set forth in Reference 12.


4.3 *Apparatus.* A complete UV calibration system consists of an O_3_ generator, an output port or manifold, a photometer, an appropriate source of zero air, and other components as necessary. The configuration must provide a stable O_3_ concentration at the system output and allow the photometer to accurately assay the output concentration to the precision specified for the photometer (4.3.1). Figure 2 shows a commonly used configuration and serves to illustrate the calibration procedure, which follows. Other configurations may require appropriate variations in the procedural steps. All connections between components in the calibration system downstream of the O_3_ generator must be of glass, Teflon, or other relatively inert materials. Additional information regarding the assembly of a UV photometric calibration apparatus is given in Reference 13. For certification of transfer standards which provide their own source of O_3,_ the transfer standard may replace the O_3_ generator and possibly other components shown in Figure 2; see Reference 12 for guidance.


4.3.1 *UV photometer.* The photometer consists of a low-pressure mercury discharge lamp, (optional) collimation optics, an absorption cell, a detector, and signal-processing electronics, as illustrated in Figure 2. It must be capable of measuring the transmittance, I/I_0,_ at a wavelength of 254 nm with sufficient precision such that the standard deviation of the concentration measurements does not exceed the greater of 0.005 ppm or 3% of the concentration. Because the low-pressure mercury lamp radiates at several wavelengths, the photometer must incorporate suitable means to assure that no O_3_ is generated in the cell by the lamp, and that at least 99.5% of the radiation sensed by the detector is 254 nm radiation. (This can be readily achieved by prudent selection of optical filter and detector response characteristics.) The length of the light path through the absorption cell must be known with an accuracy of at least 99.5%. In addition, the cell and associated plumbing must be designed to minimize loss of O_3_ from contact with cell walls and gas handling components. See Reference 13 for additional information.


4.3.2 *Air flow controllers.* Air flow controllers are devices capable of regulating air flows as necessary to meet the output stability and photometer precision requirements.


4.3.3 *Ozone generator.* The ozone generator used must be capable of generating stable levels of O_3_ over the required concentration range.


4.3.4 *Output manifold.* The output manifold must be constructed of glass, Teflon, or other relatively inert material, and should be of sufficient diameter to insure a negligible pressure drop at the photometer connection and other output ports. The system must have a vent designed to insure atmospheric pressure in the manifold and to prevent ambient air from entering the manifold.


4.3.5 *Two-way valve.* A manual or automatic two-way valve, or other means is used to switch the photometer flow between zero air and the O_3_ concentration.


4.3.6 *Temperature indicator.* A device to indicate temperature must be used that is accurate to ±1 °C.


4.3.7 *Barometer or pressure indicator.* A device to indicate barometric pressure must be used that is accurate to ±2 torr.


4.4 *Reagents.*

4.4.1 *Zero air.* The zero air must be free of contaminants which would cause a detectable response from the O_3_ analyzer, and it must be free of NO, C_2_H_4_, and other species which react with O_3_. A procedure for generating suitable zero air is given in Reference 13. As shown in Figure 2, the zero air supplied to the photometer cell for the I_0_ reference measurement must be derived from the same source as the zero air used for generation of the O_3_ concentration to be assayed (I measurement). When using the photometer to certify a transfer standard having its own source of O_3_, see Reference 12 for guidance on meeting this requirement.


4.5 *Procedure.*

4.5.1 *General operation.* The calibration photometer must be dedicated exclusively to use as a calibration standard. It must always be used with clean, filtered calibration gases, and never used for ambient air sampling. A number of advantages are realized by locating the calibration photometer in a clean laboratory where it can be stationary, protected from the physical shock of transportation, operated by a responsible analyst, and used as a common standard for all field calibrations via transfer standards.


4.5.2 *Preparation.* Proper operation of the photometer is of critical importance to the accuracy of this procedure. Upon initial operation of the photometer, the following steps must be carried out with all quantitative results or indications recorded in a chronological record, either in tabular form or plotted on a graphical chart. As the performance and stability record of the photometer is established, the frequency of these steps may be reduced to be consistent with the documented stability of the photometer and the guidance provided in Reference 12.


4.5.2.1 *Instruction manual.* Carry out all set up and adjustment procedures or checks as described in the operation or instruction manual associated with the photometer.


4.5.2.2 *System check.* Check the photometer system for integrity, leaks, cleanliness, proper flow rates, etc. Service or replace filters and zero air scrubbers or other consumable materials, as necessary.


4.5.2.3 *Linearity.* Verify that the photometer manufacturer has adequately established that the linearity error of the photometer is less than 3%, or test the linearity by dilution as follows: Generate and assay an O_3_ concentration near the upper range limit of the system or appropriate calibration scale for the instrument, then accurately dilute that concentration with zero air and re-assay it. Repeat at several different dilution ratios. Compare the assay of the original concentration with the assay of the diluted concentration divided by the dilution ratio, as follows


The linearity error must be less than 5%. Since the accuracy of the measured flow-rates will affect the linearity error as measured this way, the test is not necessarily conclusive. Additional information on verifying linearity is contained in Reference 13.


4.5.2.4 *Inter-comparison.* The photometer must be inter-compared annually, either directly or via transfer standards, with a NIST standard reference photometer (SRP) or calibration photometers used by other agencies or laboratories.


4.5.2.5 *Ozone losses.* Some portion of the O_3_ may be lost upon contact with the photometer cell walls and gas handling components. The magnitude of this loss must be determined and used to correct the calculated O_3_ concentration. This loss must not exceed 5%. Some guidelines for quantitatively determining this loss are discussed in Reference 13.


4.5.3 *Assay of O*_3_*concentrations.* The operator must carry out the following steps to properly assay O_3_ concentrations.


4.5.3.1 Allow the photometer system to warm up and stabilize.


4.5.3.2 Verify that the flow rate through the photometer absorption cell, F, allows the cell to be flushed in a reasonably short period of time (2 liter/min is a typical flow). The precision of the measurements is inversely related to the time required for flushing, since the photometer drift error increases with time.


4.5.3.3 Ensure that the flow rate into the output manifold is at least 1 liter/min greater than the total flow rate required by the photometer and any other flow demand connected to the manifold.


4.5.3.4 Ensure that the flow rate of zero air, Fz, is at least 1 liter/min greater than the flow rate required by the photometer.


4.5.3.5 With zero air flowing in the output manifold, actuate the two-way valve to allow the photometer to sample first the manifold zero air, then Fz. The two photometer readings must be equal (I = I_0_).


4.5.3.6 Adjust the O_3_ generator to produce an O_3_ concentration as needed.


4.5.3.7 Actuate the two-way valve to allow the photometer to sample zero air until the absorption cell is thoroughly flushed and record the stable measured value of Io.


4.5.3.8 Actuate the two-way valve to allow the photometer to sample the O_3_ concentration until the absorption cell is thoroughly flushed and record the stable measured value of I.


4.5.3.9 Record the temperature and pressure of the sample in the photometer absorption cell. (See Reference 13 for guidance.)






4.5.3.10. Calculate the O_3_ concentration from equation 4. An average of several determinations will provide better precision.


4.5.3.11 Obtain additional O_3_ concentration standards as necessary by repeating steps 4.5.3.6 to 4.5.3.10 or by Option 1.


4.5.4 *Certification of transfer standards.* A transfer standard is certified by relating the output of the transfer standard to one or more O_3_ calibration standards as determined according to section 4.5.3. The exact procedure varies depending on the nature and design of the transfer standard. Consult Reference 12 for guidance.


4.5.5 *Calibration of ozone analyzers.* Ozone analyzers must be calibrated as follows, using O_3_ standards obtained directly according to section 4.5.3 or by means of a certified transfer standard.


4.5.5.1 Allow sufficient time for the O_3_ analyzer and the photometer or transfer standard to warm-up and stabilize.


4.5.5.2 Allow the O_3_ analyzer to sample zero air until a stable response is obtained and then adjust the O_3_ analyzer's zero control. Offsetting the analyzer's zero adjustment to +5% of scale is recommended to facilitate observing negative zero drift (if any). Record the stable zero air response as “Z”.


4.5.5.3 Generate an O_3_ concentration standard of approximately 80% of the desired upper range limit (URL) of the O_3_ analyzer. Allow the O_3_ analyzer to sample this O_3_ concentration standard until a stable response is obtained.


4.5.5.4 Adjust the O_3_ analyzer's span control to obtain the desired response equivalent to the calculated standard concentration. Record the O_3_ concentration and the corresponding analyzer response. If substantial adjustment of the span control is necessary, recheck the zero and span adjustments by repeating steps 4.5.5.2 to 4.5.5.4.


4.5.5.5 Generate additional O_3_ concentration standards (a minimum of 5 are recommended) over the calibration scale of the O_3_ analyzer by adjusting the O_3_ source or by Option 1. For each O_3_ concentration standard, record the O_3_ concentration and the corresponding analyzer response.


4.5.5.6 Plot the O_3_ analyzer responses (vertical or Y-axis) versus the corresponding O_3_ standard concentrations (horizontal or X-axis). Compute the linear regression slope and intercept and plot the regression line to verify that no point deviates from this line by more than 2 percent of the maximum concentration tested.


4.5.5.7 *Option 1:* The various O_3_ concentrations required in steps 4.5.3.11 and 4.5.5.5 may be obtained by dilution of the O_3_ concentration generated in steps 4.5.3.6 and 4.5.5.3. With this option, accurate flow measurements are required. The dynamic calibration system may be modified as shown in Figure 3 to allow for dilution air to be metered in downstream of the O_3_ generator. A mixing chamber between the O_3_ generator and the output manifold is also required. The flow rate through the O_3_ generator (Fo) and the dilution air flow rate (FD) are measured with a flow or volume standard that is traceable to a NIST flow or volume calibration standard. Each O_3_ concentration generated by dilution is calculated from:


5.0 *Frequency of Calibration.*

5.1 The frequency of calibration, as well as the number of points necessary to establish the calibration curve, and the frequency of other performance checking will vary by analyzer; however, the minimum frequency, acceptance criteria, and subsequent actions are specified in Appendix D of Reference 14: Measurement Quality Objectives and Validation Templates. The user's quality control program shall provide guidelines for initial establishment of these variables and for subsequent alteration as operational experience is accumulated. Manufacturers of analyzers should include in their instruction/operation manuals information and guidance as to these variables and on other matters of operation, calibration, routine maintenance, and quality control.
