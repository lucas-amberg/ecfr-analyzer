# Appendix F to Part 50—Measurement Principle and Calibration Procedure for the Measurement of Nitrogen Dioxide in the Atmosphere (Gas Phase Chemiluminescence)


1. Atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO_2_) are measured indirectly by photometrically measuring the light intensity, at wavelengths greater than 600 nanometers, resulting from the chemiluminescent reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with ozone (O_3_). (*1,2,3*) NO_2_ is first quantitatively reduced to NO(*4,5,6*) by means of a converter. NO, which commonly exists in ambient air together with NO_2_, passes through the converter unchanged causing a resultant total NO_X_ concentration equal to NO + NO_2_. A sample of the input air is also measured without having passed through the converted. This latter NO measurement is subtracted from the former measurement (NO + NO_2_) to yield the final NO_2_ measurement. The NO and NO + NO_2_ measurements may be made concurrently with dual systems, or cyclically with the same system provided the cycle time does not exceed 1 minute.


2. *Sampling considerations.*

2.1 Chemiluminescence NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzers will respond to other nitrogen containing compounds, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), which might be reduced to NO in the thermal converter. (*7*) Atmospheric concentrations of these potential interferences are generally low relative to NO_2_ and valid NO_2_ measurements may be obtained. In certain geographical areas, where the concentration of these potential interferences is known or suspected to be high relative to NO_2_, the use of an equivalent method for the measurement of NO_2_ is recommended.


2.2 The use of integrating flasks on the sample inlet line of chemiluminescence NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzers is optional and left to couraged. The sample residence time between the sampling point and the analyzer should be kept to a minimum to avoid erroneous NO_2_ measurements resulting from the reaction of ambient levels of NO and O_3_ in the sampling system.


2.3 The use of particulate filters on the sample inlet line of chemiluminescence NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzers is optional and left to the discretion of the user or the manufacturer.


3. An analyzer based on this principle will be considered a reference method only if it has been designated as a reference method in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.


1. *Alternative A*—Gas phase titration (GPT) of an NO standard with O_3_.


*Major equipment required:* Stable O_3_ generator. Chemiluminescence NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer with strip chart recorder(s). NO concentration standard.


1.1 *Principle.* This calibration technique is based upon the rapid gas phase reaction between NO and O_3_ to produce stoichiometric quantities of NO_2_ in accordance with the following equation: (*8*)


1.2 *Apparatus.* Figure 1, a schematic of a typical GPT apparatus, shows the suggested configuration of the components listed below. All connections between components in the calibration system downstream from the O_3_ generator should be of glass, Teflon ®, or other non-reactive material.


1.2.1 *Air flow controllers.* Devices capable of maintaining constant air flows within ±2% of the required flowrate.


1.2.2 *NO flow controller.* A device capable of maintaining constant NO flows within ±2% of the required flowrate. Component parts in contact with the NO should be of a non-reactive material.


1.2.3 *Air flowmeters.* Calibrated flowmeters capable of measuring and monitoring air flowrates with an accuracy of ±2% of the measured flowrate.


1.2.4 *NO flowmeter.* A calibrated flowmeter capable of measuring and monitoring NO flowrates with an accuracy of ±2% of the measured flowrate. (Rotameters have been reported to operate unreliably when measuring low NO flows and are not recommended.)


1.2.5 *Pressure regulator for standard NO cylinder.* This regulator must have a nonreactive diaphragm and internal parts and a suitable delivery pressure.


1.2.6 *Ozone generator.* The generator must be capable of generating sufficient and stable levels of O_3_ for reaction with NO to generate NO_2_ concentrations in the range required. Ozone generators of the electric discharge type may produce NO and NO_2_ and are not recommended.


1.2.7 *Valve.* A valve may be used as shown in Figure 1 to divert the NO flow when zero air is required at the manifold. The valve should be constructed of glass, Teflon ®, or other nonreactive material.


1.2.8 *Reaction chamber.* A chamber, constructed of glass, Teflon ®, or other nonreactive material, for the quantitative reaction of O_3_ with excess NO. The chamber should be of sufficient volume (*V*_RC_) such that the residence time (*t*_R_) meets the requirements specified in 1.4. For practical reasons, t_R_ should be less than 2 minutes.


1.2.9 *Mixing chamber.* A chamber constructed of glass, Teflon ®, or other nonreactive material and designed to provide thorough mixing of reaction products and diluent air. The residence time is not critical when the dynamic parameter specification given in 1.4 is met.


1.2.10 *Output manifold.* The output manifold should be constructed of glass, Teflon ®, or other non-reactive material and should be of sufficient diameter to insure an insignificant pressure drop at the analyzer connection. The system must have a vent designed to insure atmospheric pressure at the manifold and to prevent ambient air from entering the manifold.


1.3 *Reagents.*

1.3.1 *NO concentration standard.* Gas cylinder standard containing 50 to 100 ppm NO in N_2_ with less than 1 ppm NO_2_. This standard must be traceable to a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) NO in N_2_ Standard Reference Material (SRM 1683 or SRM 1684), an NBS NO_2_ Standard Reference Material (SRM 1629), or an NBS/EPA-approved commercially available Certified Reference Material (CRM). CRM's are described in Reference 14, and a list of CRM sources is available from the address shown for Reference 14. A recommended protocol for certifying NO gas cylinders against either an NO SRM or CRM is given in section 2.0.7 of Reference 15. Reference 13 gives procedures for certifying an NO gas cylinder against an NBS NO_2_ SRM and for determining the amount of NO_2_ impurity in an NO cylinder.


1.3.2 *Zero air.* Air, free of contaminants which will cause a detectable response on the NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer or which might react with either NO, O_3_, or NO_2_ in the gas phase titration. A procedure for generating zero air is given in reference 13.


1.4 *Dynamic parameter specification.*

1.4.1 The O_3_ generator air flowrate (F_0_) and NO flowrate (F_NO_) (see Figure 1) must be adjusted such that the following relationship holds:


1.4.2 The flow conditions to be used in the GPT system are determined by the following procedure:


(a) Determine *F*_T_, the total flow required at the output manifold (*F*_T_ = analyzer demand plus 10 to 50% excess).


(b) Establish [NO]_OUT_ as the highest NO concentration (ppm) which will be required at the output manifold. [NO]_OUT_ should be approximately equivalent to 90% of the upper range limit (*URL*) of the NO_2_ concentration range to be covered.


(c) Determine F_NO_ as


(d) Select a convenient or available reaction chamber volume. Initially, a trial *V*_RC_ may be selected to be in the range of approximately 200 to 500 scm
3.


(e) Compute FO as


(f) Compute *t*_R_ as


(g) Compute the diluent air flowrate as


(h) If *F*_O_ turns out to be impractical for the desired system, select a reaction chamber having a different *V*_RC_ and recompute *F*_O_ and *F*_D_.


1.5 *Procedure.*

1.5.1 Assemble a dynamic calibration system such as the one shown in Figure 1.


1.5.2 Insure that all flowmeters are calibrated under the conditions of use against a reliable standard such as a soap-bubble meter or wet-test meter. All volumetric flowrates should be corrected to 25 °C and 760 mm Hg. A discussion on the calibration of flowmeters is given in reference 13.


1.5.3 Precautions must be taken to remove O_2_ and other contaminants from the NO pressure regulator and delivery system prior to the start of calibration to avoid any conversion of the standard NO to NO_2_. Failure to do so can cause significant errors in calibration. This problem may be minimized by (1) carefully evacuating the regulator, when possible, after the regulator has been connected to the cylinder and before opening the cylinder valve; (2) thoroughly flushing the regulator and delivery system with NO after opening the cylinder valve; (3) not removing the regulator from the cylinder between calibrations unless absolutely necessary. Further discussion of these procedures is given in reference 13.


1.5.4 Select the operating range of the NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer to be calibrated. In order to obtain maximum precision and accuracy for NO_2_ calibration, all three channels of the analyzer should be set to the same range. If operation of the NO and NO_X_ channels on higher ranges is desired, subsequent recalibration of the NO and NO_X_ channels on the higher ranges is recommended.


1.5.5 Connect the recorder output cable(s) of the NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer to the input terminals of the strip chart recorder(s). All adjustments to the analyzer should be performed based on the appropriate strip chart readings. References to analyzer responses in the procedures given below refer to recorder responses.


1.5.6 Determine the GPT flow conditions required to meet the dynamic parameter specification as indicated in 1.4.


1.5.7 Adjust the diluent air and O_3_ generator air flows to obtain the flows determined in section 1.4.2. The total air flow must exceed the total demand of the analyzer(s) connected to the output manifold to insure that no ambient air is pulled into the manifold vent. Allow the analyzer to sample zero air until stable NO, NO_X_, and NO_2_ responses are obtained. After the responses have stabilized, adjust the analyzer zero control(s).


Offsetting the analyzer zero adjustments to + 5 percent of scale is recommended to facilitate observing negative zero drift. Record the stable zero air responses as Z_NO_, _Znox_, and _Zno2_.


1.5.8 *Preparation of NO and NO*_X_*calibration curves.*

1.5.8.1 *Adjustment of NO span control.* Adjust the NO flow from the standard NO cylinder to generate an NO concentration of approximately 80 percent of the upper range limit (*URL*) of the NO range. This exact NO concentration is calculated from:


1.5.8.2 *Adjustment of NO*_X_*span control.* When adjusting the analyzer's NO_X_ span control, the presence of any NO_2_ impurity in the standard NO cylinder must be taken into account. Procedures for determining the amount of NO_2_ impurity in the standard NO cylinder are given in reference 13. The exact NO_X_ concentration is calculated from:


1.5.8.3 Generate several additional concentrations (at least five evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested to verify linearity) by decreasing F_NO_ or increasing F_D_. For each concentration generated, calculate the exact NO and NO_X_ concentrations using equations (9) and (11) respectively. Record the analyzer's NO and NO_X_ responses for each concentration. Plot the analyzer responses versus the respective calculated NO and NO_X_ concentrations and draw or calculate the NO and NO_X_ calibration curves. For subsequent calibrations where linearity can be assumed, these curves may be checked with a two-point calibration consisting of a zero air point and NO and NO_X_ concentrations of approximately 80% of the *URL*.


1.5.9 *Preparation of NO*_2_*calibration curve.*

1.5.9.1 Assuming the NO_2_ zero has been properly adjusted while sampling zero air in step 1.5.7, adjust F_O_ and F_D_ as determined in section 1.4.2. Adjust F_NO_ to generate an NO concentration near 90% of the *URL* of the NO range. Sample this NO concentration until the NO and NO_X_ responses have stabilized. Using the NO calibration curve obtained in section 1.5.8, measure and record the NO concentration as [NO]_orig_. Using the NO_X_ calibration curve obtained in section 1.5.8, measure and record the NO_X_ concentration as [NO_X_]_orig_.


1.5.9.2 Adjust the O_3_ generator to generate sufficient O_3_ to produce a decrease in the NO concentration equivalent to approximately 80% of the URL of the NO_2_ range. The decrease must not exceed 90% of the NO concentration determined in step 1.5.9.1. After the analyzer responses have stabilized, record the resultant NO and NO_X_ concentrations as [NO]_rem_ and [NO_X_]_rem_.


1.5.9.3 Calculate the resulting NO_2_ concentration from:


1.5.9.4 Maintaining the same F_NO_, F_O_, and F_D_ as in section 1.5.9.1, adjust the ozone generator to obtain several other concentrations of NO_2_ over the NO_2_ range (at least five evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested). Calculate each NO_2_ concentration using equation (13) and record the corresponding analyzer NO_2_ and NO_X_ responses. Plot the analyzer's NO_2_ responses versus the corresponding calculated NO_2_ concentrations and draw or calculate the NO_2_ calibration curve.


1.5.10 *Determination of converter efficiency.*

1.5.10.1 For each NO_2_ concentration generated during the preparation of the NO_2_ calibration curve (see section 1.5.9) calculate the concentration of NO_2_ converted from:


2. *Alternative B*—NO_2_ permeation device.


*Major equipment required:*

Stable O_3_ generator.


Chemiluminescence NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer with strip chart recorder(s).


NO concentration standard.


NO_2_ concentration standard.


2.1 *Principle.* Atmospheres containing accurately known concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are generated by means of a permeation device. (*10*) The permeation device emits NO_2_ at a known constant rate provided the temperature of the device is held constant (±0.1 °C) and the device has been accurately calibrated at the temperature of use. The NO_2_ emitted from the device is diluted with zero air to produce NO_2_ concentrations suitable for calibration of the NO_2_ channel of the NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer. An NO concentration standard is used for calibration of the NO and NO_X_ channels of the analyzer.


2.2 *Apparatus.* A typical system suitable for generating the required NO and NO_2_ concentrations is shown in Figure 2. All connections between components downstream from the permeation device should be of glass, Teflon ®, or other non-reactive material.


2.2.1 *Air flow controllers.* Devices capable of maintaining constant air flows within ±2% of the required flowrate.


2.2.2 *NO flow controller.* A device capable of maintaining constant NO flows within ±2% of the required flowrate. Component parts in contact with the NO must be of a non-reactive material.


2.2.3 *Air flowmeters.* Calibrated flowmeters capable of measuring and monitoring air flowrates with an accuracy of ±2% of the measured flowrate.


2.2.4 *NO flowmeter.* A calibrated flowmeter capable of measuring and monitoring NO flowrates with an accuracy of ±2% of the measured flowrate. (Rotameters have been reported to operate unreliably when measuring low NO flows and are not recommended.)


2.2.5 *Pressure regulator for standard NO cylinder.* This regulator must have a non-reactive diaphragm and internal parts and a suitable delivery pressure.


2.2.6 *Drier.* Scrubber to remove moisture from the permeation device air system. The use of the drier is optional with NO_2_ permeation devices not sensitive to moisture. (Refer to the supplier's instructions for use of the permeation device.)


2.2.7 *Constant temperature chamber.* Chamber capable of housing the NO_2_ permeation device and maintaining its temperature to within ±0.1 °C.


2.2.8 *Temperature measuring device.* Device capable of measuring and monitoring the temperature of the NO_2_ permeation device with an accuracy of ±0.05 °C.


2.2.9 *Valves.* A valve may be used as shown in Figure 2 to divert the NO_2_ from the permeation device when zero air or NO is required at the manifold. A second valve may be used to divert the NO flow when zero air or NO_2_ is required at the manifold.


The valves should be constructed of glass, Teflon ®, or other nonreactive material.


2.2.10 *Mixing chamber.* A chamber constructed of glass, Teflon ®, or other nonreactive material and designed to provide thorough mixing of pollutant gas streams and diluent air.


2.2.11 *Output manifold.* The output manifold should be constructed of glass, Teflon ®, or other non-reactive material and should be of sufficient diameter to insure an insignificant pressure drop at the analyzer connection. The system must have a vent designed to insure atmospheric pressure at the manifold and to prevent ambient air from entering the manifold.


2.3 *Reagents.*

2.3.1 *Calibration standards.* Calibration standards are required for both NO and NO_2_. The reference standard for the calibration may be either an NO or NO_2_ standard, and must be traceable to a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) NO in N_2_ Standard Reference Material (SRM 1683 or SRM 1684), and NBS NO_2_ Standard Reference Material (SRM 1629), or an NBS/EPA-approved commercially available Certified Reference Material (CRM). CRM's are described in Reference 14, and a list of CRM sources is available from the address shown for Reference 14. Reference 15 gives recommended procedures for certifying an NO gas cylinder against an NO SRM or CRM and for certifying an NO_2_ permeation device against an NO_2_ SRM. Reference 13 contains procedures for certifying an NO gas cylinder against an NO_2_ SRM and for certifying an NO_2_ permeation device against an NO SRM or CRM. A procedure for determining the amount of NO_2_ impurity in an NO cylinder is also contained in Reference 13. The NO or NO_2_ standard selected as the reference standard must be used to certify the other standard to ensure consistency between the two standards.


2.3.1.1 *NO*_2_*Concentration standard.* A permeation device suitable for generating NO_2_ concentrations at the required flow-rates over the required concentration range. If the permeation device is used as the reference standard, it must be traceable to an SRM or CRM as specified in 2.3.1. If an NO cylinder is used as the reference standard, the NO_2_ permeation device must be certified against the NO standard according to the procedure given in Reference 13. The use of the permeation device should be in strict accordance with the instructions supplied with the device. Additional information regarding the use of permeation devices is given by Scaringelli et al. (11) and Rook et al. (12).


2.3.1.2 *NO Concentration standard.* Gas cylinder containing 50 to 100 ppm NO in N_2_ with less than 1 ppm NO_2_. If this cylinder is used as the reference standard, the cylinder must be traceable to an SRM or CRM as specified in 2.3.1. If an NO_2_ permeation device is used as the reference standard, the NO cylinder must be certified against the NO_2_ standard according to the procedure given in Reference 13. The cylinder should be recertified on a regular basis as determined by the local quality control program.


2.3.3 *Zero air.* Air, free of contaminants which might react with NO or NO_2_ or cause a detectable response on the NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer. When using permeation devices that are sensitive to moisture, the zero air passing across the permeation device must be dry to avoid surface reactions on the device. (Refer to the supplier's instructions for use of the permeation device.) A procedure for generating zero air is given in reference 13.


2.4 *Procedure.*

2.4.1 Assemble the calibration apparatus such as the typical one shown in Figure 2.


2.4.2 Insure that all flowmeters are calibrated under the conditions of use against a reliable standard such as a soap bubble meter or wet-test meter. All volumetric flowrates should be corrected to 25 °C and 760 mm Hg. A discussion on the calibration of flowmeters is given in reference 13.


2.4.3 Install the permeation device in the constant temperature chamber. Provide a small fixed air flow (200-400 scm
3/min) across the device. The permeation device should always have a continuous air flow across it to prevent large buildup of NO_2_ in the system and a consequent restabilization period. Record the flowrate as FP. Allow the device to stabilize at the calibration temperature for at least 24 hours. The temperature must be adjusted and controlled to within ±0.1 °C or less of the calibration temperature as monitored with the temperature measuring device.


2.4.4 Precautions must be taken to remove O_2_ and other contaminants from the NO pressure regulator and delivery system prior to the start of calibration to avoid any conversion of the standard NO to NO_2_. Failure to do so can cause significant errors in calibration. This problem may be minimized by


(1) Carefully evacuating the regulator, when possible, after the regulator has been connected to the cylinder and before opening the cylinder valve;


(2) Thoroughly flushing the regulator and delivery system with NO after opening the cylinder valve;


(3) Not removing the regulator from the cylinder between calibrations unless absolutely necessary. Further discussion of these procedures is given in reference 13.


2.4.5 Select the operating range of the NO/NO_X_ NO_2_ analyzer to be calibrated. In order to obtain maximum precision and accuracy for NO_2_ calibration, all three channels of the analyzer should be set to the same range. If operation of the NO and NO_X_ channels on higher ranges is desired, subsequent recalibration of the NO and NO_X_ channels on the higher ranges is recommended.


2.4.6 Connect the recorder output cable(s) of the NO/NO_X_/NO_2_ analyzer to the input terminals of the strip chart recorder(s). All adjustments to the analyzer should be performed based on the appropriate strip chart readings. References to analyzer responses in the procedures given below refer to recorder responses.


2.4.7 Switch the valve to vent the flow from the permeation device and adjust the diluent air flowrate, F_D_, to provide zero air at the output manifold. The total air flow must exceed the total demand of the analyzer(s) connected to the output manifold to insure that no ambient air is pulled into the manifold vent. Allow the analyzer to sample zero air until stable NO, NO_X_, and NO_2_ responses are obtained. After the responses have stabilized, adjust the analyzer zero control(s).


2.4.8 *Preparation of NO and NO*_X_*calibration curves.*

2.4.8.1 *Adjustment of NO span control.* Adjust the NO flow from the standard NO cylinder to generate an NO concentration of approximately 80% of the upper range limit (URL) of the NO range. The exact NO concentration is calculated from:


2.4.8.2 *Adjustment of NO*_X_*span control.* When adjusting the analyzer's NO_X_ span control, the presence of any NO_2_ impurity in the standard NO cylinder must be taken into account. Procedures for determining the amount of NO_2_ impurity in the standard NO cylinder are given in reference 13. The exact NO_X_ concentration is calculated from:


2.4.8.3 Generate several additional concentrations (at least five evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested to verify linearity) by decreasing F_NO_ or increasing *F*_D_. For each concentration generated, calculate the exact NO and NO_X_ concentrations using equations (16) and (18) respectively. Record the analyzer's NO and NO_X_ responses for each concentration. Plot the analyzer responses versus the respective calculated NO and NO_X_ concentrations and draw or calculate the NO and NO_X_ calibration curves. For subsequent calibrations where linearity can be assumed, these curves may be checked with a two-point calibration consisting of a zero point and NO and NO_X_ concentrations of approximately 80 percent of the URL.


2.4.9 *Preparation of NO*_2_*calibration curve.*

2.4.9.1 Remove the NO flow. Assuming the NO_2_ zero has been properly adjusted while sampling zero air in step 2.4.7, switch the valve to provide NO_2_ at the output manifold.


2.4.9.2 Adjust *F*_D_ to generate an NO_2_ concentration of approximately 80 percent of the *URL* of the NO_2_ range. The total air flow must exceed the demand of the analyzer(s) under calibration. The actual concentration of NO_2_ is calculated from:


2.4.9.3 Adjust *F*_D_ to obtain several other concentrations of NO_2_ over the NO_2_ range (at least five evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested). Calculate each NO_2_ concentration using equation (20) and record the corresponding analyzer NO_2_ and NO_X_ responses. Plot the analyzer's NO_2_ responses versus the corresponding calculated NO_2_ concentrations and draw or calculate the NO_2_ calibration curve.


2.4.10 *Determination of converter efficiency.*

2.4.10.1 Plot [NO_X_]_M_ (y-axis) versus [NO_2_]_OUT_ (x-axis) and draw or calculate the converter efficiency curve. The slope of the curve times 100 is the average converter efficiency, *E*_C_. The average converter efficiency must be greater than 96 percent; if it is less than 96 percent, replace or service the converter.


3. *Frequency of calibration.* The frequency of calibration, as well as the number of points necessary to establish the calibration curve and the frequency of other performance checks, will vary from one analyzer to another. The user's quality control program should provide guidelines for initial establishment of these variables and for subsequent alteration as operational experience is accumulated. Manufacturers of analyzers should include in their instruction/operation manuals information and guidance as to these variables and on other matters of operation, calibration, and quality control.
