# Appendix L to Part 51—Example Regulations for Prevention of Air Pollution Emergency Episodes


The example regulations presented herein reflect generally recognized ways of preventing air pollution from reaching levels that would cause imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons. States are required under subpart H to have emergency episodes plans but they are not required to adopt the regulations presented herein.


1.0 *Air pollution emergency.* This regulation is designed to prevent the excessive buildup of air pollutants during air pollution episodes, thereby preventing the occurrence of an emergency due to the effects of these pollutants on the health of persons.


1.1 *Episode criteria.* Conditions justifying the proclamation of an air pollution alert, air pollution warning, or air pollution emergency shall be deemed to exist whenever the Director determines that the accumulation of air pollutants in any place is attaining or has attained levels which could, if such levels are sustained or exceeded, lead to a substantial threat to the health of persons. In making this determination, the Director will be guided by the following criteria:


(a) *Air Pollution Forecast:* An internal watch by the Department of Air Pollution Control shall be actuated by a National Weather Service advisory that Atmospheric Stagnation Advisory is in effect or the equivalent local forecast of stagnant atmospheric condition.


(b) *Alert:* The Alert level is that concentration of pollutants at which first stage control actions is to begin. An Alert will be declared when any one of the following levels is reached at any monitoring site:


In addition to the levels listed for the above pollutants, meterological conditions are such that pollutant concentrations can be expected to remain at the above levels for twelve (12) or more hours or increase, or in the case of ozone, the situation is likely to reoccur within the next 24-hours unless control actions are taken.


(c) *Warning:* The warning level indicates that air quality is continuing to degrade and that additional control actions are necessary. A warning will be declared when any one of the following levels is reached at any monitoring site:


In addition to the levels listed for the above pollutants, meterological conditions are such that pollutant concentrations can be expected to remain at the above levels for twelve (12) or more hours or increase, or in the case of ozone, the situation is likely to reoccur within the next 24-hours unless control actions are taken.


(d) *Emergency:* The emergency level indicates that air quality is continuing to degrade toward a level of significant harm to the health of persons and that the most stringent control actions are necessary. An emergency will be declared when any one of the following levels is reached at any monitoring site:


In addition to the levels listed for the above pollutants, meterological conditions are such that pollutant concentrations can be expected to remain at the above levels for twelve (12) or more hours or increase, or in the case of ozone, the situation is likely to reoccur within the next 24-hours unless control actions are taken.


(e) *Termination:* Once declared, any status reached by application of these criteria will remain in effect until the criteria for that level are no longer met. At such time, the next lower status will be assumed.


1.2 *Emission reduction plans.* (a) Air Pollution Alert—When the Director declares an Air Pollution Alert, any person responsible for the operation of a source of air pollutants as set forth in Table I shall take all Air Pollution Alert actions as required for such source of air pollutants and shall put into effect the preplanned abatement strategy for an Air Pollution Alert.


(b) Air Pollution Warning—When the Director declares an Air Pollution Warning, any person responsible for the operation of a source of air pollutants as set forth in Table II shall take all Air Pollution Warning actions as required for such source of air pollutants and shall put into effect the preplanned abatement strategy for an Air Pollution Warning.


(c) Air Pollution Emergency—When the Director declares an Air Pollution Emergency, any person responsible for the operation of a source of air pollutants as described in Table III shall take all Air Pollution Emergency actions as required for such source of air pollutants and shall put into effect the preplanned abatement strategy for an Air Pollution Emergency.


(d) When the Director determines that a specified criteria level has been reached at one or more monitoring sites solely because of emissions from a limited number of sources, he shall notify such source(s) that the preplanned abatement strategies of Tables I, II, and III or the standby plans are required, insofar as it applies to such source(s), and shall be put into effect until the criteria of the specified level are no longer met.


1.3 *Preplanned abatement strategies,* (a) Any person responsible for the operation of a source of air pollutants as set forth in Tables I-III shall prepare standby plans for reducing the emission of air pollutants during periods of an Air Pollution Alert, Air Pollution Warning, and Air Pollution Emergency. Standby plans shall be designed to reduce or eliminate emissions of air pollutants in accordance with the objectives set forth in Tables I-III which are made a part of this section.


(b) Any person responsible for the operation of a source of air pollutants not set forth under section 1.3(a) shall, when requested by the Director in writing, prepare standby plans for reducing the emission of air pollutants during periods of an Air Pollution Alert, Air Pollution Warning, and Air Pollution Emergency. Standby plans shall be designed to reduce or eliminate emissions of air pollutants in accordance with the objectives set forth in Tables I-III.


(c) Standby plans as required under section 1.3(a) and (b) shall be in writing and identify the sources of air pollutants, the approximate amount of reduction of pollutants and a brief description of the manner in which the reduction will be achieved during an Air Pollution Alert, Air Pollution Warning, and Air Pollution Emergency.


(d) During a condition of Air Pollution Alert, Air Pollution Warning, and Air Pollution Emergency, standby plans as required by this section shall be made available on the premises to any person authorized to enforce the provisions of applicable rules and regulations.


(e) Standby plans as required by this section shall be submitted to the Director upon request within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such request; such standby plans shall be subject to review and approval by the Director. If, in the opinion of the Director, a standby plan does not effectively carry out the objectives as set forth in Table I-III, the Director may disapprove it, state his reason for disapproval and order the preparation of an amended standby plan within the time period specified in the order.


1. There shall be no open burning by any persons of tree waste, vegetation, refuse, or debris in any form.


2. The use of incinerators for the disposal of any form of solid waste shall be limited to the hours between 12 noon and 4 p.m.
