# ยง 51.365   Data collection.

Accurate data collection is essential to the management, evaluation, and enforcement of an I/M program. The program shall gather test data on individual vehicles, as well as quality control data on test equipment (with the exception of test procedures for which either no testing equipment is required or those test procedures relying upon a vehicle's OBD system).


(a) *Test data.* The goal of gathering test data is to unambiguously link specific test results to a specific vehicle, I/M program registrant, test site, and inspector, and to determine whether or not the correct testing parameters were observed for the specific vehicle in question. In turn, these data can be used to distinguish complying and noncomplying vehicles as a result of analyzing the data collected and comparing it to the registration database, to screen inspection stations and inspectors for investigation as to possible irregularities, and to help establish the overall effectiveness of the program. At a minimum, the program shall collect the following with respect to each test conducted:


(1) Test record number;


(2) Inspection station and inspector numbers;


(3) Test system number (where applicable); 


(4) Date of the test;


(5) Emission test start time and the time final emission scores are determined;


(6) Vehicle Identification Number;


(7) License plate number;


(8) Test certificate number;


(9) Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR);


(10) Vehicle model year, make, and type;


(11) Number of cylinders or engine displacement;


(12) Transmission type;


(13) Odometer reading;


(14) Category of test performed (*i.e.*, initial test, first retest, or subsequent retest);


(15) Fuel type of the vehicle (*i.e.*, gas, diesel, or other fuel);


(16) Type of vehicle preconditioning performed (if any);


(17) Emission test sequence(s) used;


(18) Hydrocarbon emission scores and standards for each applicable test mode;


(19) Carbon monoxide emission scores and standards for each applicable test mode;


(20) Carbon dioxide emission scores (CO + CO_2_) and standards for each applicable test mode;


(21) Nitrogen oxides emission scores and standards for each applicable test mode;


(22) Results (Pass/Fail/Not Applicable) of the applicable visual inspections for the catalytic converter, air system, gas cap, evaporative system, positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve, fuel inlet restrictor, and any other visual inspection for which emission reduction credit is claimed;


(23) Results of the evaporative system pressure test(s) expressed as a pass or fail; 


(24) Results of the evaporative system purge test expressed as a pass or fail along with the total purge flow in liters achieved during the test (where applicable); and 


(25) Results of the on-board diagnostic check expressed as a pass or fail along with the diagnostic trouble codes revealed (where applicable). 


(b) *Quality control data.* At a minimum, the program shall gather and report the results of the quality control checks required under ยง 51.359 of this subpart, identifying each check by station number, system number, date, and start time. The data report shall also contain the concentration values of the calibration gases used to perform the gas characterization portion of the quality control checks (where applicable).
