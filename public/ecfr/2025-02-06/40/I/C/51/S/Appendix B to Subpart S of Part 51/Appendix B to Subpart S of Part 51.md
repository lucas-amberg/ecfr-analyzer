# Appendix B to Subpart S of Part 51—Test Procedures


(a) *General requirements*—(1) *Exhaust gas sampling algorithm.* The analysis of exhaust gas concentrations shall begin 10 seconds after the applicable test mode begins. Exhaust gas concentrations shall be analyzed at a minimum rate of two times per second. The measured value for pass/fail determinations shall be a simple running average of the measurements taken over five seconds.


(2) *Pass/fail determination.* A pass or fail determination shall be made for each applicable test mode based on a comparison of the short test standards contained in appendix C to this subpart, and the measured value for HC and CO as described in paragraph (I)(a)(1) of this appendix. A vehicle shall pass the test mode if any pair of simultaneous measured values for HC and CO are below or equal to the applicable short test standards. A vehicle shall fail the test mode if the values for either HC or CO, or both, in all simultaneous pairs of values are above the applicable standards.


(3) *Void test conditions.* The test shall immediately end and any exhaust gas measurements shall be voided if the measured concentration of CO plus CO_2_ falls below six percent or the vehicle's engine stalls at any time during the test sequence.


(4) *Multiple exhaust pipes.* Exhaust gas concentrations from vehicle engines equipped with multiple exhaust pipes shall be sampled simultaneously.


(5) This test shall be immediately terminated upon reaching the overall maximum test time.


(b) *Test sequence.* (1) The test sequence shall consist of a first-chance test and a second-chance test as follows:


(i) The first-chance test, as described under paragraph (c) of this section, shall consist of an idle mode.


(ii) The second-chance test as described under paragraph (I)(d) of this appendix shall be performed only if the vehicle fails the first-chance test.


(2) The test sequence shall begin only after the following requirements are met:


(i) The vehicle shall be tested in as-received condition with the transmission in neutral or park and all accessories turned off. The engine shall be at normal operating temperature (as indicated by a temperature gauge, temperature lamp, touch test on the radiator hose, or other visual observation for overheating).


(ii) For all pre-1996 model year vehicles, a tachometer shall be attached to the vehicle in accordance with the analyzer manufacturer's instructions. For 1996 and newer model year vehicles the OBD data link connector will be used to monitor RPM. In the event that an OBD data link connector is not available or that an RPM signal is not available over the data link connector, a tachometer shall be used instead.


(iii) The sample probe shall be inserted into the vehicle's tailpipe to a minimum depth of 10 inches. If the vehicle's exhaust system prevents insertion to this depth, a tailpipe extension shall be used.


(iv) The measured concentration of CO plus CO_2_ shall be greater than or equal to six percent.


(c) *First-chance test.* The test timer shall start (tt = 0) when the conditions specified in paragraph (I)(b)(2) of this appendix are met. The first-chance test shall have an overall maximum test time of 145 seconds (tt = 145). The first-chance test shall consist of an idle mode only.


(1) The mode timer shall start (mt = 0) when the vehicle engine speed is between 350 and 1100 rpm. If engine speed exceeds 1100 rpm or falls below 350 rpm, the mode timer shall reset zero and resume timing. The minimum mode length shall be determined as described under paragraph (I)(c)(2) of this appendix. The maximum mode length shall be 90 seconds elapsed time (mt = 90).

(iii) The vehicle shall pass the idle mode and the test shall be immediately terminated if, at any point between an elapsed time of 30 seconds (mt = 30) and 90 seconds (mt = 90), the measured values are less than or equal to the applicable short test standards as described in paragraph (I)(a)(2) of this appendix.


(iv) The vehicle shall fail the idle mode and the test shall be terminated if none of the provisions of paragraphs (I)(c)(2)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this appendix is satisfied by an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt = 90).
