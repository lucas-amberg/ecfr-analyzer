# § 52.21   Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.

(a)(1) *Plan disapproval.* The provisions of this section are applicable to any State implementation plan which has been disapproved with respect to prevention of significant deterioration of air quality in any portion of any State where the existing air quality is better than the national ambient air quality standards. Specific disapprovals are listed where applicable, in subparts B through DDD and FFF of this part. The provisions of this section have been incorporated by reference into the applicable implementation plans for various States, as provided in subparts B through DDD and FFF of this part. Where this section is so incorporated, the provisions shall also be applicable to all lands owned by the Federal Government and Indian Reservations located in such State. No disapproval with respect to a State's failure to prevent significant deterioration of air quality shall invalidate or otherwise affect the obligations of States, emission sources, or other persons with respect to all portions of plans approved or promulgated under this part.


(2) *Applicability procedures.* (i) The requirements of this section apply to the construction of any new major stationary source (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) or any project at an existing major stationary source in an area designated as attainment or unclassifiable under sections 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act. 


(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as this section otherwise provides. 


(iii) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r)(5) of this section apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Administrator has authority to issue any such permit. 


(iv) The requirements of the program will be applied in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(*a*) through (*f*) of this section. 


(A) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, and consistent with the definition of major modification contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a project is a major modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases—a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (b)(40) section) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (b)(3) and (23) of this section). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase. 


(B) The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant emissions increase (i.e., the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(*c*) through (*f*) of this section. The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (i.e., the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase.


(C) *Actual-to-projected-actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units.* A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(41) of this section) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (b)(48)(i) and (ii) of this section), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section). 


(D) *Actual-to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new emissions unit(s).* A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(48)(iii) of this section) of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section). 


(E) [Reserved] 


(F) *Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units.* A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference for all emissions units, using the method specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(*c*) and (*d*) of this section as applicable with respect to each emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section).


(G) The “sum of the difference” as used in paragraphs (*c*), (*d*) and (*f*) of this section shall include both increases and decreases in emissions calculated in accordance with those paragraphs. 


(v) For any major stationary source for a PAL for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with the requirements under paragraph (aa) of this section.

(*2*) Other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards during the project and after it is terminated. 


(J) The installation or operation of a permanent clean coal technology demonstration project that constitutes repowering, provided that the project does not result in an increase in the potential to emit of any regulated pollutant emitted by the unit. This exemption shall apply on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis. 


(K) The reactivation of a very clean coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit. 


(iv) This definition shall not apply with respect to a particular regulated NSR pollutant when the major stationary source is complying with the requirements under paragraph (aa) of this section for a PAL for that pollutant. Instead, the definition at paragraph (aa)(2)(viii) of this section shall apply. 


(v) Fugitive emissions shall not be included in determining for any of the purposes of this section whether a physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source is a major modification, unless the source belongs to one of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.


(3)(i) *Net emissions increase* means, with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted by a major stationary source, the amount by which the sum of the following exceeds zero: 


(A) The increase in emissions from a particular physical change or change in the method of operation at a stationary source as calculated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section; and 


(B) Any other increases and decreases in actual emissions at the major stationary source that are contemporaneous with the particular change and are otherwise creditable. Baseline actual emissions for calculating increases and decreases under this paragraph (b)(3)(i)(*b*) shall be determined as provided in paragraph (b)(48) of this section, except that paragraphs (b)(48)(i)(*c*) and (b)(48)(ii)(*d*) of this section shall not apply. 


(ii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is contemporaneous with the increase from the particular change only if it occurs between:


(A) The date five years before construction on the particular change commences; and


(B) The date that the increase from the particular change occurs.


(iii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is creditable only if: 


(A) The Administrator or other reviewing authority has not relied on it in issuing a permit for the source under this section, which permit is in effect when the increase in actual emissions from the particular change occurs; and 


(B) [Reserved]


(C) As it pertains to an increase or decrease in fugitive emissions (to the extent quantifiable), it occurs at an emissions unit that is part of one of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section or it occurs at an emission unit that is located at a major stationary source that belongs to one of the listed source categories.


(iv) An increase or decrease in actual emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, or nitrogen oxides that occurs before the applicable minor source baseline date is creditable only if it is required to be considered in calculating the amount of maximum allowable increases remaining available. 


(v) An increase in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent that the new level of actual emissions exceeds the old level.


(vi) A decrease in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent that:


(A) The old level of actual emissions or the old level of allowable emissions, whichever is lower, exceeds the new level of actual emissions;


(B) It is enforceable as a practical matter at and after the time that actual construction on the particular change begins. 


(C) It has approximately the same qualitative significance for public health and welfare as that attributed to the increase from the particular change. 


(vii) [Reserved]


(viii) An increase that results from a physical change at a source occurs when the emissions unit on which construction occurred becomes operational and begins to emit a particular pollutant. Any replacement unit that requires shakedown becomes operational only after a reasonable shakedown period, not to exceed 180 days.


(ix) Paragraph (b)(21)(ii) of this section shall not apply for determining creditable increases and decreases. 


(4) *Potential to emit* means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally enforceable. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the potential to emit of a stationary source.


(5) *Stationary source* means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit a regulated NSR pollutant.


(6)(i) *Building, structure, facility, or installation* means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant-emitting activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same “Major Group” (*i.e.,* which have the same first two digit code) as described in the *Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972,* as amended by the 1977 Supplement (U.S. Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101-0066 and 003-005-00716-0, respectively).


(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, *building, structure, facility, or installation* means, for onshore activities under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Major Group 13: Oil and Gas Extraction, all of the pollutant-emitting activities included in Major Group 13 that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Pollutant emitting activities shall be considered adjacent if they are located on the same surface site; or if they are located on surface sites that are located within 
1/4 mile of one another (measured from the center of the equipment on the surface site) and they share equipment. Shared equipment includes, but is not limited to, produced fluids storage tanks, phase separators, natural gas dehydrators or emissions control devices. Surface site, as used in this paragraph (b)(6)(ii), has the same meaning as in 40 CFR 63.761.


(7) *Emissions unit* means any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the potential to emit any regulated NSR pollutant and includes an electric utility steam generating unit as defined in paragraph (b)(31) of this section. For purposes of this section, there are two types of emissions units as described in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section. 


(i) A new emissions unit is any emissions unit that is (or will be) newly constructed and that has existed for less than 2 years from the date such emissions unit first operated. 


(ii) An existing emissions unit is any emissions unit that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. A replacement unit, as defined in paragraph (b)(33) of this section, is an existing emissions unit. 


(8) *Construction* means any physical change or change in the method of operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, or modification of an emissions unit) that would result in a change in emissions. 


(9) *Commence* as applied to construction of a major stationary source or major modification means that the owner or operator has all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits and either has:


(i) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-site construction of the source, to be completed within a reasonable time; or


(ii) Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the source to be completed within a reasonable time.


(10) *Necessary preconstruction approvals or permits* means those permits or approvals required under Federal air quality control laws and regulations and those air quality control laws and regulations which are part of the applicable State Implementation Plan.


(11) *Begin actual construction* means, in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change.


(12) *Best available control technology* means an emissions limitation (including a visible emission standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR part 60, 61, or 63. If the Administrator determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of best available control technology. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.


(13)(i) *Baseline concentration* means that ambient concentration level that exists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable minor source baseline date. A baseline concentration is determined for each pollutant for which a minor source baseline date is established and shall include: 


(A) The actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(21) of this section, representative of sources in existence on the applicable minor source baseline date, except as provided in paragraph (b)(13)(ii) of this section; and 


(B) The allowable emissions of major stationary sources that commenced construction before the major source baseline date, but were not in operation by the applicable minor source baseline date. 


(ii) The following will not be included in the baseline concentration and will affect the applicable maximum allowable increase(s): 


(A) Actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(21) of this section, from any major stationary source on which construction commenced after the major source baseline date; and 


(B) Actual emissions increases and decreases, as defined in paragraph (b)(21) of this section, at any stationary source occurring after the minor source baseline date. 


(14)(i) *Major source baseline date* means:

(B) In the case of a major stationary source, the pollutant would be emitted in significant amounts, or, in the case of a major modification, there would be a significant net emissions increase of the pollutant.


(iv) Any minor source baseline date established originally for the TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of available PM-10 increments, except that the Administrator shall rescind a minor source baseline date where it can be shown, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the emissions increase from the major stationary source, or net emissions increase from the major modification, responsible for triggering that date did not result in a significant amount of PM-10 emissions. 


(15)(i) *Baseline area* means any intrastate area (and every part thereof) designated as attainment or unclassifiable under section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act in which the major source or major modification establishing the minor source baseline date would construct or would have an air quality impact for the pollutant for which the baseline date is established, as follows: equal to or greater than 1 µg/m
3 (annual average) for SO_2_, NO_2_, or PM_10_; or equal or greater than 0.3 µg/m
3 (annual average) for PM_2.5_.


(ii) Area redesignations under section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act cannot intersect or be smaller than the area of impact of any major stationary source or major modification which:


(A) Establishes a minor source baseline date; or


(B) Is subject to 40 CFR 52.21 and would be constructed in the same state as the state proposing the redesignation.


(iii) Any baseline area established originally for the TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of available PM-10 increments, except that such baseline area shall not remain in effect if the Administrator rescinds the corresponding minor source baseline date in accordance with paragraph (b)(14)(iv) of this section.


(16) *Allowable emissions* means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following:

(18) *Secondary emissions* means emissions which would occur as a result of the construction or operation of a major stationary source or major modification, but do not come from the major stationary source or major modification itself. Secondary emissions include emissions from any offsite support facility which would not be constructed or increase its emissions except as a result of the construction or operation of the major stationary source or major modification. Secondary emissions do not include any emissions which come directly from a mobile source, such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor vehicle, from a train, or from a vessel.

(20) *Fugitive emissions* means those emissions which could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening.


(21)(i) *Actual emissions* means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(21)(ii) through (iv) of this section, except that this definition shall not apply for calculating whether a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraph (aa) of this section. Instead, paragraphs (b)(41) and (b)(48) of this section shall apply for those purposes. 


(ii) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive 24-month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Administrator shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period. 


(iii) The Administrator may presume that source-specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. 


(iv) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. 


(22) *Complete* means, in reference to an application for a permit, that the application contains all of the information necessary for processing the application.

(29) *Adverse impact on visibility* means visibility impairment which interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of the visitor's visual experience of the Federal Class I area. This determination must be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of visibility impairment, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of visitor use of the Federal Class I area, and (2) the frequency and timing of natural conditions that reduce visibility.


(30) *Volatile organic compounds (VOC)* is as defined in § 51.100(s) of this chapter.


(31) *Electric utility steam generating unit* means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale.

(i) The emissions unit is a reconstructed unit within the meaning of § 60.15(b)(1) of this chapter, or the emissions unit completely takes the place of an existing emissions unit;


(ii) The emissions unit is identical to or functionally equivalent to the replaced emissions unit;


(iii) The replacement does not alter the basic design parameters of the process unit; and


(iv) The replaced emissions unit is permanently removed from the major stationary source, otherwise permanently disabled, or permanently barred from operation by a permit that is enforceable as a practical matter. If the replaced emissions unit is brought back into operation, it shall constitute a new emissions unit. 


(34) *Clean coal technology* means any technology, including technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or post combustion stage, at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity, or process steam which was not in widespread use as of November 15, 1990. 


(35) *Clean coal technology demonstration project* means a project using funds appropriated under the heading “Department of Energy-Clean Coal Technology”, up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstration of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency.

(39) *Pollution prevention* means any activity that through process changes, product reformulation or redesign, or substitution of less polluting raw materials, eliminates or reduces the release of air pollutants (including fugitive emissions) and other pollutants to the environment prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; it does not mean recycling (other than certain “in-process recycling” practices), energy recovery, treatment, or disposal. 


(40) *Significant emissions increase* means, for a regulated NSR pollutant, an increase in emissions that is significant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section) for that pollutant. 


(41)(i) *Projected actual emissions* means the maximum annual rate, in tons per year, at which an existing emissions unit is projected to emit a regulated NSR pollutant in any one of the 5 years (12-month period) following the date the unit resumes regular operation after the project, or in any one of the 10 years following that date, if the project involves increasing the emissions unit's design capacity or its potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant and full utilization of the unit would result in a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase at the major stationary source. 


(ii) In determining the projected actual emissions under paragraph (b)(41)(i) of this section (before beginning actual construction), the owner or operator of the major stationary source: 


(A) Shall consider all relevant information, including but not limited to, historical operational data, the company's own representations, the company's expected business activity and the company's highest projections of business activity, the company's filings with the State or Federal regulatory authorities, and compliance plans under the approved State Implementation Plan; and

(45) *Predictive emissions monitoring system (PEMS)* means all of the equipment necessary to monitor process and control device operational parameters (for example, control device secondary voltages and electric currents) and other information (for example, gas flow rate, O_2_ or CO_2_ concentrations), and calculate and record the mass emissions rate (for example, lb/hr) on a continuous basis. 


(46) *Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS)* means all of the equipment necessary to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this section, to monitor process and control device operational parameters (for example, control device secondary voltages and electric currents) and other information (for example, gas flow rate, O_2_ or CO_2_ concentrations), and to record average operational parameter value(s) on a continuous basis.

(48) *Baseline actual emissions* means the rate of emissions, in tons per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(48)(i) through (iv) of this section. 


(i) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The Administrator shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation.

(B) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive 24-month period. 


(C) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive 24-month period can be used for each regulated pollutant. 


(D) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive 24-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (b)(48)(i)(*b*) of this section.

(C) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the major stationary source must currently comply, had such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive 24-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology standard that the Administrator proposed or promulgated under part 63 of this chapter, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the State has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent with the requirements of § 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(G) of this chapter. 


(D) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive 24-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. 


(E) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive 24-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (b)(48)(ii)(*b*) and (*c*) of this section. 


(iii) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial construction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to emit.

(49) *Subject to regulation* means, for any air pollutant, that the pollutant is subject to either a provision in the Clean Air Act, or a nationally-applicable regulation codified by the Administrator in subchapter C of this chapter, that requires actual control of the quantity of emissions of that pollutant, and that such a control requirement has taken effect and is operative to control, limit or restrict the quantity of emissions of that pollutant released from the regulated activity. Except that:


(i) *Greenhouse gases (GHGs),* the air pollutant defined in § 86.1818-12(a) of this chapter as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, shall not be subject to regulation except as provided in paragraph (b)(49)(iv) of this section and shall not be subject to regulation if the stationary source maintains its total source-wide emissions below the GHG PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section, and complies with the PAL permit containing the GHG PAL.

For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO_2_e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO_2_e instead of applying the value in paragraph (b)(23)(ii) of this section.


(iv) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:


(A) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO_2_e or more; or


(B) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO_2_e or more.

On or after January 1, 2011, such condensable particulate matter shall be accounted for in applicability determinations and in establishing emissions limitations for PM_2.5_ and PM_10_ in PSD permits. Compliance with emissions limitations for PM_2.5_ and PM_10_ issued prior to this date shall not be based on condensable particulate matter unless required by the terms and conditions of the permit or the applicable implementation plan. Applicability determinations made prior to this date without accounting for condensable particulate matter shall not be considered in violation of this section unless the applicable implementation plan required condensable particulate matter to be included.


(B) Any pollutant identified under this paragraph (b)(50)(i)(*b*) as a constituent or precursor for a pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard has been promulgated. Precursors identified by the Administrator for purposes of NSR are the following:


(*1*) Volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are precursors to ozone in all attainment and unclassifiable areas.


(*2*) Sulfur dioxide is a precursor to PM_2.5_ in all attainment and unclassifiable areas.

(i) The air quality impact of the source or modification, including meteorological and topographical data necessary to estimate such impact; and


(ii) The air quality impacts, and the nature and extent of any or all general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth which has occurred since August 7, 1977, in the area the source or modification would affect.


(o) *Additional impact analyses.* (1) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the impairment to visibility, soils and vegetation that would occur as a result of the source or modification and general commercial, residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or modification. The owner or operator need not provide an analysis of the impact on vegetation having no significant commercial or recreational value.


(2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air quality impact projected for the area as a result of general commercial, residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or modification.


(3) *Visibility monitoring.* The Administrator may require monitoring of visibility in any Federal class I area near the proposed new stationary source for major modification for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.


(p) *Sources impacting Federal Class I areas—additional requirements*—(1) *Notice to Federal land managers.* The Administrator shall provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal land manager and the Federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in the Federal Class I area. The Administrator shall also provide the Federal land manager and such Federal officials with a copy of the preliminary determination required under paragraph (q) of this section, and shall make available to them any materials used in making that determination, promptly after the Administrator makes such determination. Finally, the Administrator shall also notify all affected Federal land managers within 30 days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application.


(2) *Federal Land Manager.* The Federal Land Manager and the Federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of such lands have an affirmative responsibility to protect the air quality related values (including visibility) of such lands and to consider, in consultation with the Administrator, whether a proposed source or modification will have an adverse impact on such values.


(3) *Visibility analysis.* The Administrator shall consider any analysis performed by the Federal land manager, provided within 30 days of the notification required by paragraph (p)(1) of this section, that shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area. Where the Administrator finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an adverse impact on visibility will result in the Federal Class I area, the Administrator must, in the notice of public hearing on the permit application, either explain his decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained.


(4) *Denial—impact on air quality related values.* The Federal Land Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Administrator that the emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse impact on the air quality-related values (including visibility) of those lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would not cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Administrator concurs with such demonstration, then he shall not issue the permit.


(5) *Class I variances.* The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification may demonstrate to the Federal Land Manager that the emissions from such source or modification would have no adverse impact on the air quality related values of any such lands (including visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Federal Land Manager concurs with such demonstration and he so certifies, the State may authorize the Administrator, provided that the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise met, to issue the permit with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide, PM_2.5,_ PM_10_, and nitrogen oxides would not exceed the following maximum allowable increases over minor source baseline concentration for such pollutants:


(6) *Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's concurrence.* The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification which cannot be approved under paragraph (p)(5) of this section may demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period of 24 hours or less applicable to any Class I area and, in the case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this clause would not adversely affect the air quality related values of the area (including visibility). The Governor, after consideration of the Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and subject to his concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the Administrator shall issue a permit to such source or modification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (p)(8) of this section provided that the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise met.


(7) *Variance by the Governor with the President's concurrence.* In any case where the Governor recommends a variance with which the Federal Land Manager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and the Federal Land Manager shall be transmitted to the President. The President may approve the Governor's recommendation if he finds that the variance is in the national interest. If the variance is approved, the Administrator shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (p)(8) of this section provided that the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise met.


(8) *Emission limitations for Presidential or gubernatorial variance.* In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (p)(6) or (7) of this section, the source or modification shall comply with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide from the source or modification would not (during any day on which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to assure that such emissions would not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases for periods of exposure of 24 hours or less for more than 18 days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period:


(q) *Public participation.* The administrator shall follow the applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications under this section.


(r) *Source obligation.* (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action.


(2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Administrator may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within 18 months of the projected and approved commencement date.


(3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State implementation plan and any other requirements under local, State, or Federal law.


(4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (s) of this section shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification.


(5) [Reserved] 


(6) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(*b*) of this section, the provisions of this paragraph (r)(6) apply with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at existing emissions units at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility, within the meaning of paragraph (r)(6)(vi) of this section, that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase of such pollutant, and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragraphs (b)(41)(ii)(*a*) through (*c*) of this section for calculating projected actual emissions.


(i) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: 


(A) A description of the project; 


(B) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and 


(C) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(*c*) of this section and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. 


(ii) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(i) of this section to the Administrator. Nothing in this paragraph (r)(6)(ii) shall be construed to require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the Administrator before beginning actual construction. 


(iii) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project and that is emitted by any emissions unit identified in paragraph (r)(6)(i)(*b*) of this section; and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of 5 years following resumption of regular operations after the change, or for a period of 10 years following resumption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity or potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit.


(iv) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Administrator within 60 days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (r)(6)(iii) of this section setting out the unit's annual emissions during the calendar year that preceded submission of the report.


(v) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Administrator if the annual emissions, in tons per year, from the project identified in paragraph (r)(6)(i) of this section, exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(i)(*c*) of this section), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section) for that regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(i)(*c*) of this section. Such report shall be submitted to the Administrator within 60 days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following: 


(A) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; 


(B) The annual emissions as calculated pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(iii) of this section; and 


(C) Any other information that the owner or operator wishes to include in the report (e.g., an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). 


(vi) A “reasonable possibility” under paragraph (r)(6) of this section occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either:


(A) A projected actual emissions increase of at least 50 percent of the amount that is a “significant emissions increase,” as defined under paragraph (b)(40) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or


(B) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(*c*) of this section, sums to at least 50 percent of the amount that is a “significant emissions increase,” as defined under paragraph (b)(40) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(*b*) of this section, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(*a*) of this section, then provisions (r)(6)(ii) through (v) do not apply to the project.


(7) The owner or operator of the source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6) of this section available for review upon a request for inspection by the Administrator or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in § 70.4(b)(3)(viii) of this chapter. 


(s) *Environmental impact statements.* Whenever any proposed source or modification is subject to action by a Federal Agency which might necessitate preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321), review by the Administrator conducted pursuant to this section shall be coordinated with the broad environmental reviews under that Act and under section 309 of the Clean Air Act to the maximum extent feasible and reasonable.


(t) *Disputed permits or redesignations.* If any State affected by the redesignation of an area by an Indian Governing Body, or any Indian Governing Body of a tribe affected by the redesignation of an area by a State, disagrees with such redesignation, or if a permit is proposed to be issued for any major stationary source or major modification proposed for construction in any State which the Governor of an affected State or Indian Governing Body of an affected tribe determines will cause or contribute to a cumulative change in air quality in excess of that allowed in this part within the affected State or Indian Reservation, the Governor or Indian Governing Body may request the Administrator to enter into negotiations with the parties involved to resolve such dispute. If requested by any State or Indian Governing Body involved, the Administrator shall make a recommendation to resolve the dispute and protect the air quality related values of the lands involved. If the parties involved do not reach agreement, the Administrator shall resolve the dispute and his determination, or the results of agreements reached through other means, shall become part of the applicable State implementation plan and shall be enforceable as part of such plan. In resolving such disputes relating to area redesignation, the Administrator shall consider the extent to which the lands involved are of sufficient size to allow effective air quality management or have air quality related values of such an area.


(u) *Delegation of authority.* (1) The Administrator shall have the authority to delegate his responsibility for conducting source review pursuant to this section, in accordance with paragraph (u)(2) of this section.


(2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for conducting source review under this section to any agency other than a Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the following provisions shall apply:


(i) Where the delegate agency is not an air pollution control agency, it shall consult with the appropriate state, tribe, and local air pollution control agency prior to making any determination under this section. Similarly, where the delegate agency does not have continuing responsibility for managing land use, it shall consult with the appropriate state, tribe, and local agency primarily responsible for managing land use prior to making any determination under this section.


(ii) The delegate agency shall send a copy of any public comment notice required under paragraph (q) of this section to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office.


(3) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to construct in a Class III area, emissions from which would cause or contribute to air quality exceeding the maximum allowable increase applicable if the area were designated a Class II area, and where no standard under section 111 of the Act has been promulgated for such source category, the Administrator must approve the determination of best available control technology as set forth in the permit.


(v) *Innovative control technology.* (1) An owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the Administrator in writing no later than the close of the comment period under 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control technology.


(2) The Administrator shall, with the consent of the governor(s) of the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may employ a system of innovative control technology, if:


(i) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function;


(ii) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous emissions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, by a date specified by the Administrator. Such date shall not be later than 4 years from the time of startup or 7 years from permit issuance;


(iii) The source or modification would meet the requirements of paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section, based on the emissions rate that the stationary source employing the system of innovative control technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the Administrator;


(iv) The source or modification would not before the date specified by the Administrator:


(A) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable national ambient air quality standard; or


(B) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and


(v) All other applicable requirements including those for public participation have been met.


(vi) The provisions of paragraph (p) of this section (relating to Class I areas) have been satisfied with respect to all periods during the life of the source or modification.


(3) The Administrator shall withdraw any approval to employ a system of innovative control technology made under this section, if:


(i) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the required continuous emissions reduction rate; or


(ii) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; or


(iii) The Administrator decides at any time that the proposed system is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the public health, welfare, or safety.


(4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the approval is withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (v)(3) of this section, the Administrator may allow the source or modification up to an additional 3 years to meet the requirement for the application of best available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of control.


(w) *Permit rescission.* (1) Any permit issued under this section or a prior version of this section shall remain in effect, unless and until it expires under paragraph (r)(2) of this section or is rescinded under this paragraph (w).


(2) An owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who holds a permit issued under this section for the construction of a new source or modification that meets the requirement in paragraph (w)(3) of this section may request that the Administrator rescind the permit or a particular portion of the permit.


(3) The Administrator may grant an application for rescission if the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or modification.


(4) If the Administrator rescinds a permit under this paragraph, the Administrator shall post a notice of the rescission determination on a public Web site identified by the Administrator within 60 days of the rescission.


(x)-(z) [Reserved] 


(aa) *Actuals PALs.* The provisions in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section govern actuals PALs. 


(1) *Applicability.* (i) The Administrator may approve the use of an actuals PAL, including for GHGs on either a mass basis or a CO_2_e basis, for any existing major stationary source or any existing GHG-only source if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section. The term “PAL” shall mean “actuals PAL” throughout paragraph (aa) of this section.


(ii) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source or a GHG-only source that maintains its total source-wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section, and complies with the PAL permit:


(A) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; 


(B) Does not have to be approved through the PSD program;


(C) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (r)(4) of this section (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source used to avoid applicability of the major NSR program); and


(D) Does not make GHGs subject to regulation as defined by paragraph (b)(49) of this section.


(iii) Except as provided under paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(*c*) of this section, a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall continue to comply with all applicable Federal or State requirements, emission limitations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL.


(2) *Definitions.* For the purposes of this section, the definitions in paragraphs (aa)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section apply. When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in paragraph (b) of this section or in the Act. 


(i) *Actuals PAL* for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(48) of this section) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. For a GHG-only source, *actuals PAL* means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiii) of this section) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiv) of this section) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit GHGs. 


(ii) *Allowable emissions* means “allowable emissions” as defined in paragraph (b)(16) of this section, except as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (aa)(2)(ii)(*a*) and (*b*) of this section. 


(A) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit. 


(B) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determined using the definition in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, except that the words “or enforceable as a practical matter” should be added after “federally enforceable.” 


(iii) *Small emissions unit* means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section or in the Act, whichever is lower. For a GHG PAL issued on a CO_2_e basis, *small emissions unit* means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit less than the amount of GHGs on a CO_2_e basis defined as “significant” for the purposes of paragraph (b)(49)(iii) of this section at the time the PAL permit is being issued. 


(iv) *Major emissions unit* means: 


(A) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or


(B) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Act for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance with the definition of major stationary source in section 182(c) of the Act, an emissions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit 50 or more tons of VOC per year. 


(C) For a GHG PAL issued on a CO_2_e basis, any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit equal to or greater than the amount of GHGs on a CO_2_e basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements under paragraph (b)(49) of this section at the time the PAL permit is being issued.


(v) *Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL)* means an emission limitation expressed on a mass basis in tons per year, or expressed in tons per year CO_2_e for a CO_2_e-based GHG emission limitation, for a pollutant at a major stationary source or GHG-only source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source-wide in accordance with paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section. 


(vi) *PAL effective date* generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. 


(vii) *PAL effective period* means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending 10 years later. 


(viii) *PAL major modification* means, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(49) of this section (the definitions for major modification, net emissions increase, and subject to regulation), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL.


(ix) *PAL permit* means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the State operating permit under a program that is approved into the State Implementation Plan, or the title V permit issued by the Administrator that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source or a GHG-only source.


(x) *PAL pollutant* means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source or a GHG-only source. For a GHG-only source, the only available PAL pollutant is greenhouse gases.


(xi) *Significant emissions unit* means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section or in the Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv) of this section. For a GHG PAL issued on a CO_2_e basis, *significant emissions unit* means any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit GHGs on a CO_2_e basis in amounts equal to or greater than the amount that would qualify the unit as small emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iii) of this section, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv)(*c*) of this section.


(xii) *GHG-only source* means any existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit GHGs in the amount equal to or greater than the amount of GHGs on a mass basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements for GHGs under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the amount of GHGs on a CO_2_e basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements for GHGs under paragraph (b)(49) of this section at the time the PAL permit is being issued, but does not emit or have the potential to emit any other non-GHG regulated NSR pollutant at or above the applicable major source threshold. A GHG-only source may only obtain a PAL for GHG emissions under paragraph (aa) of this section.


(xiii) *Baseline actual emissions* for a GHG PAL means the average rate, in tons per year CO_2_e or tons per year GHG, as applicable, at which the emissions unit actually emitted GHGs during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 10-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Administrator for a permit required under this section or by the permitting authority for a permit required by a plan, whichever is earlier. For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, *baseline actual emissions* for a GHG PAL means the average rate, in tons per year CO_2_e or tons per year GHG, as applicable, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the GHGs during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, except that the Administrator shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation.


(A) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.


(B) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive 24-month period.


(C) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the stationary source must currently comply, had such stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive 24-month period.


(D) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive 24-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual GHG emissions and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (aa)(2)(xiii)(*b*) and (*c*) of this section.


(xiv) *Emissions unit* with respect to GHGs means any part of a stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit GHGs. For purposes of this section, there are two types of emissions units as described in the following:


(A) A new emissions unit is any emissions unit that is (or will be) newly constructed and that has existed for less than 2 years from the date such emissions unit first operated.


(B) An existing emissions unit is any emissions unit that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiv)(*a*) of this section.


(xv) *Minor source* means any stationary source that does not meet the definition of major stationary source in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any pollutant at the time the PAL is issued.


(3) *Permit application requirements.* As part of a permit application requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall submit the following information to the Administrator for approval: 


(i) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, significant or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, Federal or State applicable requirements, emission limitations, or work practices apply to each unit. 


(ii) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and malfunction. 


(iii) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a 12-month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this section. 


(iv) As part of a permit application requesting a GHG PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall submit a statement by the source owner or operator that clarifies whether the source is an existing major source as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*a*) and (*b*) of this section or a GHG-only source as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xii) of this section.


(4) *General requirements for establishing PALs.* (i) The Administrator is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source or a GHG-only source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(4)(i)(*a*) through (*g*) of this section are met.


(A) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation expressed on a mass basis in tons per year, or expressed in tons per year CO_2_e, that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source or GHG-only source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first 12 months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous 12 consecutive months is less than the PAL (a 12-month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first 11 months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL.


(B) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (aa)(5) of this section. 


(C) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (aa)(7) of this section. 


(D) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source or GHG-only source.


(E) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. 


(F) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of 10 years. 


(G) The owner or operator of the major stationary source or GHG-only source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (aa)(12) through (14) of this section for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. 


(ii) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant that occur during the PAL effective period creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under § 51.165(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. 


(5) *Public participation requirements for PALs.* PALs for existing major stationary sources or GHG-only sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with §§ 51.160 and 51.161 of this chapter. This includes the requirement that the Administrator provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a 30-day period for submittal of public comment. The Administrator must address all material comments before taking final action on the permit. 


(6) *Setting the 10-year actuals PAL level.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (aa)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the plan shall provide that the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(48) of this section or, for GHGs, paragraph (aa)(2)(xiii) of this section) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (b)(23) of this section or under the Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive 24-month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this 24-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The reviewing authority shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tons/yr) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable Federal or State regulatory requirement(s) that the reviewing authority is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of 60 ppm NO_X_ to a new rule limit of 30 ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). 


(ii) For newly constructed units (which do not include modifications to existing units) on which actual construction began after the 24-month period, in lieu of adding the baseline actual emissions as specified in paragraph (aa)(6)(i) of this section, the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units.


(iii) For CO_2_e based GHG PAL, the actuals PAL level shall be established as the sum of the GHGs baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiii) of this section) of GHGs for each emissions unit at the source, plus an amount equal to the amount defined as “significant” on a CO_2_e basis for the purposes of paragraph (b)(49)(iii) at the time the PAL permit is being issued. When establishing the actuals PAL level for a CO_2_e-based PAL, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this 24-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The reviewing authority shall specify a reduced PAL level (in tons per year CO_2_e) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable Federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the reviewing authority is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit.


(7) *Contents of the PAL permit.* The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (aa)(7)(i) through (xi) of this section.


(i) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source-wide emission limitation in tons per year or tons per year CO_2_e.


(ii) The PAL permit effective date and the expiration date of the PAL (PAL effective period). 


(iii) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source or a GHG-only source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (aa)(10) of this section before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effective period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by a reviewing authority. 


(iv) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purposes must include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. 


(v) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source or GHG-only source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (aa)(9) of this section.


(vi) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a 12-month rolling total as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this section.


(vii) A requirement that the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (aa)(12) of this section. 


(viii) A requirement to retain the records required under paragraph (aa)(13) of this section on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format. 


(ix) A requirement to submit the reports required under paragraph (aa)(14) of this section by the required deadlines. 


(x) Any other requirements that the Administrator deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL. 


(xi) A permit for a GHG PAL issued to a GHG-only source shall also include a statement denoting that GHG emissions at the source will not be subject to regulation under paragraph (b)(49) of this section as long as the source complies with the PAL.


(8) *PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit.* The requirements in paragraphs (aa)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to actuals PALs. 


(i) *PAL effective period.* The Administrator shall specify a PAL effective period of 10 years. 


(ii) *Reopening of the PAL permit.* (A) During the PAL effective period, the Administrator must reopen the PAL permit to: 


(*1*) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL; 


(*2*) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under § 51.165(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter; and 


(*3*) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (aa)(11) of this section. 


(B) The Administrator shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: 


(*1*) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable Federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date; 


(*2*) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the State may impose on the major stationary source or GHG-only source under the State Implementation Plan; and 


(*3*) Reduce the PAL if the reviewing authority determines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Federal Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. 


(C) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (aa)(8)(ii)(*a*)(*1*) of this section for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (aa)(5) of this section. 


(9) *Expiration of a PAL.* Any PAL that is not renewed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (aa)(10) of this section shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i) through (v) of this section shall apply. 


(i) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i)(*a*) and (*b*) of this section. 


(A) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (aa)(10)(ii) of this section, the major stationary source or GHG-only source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the Administrator) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source or GHG-only source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (aa)(10)(v) of this section, such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted.


(B) The Administrator shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Administrator determines is appropriate.


(ii) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a 12-month rolling basis. The Administrator may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than CEMS, CERMS, PEMS, or CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. 


(iii) Until the Administrator issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (aa)(9)(i)(*b*) of this section, the source shall continue to comply with a source-wide, multi-unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. 


(iv) Any physical change or change in the method of operation at the major stationary source or GHG-only source will be subject to major NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(v) The major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any State or Federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that had been established pursuant to paragraph (r)(4) of this section, but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(*c*) of this section.


(10) *Renewal of a PAL.* (i) The Administrator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (aa)(5) of this section in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source or a GHG-only source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Administrator.


(ii) *Application deadline.* A major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Administrator to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least 6 months prior to, but not earlier than 18 months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source or GHG-only source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. 


(iii) *Application requirements.* The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iii)(*a*) through (*d*) of this section. 


(A) The information required in paragraphs (aa)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. 


(B) A proposed PAL level. 


(C) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). 


(D) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Administrator to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. 


(iv) *PAL adjustment.* In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Administrator shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(*a*) and (*b*) of this section. However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(*c*) of this section. 


(A) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph (aa)(6) of this section is equal to or greater than 80 percent of the PAL level, the Administrator may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(*b*) of this section; or 


(B) The Administrator may set the PAL at a level that he or she determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that he or she determines to be more appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Administrator in his or her written rationale. 


(C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a) and (b) of this section: 


(*1*) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source or GHG-only source is less than the PAL, the Administrator shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of the source; and


(*2*) The Administrator shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source or GHG-only source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (aa)(11) of this section (increasing a PAL). 


(v) If the compliance date for a State or Federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Administrator has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewal or title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first.


(11) *Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period.* (i) The Administrator may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source or GHG-only source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (aa)(11)(i)(*a*) through (*d*) of this section. 


(A) The owner or operator of the major stationary source or GHG-only source shall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary or GHG-only source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL.


(B) As part of this application, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding 10 years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. 


(C) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(*a*) of this section, regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the major NSR process (for example, BACT), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. 


(D) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. 


(ii) The Administrator shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(*b*)), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units. 


(iii) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (aa)(5) of this section. 


(12) *Monitoring requirements for PALs.* (i) *General requirements.* (A) Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time or CO_2_e per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL permit. 


(B) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (aa)(12)(ii)(*a*) through (*d*) of this section and must be approved by the Administrator. 


(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(*b*) of this section, you may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(*a*) of this section if approved by the Administrator. 


(D) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this section renders the PAL invalid. 


(ii) Minimum performance requirements for approved monitoring approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when conducted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) through (ix) of this section: 


(A) Mass balance calculations for activities using coatings or solvents; 


(B) CEMS; 


(C) CPMS or PEMS; and 


(D) Emission factors. 


(iii) *Mass balance calculations.* An owner or operator using mass balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements: 


(A) Provide a demonstrated means of validating the published content of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materials used in or at the emissions unit; 


(B) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or at the emissions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the process; and 


(C) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, which is used in or at the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such material, the owner or operator must use the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unless the Administrator determines there is site-specific data or a site-specific monitoring program to support another content within the range. 


(iv) *CEMS.* An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: 


(A) CEMS must comply with applicable Performance Specifications found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; and 


(B) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every 15 minutes while the emissions unit is operating. 


(v) *CPMS or PEMS.* An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: 


(A) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site-specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and 


(B) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least every 15 minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the Administrator, while the emissions unit is operating. 


(vi) *Emission factors.* An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: 


(A) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development; 


(B) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and 


(C) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to determine a site-specific emission factor within 6 months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Administrator determines that testing is not required. 


(vii) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, unless another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. 


(viii) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) through (vii) of this section, where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Administrator shall, at the time of permit issuance: 


(A) Establish default value(s) for determining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or 


(B) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. 


(ix) *Re-validation.* All data used to establish the PAL pollutant must be re-validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the Administrator. Such testing must occur at least once every 5 years after issuance of the PAL. 


(13) *Recordkeeping requirements.* (i) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance with any requirement of paragraph (aa) of this section and of the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's 12-month rolling total emissions, for 5 years from the date of such record. 


(ii) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective period plus 5 years: 


(A) A copy of the PAL permit application and any applications for revisions to the PAL; and 


(B) Each annual certification of compliance pursuant to title V and the data relied on in certifying the compliance. 


(14) *Reporting and notification requirements.* The owner or operator shall submit semi-annual monitoring reports and prompt deviation reports to the Administrator in accordance with the applicable title V operating permit program. The reports shall meet the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(14)(i) through (iii) of this section. 


(i) *Semi-annual report.* The semi-annual report shall be submitted to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of each reporting period. This report shall contain the information required in paragraphs (aa)(14)(i)(*a*) through (*g*) of this section. 


(A) The identification of owner and operator and the permit number. 


(B) Total annual emissions (expressed on a mass-basis in tons per year, or expressed in tons per year CO_2_e) based on a 12-month rolling total for each month in the reporting period recorded pursuant to paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this section.


(C) All data relied upon, including, but not limited to, any Quality Assurance or Quality Control data, in calculating the monthly and annual PAL pollutant emissions. 


(D) A list of any emissions units modified or added to the major stationary source or GHG-only source during the preceding 6-month period. 


(E) The number, duration, and cause of any deviations or monitoring malfunctions (other than the time associated with zero and span calibration checks), and any corrective action taken. 


(F) A notification of a shutdown of any monitoring system, whether the shutdown was permanent or temporary, the reason for the shutdown, the anticipated date that the monitoring system will be fully operational or replaced with another monitoring system, and whether the emissions unit monitored by the monitoring system continued to operate, and the calculation of the emissions of the pollutant or the number determined by method included in the permit, as provided by (aa)(12)(vii). 


(G) A signed statement by the responsible official (as defined by the applicable title V operating permit program) certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the report. 


(ii) *Deviation report.* The major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall promptly submit reports of any deviations or exceedance of the PAL requirements, including periods where no monitoring is available. A report submitted pursuant to § 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) of this chapter shall satisfy this reporting requirement. The deviation reports shall be submitted within the time limits prescribed by the applicable program implementing § 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) of this chapter. The reports shall contain the following information: 


(A) The identification of owner and operator and the permit number; 


(B) The PAL requirement that experienced the deviation or that was exceeded; 


(C) Emissions resulting from the deviation or the exceedance; and 


(D) A signed statement by the responsible official (as defined by the applicable title V operating permit program) certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the report. 


(iii) *Re-validation results.* The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator the results of any re-validation test or method within 3 months after completion of such test or method.


(15) *Transition requirements.* (i) The Administrator may not issue a PAL that does not comply with the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section after March 3, 2003. 


(ii) The Administrator may supersede any PAL that was established prior to March 3, 2003 with a PAL that complies with the requirements of paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section. 


(bb) If any provision of this section, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this section, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.
