(d) *Sanction application sequencing.* (1) To implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in an affected area 18 months from the date when the Administrator makes a finding under paragraph (c) of this section unless the Administrator affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. To further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in an affected area 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For the findings under paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(4) of this section, the date of the finding shall be the effective date as defined in the final action triggering the sanctions clock. 


(2)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. 


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the proposed or final disapproval occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 


(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and more than 24 months after the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues such proposed or final disapproval. 


(3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has conditionally-approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. 


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable, more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 


(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill its commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable. 


(4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if EPA's proposed or final action finding the deficiency has not been corrected occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected.


(5) Any sanction clock started by a finding under paragraph (c) of this section will be permanently stopped and sanctions applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from the Administrator to the State governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the _Federal Register_ fully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the _Federal Register_ finding that the State is implementing the approved SIP.


(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in this section will prohibit the Administrator from determining through notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway sanction, rather than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph (c) of this section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, shall apply 6 months from the date the highway sanction applies.


(e) *Available sanctions and method for implementation*โ(1) *Offset sanction.* (i) As further set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)-(e)(1)(vi) of this section, the State shall apply the emissions offset requirement in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the offset sanction. The State shall apply the emission offset requirements in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7503 and 7509(b)(2), at a ratio of at least two units of emission reductions for each unit of increased emissions of the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for which the finding(s) under paragraph (c) of this section is (are) made. If the deficiency prompting the finding under paragraph (c) of this section is not specific to one or more particular pollutants and their precursors, the 2-to-1 ratio shall apply to all pollutants (and their precursors) for which an affected area within the State listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is required to meet the offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7503.


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding is made with respect to a requirement for the criteria pollutant ozone or when the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions offset requirements at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions for nitrogen oxides where, under 42 U.S.C. 7511a(f), the Administrator has approved an NO_X_ exemption for the affected area from the Act's new source review requirements under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for NO_X_ or where the affected area is not otherwise subject to the Act's new source review requirements for emission offsets under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for NO_X_.


(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding under paragraph (c) of this section is made with respect to PM-10, or the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions offset requirements, at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions to PM-10 precursors if the Administrator has determined under 42 U.S.C. 7513a(e) that major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the affected area.


(iv) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, at the 2-to-1 ratio required under this section, the State shall comply with the provisions of a State-adopted new source review (NSR) program that EPA has approved under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(3) as meeting the nonattainment area NSR requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or, if no plan has been so approved, the State shall comply directly with the nonattainment area NSR requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or cease issuing permits to construct and operate major new or modified sources as defined in those requirements. For purposes of applying the offset requirement under 42 U.S.C. 7503 where EPA has not fully approved a State's NSR program as meeting the requirements of part D, the specifications of those provisions shall supersede any State requirement that is less stringent or inconsistent.


(v) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, any permit required pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7503 and issued on or after the date the offset sanction applies under paragraph (d) of this section shall be subject to the enhanced 2-to-1 ratio under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.


(2) *Highway funding sanction.* The highway sanction shall apply, as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1), in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the highway sanction, but shall apply only to those portions of affected areas that are designated nonattainment under 40 CFR part 81.
