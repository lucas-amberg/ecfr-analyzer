# § 52.35   What are the requirements of the Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) for the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) relating to emissions of nitrogen oxides?

(a)(1) The Federal CAIR NO_X_ Annual Trading Program provisions of part 97 of this chapter constitute the Clean Air Interstate Rule Federal Implementation Plan provisions that relate to annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO_X_). Each State that is described in § 51.123(c)(1) and (2) of this chapter received a finding by the Administrator that the State failed to submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the Clean Air Act for the PM_2.5_ NAAQS. The provisions of subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter, regarding the CAIR NO_X_ Annual Trading Program, apply to the sources in each of these States that has not promulgated a SIP approved by the Administrator as correcting that deficiency. Following promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a State's SIP as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM_2.5_ relating to NO_X_ under § 51.123 of this chapter, these provisions of part 97 of this chapter will no longer apply to the sources in that State, except to the extent the Administrator's approval of the SIP is partial or conditional or unless such approval is under § 51.123(p) of this chapter.


(2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the Administrator has already allocated any CAIR NO_X_ allowances to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR NO_X_ allowances for those years shall continue to apply, unless the Administrator approves a SIP that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR NO_X_ allowances for those years.


(b)(1) The Federal CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season Trading Program provisions of part 97 of this chapter constitute the Clean Air Interstate Rule Federal Implementation Plan provisions that relate to emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO_X_) during the ozone season, as defined in § 97.302 of this chapter. Each State that is described in § 51.123(c)(1) and (3) of this chapter received a finding by the Administrator that the State failed to submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the Clean Air Act for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The provisions of subparts AAAA through IIII of part 97 of this chapter, regarding the CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season Trading Program, apply to sources in each of these States that has not promulgated a SIP revision approved by the Administrator as correcting that deficiency. Following promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a State's SIP as meeting the requirements of CAIR for ozone relating to NO_X_ under § 51.123 of this chapter, these provisions of part 97 of this chapter will no longer apply to sources in that State, except to the extent the Administrator's approval of the SIP is partial or conditional or unless such approval is under § 51.123(ee) of this chapter.


(2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the Administrator has already allocated any CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season allowances to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season allowances for those years shall continue to apply, unless the Administrator approves a SIP that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season allowances for those years.


(c) The provisions of this section do not invalidate or otherwise affect the obligations of States, emissions sources, or other responsible entities with respect to all portions of plans approved or promulgated under this part or the obligations of States under the requirements of §§ 51.123 and 51.125 of this chapter.


(d)(1) The States with SIPs approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM_2.5_ relating to NO_X_ under § 51.123(o) of this chapter are: Indiana, and Ohio.


(2) The States with SIPs approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of CAIR for ozone relating to NO_X_ under § 51.123(aa) of this chapter, are: Indiana, and Ohio.


(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, such paragraphs are not applicable as they relate to sources in the State of Minnesota as of December 3, 2009, except as provided in § 52.1240(b).


(f) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, subparts AA through II and AAAA through IIII of part 97 of this chapter, and any State's SIP to the contrary:


(1) With regard to any control period that begins after December 31, 2014,


(i) The provisions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section relating to NO_X_ annual or ozone season emissions shall not be applicable; and


(ii) The Administrator will not carry out any of the functions set forth for the Administrator in subparts AA through II and AAAA through IIII of part 97 of this chapter;


(2) The Administrator will not deduct for excess emissions any CAIR NO_X_ allowances or CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season allowances allocated for 2015 or any year thereafter;


(3) By March 3, 2015, the Administrator will remove from the CAIR NO_X_ Allowance Tracking System accounts all CAIR NO_X_ allowances allocated for a control period in 2015 and any subsequent year, and, thereafter, no holding or surrender of CAIR NO_X_ allowances will be required with regard to emissions or excess emissions for such control periods; and


(4) By March 3, 2015, the Administrator will remove from the CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season Allowance Tracking System accounts all CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season allowances allocated for a control period in 2015 and any subsequent year, and, thereafter, no holding or surrender of CAIR NO_X_ allowances will be required with regard to emissions or excess emissions for such control periods.
