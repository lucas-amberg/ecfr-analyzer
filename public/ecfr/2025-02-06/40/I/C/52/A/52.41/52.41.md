# § 52.41   What are the requirements of the Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) relating to ozone season emissions of nitrogen oxides from the Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas Industry?

(a) *Definitions.* All terms not defined in this paragraph (a) shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in subpart A of 40 CFR part 60.


*Affected unit* means an engine meeting the applicability criteria of this section.


*Cap* means the total amount of NO_X_ emissions, in tons per day on a 30-day rolling average basis, that is collectively allowed from all of the affected units covered by a Facility-Wide Averaging Plan and is calculated as the sum each affected unit's NO_X_ emissions at the emissions limit applicable to such unit under paragraph (c) of this section, converted to tons per day in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


*Emergency engine* means any stationary reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE) that meets all of the criteria in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this definition. All emergency stationary RICE must comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in order to be considered emergency engines. If the engine does not comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1), it is not considered an emergency engine under this section.


(i) The stationary engine is operated to provide electrical power or mechanical work during an emergency situation. Examples include stationary RICE used to produce power for critical networks or equipment (including power supplied to portions of a facility) when electric power from the local utility (or the normal power source, if the facility runs on its own power production) is interrupted, or stationary RICE used to pump water in the case of fire or flood, etc.


(ii) The stationary RICE is operated under limited circumstances for purposes other than those identified in paragraph (i) of this definition, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


*Facility* means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Pollutant-emitting activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same “Major Group” (*i.e.,* which have the same first two digit code as described in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987). For purposes of this section, a facility may not extend beyond the 20 states identified in § 52.40(b)(2).


*Four stroke* means any type of engine which completes the power cycle in two crankshaft revolutions, with intake and compression strokes in the first revolution and power and exhaust strokes in the second revolution.


*ISO conditions* means 288 Kelvin (15 °C), 60 percent relative humidity, and 101.3 kilopascals pressure.


*Lean burn* means any two-stroke or four-stroke spark ignited reciprocating internal combustion engine that does not meet the definition of a rich burn engine.


*Local Distribution Companies (LDCs)* are companies that own or operate distribution pipelines, but not interstate pipelines or intrastate pipelines, that physically deliver natural gas to end users and that are within a single state that are regulated as separate operating companies by State public utility commissions or that operate as independent municipally-owned distribution systems. LDCs do not include pipelines (both interstate and intrastate) delivering natural gas directly to major industrial users and farm taps upstream of the local distribution company inlet.


*Local Distribution Company (LDC) custody transfer station* means a metering station where the LDC receives a natural gas supply from an upstream supplier, which may be an interstate transmission pipeline or a local natural gas producer, for delivery to customers through the LDC's intrastate transmission or distribution lines.


*Nameplate rating* means the manufacturer's maximum design capacity in horsepower (hp) at the installation site conditions. Starting from the completion of any physical change in the engine resulting in an increase in the maximum output (in hp) that the engine is capable of producing on a steady state basis and during continuous operation, such increased maximum output shall be as specified by the person conducting the physical change.


*Natural gas* means a fluid mixture of hydrocarbons (*e.g.,* methane, ethane, or propane) or non-hydrocarbons, composed of at least 70 percent methane by volume or that has a gross calorific value between 35 and 41 megajoules (MJ) per dry standard cubic meter (950 and 1,100 Btu per dry standard cubic foot), that maintains a gaseous state under ISO conditions. Natural gas does not include the following gaseous fuels: Landfill gas, digester gas, refinery gas, sour gas, blast furnace gas, coal-derived gas, producer gas, coke oven gas, or any gaseous fuel produced in a process which might result in highly variable CO_2_ content or heating value.


*Natural gas-fired* means that greater than or equal to 90% of the engine's heat input, excluding recirculated or recuperated exhaust heat, is derived from the combustion of natural gas.


*Natural gas processing plant* means any processing site engaged in the extraction of natural gas liquids from field gas, fractionation of mixed natural gas liquids to natural gas products, or both. A Joule-Thompson valve, a dew point depression valve, or an isolated or standalone Joule-Thompson skid is not a natural gas processing plant.


*Natural gas production facility* means all equipment at a single stationary source directly associated with one or more natural gas wells upstream of the natural gas processing plant. This equipment includes, but is not limited to, equipment used for storage, separation, treating, dehydration, artificial lift, combustion, compression, pumping, metering, monitoring, and flowline.


*Operating day* means a 24-hour period beginning at 12:00 midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time in the engine.


*Pipeline transportation of natural gas* means the movement of natural gas through an interconnected network of compressors and pipeline components, including the compressor and pipeline network used to transport the natural gas from processing plants over a distance (intrastate or interstate) to and from storage facilities, to large natural gas end-users, and prior to delivery to a “local distribution company custody transfer station” (as defined in this section) of an LDC that provides the natural gas to end-users. *Pipeline transportation of natural gas* does not include natural gas production facilities, natural gas processing plants, or the portion of a compressor and pipeline network that is upstream of a natural gas processing plant.


*Reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE)* means a reciprocating engine in which power, produced by heat and/or pressure that is developed in the engine combustion chambers by the burning of a mixture of air and fuel, is subsequently converted to mechanical work.


*Rich burn* means any four-stroke spark ignited reciprocating internal combustion engine where the manufacturer's recommended operating air/fuel ratio divided by the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio at full load conditions is less than or equal to 1.1. Internal combustion engines originally manufactured as rich burn engines but modified with passive emissions control technology for nitrogen oxides (NO_X_) (such as pre-combustion chambers) will be considered lean burn engines. Existing affected unit where there are no manufacturer's recommendations regarding air/fuel ratio will be considered rich burn engines if the excess oxygen content of the exhaust at full load conditions is less than or equal to 2 percent.


*Spark ignition* means a reciprocating internal combustion engine utilizing a spark plug (or other sparking device) to ignite the air/fuel mixture and with operating characteristics significantly similar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle.


*Stoichiometric* means the theoretical air-to-fuel ratio required for complete combustion.


*Two stroke* means a type of reciprocating internal combustion engine which completes the power cycle in a single crankshaft revolution by combining the intake and compression operations into one stroke (one-half revolution) and the power and exhaust operations into a second stroke. This system requires auxiliary exhaust scavenging of the combustion products and inherently runs lean (excess of air) of stoichiometry.


(b) *Applicability.* You are subject to the requirements under this section if you own or operate a new or existing natural gas-fired spark ignition engine, other than an emergency engine, with a nameplate rating of 1,000 hp or greater that is used for pipeline transportation of natural gas and is located within any of the States listed in § 52.40(c)(2), including Indian country located within the borders of any such State(s).


(1) For purposes of this section, the owner or operator of an emergency stationary RICE must operate the RICE according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section to be treated as an emergency stationary RICE. In order for stationary RICE to be treated as an emergency RICE under this subpart, any operation other than emergency operation, maintenance and testing, and operation in non-emergency situations for up to 50 hours per year, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii), is prohibited. If you do not operate the RICE according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii), the RICE will not be considered an emergency engine under this section and must meet all requirements for affected units in this section.


(i) There is no time limit on the use of emergency stationary RICE in emergency situations.


(ii) The owner or operator may operate your emergency stationary RICE for maintenance checks and readiness testing for a maximum of 100 hours per calendar year, provided that the tests are recommended by a Federal, state, or local government agency, the manufacturer, the vendor, or the insurance company associated with the engine. Any operation for non-emergency situations as allowed by paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section counts as part of the 100 hours per calendar year allowed by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for approval of additional hours to be used for maintenance checks and readiness testing, but a petition is not required if the owner or operator maintains records confirming that Federal, state, or local standards require maintenance and testing of emergency RICE beyond 100 hours per calendar year. Any approval of a petition for additional hours granted by the Administrator under 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, shall constitute approval by the Administrator of the same petition under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii).


(iii) Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for up to 50 hours per calendar year in non-emergency situations. The 50 hours of operation in non-emergency situations are counted as part of the 100 hours per calendar year for maintenance and testing provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.


(2) If you own or operate a natural gas-fired two stroke lean burn spark ignition engine manufactured after July 1, 2007 that is meeting the applicable emissions limits in 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ, table 1, the engine is not an affected unit under this section and you do not have to comply with the requirements of this section.


(3) If you own or operate a natural gas-fired four stroke lean or rich burn spark ignition engine manufactured after July 1, 2010, that is meeting the applicable emissions limits in 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ, table 1, the engine is not an affected unit under this section and you do not have to comply with the requirements of this section.


(c) *Emissions limitations.* If you are the owner or operator of an affected unit, you must meet the following emissions limitations on a 30-day rolling average basis during the 2026 ozone season and in each ozone season thereafter:

(3) Natural gas-fired two stroke lean burn spark ignition engine: 3.0 g/hp-hr.


(d) *Facility-Wide Averaging Plan.* If you are the owner or operator of a facility containing more than one affected unit, you may submit a request via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA to the Administrator for approval of a proposed Facility-Wide Averaging Plan as an alternative means of compliance with the applicable emissions limits in paragraph (c) of this section. Any such request shall be submitted to the Administrator on or before October 1st of the year prior to each emissions averaging year. The Administrator will approve a proposed Facility-Wide Averaging Plan submitted under this paragraph (d) if the Administrator determines that the proposed Facility-Wide Averaging Plan meets the requirements of this paragraph (d), will provide total emissions reductions equivalent to or greater than those achieved by the applicable emissions limits in paragraph (c), and identifies satisfactory means for determining initial and continuous compliance, including appropriate testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. You may only include affected units (*i.e.,* engines meeting the applicability criteria in paragraph (b) of this section) in a Facility-Wide Averaging Plan. Upon EPA approval of a proposed Facility-Wide Averaging Plan, you cannot withdraw any affected unit listed in such plan, and the terms of the plan may not be changed unless approved in writing by the Administrator.

(3) The owner or operator will calculate the cap according to equation 1 to this paragraph (d)(3). You will monitor and record daily hours of engine operation for use in calculating the cap on a 30-day rolling average basis. You will base the hours of operation on hour readings from a non-resettable hour meter or an equivalent monitoring device.


(i) Any affected unit for which less than two years of operating data are available shall not be included in the Facility-Wide Averaging Plan unless the owner or operator extrapolates the available operating data for the affected unit to two years of operating data, for use in calculating the emissions cap in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(ii) [Reserved]


(4) The owner or operator of an affected units covered by an EPA-approved Facility-Wide Averaging Plan will be in violation of the cap if the sum of NO_X_ emissions from all such units, in tons per day on a 30-day rolling average basis, exceeds the cap. Each day of noncompliance by each affected unit covered by the Facility-Wide Averaging Plan shall be a violation of the cap until corrective action is taken to achieve compliance.
