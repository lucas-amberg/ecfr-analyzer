# ยง 52.136   Control strategy for ozone: Oxides of nitrogen.

EPA is approving an exemption request submitted by the State of Arizona on April 13, 1994 for the Maricopa County ozone nonattainment area from the NO_X_ RACT requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the Phoenix area from implementing the NO_X_ requirements for RACT, new source review (NSR), and the applicable general and transportation conformity and inspection and maintenance (I/M) requirements of the CAA. The exemption is based on Urban Airshed Modeling as lasts for only as long as the area's modeling continues to demonstrate attainment without NO_X_ reductions from major stationary sources.
