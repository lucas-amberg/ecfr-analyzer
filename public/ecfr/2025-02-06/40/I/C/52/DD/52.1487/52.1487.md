# ยง 52.1487   Public hearings.

(a) The requirements of ยง 51.102 (a) and (e) of this chapter are not met since NAQR, Article 2.11.4.2 allows variances (compliance schedules), to be renewed without a public hearing, thus allowing further postponement of the final compliance date for sources whose emissions contribute to violations of the national standards. Therefore, NAQR, Article 2.11.4.2 is disapproved.
