(b) No person shall discharge into the atmosphere more than 15 pounds of organic materials in any 1 day or more than 3 pounds in any 1 hour from any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance in which any organic solvent or any material containing organic solvent comes into contact with flame or is baked, heat-cured, or heat-polymerized in the presence of oxygen, unless said discharge has been reduced by at least 85 percent. Those portions of any series of articles, machines, equipment, or other contrivances designed for processing continuous web, strip, or wire that emit organic materials in the course of using operations described in this section shall be collectively subject to compliance with this section.


(c) A person shall not discharge to the atmosphere more than 40 pounds of organic materials in any 1 day or more than 8 pounds in any 1 hour from any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance used under conditions other than those described in paragraph (b) of this section for employing or applying any photochemically reactive solvent, as defined in paragraph (k) of this section, or material containing such photochemically reactive solvent, unless said discharge has been reduced by at least 85 percent. Emissions of organic materials into the atmosphere resulting from air- or heated-drying of products for the first 12 hours after their removal from any article, machine, or other contrivance described in this section shall be included in determining compliance with this paragraph. Emissions resulting from baking, heat-curing, or heat-polymerizing as described in paragraph (b) of this section shall be excluded from determination of compliance with this section.

(d) A person shall not, after August 31, 1976, discharge into the atmosphere more than 3,000 pounds of organic materials in any 1 day or more than 450 pounds in any 1 hour from any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance in which any non-photochemically reactive organic solvent or any material containing such a solvent is employed or applied, unless said discharge has been reduced by at least 85 percent. Emissions of organic materials into the atmosphere resulting from air- or heated-drying of products for the first 12 hours after their removal from any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance described in this section shall be included in determining compliance with this section. Emissions resulting from baking, heat-curing, or heat-polymerizing as described in paragraph (b) of this section shall be excluded from determination of compliance with this section. Those portions of any series of articles, machines, equipment, or other contrivances designed for processing a continuous web, strip, or wire that emit organic materials in the course of using operations described in this section shall be collectively subject to compliance with this section.


(e) Emissions of organic materials to the atmosphere from the cleaning with photochemically reactive solvent, as defined in paragraph (k) of this section, of any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance described in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section, shall be included with the other emissions of organic materials for determining compliance with this rule.


(f) Emissions of organic materials into the atmosphere required to be controlled by paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section, shall be reduced by:


(1) Incineration, provided that 90 percent or more of the carbon in the organic material being incinerated is oxidized to carbon dioxide, or


(2) Adsorption, or
