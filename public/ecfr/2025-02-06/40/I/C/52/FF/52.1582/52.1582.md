# § 52.1582   Control strategy and regulations: Ozone.

(a) Subchapter 16 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled “Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Volatile Organic Substances,” N.J.A.C. 7:27-16.1 et seq. as revised on December 31, 1981 and effective March 1, 1982, is approved with the following provisions and conditions:


(1) Subsections 16.6(c)(4) and 16.6(c)(5) are approved. The State must comply with the public participation procedures it submitted to EPA on December 19, 1980 and must supply to EPA a copy of each notice of a proposed bubble that it supplies the public. In addition, the State must promptly transmit to EPA notice setting forth each set of emission limits approved by the state pursuant to subsections 16.6(c)(4) and 16.6(c)(5) as well as the emission limitations previously applicable. Finally, the State must transmit any relevant additional material EPA may request, and it must notify the public of an approved set of emission limits at the time it transmits notice of those limits to EPA.


(2) Emission limitations required by subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) and 16.6(b) are applicable requirements of the New Jersey SIP for the purposes of section 113 of the Clean Air Act and shall be enforceable by EPA and by citizens in the same manner as other requirements of the SIP; except that emission limitations adopted by the State under and which comply with subsections 16.6(c) (4) and (5) shall be the applicable requirements of the New Jersey SIP in lieu of those contained in subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) and 16.6(b) and shall be enforceable by EPA and by citizens, if the State meets the requirements set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(3) Although EPA approves the variance provisions in subchapter 7:27-16.9 and 7:27-16.10, in order to be considered as part of the SIP, each variance issued under these provisions must be submitted to and approved by EPA as a SIP revision.


(4) The December 17, 1979 version of Subchapter 16 is approved as a part of the SIP only to the extent that it addresses compliance dates for Group I Control Techniques Guideline source categories.


(b) Subchapter 17 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled “Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Toxic Substances,” N.J.A.C. 7:27-17.1 et seq. as revised on October 17, 1979 and effective December 17, 1979, is approved for the regulation of perchloroethylene dry cleaners, as further clarified in a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection memorandum “Subchapter 17 Requirements for Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Systems” dated October 25, 1982.


(c) The November 15, 1993 SIP revision submitted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy demonstrates the fulfillment of section 182(b)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for states to adopt RACT regulations for all sources for which EPA has issued a CTG before enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act.


(d)(1) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has been satisfied for the Atlantic City, New York/ Northern New Jersey/Long Island, Philadelphia/Wilmington/ Trenton, and Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton areas of New Jersey. The inventory was submitted on November 15, 1993 and amended on November 21, 1994 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP). Revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory dated December 31, 1996 for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas of New Jersey have been approved. Revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory dated February 10, 1999 for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas of New Jersey have been approved.


(2) [Reserved]


(3) The 1996 and 1999 ozone projection year emission inventories included in New Jersey's July 30, 1998 addendum and February 10, 1999 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas have been approved.


(4) [Reserved] 


(5) The photochemical assessment monitoring stations network included in New Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas has been approved.


(6) The demonstration that emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled will not increase motor vehicle emissions and, therefore, offsetting measures are not necessary which was included in New Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas has been approved.


(7) The enforceable commitments to: participate in the consultative process to address regional transport; adopt additional control measures as necessary to attain the ozone standard, meet rate of progress requirements, and eliminate significant contribution to nonattainment downwind; identify any reductions that are needed from upwind areas for the area to meet the ozone standard; and implement the Ozone Transport Commission NO_X_ Memorandum of Understanding included in New Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas have been approved.


(e) The State of New Jersey's March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on November 27, 1996 and April 1997, is approved pursuant to section 110 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410. However, since New Jersey failed to start its program by November 15, 1997, the interim approval granted under the provisions of Section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act of 1995 (NHSDA), 23 U.S.C. 348, which allowed the State to take full credit in its 15 Percent ROP Plan for all the emission reduction credits in its proposal, converted to a disapproval when EPA sent finding letters to the State on December 12, 1997. The finding letters also informed the state that the underlying enhanced I/M program approval, pursuant to Section 110 of the Act, remained in effect as part of the federally enforceable SIP.


(f) The State of New Jersey's June 5, 1998 submittal for the conversion of the inspection frequency of the current inspection and maintenance (I/M) program from annual to biennial in order to facilitate the upgrade of the existing state lanes to accommodate the testing equipment for the enhanced program has been approved by EPA. The State will be adding a gas cap inspection to the current I/M program, which will result in a net increase in overall emissions reductions.


(g) The 15 Percent Rate of Progress (ROP) Plans and the recalculation of the 9 Percent ROP Plans included in the July 30, 1998 addendum and the February 10, 1999 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas have been approved.


(h)(1) The statewide 1996 periodic emission inventory included in New Jersey's April 11, 2001 State Implementation Plan revision is approved. 


(2) The 2002 and 2005 ozone projection year emission inventories for the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment area and the 2002, 2005 and 2007 ozone projection year emission inventories for the New Jersey portion of the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island nonattainment area included in New Jersey's April 11, 2001 State Implementation Plan revision are approved. 


(3) The 2002 and 2005 Reasonable Further Progress Plans for the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment area and the 2002, 2005 and 2007 Reasonable Further Progress Plans for the New Jersey portion of the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island nonattainment area included in New Jersey's April 11, 2001 State Implementation Plan revision are approved. 


(4) The contingency measures for the New Jersey portions of the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment area and the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island nonattainment area included in New Jersey's April 11, 2001 State Implementation Plan revision are approved. 


(5) [Reserved] 


(6) The Reasonably Available Control Measure Analysis for the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton and New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 16, 2001 State Implementation Plan revision is approved. 


(7) The revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by New Jersey on August 31, 1998, October 16, 1998, and April 26, 2000 are approved. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act for the New Jersey portions of the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton and New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island severe ozone nonattainment areas. The revisions establish attainment dates of November 15, 2005 for the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment area and November 15, 2007 for the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island ozone nonattainment area. The revisions include the enforceable commitments for future actions associated with attainment of the 1-hour ozone national ambient air quality: 


(i) To adopt additional control measures by October 31, 2001 to meet the level of reductions identified by EPA for attainment of the 1-hour ozone standard; 


(ii) To submit revised State Implementation Plan and motor vehicle emissions budgets by October 31, 2001 if additional adopted measures affect the motor vehicle emissions inventory; 


(i)(1) The revised 1996, 2005 and 2007 motor vehicle emission inventories calculated using MOBILE6 included in New Jersey's April 8, 2003 State Implementation Plan revision is approved.

(3) The conformity emission budgets for the McGuire Air Force Base included in New Jersey's May 18, 2006 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.


(l) *Attainment Determination.* EPA is determining that the 1-hour ozone nonattainment areas in New Jersey listed below have attained the 1-hour ozone standard on the date listed and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) (contingency measures) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to these areas.


(1) Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton (consisting of Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, and Salem Counties) as of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined, as of November 15, 2005, the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.


(2) Atlantic City (consisting of Atlantic and Cape May Counties) as of *January 6, 2010.*

(m)(1) The 2008 Reasonable Further Progress Plans and associated 2008 ozone projection year emission inventories for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.


(2) The contingency measures for failure to meet the 2008 RFP Plan milestones for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.


(3) The moderate area Reasonably Available Control Measure Analysis for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.


(4) The 2008 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.


(5) The general conformity budgets for McGuire AFB and Lakehurst NAS included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.


(6) The Statewide reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis for the 8-hour ozone standard included in the August 1, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved based on EPA's approval of the April 9, 2010 and April 21, 2010 SIP revisions.


(n)(1) *Attainment determination.* EPA has determined, as of March 26, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual 8-hour ozone NAAQS.


(2) EPA has determined, as of June 18, 2012, that based on 2007 to 2009 complete, quality-assured and certified ambient air quality data, additional data showing continued attainment through 2011, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT, eight-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS.


(o)(1) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.


(2) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment area included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.


(p) *Rescission of clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.* Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012-2014 show the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Therefore, the EPA is rescinding the clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard only. The prior determination (*see* paragraph (n)(2)) is in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918. The prior determination suspended the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This rescission of the clean data determination will result in a SIP Call for a new ozone attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard, for this area only. If the revised plan is approved by the EPA as demonstrating reasonable further progress and attainment for the more stringent 2008 NAAQS by the Moderate area attainment date, and is approved by the EPA as containing adequate contingency measures for the 2008 NAAQS, then the plan would be deemed to have also satisfied requirements of the SIP Call associated with violations for the 1997 NAAQS.


(q) *Negative declarations.* The State of New Jersey has certified to the satisfaction of the EPA that no sources are located in the State which are covered by the following Control Techniques Guidelines:


(1) Oil and Natural Gas Industry (October 2016).


(2) [Reserved]


(r) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area included in New Jersey's January 2, 2018 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182 of the Clean Air Act.
