# § 52.319   Conditional approval.

(a) The EPA is making a limited conditional approval and limited disapproval of revisions committed to correcting deficiencies identified with submissions made on May 31, 2017, and May 10, 2019. The conditional approval is based upon the October 13, 2022 commitment from the State to submit a SIP revision consisting of rule revisions that will cure the identified deficiencies within twelve months after the EPA's conditional approval. If the State fails to meet its commitment, the conditional approval will be treated as a disapproval with respect to the rules and CTG category for which the corrections are not met. The following rules are conditionally approved, except as they relate to periodic reporting requirements to the state for which we are disapproving, because we have determined that the rules strengthen the SIP and are largely consistent with the relevant CAA requirements:


(1) Regulation number 7 (Reg. 7), Part C, section I.P. and Reg. 7, Part E, section II.A.4. RACT requirements for the Colorado ozone SIP for the “Control Techniques Guidelines for Miscellaneous Metal and Plastic Parts Coatings,” Tables 5 and 7, EPA453/R08003, September 2008 and glass melting furnaces.


(2) [Reserved]


(b) [Reserved].
