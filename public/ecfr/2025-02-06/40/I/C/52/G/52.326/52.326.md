The Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) submitted a NO_X_ exemption petition to the EPA on May 25, 1994 and submitted supporting documentation via a letter dated August 1, 1994. This petition requested that the Denver metropolitan area, a transitional ozone nonattainment area, be exempted from the requirement to meet the NO_X_ provisions of the Federal transportation and general conformity rule with respect to ozone. The exemption request was based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 3 years prior to the petition. The EPA approved this exemption request on July 28, 1995.
