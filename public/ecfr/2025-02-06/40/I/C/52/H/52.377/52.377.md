# § 52.377   Control strategy: Ozone.

(a) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on December 30, 1997 and January 7, 1998. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(c)(2) through 1999, and the contingency measure requirements of sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the Greater Hartford serious ozone nonattainment area, and the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area.


(b) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on September 16, 1998, February 8, 2000 and June 17, 2003. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act for the Greater Connecticut serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes an attainment date of November 15, 2007 for the Greater Connecticut serious ozone nonattainment area. Connecticut commits to conduct a mid-course review to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved toward the goal of attainment by 2007, and submit the results to EPA by December 31, 2004. The June 17, 2003 revision establishes MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 51.9 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 98.4 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NO_X_) to be used in transportation conformity in the Greater Connecticut serious ozone nonattainment area. 


(c) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on October 15, 2001 and June 17, 2003. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182 (c)(2)(B) through 2007, and the contingency measure requirements of section 182 (c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area. The October 15, 2001 revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2002 of 15.20 tons per day of VOC and 38.39 tons per day of NO_X_ to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area. The June 17, 2003 revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2005 of 19.5 tons per day of VOC and 36.8 tons per day of NO_X_ to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area.


(d) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on September 16, 1998, February 8, 2000, October 15, 2001 and June 17, 2003. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act for the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area. The June 17, 2003 revision establishes MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 16.4 tons per day of VOC and 29.7 tons per day of NO_X_ to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe ozone nonattainment area. Connecticut commits to adopt and submit by October 31, 2001, additional necessary regional control measures to offset the emission reduction shortfall in order to attain the one-hour ozone standard by November 2007. Connecticut commits to adopt and submit by October 31, 2001, additional necessary intrastate control measures to offset the emission reduction shortfall in order to attain the one-hour ozone standard by November 2007. Connecticut commits to adopt and submit additional restrictions on VOC emissions from mobile equipment and repair operations; and requirements to reduce VOC emissions from certain consumer products. Connecticut also commits to conduct a mid-course review to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved toward the goal of attainment by 2007, and submit the results to EPA by December 31, 2004.


(e) Commitment Fulfillment—Connecticut has fulfilled the commitment in section 52.377(d), to adopt additional NO_X_ and VOC control measures to meet the emission reduction shortfall in its 1-hour severe ozone nonattainment area.


(f) Determination of Attainment. Effective September 30, 2010, EPA is determining that the Greater Connecticut 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (*see* 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Greater Connecticut 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 ozone standard.


(g) Approval—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, dated December 28, 2007, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) infrastructure requirements for the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This submittal satisfies the requirements of CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (K), (L), and (M).


(h) Conditional Approval—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, dated December 28, 2007, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) infrastructure requirements for the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). On May 2, 2011, the State of Connecticut supplemented this submittal with a commitment to address the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the CAA that requires notification of affected states for Prevention of Significant Deterioration purposes. EPA is conditionally approving Connecticut's submittal with respect to CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii).


(i) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective April 16, 2012, EPA is determining that the Greater Connecticut one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Greater Connecticut one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. EPA's review of the ozone data shows that the area began attaining the one-hour ozone standard during the 2006-2008 monitoring period, and has continued attaining the one-hour standard through the 2007-2009 and 2008-2010 monitoring periods.


(j) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective July 18, 2012, EPA is determining that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area and data showing the area continued to attain through 2011.


(k) Determination of Attainment for the Eight-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective July 18, 2012 EPA is determining, that complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2007-2009 show the NY-NJ-CT eight-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard by its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A). EPA is also determining that the NY-NJ-CT eight-hour ozone nonattainment area currently continues to attain the eight-hour ozone NAAQS, based on complete, quality-assured and certified data for 2008-2010 and data through 2011. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS.


(l) Approval—Revisions to the Connecticut State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on December 8, 2006. The SIP revision satisfies the requirement to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO_X_) for purposes of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Specifically, the following sections of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies are approved for this purpose: For VOC RACT, 22a-174-20, Control of Organic Compound Emissions, 22a-174-30, Dispensing of Gasoline/Stage I and Stage II Vapor Recovery, and 22a-174-32, RACT for Organic Compounds; for NO_X_ RACT, 22a-174-22, Control of Nitrogen Oxide Emissions, and 22a-174-38, Municipal Waste Combustors.


(m) *Approval.* (1) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on August 18, 2000, December 12, 2002, July 1, 2004, January 13, 2006. The revisions consist of 148 single source emission trading orders necessary for satisfying Reasonable Available Control Technology requirements for nitrogen oxides during specific time periods. All trading orders expired before January 1, 2013, with the exception of Trading Agreement and Order 8242, in paragraph (m)(1)(xlii) of this section, issued to PSEG Power Connecticut, LLC in Bridgeport, Connecticut on February 12, 2003.

(xc) Trading Agreement and Order No. 8110A issued to Yale University in New Haven.


(n) Approval—An attainment demonstration for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard to satisfy requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, and a Reasonably Available Control Measure (RACM) analysis to satisfy requirements of section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the Greater Connecticut ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection on February 1, 2008.


(o) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on February 1, 2008. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b)(1) from 2002 through 2008, and the contingency measure requirement of sections 172(c)(9) and of the Clean Air Act, for the Greater Connecticut moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, and the Connecticut portion of the New York-New Jersey-Long Island moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 of 29.7 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 60.5 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the New York-New Jersey-Long Island moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions also establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 for the Greater Connecticut moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area of 28.5 tons per day for VOCs, and 54.3 tons per day for NOx.


(p) *Rescission of clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.* Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012-2014 show the NY-NJ-CT 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Therefore, the EPA is rescinding the clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard only. The prior determination (*see* paragraph k of this section) is in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918. The prior determination suspended the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This rescission of the clean data determination will result in a SIP Call for a new ozone attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard, for this area only. If the revised plan is approved by the EPA as demonstrating reasonable further progress and attainment for the more stringent 2008 NAAQS by the Moderate area attainment date, and is approved by the EPA as containing adequate contingency measures for the 2008 NAAQS, then the plan would be deemed to have also satisfied requirements of the SIP Call associated with violations for the 1997 NAAQS.


(q) Approval—Revisions to the Connecticut State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on July 18, 2014. The SIP revision satisfies the requirement to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO_X_) for purposes of the 2008 ozone standard. Specifically, the following sections of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies are approved for this purpose: For VOC RACT, 22a-174-20, Control of Organic Compound Emissions, 22a-174-30, Dispensing of Gasoline/Stage I and Stage II Vapor Recovery, and 22a-174-32, RACT for Organic Compounds; for NO_X_ RACT, 22a-174-22, Control of nitrogen oxide emissions, 22a-174-22e, Control of nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning equipment at major sources, 22a-174-22f, High daily NO_X_ emitting units at non-major sources of nitrogen oxides, and 22a-174-38, Municipal Waste Combustors.


(r) *Approval*—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection dated March 9, 2017, to address the nonattainment new source review requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Greater Connecticut and the New York-N. New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT ozone nonattainment areas, as it meets the requirements for both the State's marginal and moderate classifications.


(s) *Approval*—An attainment demonstration for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard to satisfy requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, and a Reasonably Available Control Measure (RACM) analysis to satisfy requirements of section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. This rulemaking addresses the EPA's obligations to act on Connecticut's February 1, 2008 SIP revision for the 1997 ozone NAAQS, as well as the attainment demonstration and RACM analysis portion of the August 8, 2017 SIP submittal for the 1997 ozone NAAQS for the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT area.


(t) *Approval.* Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection on January 17, 2017, September 5, 2017, and August 8, 2017, to meet, in part, requirements of the 2008 ozone NAAQS. These revisions satisfy the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b) through 2017, the contingency measure requirements of section 172(c)(9), the emission statement requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B), and the reasonably available control measure requirement of section 172(c)(1) for the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT area, and the Greater Connecticut moderate ozone nonattainment areas. The January 17, 2017 revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2017 of 15.9 tons per day of VOC and 22.2 tons per day of NO_X_ to be used in transportation conformity in the Greater Connecticut moderate ozone nonattainment area. The August 8, 2017 revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2017 of 17.6 tons per day of VOC and 24.6 tons per day of NO_X_ to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT moderate ozone nonattainment area.


(u) *Determination of attainment for the 2008 ozone standard.* Effective November 7, 2022 EPA is determining that complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2018-2020 show the Greater Connecticut, CT ozone nonattainment area attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS by its July 20, 2021, attainment deadline. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard.


(v) *Approval*—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection dated December 21, 2020, to address the nonattainment new source review (NNSR) requirements as a serious nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone standard for the Greater Connecticut and the New York-N. New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT ozone nonattainment areas, and also approves NNSR for Connecticut for the 2015 ozone standard as a state containing a moderate and a marginal nonattainment area and being located within the Ozone Transport Region as it meets the requirements for both the state's marginal and moderate classifications.
