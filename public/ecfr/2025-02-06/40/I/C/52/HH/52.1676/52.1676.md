# ยง 52.1676   Control strategy: Nitrogen dioxide.

(a) The requirements of ยง 52.14(c)(3) of this chapter as of May 8, 1974 (39 FR 16347), are not met since the plans do not provide for the degree of nitrogen oxides emission reduction attainable through the application of reasonably available control technology in the New York portion of the New Jersey-New York-Connecticut Interstate Region.


(b) Section 227.5(b) of 6 NYCRR, as submitted on August 10, 1979, is disapproved because it is inconsistent with 40 CFR Subpart G, Control strategy: Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide.
