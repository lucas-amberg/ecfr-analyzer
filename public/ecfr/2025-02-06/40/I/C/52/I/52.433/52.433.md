# ยง 52.433   Nonattainment new source review.

(a) *Disapproval.* EPA is disapproving Delaware's October 15, 2013 submittal of revisions to 7 DNREC 1125, sections 2.5.5 and 2.5.6 because it does not meet Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements which establish the criteria under which the owner or operator of a new or modified major stationary source must obtain the required emission offsets for the nonattainment new source review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program and because Delaware exercises authorities that are reserved for EPA under section 107 of the CAA. Delaware's Federally-approved nonattainment NSR preconstruction program in 7 DNREC 1125, sections 1.0 through 3.16.4, effective in Delaware on February 11, 2012, was fully-approved by EPA on October 2, 2012 and continues to apply.


(b) [Reserved]
