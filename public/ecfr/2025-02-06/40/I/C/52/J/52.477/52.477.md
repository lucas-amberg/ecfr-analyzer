# ยง 52.477   Control strategy: Particular matter.

(a) *Determination of Attainment.* EPA has determined, as of January 12, 2009, that the District of Columbia portion of the Metropolitan Washington, DC-MD-VA nonattainment area for the 1997 PM_2.5_ NAAQS has attained the 1997 PM_2.5_ NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 52.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration and associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 PM_2.5_ NAAQS.


(b) *Maintenance Plan and Transportation Conformity Budgets.* EPA approves the maintenance plan for the District of Columbia portion of the Washington, DC-MD-VA nonattainment area for the 1997 annual PM_2.5_ NAAQS submitted by the District of Columbia for the entire Area on June 3, 2013 and supplemented on July 22, 2013. The MVEBs are based on a tiered approach: Tier 1 MVEBs are effective as EPA has determined them adequate for transportation conformity purposes; Tier 2 mobile budgets will become effective upon the completion of the interagency consultation process and fully documented within the first conformity analysis that uses the Tier 2 MVEBs.
