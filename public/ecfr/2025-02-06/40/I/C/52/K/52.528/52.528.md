# ยง 52.528   Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

(a) In a letter dated October 10, 1986, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules.


(b) The variance granted to the Turkey Point and Port Everglades plants of Florida Power and Light Company from the particulate emission limits of the plan is disapproved because the relaxed limits would cause violation of the Class I increment for sulfur dioxide in the Everglades National Park. These plants must meet the 0.1#/MMBTU particulate limit of the plan.
