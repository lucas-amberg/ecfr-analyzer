# § 52.1879   Review of new sources and modifications.

(a) The requirements of sections 172, 173, 182, and 189 for permitting of major new sources and major modifications in nonattainment areas for ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide are not met, because Ohio's regulations exempt source categories which may not be exempted and because the State has not adopted the new permitting requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in a clear or enforceable manner.


(b) [Reserved]


(c) The requirements of § 51.161 of this chapter are not met because the State failed to submit procedures providing for public comment on review of new or modified stationary sources.


(d) Regulation providing for public comment. (1) For purposes of this paragraph, *Director* shall mean the *Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.*

(2) Prior to approval or disapproval of the construction or modification of a stationary source, the Director shall:


(i) Make a preliminary determination whether construction or modification of the stationary source should be approved, approved with conditions or disapproved;


(ii) Make available in at least one location in the region in which the proposed stationary source would be constructed or modified, a copy of all materials submitted by the owner or operator, a copy of the Director's preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered by the Director in making his preliminary determination; and


(iii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the region in which the proposed stationary source would be constructed or modified, of the opportunity for public comment on the information submitted by the owner or operator and the Director's preliminary determination on the approvability of the new or modified stationary source.


(3) A copy of the notice required pursuant to this paragraph shall be sent to the Administrator through the appropriate regional office and to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction within the region where the stationary source will be constructed or modified.


(4) Public comments submitted in writing within 30 days of the date such information is made available shall be considered by the Director in making his final decision on the application.


(e) Approval—EPA is approving requests submitted by the State of Ohio on March 18, November 1, and November 15, 1994, for exemption from the requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the following counties in Ohio from the NO_X_ related general and transportation conformity provisions and nonattainment area NSR for new sources and modifications that are major for NO_X_: Clinton, Columbiana, Delaware, Franklin, Jefferson, Licking, Mahoning, Preble, Stark, and Trumbull. This approval also exempts the following counties in Ohio from the NO_X_ related general conformity provisions; nonattainment area NSR for new sources and modifications that are major for NO_X_; NO_X_ RACT; and a demonstration of compliance with the enhanced I/M performance standard for NO_X_: Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit. 


(f) Approval—USEPA is approving two exemption requests submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on September 20, 1993, and November 8, 1993, for the Toledo and Dayton ozone nonattainment areas, respectively, from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the Lucas, Wood, Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties from the requirements to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for major sources of nitrogen oxides (NO_X_), nonattainment area new source review (NSR) for new sources and modifications that are major for NO_X_, and the NO_X_-related requirements of the general and transportation conformity provisions. For the Dayton ozone nonattainment area, the Dayton local area has opted for an enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. Upon final approval of this exemption, the Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties shall not be required to demonstrate compliance with the enhanced I/M performance standard for NO_X_. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Toledo or Dayton area(s), the exemptions from the requirements of Section 182(f) of the Act in the applicable area(s) shall no longer apply.


(g) Approval—EPA is approving an exemption from the requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts Butler, Clermont, Hamilton, and Warren counties in Ohio from nonattainment NSR for new sources and modifications that are major for NO_X_.
