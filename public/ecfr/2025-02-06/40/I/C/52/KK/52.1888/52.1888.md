# ยง 52.1888   Operating permits.

Emission limitations and related provisions which are established in Ohio operating permits as federally enforceable conditions in accordance with Rule 3745-35-07 shall be enforceable by USEPA and by any person under section 304 of the Clean Air Act. USEPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures, and will be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures or permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements or the requirements of USEPA's underlying regulations.
