(72) On March 16, 1982, the State of Ohio submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan for TSP for the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant in Columbus, Ohio.


(73) On March 28, 1983, the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted amendments to the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745-21 and supporting data to USEPA as a proposed revision to the ozone portion of its SIP. OAC Chapter 3745-21, entitled “Carbon Monoxide, Photochemically Reactive Materials, Hydrocarbons, and Related Material Standards”, contains Ohio's VOC RACT I and II regulations. The amendments to these regulations are embodied in the OAC as follows: Definitions, Rule 3745-21-01; Attainment dates and compliance time schedules, Rule 3745-21-04; Control of emissions of organic compounds from stationary sources, Rule 3745-21-09; and Compliance test methods and procedures, Rule 3745-21-10. See (c)(15). USEPA is not taking action on the applicability of Rule 3745-21-09 to new sources of VOC, to the gasoline throughout exemption level for gasoline dispensing facilities, and to the compliance date extension for Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. auto and motorcycle assembly plant in Marysville. USEPA is not taking action on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(AA))(2)(a) which exempts any dry cleaning facility in which less than 60,000 pounds of fabrics are cleaned per year. USEPA is not taking action on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(U)(2)(f) (i) and (ii) which apply to new sources (surface coating lines). USEPA is identifying deficiencies in the existing Rule 3745-21-09(D)(3) which contains an alternative daily emission limitation for can coating facilities. USEPA identified the following deficiencies within this rule: This rule presents equations for determining an alternative daily emission limitation. USEPA finds that the equations are incorrect in that they are based on volume of coating used (in gallons, excluding water), which in many cases can lead to erroneous results. Equivalency calculations for coatings should be performed on a basis of volume of coating solids used rather than volume of coating used. (45 FR 80824 gives an example calculation for can coating done on a volume solids basis.)

(155) On March 11, 2011, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted Ohio's regional haze plan addressing the first implementation period of the regional haze rule requirements. This plan includes a long-term strategy with emission limits for mandating emission reductions equivalent to the reductions from implement best available retrofit technology and with emission reductions to provide Ohio's contribution toward achievement of reasonable progress goals at Class I areas affected by Ohio. The plan specifically satisfies BART requirements for non-EGUs, most notably by providing new, tighter emission limits for the P.H. Glatfelter facility in Ross County, Ohio. The plan establishes a combined daily sulfur dioxide emission limit of 24,930 pounds per day for boiler #7 and #8. The plan also includes permit number P0103673 that will impose these emission limitations on P.H. Glatfelter Company.
