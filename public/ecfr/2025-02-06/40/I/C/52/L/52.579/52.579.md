# ยง 52.579   Economic feasibility considerations.

Section 88-906(h), (i), (k), (o) and (q) of the Georgia Code is disapproved, since consideration of economic feasibility could, in some cases, conflict, with the requirements of the Act that primary standards be attained as expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later than July 1975.
