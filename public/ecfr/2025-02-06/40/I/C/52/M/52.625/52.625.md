# ยง 52.625   Legal authority.

(a) The requirements of ยง 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, since sections 322-64(5) and 322-66 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, sections 322-64(5) and 322-66 are disapproved.
