# § 52.675   Control strategy: Sulfur oxides—Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control Region.

(a)(1) Regulation R of the Rules and Regulations for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho, which is part of the sulfur dioxide (SO_2_) control strategy, is disapproved since it is inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of subpart G of this chapter. These requirements are not met by Regulation R in that the SO_2_ control strategy contained therein is not adequate for the attainment and maintenance of SO_2_ national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). 


(2) Rules 1-1801 through 1-1804 (Rules for Control of Sulfur Oxide Emissions from Sulfuric Acid Plants) of the “Rules and Regulations for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho” are inadequate to ensure attainment and maintenance of Sulfur Dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards in the Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control Region. Special limits have previously been established for certain existing acid plants in this Air Quality Control Region (§§ 52.670(c)(15) and 52.675(b)). Therefore, Rules 1-1801 through 1-1804 are approved except as they apply to existing acid plants with approved or promulgated emission limits that are more stringent than the limit found in 1-1802.


(b) Regulation for control of sulfur dioxide (SO_2_) emissions: Sulfuric Acid Plants. (1) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company's Minerals and Chemical Division, located in Power County, Idaho, in the Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control Region. 


(2) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company facility shall utilize best engineering techniques in the operation of their plant to prevent fugitive SO losses. Such techniques shall include but are not limited to: 


(i) Operating and maintaining all conducts, flues, and stacks in a leakfree condition. 


(ii) Operating and maintaining all process equipment and gas collection systems in such a fashion that leakage of SO_2_ gases will be prevented to the maximum extent possible. 


(3) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company facility shall limit SO_2_ emissions from their sulfuric acid plants per the following: 


(i) The combined SO_2_ emissions from the designated 100 and 200 sulfric acid plants shall not exceed 2 kilograms (kg) per metric ton (4 pounds per ton) of 100 percent sulfuric acid produced. 


(ii) The SO_2_ emissions from the designated 300 sulfuric acid plant and stack shall not exceed 994 kg per hour (2190 pounds per hour). 


(4) (i) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company shall achieve compliance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section in accordance with the following schedule: 


(A) Advise EPA as to status of contract(s) and construction schedules for pollution abatement projects within 30 days of the effective date of this regulation. 


(B) Attain final compliance by July 31, 1976. 


(ii) A performance test of the 300 acid plant shall be necessary to determine whether compliance has been achieved with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Such test must be completed within 15 days of the final compliance date specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. Notice must be given to the Administrator at least 10 days prior to such a test to afford him an opportunity to have an observer present. 


(iii) Within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the 100 and 200 acid plant will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial start-up of these plants and at such other times as may be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, the owner(s) and operator(s) of the facility shall conduct performance test(s) in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.8. 


(iv) If the owner(s) and operator(s) of the J. R. Simplot Company facility are presently in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section or in compliance with a portion of these requirements, such compliance shall be certified to the Administrator within 15 days following the date of the publication of these requirements as a final regulation in the _Federal Register._ If the owner(s) or operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company achieve compliance prior to July 31, 1976, such compliance shall be certified to the Administrator within 15 days of the date of achieving compliance. The Administrator may request whatever supporting information he considers necessary to determine the validity of the certification. 


(5) (i) By no later than September 30, 1976, the owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company facility shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate measurement system(s) for: 


(A) Continuously monitoring and recording SO_2_ concentration rates in each sulfuric acid plant discharge stack per the requirements of 40 CFR 60.13 and 60.84. 


(B) Continuously monitoring and recording gas volumetric flow rates in the exhaust stack of the designated 300 sulfuric acid plant. 


(ii) By no later than October 30, 1976, and at such other times following that date as the Administrator may specify, the SO_2_ concentration measurement system(s) and stack gas volumetric flow rate system(s) installed and used pursuant to this paragraph shall be demonstrated to meet the measurement system performance specifications prescribed in 40 CFR 60.13 and Appendix E to this part, respectively. The Administrator shall be notified at least 10 days prior to the start of this field test period to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. 


(iii) The sampling point for monitoring the concentration of SO_2_ emissions shall be in the duct at the centroid of the cross section of the discharge stack if the cross sectional area is less than 4.65 m
2 (50 ft
2) or at a point no closer to the wall than 0.91 m (3 ft) if the cross sectional area is 4.65 m
2 (50 ft
2) or more. The monitor sample point shall be representative of the average concentration in the duct. 


(iv) The measurement system(s) shall be maintained, operated and calibrated in accordance with the methods prescribed by the manufacturers.
