The 1990 VOC and NO_X_ emissions from the Basic Oxygen Furnace Shop (scrap preheating, ladle preheating and heaters) are 1.4 TPY and 39.6 TPY, respectively. The 1990 VOC and NO_X_ emissions from the Blast Furnace Casthouse are 205.4 TPY and 11.0 TPY, respectively.


(g)-(h) [Reserved]


(i) The 1990 VOC emission inventory for the Philadelphia ozone nonattainment area, submitted on September 12, 1996 by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, is approved, with the exception of the revisions to the emission inventory for those sources at United States Steel—Fairless that were approved in § 52.2036 (b) on April 9, 1996.


(j) EPA is approving Pennsylvania's request that the 1990 emissions inventory for VOCs from R.R. Donnelley & Sons—East Plant be corrected to accurately reflect the 1990 emissions. The 1990 baseyear VOC emissions inventory will be corrected to 864 tons. Justification for the change in VOC emissions is described as follows: 


(1) For rotogravure operations, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (East Plant) initially assumed a 5% retention of solvent in the web, and then revised their assumption to 2% based on the amount of solvent actually being recovered by the six bed carbon adsorption system. Based on VOC emissions data submitted to PADEP for the year 1990, the actual VOC emissions from rotogravure operations was 794.51 tons. The figures were taken from data submitted to PADEP from the facility dated May 6, 1996 (subsequently submitted to EPA from PADEP via letter dated December 13, 1996). 


(2) For heatset web offset lithographic operations, boilers, and associated solvent cleaning equipment, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company provided data calculating estimates for actual 1990 VOC emissions of 69.83 tons. The figures were taken from the facility's RACT proposal submitted to PADEP dated March 29, 1995. 


(k) Rockwell Heavy Vehicle, Inc., New Castle Forge Plant, Lawrence County—On April 8, 1998 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection requested that EPA include the CO, VOC and NO_X_ emissions from this facility in the 1990 base year emission inventory. The CO, VOC and NO_X_ emissions from the natural gas units and the spray booth of this facility are hereby approved as part of the 1990 point source inventory. The 1990 CO, VOC and NO_X_ emissions from the natural gas units are 8.3 TPY, 1.2 TPY and 64.2 TPY, respectively. The 1990 VOC emissions from the spray booth is 12.1 TPY.
