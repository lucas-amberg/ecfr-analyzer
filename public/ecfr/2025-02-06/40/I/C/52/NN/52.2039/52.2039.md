The EPA has made a finding pursuant to section 126 of the Clean Air Act (the Act) that emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO_2_) from the Portland Generating Station in Northampton County, Upper Mount Bethel Township, Pennsylvania (Portland) significantly contribute to nonattainment and interfere with maintenance of the 1-hour SO_2_ national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) in New Jersey. The owners and operators of Portland shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.


(a) The owners and operators of Portland shall not, at any time later than one year after the effective date of the section 126 finding, emit SO_2_ (as determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter) in excess of 6,253 pounds per hour (lb/hr) for unit 1 (identified with source ID 031 in Title V Permit No. 48-0006) and unit 2 (identified with source ID 032 in Title V Permit No. 48-0006) combined;


(b) The owners and operators of Portland shall not, at any time later than three years after the effective date of the section 126 finding, emit SO_2_ (as determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter) in excess of the following limits:


(1) 1,105 lb/hr and 0.67 pounds per million British Thermal Unit (lb/mmBtu) for unit 1; and


(2) 1,691 lb/hr and 0.67 lb/mmBtu for unit 2.


(c) The owners and operators of Portland shall comply with the following requirements:


(1) Perform air modeling to demonstrate that, starting no later than three years after the effective date of the section 126 finding, emissions from Portland will not significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 1-hour SO_2_ NAAQS in New Jersey, in accordance with the following requirements:


(i) No later than six months after the effective date of the section 126 finding, submit to the EPA a modeling protocol that is consistent with the EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models, as codified at 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix W, and that includes all units at the Portland Generating Station in the modeling.


(ii) Within 15 business days of receipt of a notice from the EPA of any deficiencies in the modeling protocol under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, submit to the EPA a revised modeling protocol to correct any deficiencies identified in such notice.


(iii) No later than one year after the effective date of the section 126 finding, submit to the EPA a modeling analysis, performed in accordance with the modeling protocol under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, for the compliance methods identified in the notice required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(2) No later than one year after the effective date of the section 126 finding, submit to the EPA the compliance method selected by the owners and operators of Portland to achieve the emissions limits in paragraph (b) of this section.


(3) Starting six months after the effective date of the section 126 finding and continuing every six months until three years after the effective date of the section 126 finding, submit to the EPA progress reports on the implementation of the methods to achieve compliance with emissions limits in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, including status of design, technology selection, development of technical specifications, awarding of contracts, construction, shakedown, and compliance demonstrations as applicable. These reports shall include:


(i) An interim project report, no later than one year after the effective date of the section 126 finding, that demonstrates compliance with the emission limit in paragraph (a) of this section.


(ii) A final project report, submitted no later than 60 days after three years after the effective date of the section 126 finding, that demonstrates compliance with the emission limits in paragraph (b) of this section and that includes at least one month of SO_2_ emission data from Portland's continuous SO_2_ emission monitor, and that includes the date when full operation of controls was achieved at Portland after shakedown.


(4) The requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this section shall not apply if the notice required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section indicates that the owners and operators of Portland have decided to completely and permanently cease operation of unit 1 and unit 2 as the method of compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) and with section 126 of the Act.


(d) Compliance with the lb/mmBtu limitations in paragraph (b) of this section is determined on a 30 boiler operating day rolling average basis. Boiler operating day for the purposes of this paragraph means a 24-hour period between midnight and the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted in the units identified in paragraph (a) of this section.
