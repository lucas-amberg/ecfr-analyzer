(B) *Specific requirements.* The capture efficiency of a process line shall be measured using one of the four protocols given below. Any error margin associated with a test protocol may not be incorporated into the results of a capture efficiency test.

(*2*) If any changes are made to capture or control equipment, then the source is required to notify USEPA of these changes and a new test may be required by USEPA.


(*3*) The source must notify the Administrator 30 days prior to performing any capture efficiency or control test. At that time, the source must notify the Administrator which capture efficiency protocol and control device test methods will be used.


(*4*) Sources utilizing a PTE must demonstrate that this enclosure meets the requirement given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this section) for a PTE during any testing of their control device.


(*5*) Sources utilizing a TTE must demonstrate that their TTE meets the requirements given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this section) for a TTE during testing of their control device. The source must also provide documentation that the quality assurance criteria for a TTE have been achieved.

In those cases in which the overall efficiency is being determined for an entire line, the capture efficiency used to calculate the product of the capture and control efficiency is the total capture efficiency over the entire line.


(B) For coating lines which are both chosen by the owner or operator to comply with paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv), (e)(2)(v), or (e)(2)(vi) of this section by the alternative in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section and meet the criteria allowing them to comply with paragraph (e)(2) of this section instead of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the overall efficiency of the capture system and control device, as determined by the test methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(4) (iii), (iv) and (v)(A) of this section, shall be no less than the equivalent overall efficiency which shall be calculated by the following equation:

(b)-(c) [Reserved]


(d) *Solvent cleaning*—(1) *Solvent cleaning in general.* The requirements of subpart E (sections 215.182-215.184) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742) shall apply to all cold cleaning, open top vapor degreasing, and conveyorized degreasing operations.


(2) *Compliance schedule.* Every owner or operator of an emission source which was previously exempt from the requirements of subpart E (sections 215.182-215.184) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742) because it satisfied the criteria in either (d)(a)(i) or (d)(2)(ii) of this section, shall comply with the requirements of subpart E (sections 215.182-215.184) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742) on and after July 1, 1991. A source which did not satisfy the criteria in either (d)(a)(i) or (d)(2)(ii) of this section, shall comply with the requirements of subpart E (sections 215.182-215.184) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742) upon promulgation.


(i) If emissions of VOM exceed neither 6.8 kg (15 lbs) in any one day, nor 1.4 kg (3 lbs) in any one hour, or


(ii) If the source is used exclusively for chemical or physical analysis or for determination of product quality and commercial acceptance, provided that the operation of the source is not an integral part of the production process, the emissions of VOM from the source do not exceed 363 kg (800 lbs) in any calendar month, and the exemption had been approved in writing by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

(e) *Coating operations*—(1) *Emission limitations for manufacturing plants.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no owner or operator of a coating line shall apply at any time any coating in which the VOM content exceeds the following emission limitations for the specified coating. The following emission limitations are expressed in units of VOM per volume of coating (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) as applied at each coating applicator, except where noted. Compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM should be treated as water for the purpose of calculating the “less water” part of the coating composition. Compliance with this paragraph must be demonstrated through the applicable coating analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section. As an alternative to compliance with this paragraph, the owner or operator of a coating line may meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The equation presented in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section shall be used to calculate emission limitations for determining compliance by add-on controls, credits for transfer efficiency, emissions trades and cross-line averaging.


(ii) *Daily-weighted average limitations.* No owner or operator of a coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and complying by means of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section shall operate the subject coating line unless the owner or operator has demonstrated compliance with paragraph (e)(1) (ii)(A), (ii)(B), (ii)(C), (ii)(D), (ii)(E) or (ii)(F) of this section (depending upon the source category) through the applicable coating analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section.


(A) No owner or operator of a coating line subject to only one of the limitations from among paragraph (e)(1) (i)(A)(*1*), (i)(A)(*2*), (i)(A)(*4*), (i)(C), (i)(D), (i)(E), (i)(F), (i)(G), (i)(H), or (i)(I) of this section shall apply coating on any such coating line, during any day, whose daily-weighted average VOM content exceeds the emission limitation to which the coatings are subject.


(B) No owner or operator of a miscellaneous metal parts and products coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(J) of this section shall apply coatings to miscellaneous metal parts or products on the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) (*1*) or (*2*) of this section are met.


(*1*) For each coating line which applies multiple coatings, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(J) of this section, during the same day (*e.g.,* all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), the daily-weighted average VOM content shall not exceed the coating VOM content limit corresponding to the category of coating used, or


(*2*) For each coating line which applies coatings from more than one of the four coating categories in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(J) of this section, during the same day, the owner or operator shall submit to and receive approval from the Administrator for a site-specific FIP revision.

(*1*) An alternative daily emission limitation shall be determined according to paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section. Actual daily emissions shall never exceed the alternative daily emission limitation and shall be calculated by use of the following equation.


(*2*) The alternative daily emission limitation (A_d_) shall be determined on a daily basis as follows:


(D) No owner or operator of a heavy off-highway vehicle products coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(K) of this section shall apply coatings to heavy off-highway vehicle products on the subject coating line unless the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(D) (*1*) or (*2*) of this section are met.


(*1*) For each coating line which applies multiple coatings, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(K) of this section, during the same day (*e.g.,* all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), the daily-weighted average VOM content shall not exceed the coating VOM content limit corresponding to the category of coating used, or


(*2*) For each coating line which applies coatings subject to more than one numerical emission limitation in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(K) of this section, during the same day, the owner or operator shall submit to and receive approval from the Administrator for a site-specific FIP revision. To receive approval, the requirements of USEPA's Emissions Trading Policy Statement (and related policy) must be satisfied.


(E) No owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section shall apply coatings to wood furniture on the subject coating line unless the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(E) (*1*) or (*2*) of this section, in addition to the requirements specified in the note to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section, are met.


(*1*) For each coating line which applies multiple coatings, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section, during the same day (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.67 kg/l [5.6 lbs/gal]), the daily-weighted average VOM content shall not exceed the coating VOM content limit corresponding to the category of coating used, or


(*2*) For each coating line which applies coatings subject to more than one numerical emission limitation in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section, during the same day, the owner or operator shall submit to and receive approval from the Administrator for a site-specific FIP revision. To receive approval, the requirements of USEPA's Emissions Trading Policy Statement (and related policy) must be satisfied.


(F) No owner or operator of an existing diesel-electric locomotive coating line in Cook County, subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(M) of this section shall apply coatings to diesel-electric locomotives on the subject coating line unless the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(F) (*1*) or (*2*) of this section are met.

(iii) Limitations in terms of kg (lbs) of VOM emissions per l (gal) of solids as applied at each coating applicator shall be determined by the following equation:


(2) *Alternative emission limitations.* Any owner or operator of a coating line subject to paragraph (e)(1) of this section may comply with this paragraph, rather than with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if a capture system and control device are operated at all times and the owner or operator demonstrates compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of this section (depending upon the source category) through the applicable coating analysis and capture system and control device efficiency test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section; and the control device is equipped with the applicable monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section and the monitoring equipment is installed, calibrated, operated and maintained according to vendor specifications at all times the control device is in use. The use of a capture system and control device, which does not demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), or (vii), may only be used as an alternative to compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section if approved as a FIP revision.


(i) *Alternative add-on control methodologies.* (A) The coating line is equipped with a capture system and control device that provides 81 percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from the coating line and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency, or


(B) The system used to control VOM from the coating line is demonstrated to have an overall efficiency sufficient to limit VOM emissions to no more than what is allowed under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Use of any control system other than an afterburner, carbon absorption, condensation, or absorption scrubber system can only be allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Transfer efficiency credits can only be allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Baseline transfer efficiencies and transfer efficiency test methods must be approved by the Administrator.


Such overall efficiency is to be determined as follows:


(*1*) Obtain the emission limitation from the appropriate paragraph in (e)(1) of this section,


(*2*) Calculate “S” according to the equation in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section,


(*3*) Calculate the overall efficiency required according to paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section. For the purposes of calculating this value, according to the equation in (a)(4)(v)(B) of this section VOM_1_ is equal to the value of “S” as determined above in (i)(B)(*2*).


(ii) No owner or operator of a coating line subject to only one of the emission limitations from among paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A)(*1*), (e)(1)(i)(A)(*2*), (e)(1)(i)(A)(*4*), (e)(1)(i)(C), (e)(1)(i)(D), (e)(1)(i)(E), (e)(1)(i)(F), (e)(1)(i)(G), (e)(1)(i)(H), or (e)(1)(i)(I) of this section and equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met. No owner or operator of a coating line subject to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A)(*3*) of this section and equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the coating line unless the owner or operator demonstrates compliance with the topcoat limitation in accordance with the topcoat protocol for automobile or light-duty trucks referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.


(iii) No owner or operator of a miscellaneous metal parts and products coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(J) of this section (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met.


(iv) No owner or operator of a heavy off-highway vehicle products coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(K) of this section (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met.


(v) No owner or operator of an existing diesel-electric locomotive coating line in Cook County which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(M) of this section (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gals]), and which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met.


(vi) No owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) (*e.g.,* all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.67 kg/l [5.6 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met. If compliance is achieved by meeting the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, then the provisions in the note to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section must also be met.


(vii) No owner or operator of a can coating facility and equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating facility unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(vii) (A) or (B) of this section are met.


(A) An alternative daily emission limitation shall be determined according to paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section. Actual daily emissions shall never exceed the alternative daily emission limitation and shall be calculated by use of the following equation:


(B) The coating line is equipped with a capture system and control device that provide 75 percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from the coating line and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency.


(3) *Exemptions from emission limitations*—(i) *Exemptions for all source categories except wood furniture coating.* The limitations of paragraph (e) of this section shall not apply to coating lines within a facility, that otherwise would be subject to the same subparagraph of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (because they belong to the same source category, e.g. can coating), provided that combined actual emissions of VOM from all lines at the facility subject to that subparagraph never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices. (For example, can coating lines within a plant would not be subject to the limitations of subparagraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section if the combined actual emissions of VOM from the can coating lines never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices.) Volatile organic material emissions from heavy off-highway vehicle products coating lines must be combined with VOM emissions from miscellaneous metal parts and products coating lines to determine applicability. Any owner or operator of a coating facility shall comply with the applicable coating analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section if total VOM emissions from the subject coating lines are always less than or equal to 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices and, therefore, are not subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Once a category of coating lines at a facility is subject to the limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the coating lines are always subject to the limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(ii) *Applicability for wood furniture coating.* (A) The limitations of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to a plant's wood furniture coating lines if the plant contains process emission sources, not regulated by paragraphs (d), (e) (excluding paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L)), (h) (excluding paragraph (h)(5)), (i), (j), or (q)(1), or subparts B, Q (excluding sections 215.432 and 215.436), R (excluding sections 215.447, 215.450, and 215.452), S, V, X, Y (sections 215.582-215.584), or Z of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742), which as a group both:


(*1*) Have maximum theoretical emissions of 91 Mg (100 tons) or more per calendar year of VOM if no air pollution control equipment were used, and


(*2*) Are not limited to less than 91 Mg (100 tons) of VOM per calendar year if no air pollution control equipment were used, through production or capacity limitations contained in a federally enforceable construction permit or SIP or FIP version.


(B) If a plant ceases to fulfill the criteria of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section shall continue to apply to any wood furniture coating line which was ever subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section.


(C) For the purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, an emission source shall be considered regulated by a subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if it is subject to the limitations of that subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph. An emission source is not considered regulated by a subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if its emissions are below the applicability cutoff level or if the source is covered by an exemption.


(D) Any owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line to which the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section are not applicable due to the criteria in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall, upon request by the Administrator, submit records to the Administrator within 30 calendar days from the date of the request that document that the coating line is exempt from the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section.


(4) *Exemption from general rule on use of organic material.* No owner or operator of a coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section is required to meet the limitations of subpart K (section 215.301 or 215.302) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742), after the date by which the coating line is required to meet paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(5) *Compliance schedule.* Except as specified in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, every owner or operator of a coating line (of a type included within paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section) shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1),(e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section and paragraph (e)(6) of this section in accordance with the appropriate compliance schedule as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(i),(ii),(iii) or (iv) of this section. 


(i) No owner or operator of a coating line which is exempt from the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section because of the criteria in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section shall operate said coating line on or after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied with, and continues to comply with, paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section. Wood furniture coating lines are not subject to paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section. 


(ii) No owner or operator of a coating line complying by means of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall operate said coating line on or after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied with, and continues to comply with, paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(6)(ii) of this section. 


(iii) No owner or operator of a coating line complying by means of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section shall operate said coating line on or after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied with, and continues to comply with, paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(6)(iii) of this section. 


(iv) No owner or operator of a coating line complying by means of paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall operate said coating line on or after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied with, and continues to comply with, paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(6)(iv) of this section. 


(6) *Recordkeeping and reporting.* The VOM content of each coating and the efficiency of each capture system and control device shall be determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to establish the records required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section.


(i) Any owner or operator of a coating line which is exempted from the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section because of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section shall comply with the following:


(A) By July 1, 1991, the owner or operator of a facility referenced in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section shall certify to the Administrator that the facility is exempt under the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. Such certification shall include:


(*1*) A declaration that the facility is exempt from the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section because of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section; and

(v) Any record showing a violation of paragraph (x)(13)(i) or (x)(13)(ii) of this section shall be reported by sending a copy of such record to the Administrator within 30 days of the violation.


(vi) To determine compliance with paragraphs (x)(13)(i) and (x)(13)(ii) of this section and to establish the records required under paragraph (x)(13)(iv) of this section the VOM content of each ink and miscellaneous VOM containing material shall be determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.


(14) The control and recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as the test methods in this paragraph, apply to the power-operated silk screen presses, the hand screen presses, the screen adhesive printing lines, the Andreotti rotogravure press, the Halley Rotogravure press, and the Viking press at the American Decal and Manufacturing Company's plant in Chicago, Illinois, instead of the requirements in paragraphs (h) and (x)(1) through (x)(5) of this section. The emissions from the sources listed above (in paragraph (x)(14) of this section) are to be included in the calculation of “maximum theoretical emissions” for determining applicability for any other sources (for which applicability is based on the quantity of maximum theoretical emissions) at American Decal and Manufacturing Company's Chicago plant not included in paragraph (x)(14) of this section. 


(i) After July 24, 1992, no inks, coatings, thinner, clean-up material or other VOC-containing material shall at any time be applied, at the presses/printing lines listed above (in paragraph (x)(14) of this section), which exceed the VOC content (in percent by weight VOC) limit established below. After July 24, 1992, the yearly usage (in weight of material applied) of ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material, shall not exceed the applicable pounds per year limit established below. The yearly weight of ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material is to be calculated according to the procedure in paragraph (x)(14)(ii) of this section. 


(ii) The yearly weight of material used is to be calculated as follows: 


(A) Compute the weight of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material used each month by the 15th of the following month. 


(B) By the 15th of each month, add the monthly usage (in pounds) for each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material for the twelve previous months (to obtain the yearly weight of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material used). A comparison of these yearly usage levels (in pounds) with purchase records must be made to ensure the accuracy of the monthly usage levels (in pounds) obtained to satisfy paragraph (x)(14)(ii)(A) of this section. 


(iii) Beginning on August 1, 1992, the owner and operator of the American Decal and Manufacturing Company plant in Chicago, Illinois, shall keep the following records for each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material for each month. All records shall be kept by the American Decal and Manufacturing Company for 3 years and shall be made available to the Administrator on request: 


(A) The name and identification number of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material as applied or used. 


(B) The weight percent VOC of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and each other VOC-containing material as applied or used each month. 


(C) The as applied weight of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material used each month. 


(iv) Any record showing a violation of paragraph (x)(14)(i) of this section after October 20, 1995 shall be reported by sending a copy of such record to the Administrator within 30 days of the violation. 


(v) To determine compliance with paragraph (x)(14)(i) of this section and to establish the records required under paragraph (x)(14)(iii) of this section, the weight percent VOC of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material shall be determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Any material reported to be 100 percent VOC does not have to be tested for weight percent VOC. 


(y) *Recordkeeping and reporting for non-CTG sources*—(1) *Exempt emission sources.* Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator of an emission source which is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (u), (v), (w), (x), or (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall submit records to the Administrator within 30 calendar days from the date of the request that document that the emission source is exempt from those requirements.
