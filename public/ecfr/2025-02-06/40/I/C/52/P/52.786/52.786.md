(h) The State's December 2, 1992, commitment to timely adopt and implement enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) rules for Lake and Porter Counties is disapproved based on the failure of the State of Indiana to meet important milestones pertaining to the development and adoption of necessary authority for the I/M program. This disapproval initiates the sanction process of section 179(a) of the Act.
