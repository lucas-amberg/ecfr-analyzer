# ยง 52.2126   VOC rule deficiency correction.

Sections I and II of South Carolina's Regulations 62.1 and 62.5 is approved. The State submitted these regulations to EPA for approval on September 18, 1990. Sections I and II of Regulation 62.5 were intended to correct deficiencies cited in a letter calling for the State to revise its SIP for ozone from Mr. Greer C. Tidwell, the EPA Regional Administrator, to Governor Carroll A. Campbell on May 26, 1988, and clarified in a letter from Mr. Winston A. Smith, EPA Region IV, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, to Mr. Otto E. Pearson, former Director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control:


(a) South Carolina's VOC regulations contain no method for determining capture efficiency. This deficiency must be corrected after EPA publishes guidance on the methods for determining capture efficiency before the SIP for ozone can be fully approved. 


(b) [Reserved]
