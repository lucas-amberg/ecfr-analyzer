# ยง 52.2183   Variance provision.

The revisions to the variance provisions in Chapter 74:26:01:31.01 of the South Dakota Air Pollution Control Program, which were submitted by the Governor's designee on September 25, 1991, are disapproved because they are inconsistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits any state or EPA from granting a variance from any requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to a stationary source.
