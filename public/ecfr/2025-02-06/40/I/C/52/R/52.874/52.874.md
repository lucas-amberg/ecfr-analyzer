# § 52.874   Legal authority.

(a) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met since authority to make emission data available to the public is inadequate. Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3015 would require confidential treatment if the data related to processes or production unique to the owner or would tend to affect adversely the competitive position of the owner.


(b) The requirements of § 51.232(b) of this chapter are not met since the following deficiencies exist in the local agency legal authority:


(1) *Kansas City, Kans.-Wyandotte County Health Department.* (i) Authority to make emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated local air quality conservation authority with the same authority as the State (§ 51.230(f) of this chapter).


(2) *Topeka-Shawnee County Health Department.* (i) Authority to make emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated air quality conservation authority with the same authority as the State (§ 51.230(f) of this chapter).


(3) *Wichita-Sedgwick County Health Department.* (i) Authority to make emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated local air quality conservation authority with the same authority as the State (§ 51.230(f) of this chapter).


(c) The requirements of § 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not adequate.
