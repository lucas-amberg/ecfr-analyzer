The obligation to comply with such requirements will be eliminated with regard to sources and units in the State by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Kansas' State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the CSAPR Federal Implementation Plan under ยง 52.39 for those sources and units, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional.
