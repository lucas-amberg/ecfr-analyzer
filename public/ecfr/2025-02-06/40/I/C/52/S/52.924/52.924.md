# ยง 52.924   Legal authority.

(a) The requirements of ยง 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met since K.R.S. 224.380 of the Air Pollution Control Law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (June 18, 1970) does not provide for the release, under certain circumstances, of emission data to the public.


(b) Delegation of Authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, Kentucky requested a delegation of authority to enable it to collect, correlate, and release emission data to the public. The Administrator has determined that Kentucky is qualified to receive a delegation of the authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator delegates to Kentucky his authority under section 114(a) (1) and (2) and section 114(c) of the Act, i.e., authority to collect, correlate, and release emission data to the public.
