The revised SO_2_ emission limit for large coal-fired boilers in Bell, Clark, and Woodford Counties, submitted on June 29, 1979, is disapproved since it does not provide for attainment and maintenance of all SO_2_ NAAQS. The limit approved by EPA on May 10, 1976 (41 FR 19105), remains the limit applicable to these sources.
