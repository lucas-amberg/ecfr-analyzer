# § 52.2305   What are the requirements of the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to issue permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements to sources that emit greenhouse gases?

(a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not met to the extent the plan, as approved, for Texas does not apply with respect to emissions of the pollutant GHGs from certain stationary sources. Therefore, the provisions of § 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are hereby made a part of the plan for Texas for:


(1) Beginning on May 1, 2011, the pollutant GHGs from stationary sources described in § 52.21(b)(49)(iv), and


(2) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the pollutant GHGs from sources described under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, stationary sources described in § 52.21(b)(49)(v).


(b) For purposes of this section, the “pollutant GHGs” refers to the pollutant GHGs, as described in § 52.21(b)(49)(i).


(c) [Reserved]


(d) The authority provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is rescinded except in the three limited circumstances described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section:


(1) The EPA will retain permitting authority for all GHG PSD permit applications for major sources and major modifications required to obtain PSD permits because of emissions of pollutants other than GHGs submitted to the EPA where the permit applicant submitted a written request by May 15, 2014, that the EPA continue processing the application.


(2) The EPA will retain permitting authority for all GHG PSD permit applications for major sources and major modifications required to obtain PSD permits because of emissions of pollutants other than GHGs submitted to the EPA after February 18, 2014, unless and until the applicant submits to the EPA a written request to transfer the permitting authority to TCEQ (or withdraws the application) prior to issuance of a final permit decision under 40 CFR 124.15(b).


(3) The EPA will retain permitting authority for GHG PSD permits issued by the EPA for major sources and major modifications required to obtain PSD permits because of emissions of pollutants other than GHGs and GHG PSD permit applications denied by the EPA for major sources and major modifications required to obtain PSD permits because of emissions of pollutants other than GHGs for which either the time for filing an administrative appeal has not expired or all administrative and judicial appeals processes have not been completed by November 10, 2014. Except that the EPA will not retain authority over a permit if an applicant submits a written request to the EPA to withdraw the permit application while an administrative appeal is pending and the Regional Administrator then withdraws the permit under 40 CFR 124.19(j) or the Environmental Appeals Board grants a voluntary remand under 40 CFR 124.19(j) or another appropriate remedy.
