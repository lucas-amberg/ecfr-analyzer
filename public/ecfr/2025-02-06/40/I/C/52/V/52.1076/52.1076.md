(l) EPA approves the following mobile budgets of the Baltimore area attainment plan: 


(1) [Reserved] 


(2) Similarly, EPA is approving the 2005 attainment demonstration and its current budgets because Maryland has provided an enforceable commitment to submit new budgets as a SIP revision to the attainment plan consistent with any new measures submitted to fill any shortfall, if the new additional control measures affect on-road motor vehicle emissions. 


(m) EPA approves the State of Maryland's revised 1990 and the 2005 VOC and NO_X_ highway mobile emissions inventories and the 2005 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the one-hour ozone attainment plans for the Baltimore severe ozone nonattainment area and the Cecil County portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe ozone nonattainment area. These revisions were submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment on September 2, 2003. Submission of these revised MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions inventories was a requirement of EPA's approval of the attainment demonstration under paragraphs (h) and (k) of this section.


(n) EPA approves revisions to the Maryland State Implementation Plan for Post-1996 Rate of Progress (ROP) Plans for the Baltimore severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions were submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on December 23, 2003 and consist of the following: 


(1) Revisions to the base year 1990 emissions inventory which reflect the use of the MOBILE6 motor vehicle emissions model. These revisions establish motor vehicle emissions inventories for 1990 of 165.14 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 228.21 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen (NO_X_). 


(2) Revisions to the year 2005 motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for transportation conformity purposes, reflecting the use of the MOBILE6 motor vehicle emissions model. These revisions establish a motor vehicle emissions budget of 55 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 144.5 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen (NO_X_). EPA approved new 2005 MOBILE6-based MVEBs for the Baltimore area's 1-hour ozone attainment demonstration on October 27, 2003 (68 FR 61106). Those MVEBs became effective on November 26, 2003. The approved 2005 attainment plan MVEBs budgets are 55.3 tons per day of VOC and 146.9 tons per day of NO_X_. The MVEBs of the 2005 ROP plan are less than the MVEBs in the approved attainment demonstration. These more restrictive MVEBs, contained in the ROP plan, are the applicable MVEBs to be used in transportation conformity demonstrations for the year 2005 for the Baltimore area. 


(3) Revisions to the 2005 ROP plan to reallocate some of the contingency measures established in prior SIP revisions to the control measures portion of the plan. EPA guidance allows states an additional year to adopt new contingency measures to replace those reallocated to the control measures portion of the plan. The State of Maryland's December 23, 2003 SIP revision submittal includes an enforceable commitment to replace those contingency measures reallocated to the control measures portion of the 2005 ROP plan and to submit these additional contingency measures by October 31, 2004.


(o) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2003 to 2005, EPA has determined that the Washington, DC severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined that the Washington, DC severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.


(p) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2003 to 2005, EPA has determined that that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.

The maintenance plan includes two sets of VOC and NO_X_ MVEBs: The MVEBs without transportation buffers are effective as EPA has determined them adequate for transportation conformity purposes; the MVEBs with transportation buffers will be used only as needed in situations where the conformity analysis must be based on different data, models, or planning assumptions, including, but not limited to, updates to demographic, land use, or project-related assumptions, than were used to create the set of MVEBs without transportation buffers. The technical analyses used to demonstrate compliance with the MVEBs and the need, if any, to use transportation buffers will be fully documented in the conformity analysis and follow the Transportation Planning Board's (TPB) interagency consultation procedures.


(ff) The EPA has determined that the Baltimore, Maryland Moderate nonattainment area attained the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards by the applicable attainment date of July 20, 2018, based upon complete quality-assured and certified data for the calendar years 2015-2017.


(gg) EPA is disapproving Maryland's October 16, 2019, State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision intended to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) interstate transport requirements for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS).


(hh) EPA approves updates to the 2008 8-Hour Ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) maintenance plan for the Maryland portion of the Washington, DC-MD-VA 2008 8-Hour Ozone NAAQS Maintenance Area. The updates include revised motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) and updates to the applicable onroad and nonroad mobile emissions for VOC and NO_X_ for the years 2025 and 2030. EPA also approves the allocation of a portion of the safety margins for VOC and NO_X_ in the ozone maintenance plan to the 2025 and 2030 MVEBs. The revised MVEBs for VOC and NO_X_ applies to all future transportation conformity determinations and analyses for the entire Washington, DC-MD-VA Maintenance Area for the 2008 8-Hour Ozone NAAQS.
