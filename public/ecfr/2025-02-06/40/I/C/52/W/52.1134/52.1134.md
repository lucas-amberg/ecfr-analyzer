(2) Vehicles owned by residents of Cambridge that are registered in and parked within Cambridge and display an appropriate parking sticker issued by the City of Cambridge;


(3) Vehicles owned and operated by handicapped persons with HP license plates; and


(4) Vehicles registered as “commercial vehicles” by the Commonwealth and displaying appropriate license plates.


(d) On or before June 30, 1974, no owner or operator of a motor vehicle shall park, or permit the on-street parking of, said vehicle within Cambridge or Boston proper except in conformity with the provisions of this section and the measures implementing it.


(e) The Governor and the chief executive of any other governmental entity on which obligations are imposed by paragraph (b) of this section should, on or before April 15, 1974, submit to the Regional Administrator for his approval a detailed statement of the legal and administrative steps selected to effect the prohibition provided for in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, and a schedule of implementation consistent with the requirements of this section. Such schedule shall include as a minimum the following:

(f) Upon a finding that substantial hardship would otherwise be experienced by employees of employment facilities located in Cambridge, the Director of Traffic and Parking of the City of Cambridge may issue special parking stickers to such employees which shall entitle vehicles to park during the hours of the ban. Such stickers shall be valid only for those streets and areas of streets clearly identified on the face of such stickers, shall be issued with preference being given to carpools and vanpools and shall be subject to immediate revocation if the vehicle is cited for a parking violation on a street or area other than those designated. A list of all persons receiving such stickers shall be sent to the Regional Administrator on or before July 1 of each year.


(g) The ban shall not apply to any street space which is subject to metered parking with a maximum allowable time limit of one hour.
