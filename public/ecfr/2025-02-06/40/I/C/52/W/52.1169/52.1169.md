# § 52.1169   Stack height review.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited dispersion technique as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as revised on July 8, 1985. This declaration was submitted to EPA on April 8, 1986. The commonwealth has further declared in a letter from Bruce K. Maillet, dated June 24, 1986, that, “[A]s part of our new source review activities under the Massachusetts SIP and our delegated PSD authority, the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering will follow EPA's stack height regulations, as revised in the _Federal Register_ on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892).” Thus, the Commonwealth has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.
