(i) *Compliance demonstration.* Alcoa must determine SO_2_ emissions, on a calendar month basis using the following formulas:


(A) The carbon ratio is the calendar month average of tons of baked anodes consumed per ton of aluminum produced as determined using the baked anode consumption and aluminum production records required in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.


(B) The % sulfur in baked anodes is the calendar month average sulfur content as determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(ii) *NO*_X_*emission factor development.* By September 9, 2014, Alcoa must submit to the EPA a plan for testing NO_X_ emissions from Potline 5 and developing an emission factor in terms of pounds of NO_X_ per ton of aluminum produced. This plan must include testing NO_X_ emissions from both the Gas Treatment Center stack and the potline roof vents along with measurements of volumetric flow and aluminum production such that mass emissions can be determined and correlated with aluminum production. Within 90 days after the EPA approval of the plan, Alcoa shall conduct the testing and submit the resultant emission factor to the EPA at the address listed in paragraph (i)(5) of this section.


(iii) *NO*_X_*emission limit.* NO_X_ emission limit in tons per calendar month = (the emission factor determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, in pounds of NO_X_ per ton of aluminum produced) × (5546.2 tons of aluminum per month)/(2000 pounds per ton).

(i) *Compliance demonstration.* The weighted monthly average sulfur content of coke used in manufacturing shall be calculated as follows:


(ii) *Emission monitoring.* Alcoa must test each shipment of coke for sulfur content using ASTM Method D6376 or an alternative method approved by the EPA Region 10. Written documentation from the coke supplier certifying the sulfur content is an approved alternative method.


(2) *Particulate matter (PM) emission limit.* Starting November 10, 2014, the PM emissions from the anode bake furnaces stack must not exceed 0.01 grains per dry standard cubic foot of exhaust gas.


(3) *Nitrogen oxides**(NO*_X_*) emission limit.* Starting November 10, 2014, the anode bake furnaces must only combust natural gas.

(ii) *Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) Nitrogen oxides (NO*_X_*) emission limit for an approved alternative fuel.* Compliance with a Best Available Control Technology (BACT) emission limit for NO_X_ for the anode bake furnaces, established in a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit issued pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21 or pursuant to an EPA-approved PSD program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 51.166, shall be deemed to be compliance with BART for a fuel other than natural gas.


(d) *Best available retrofit technology (BART) emission limitations for Ingot Furnace 1 (IP-1), Ingot Furnace 2 (IP-2), and Ingot Furnace 11 (IP-11)*—(1) *Particulate matter (PM) emission limits.* Starting November 10, 2014, the PM emissions from each of ingot furnaces IP-1, IP-2, and IP-11 must not exceed 0.1 grains per dry standard cubic foot of exhaust gas.
