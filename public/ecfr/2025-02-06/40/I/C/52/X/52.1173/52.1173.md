(5) Rule 336.1350—The State adopts and submits an acceptable inspection method for determining compliance with the rule.


(6) Rule 336.1352—The State adopts and submits the following clarifications to the rule: (a) The rule regulates emissions from the receiving car itself during the pushing operation; (b) in the phrase “eight consecutive trips,” “consecutive” is defined as “consecutively observed trips”; (c) the word “trips” is defined as “trips per battery” or “trips per system”; (d) the 40% opacity fugitive emissions limitation refers to an instantaneous reading and not an average; (e) the method of reading opacity is defined.


(7) Rule 336.1353—The State adopts and submits: (a) An acceptable test methodology for determining compliance with the rule; and (b) a clarification that the exception to the visible emission prohibition of 4% of standpipe emission points refers to “operating” ovens.


(8) Rule 336.1356—The State adopts and submits a clarification of the test methodology to determine compliance with the rule.


(9) Rule 336.1357—The State adopts and submits a clarification of the test methodology to determine compliance with the rule.


(10) The State adopts and submits a regulation reflecting RACT for coke battery combustion stacks.


(11) The State adopts and submits an acceptable test method for application of Rule 336.1331, Table 32 to quench towers, or, in the alternative, adopts and submits a limitation reflecting RACT for quench tower emissions based on the quantity of total dissolved solids in the quench water.


(12) The State adopts and submits rules requiring RACT for scarfing emissions.


(13) Part 10 Testing—The State adopts and submits the following clarifications to the test methods: (a) Testing of fugitive emissions from blast furnaces are conducted during the cast; (b) the starting and ending period is specified for basic oxygen furnaces (for both primary and secondary emissions generating operations), electric arc furnaces and for each of the three emission points at sinter plants.


(14) The State conducts additional particulate studies in the Detroit area by September, 1980.


(c) *Disapprovals.* EPA disapproves the following specific revisions to the Michigan Plan:


(1) The State submitted Consent Order No. 16-1982 on June 24, 1982, Great Lakes Steel, a Division of the National Steel Corporation as a revision to the Michigan State Implementation Plan. EPA disapproves this revision, because it does not satisfy all the requirements of EPA's proposed Emission Trading Policy Statement of April 7, 1982 (47 FR 15076).


(d) Approval—On April 29, 1988, the State of Michigan submitted a committal SIP for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers (PM_10_) for Michigan's Group II areas. The Group II areas of concern are in the City of Monroe and an area surrounding the City of Carrollton. The committal SIP contains all the requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for PM_10_ at 52 FR 24681.


(e) [Reserved]


(f) On July 24, 1995, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested the redesignation of Wayne County to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter. The State's maintenance plan is complete and the redesignation satisfies all of the requirements of the Act.


(g) Approval—On November 29, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the particulate State Implementation Plan for general conformity rules. The general conformity SIP revisions enable the State of Michigan to implement and enforce the Federal general conformity requirements in the nonattainment or maintenance areas at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 93, subpart B—Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans.


(h) *Determination of Attainment.* EPA has determined, as of November 6, 2012, that based on 2009-2011 ambient air quality data, the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area has attained the 1997 annual PM_2.5_ NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM_2.5_ NAAQS.


(i) Pursuant to Clean Air Act section 179(c), EPA has determined that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area attained the annual 1997 PM_2.5_ NAAQS by the applicable attainment date, April 5, 2010.


(j) Approval—The 1997 annual PM_2.5_ maintenance plans for the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area (Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties), has been approved as submitted on July 5, 2011. The maintenance plan establishes 2023 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area of 4,360 tpy for primary PM_2.5_ and 119,194 tpy for NO_X_.


(k) Approval—The 2006 24-Hour PM_2.5_ maintenance plans for the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area (Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties), has been approved as submitted on July 5, 2011. The maintenance plan establishes 2023 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area of 16 tpd for primary PM_2.5_ and 365 tpd for NO_X_.


(l) Approval—On October 3, 2016, the State of Michigan submitted a revision to their Particulate Matter State Implementation Plan. The submittal established transportation conformity “Conformity” criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, and enforceability of certain transportation related control and mitigation measures.
