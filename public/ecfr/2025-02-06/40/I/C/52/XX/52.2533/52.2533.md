(a) *Reasonably Attributable Visibility Impairment.* The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the plan does not include approvable measures for meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.


(b) Regulation for visibility monitoring and new source review. The provisions of ยง 52.28 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for the State of West Virginia.
