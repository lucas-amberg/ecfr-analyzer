(b) Approval—On May 31, 1988, the State of Minnesota submitted a committal SIP for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers (PM_10_) for Minnesota's Group II areas. The Group II areas of concern are in Minneapolis, Hennepin County; Duluth and Iron Range, St. Louis County; Iron Range, Itasca County; Two Harbors, Lake County; and St. Cloud, Stearns County. The committal SIP contains all the requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for PM_10_ at 52 FR 24681.


(c) Approval—On June 20, 2002, the State of Minnesota submitted a request to redesignate the Saint Paul, Ramsey County particulate matter nonattainment area to attainment of the NAAQS for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM). In its submittal, the State also requested that EPA approve the maintenance plan for the area into the Minnesota PM SIP. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements of the Clean Air Act.
