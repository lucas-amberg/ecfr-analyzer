# ยง 52.1238   Control strategy: Lead (Pb).

(a) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2012 to 2014, EPA determined that the Eagan, Minnesota lead nonattainment area attained the 2008 Lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This clean data determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2008 lead NAAQS.
