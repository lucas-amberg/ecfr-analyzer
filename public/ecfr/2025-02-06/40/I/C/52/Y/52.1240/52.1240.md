# § 52.1240   Interstate pollutant transport provisions; What are the FIP requirements for decreases in emissions of nitrogen oxides?

(a)(1) The owner and operator of each source located within the State of Minnesota and for which requirements are set forth under the Federal CAIR NO_X_ Annual Trading Program in subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such applicable requirements. The obligation to comply with these requirements in part 97 of this chapter will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM_2.5_ relating to NO_X_ under § 51.123 of this chapter, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional or unless such approval is under § 51.123(p) of this chapter.


(2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the Administrator has already allocated CAIR NO_X_ allowances to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR NO_X_ allowances for those years shall continue to apply, unless the Administrator approves a SIP provision that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR NO_X_ allowances for those years.


(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, such paragraph is not applicable as it relates to sources in the State of Minnesota as of December 3, 2009, except that:


(1) The owner and operator of each source referenced in such paragraph in whose compliance account any allocation of CAIR NO_X_ allowances was recorded under the Federal CAIR NO_X_ Annual Trading Program in part 97 of this chapter shall hold in that compliance account, as of midnight of December 3, 2009 and with regard to each such recorded allocation, CAIR NO_X_ allowances that are usable in such trading program, issued for the same year as the recorded allocation, and in the same amount as the recorded allocation. The owner and operator shall hold such allowances for the purpose of deduction by the Administrator under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(2) After December 3, 2009, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of each source in the State of Minnesota any CAIR NO_X_ allowances required to be held in that compliance account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Administrator will not deduct, for purposes of implementing the stay, any other CAIR NO_X_ allowances held in that compliance account and, starting no later than December 3, 2009, will not record any allocation of CAIR NO_X_ allowances included in the State trading budget for Minnesota for any year.


(c)(1) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Minnesota and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NO_X_ Annual Trading Program in subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units in the State will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the CSAPR Federal Implementation Plan under § 52.38(a) for those sources and units, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units located in Indian country within the borders of the State will not be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's SIP.


(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if, at the time of the approval of Minnesota's SIP revision described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator has already started recording any allocations of CSAPR NO_X_ Annual allowances under subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter to units in the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation and recordation of CSAPR NO_X_ Annual allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the State's SIP revision.


(d)(1) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Minnesota and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 Trading Program in subpart GGGGG of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements with regard to emissions occurring in 2023 and each subsequent year. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units in the State and areas of Indian country within the borders of the State subject to the State's SIP authority will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the CSAPR Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under § 52.38(b)(1) and (b)(2)(iii) for those sources and units, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units located in areas of Indian country within the borders of the State not subject to the State's SIP authority will not be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's SIP.


(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if, at the time of the approval of Minnesota's SIP revision described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator has already started recording any allocations of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances under subpart GGGGG of part 97 of this chapter to units in the State and areas of Indian country within the borders of the State subject to the State's SIP authority for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart GGGGG of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation and recordation of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to such units for each such control period shall continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the State's SIP revision.


(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the effectiveness of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is stayed with regard to emissions occurring in 2023 and thereafter.
