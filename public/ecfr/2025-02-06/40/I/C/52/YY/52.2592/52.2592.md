# § 52.2592   Review of new sources and modifications.

Disapproval—On May 12, 2011, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a proposed revision to its State Implementation Plan to update its rules to match the 2008 New Source Review Implementation Rule for PM_2.5_. The State supplemented the submittal on March 5, 2012. EPA determined that this submittal was not approvable because the revisions did not explicitly identify the precursors to PM_2.5_ and did not contain the prescribed language to ensure that gases that condense to form PM, known as condensables, are regulated within PM_2.5_ and PM_10_ emission limits.
