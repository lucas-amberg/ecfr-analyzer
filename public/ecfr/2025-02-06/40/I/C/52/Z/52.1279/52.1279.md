# ยง 52.1279   Visibility protection.

(a) [Reserved]


(b) *Disapproval.* EPA has disapproved the portions of Mississippi's May 29, 2012, 2008 8-hour Ozone infrastructure SIP submission; July 26, 2012, 2008 8-hour Ozone infrastructure SIP resubmission; February 28, 2013, 2010, 1-hour NO_2_ infrastructure SIP submission; June 20, 2013, 2010 1-hour SO_2_ infrastructure SIP submission; and December 8, 2015, 2012, Annual PM_2.5_ infrastructure SIP submission that address the visibility protection (prong 4) requirements of Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II). EPA disapproved the prong 4 portions of these SIP submissions because Mississippi does not have a fully approved regional haze SIP that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308 and because these SIP submissions do not otherwise demonstrate that emissions within the State do not interfere with other states' plans to protect visibility.
