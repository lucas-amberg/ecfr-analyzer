(e) *Compliance determinations for SO*_2_ and *NO*_X_. (1) For all BART units other than Trona Plant units:


(i) *CEMS.* At all times after the earliest compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 75, to accurately measure SO_2_ and/or NO_X_, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit. The CEMS shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.


(ii) *Method.* (A) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NO_X_ emission rates in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 75. At the end of each operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current operating day and the previous 29 successive operating days.


(B) At the end of each calendar year, the owner/operator shall calculate the annual average SO_2_ emission rate in lb/MMBtu across Laramie River Station Units 1 and 2 as the sum of the SO_2_ annual mass emissions (pounds) divided by the sum of the annual heat inputs (MMBtu). For Laramie River Station Units 1 and 2, the owner/operator shall calculate the annual mass emissions for SO_2_ and the annual heat input in accordance with 40 CFR part 75 for each unit.


(C) An hourly average SO_2_ and/or NO_X_ emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 75, is acquired by both the pollutant concentration monitor (SO_2_ and/or NO_X_) and the diluent monitor (O_2_ or CO_2_).


(D) Data reported to meet the requirements of this section shall not include data substituted using the missing data substitution procedures of subpart D of 40 CFR part 75, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of 40 CFR part 75.


(2) For all Trona Plant BART units:


(i) *CEMS.* At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 60, to accurately measure NO_X_, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit, including the CEMS quality assurance requirements in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60. The CEMS shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.


(ii) *Method.* (A) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NO_X_ emission rate in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 60. At the end of each operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current operating day and the previous 29 successive operating days.


(B) An hourly average NO_X_ emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 60, is acquired by both the pollutant concentration monitor (NO_X_) and the diluent monitor (O_2_ or CO_2_).


(f) *Compliance determinations for particulate matter.* Compliance with the particulate matter emission limit for each BART unit shall be determined from annual performance stack tests. Within 60 days of the compliance deadline specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and on at least an annual basis thereafter, the owner/operator of each unit shall conduct a stack test on each unit to measure particulate emissions using EPA Method 5, 5B, 5D, or 17, as appropriate, in 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A. A test shall consist of three runs, with each run at least 120 minutes in duration and each run collecting a minimum sample of 60 dry standard cubic feet. Results shall be reported in lb/MMBtu. In addition to annual stack tests, the owner/operator shall monitor particulate emissions for compliance with the BART emission limits in accordance with the applicable Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) plan developed and approved by the State in accordance with 40 CFR part 64.


(g) *Recordkeeping.* The owner/operator shall maintain the following records for at least five years:


(1) All CEMS data, including the date, place, and time of sampling or measurement; parameters sampled or measured; and results.


(2) Records of quality assurance and quality control activities for emissions measuring systems including, but not limited to, any records required by 40 CFR part 75. Or, for Trona Plant units, records of quality assurance and quality control activities for emissions measuring systems including, but not limited to appendix F of 40 CFR part 60.


(3) Records of all major maintenance activities conducted on emission units, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS.


(4) Any other CEMS records required by 40 CFR part 75. Or, for Trona Plant units, any other CEMs records required by 40 CFR part 60.


(5) Records of all particulate stack test results.


(6) All data collected pursuant to the CAM plan.


(h) *Reporting.* All reports under this section shall be submitted to the Director, Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Environmental Justice, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8, Mail Code 8ENF-AT, 1595 Wynkoop Street, Denver, Colorado 80202-1129.


(1) The owner/operator of each unit shall submit quarterly excess emissions reports for SO_2_ and/or NO_X_ BART units no later than the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter. Excess emissions means emissions that exceed the emissions limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The reports shall include the magnitude, date(s) and duration of each period of excess emissions, specific identification of each period of excess emissions that occurs during startups, shutdowns and malfunctions of the unit, the nature and cause of any malfunction (if known), and the corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted.


(2) The owner/operator of each unit shall submit quarterly CEMS performance reports, to include dates and duration of each period during which the CEMS was inoperative (except for zero and span adjustments and calibration checks), reason(s) why the CEMS was inoperative and steps taken to prevent recurrence, and any CEMS repairs or adjustments. The owner/operator of each unit shall also submit results of any CEMS performance tests required by 40 CFR part 75. Or, for Trona Plant units, the owner/operator of each unit shall also submit results of any CEMs performance test required appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 (Relative Accuracy Test Audits, Relative Accuracy Audits, and Cylinder Gas Audits).


(3) When no excess emissions have occurred or the CEMS has not been inoperative, repaired, or adjusted during the reporting period, such information shall be stated in the quarterly reports required by paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section.


(4) The owner/operator of each unit shall submit results of any particulate matter stack tests conducted for demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter BART limits in paragraphs (c) of this section, within 60 calendar days after completion of the test.


(5) The owner/operator of each unit shall submit semi-annual reports of any excursions under the approved CAM plan in accordance with the schedule specified in the source's title V permit.

(2) The owner/operator shall promptly submit semi-annual progress reports on construction of any such equipment.


(3) The owner/operator shall promptly submit notification of initial startup of any such equipment.


(j) *Equipment operation.* At all times, the owner/operator shall maintain each unit, including associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.


(k) *Credible evidence.* Nothing in this section shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with requirements of this section if the appropriate performance or compliance test procedures or method had been performed.
