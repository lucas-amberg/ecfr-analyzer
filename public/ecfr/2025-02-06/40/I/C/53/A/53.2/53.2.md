The following general requirements for a Federal reference method (FRM) determination are summarized in table A-1 of this subpart.


(a) *Manual methods*—(1) *Sulfur dioxide (SO*_2_) and Lead. For measuring SO_2_ and lead, appendixes A-2 and G of part 50 of this chapter specify unique manual FRM for measuring those pollutants. Except as provided in § 53.16, other manual methods for lead will not be considered for a reference method determination under this part.


(2) *PM*_10_. A FRM for measuring PM _10_ must be a manual method that meets all requirements specified in appendix J of part 50 of this chapter and must include a PM _10_ sampler that has been shown in accordance with this part to meet all requirements specified in this subpart A and subpart D of this part.


(3) *PM*_2.5_. A FRM for measuring PM _2.5_ must be a manual method that meets all requirements specified in appendix L of part 50 of this chapter and must include a PM _2.5_ sampler that has been shown in accordance with this part to meet the applicable requirements specified in this subpart A and subpart E of this part. Further, FRM samplers must be manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility, as defined in § 53.1 and as set forth in § 53.51.


(4) *PM*_10-2.5_. A FRM for measuring PM _10-2.5_ must be a manual method that meets all requirements specified in appendix O of part 50 of this chapter and must include PM _10C_ and PM _2.5_ samplers that have been shown in accordance with this part to meet the applicable requirements specified in this subpart A and subpart E of this part. Further, PM _10-2.5_ FRM samplers must be manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility, as defined in § 53.1 and as set forth in § 53.51.


(b) *Automated methods.* An automated FRM for measuring SO_2_, CO, O_3_, or NO_2_ must utilize the measurement principle and calibration procedure specified in the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter (appendix A-1 only for SO_2_ methods) and must have been shown in accordance with this part to meet the requirements specified in this subpart A and subpart B of this part.
