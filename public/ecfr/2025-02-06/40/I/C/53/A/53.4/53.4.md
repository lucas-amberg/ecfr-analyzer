(ii) Test data shall be collected according to the standards of good practice and by qualified personnel. Test anomalies or irregularities shall be documented and explained or justified. The impact and significance of the deviation on test results and conclusions shall be determined. Data collected shall correspond directly to the specified test requirement and be labeled and identified clearly so that results can be verified and evaluated against the test requirement. Calculations or data manipulations must be explained in detail so that they can be verified.


(6) A statement that the method, analyzer, or sampler tested in accordance with this part is representative of the candidate method described in the application.


(7) All written materials for new FRM and FEM applications and modification requests must be submitted in English in MS Word format. For any calibration certificates originally written in a non-English language, the original non-English version of the certificate must be submitted to EPA along with a version of the certificate translated to English. All laboratory and field data associated with new FRM and FEM applications and modification requests must be submitted in MS Excel format. All worksheets in MS Excel must be unprotected to enable full inspection as part of the application review process.


(c) For candidate automated methods and candidate manual methods for PM _10_, PM _2.5_, and PM _10-2.5_ the application shall also contain the following:


(1) A detailed description of the quality system that will be utilized, if the candidate method is designated as a reference or equivalent method, to ensure that all analyzers or samplers offered for sale under that designation will have essentially the same performance characteristics as the analyzer(s) or samplers tested in accordance with this part. In addition, the quality system requirements for candidate methods for PM _2.5_ and PM _10-2.5_ must be described in sufficient detail, based on the elements described in section 4 of reference 1 (Quality System Requirements) of appendix A of this subpart.
