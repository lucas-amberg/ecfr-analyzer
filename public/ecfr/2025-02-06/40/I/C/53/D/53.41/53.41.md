(c) Once the test sampler or samplers have been set up and the performance tests started, manual adjustment shall be permitted only between test points for the sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint tests or between test days for the precision and flow rate stability tests. The manual adjustments and any periodic maintenance shall be limited to only those procedures prescribed in the manual referred to in ยง 53.4(b)(3). The submitted records shall show clearly when any manual adjustment or periodic maintenance was made and shall describe the operations performed.


(d) If a test sampler malfunctions during any of the sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint tests, that test run shall be repeated.
