# § 53.64   Test procedure: Static fractionator test.

(a) *Overview.* This test applies only to those candidate methods in which the sole deviation from the reference method is in the design of the 2.5-micron fractionation device. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the fractionation characteristics of the candidate fractionator are acceptably similar to that of the reference method sampler. It is recognized that various methodologies exist for quantifying fractionator effectiveness. The following commonly-employed techniques are provided for purposes of guidance. Other methodologies for determining sampler effectiveness may be used contingent upon prior approval by the Agency.


(1) *Wash-off method.* Effectiveness is determined by measuring the aerosol mass deposited on the candidate sampler's after filter versus the aerosol mass deposited in the fractionator. The material deposited in the fractionator is recovered by washing its internal surfaces. For these wash-off tests, a fluorometer must be used to quantitate the aerosol concentration. Note that if this technique is chosen, the candidate must be reloaded with coarse aerosol prior to each test point when reevaluating the curve as specified in the loading test.


(2) *Static chamber method.* Effectiveness is determined by measuring the aerosol mass concentration sampled by the candidate sampler's after filter versus that which exists in a static chamber. A calibrated fluorometer shall be used to quantify the collected aerosol deposits. The aerosol concentration is calculated as the measured aerosol mass divided by the sampled air volume.


(3) *Divided flow method.* Effectiveness is determined by comparing the aerosol concentration upstream of the candidate sampler's fractionator versus that concentration which exists downstream of the candidate fractionator. These tests may utilize either fluorometry or a real-time aerosol measuring device to determine the aerosol concentration.


(b) *Technical definition.* Effectiveness under static conditions is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass concentration of particles of the same size existing in the test atmosphere.


(c) *Facilities and equipment required*—(1) *Aerosol generation.* Methods for generating aerosols shall be identical to those prescribed in § 53.62(c)(2).


(2) *Particle delivery system.* Acceptable apparatus for delivering the generated aerosols to the candidate fractionator is dependent on the effectiveness measurement methodology and shall be defined as follows:


(i) *Wash-off test apparatus.* The aerosol may be delivered to the candidate fractionator through direct piping (with or without an in-line mixing chamber). Validation particle size and quality shall be conducted at a point directly upstream of the fractionator.


(ii) *Static chamber test apparatus.* The aerosol shall be introduced into a chamber and sufficiently mixed such that the aerosol concentration within the chamber is spatially uniform. The chamber must be of sufficient size to house at least four total filter samplers in addition to the inlet of the candidate method size fractionator. Validation of particle size and quality shall be conducted on representative aerosol samples extracted from the chamber.


(iii) *Divided flow test apparatus.* The apparatus shall allow the aerosol concentration to be measured upstream and downstream of the fractionator. The aerosol shall be delivered to a manifold with two symmetrical branching legs. One of the legs, referred to as the bypass leg, shall allow the challenge aerosol to pass unfractionated to the detector. The other leg shall accommodate the fractionation device.


(3) *Particle concentration measurement*—(i) *Fluorometry.* Refer to § 53.62(c)(7).


(ii) *Number concentration measurement.* A number counting particle sizer may be used in conjunction with the divided flow test apparatus in lieu of fluorometric measurement. This device must have a minimum range of 1 to 10 µm, a resolution of 0.1 µm, and an accuracy of 0.15 µm such that primary particles may be distinguished from multiplets for all test aerosols. The measurement of number concentration shall be accomplished by integrating the primary particle peak.


(d) *Setup*—(1) *Remove the inlet and downtube from the candidate fractionator.* All tests procedures shall be conducted with the inlet and downtube removed from the candidate sampler.


(2) *Surface treatment of the fractionator.* Rinsing aluminum surfaces with alkaline solutions has been found to adversely affect subsequent fluorometric quantitation of aerosol mass deposits. If wash-off tests are to be used for quantifying aerosol penetration, internal surfaces of the fractionator must first be plated with electroless nickel. Specifications for this plating are specified in Society of Automotive Engineers Aerospace Material Specification (SAE AMS) 2404C, Electroless Nickel Plating (Reference 3 in appendix A of subpart F).


(e) *Test procedure: Wash-off method*—(1) *Clean the candidate sampler.* Note: The procedures in this step may be omitted if this test is being used to evaluate the fractionator after being loaded as specified in § 53.65.
