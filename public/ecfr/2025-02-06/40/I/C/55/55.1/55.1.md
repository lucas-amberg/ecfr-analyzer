# § 55.1   Statutory authority and scope.

Section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (“the Act”), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to establish requirements to control air pollution from outer continental shelf (“OCS”) sources in order to attain and maintain Federal and State ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. This part establishes the air pollution control requirements for OCS sources and the procedures for implementation and enforcement of the requirements, consistent with these stated objectives of section 328(a)(1) of the Act. In implementing, enforcing and revising this rule and in delegating authority hereunder, the Administrator will ensure that there is a rational relationship to the attainment and maintenance of Federal and State ambient air quality standards and the requirements of part C of title I, and that the rule is not used for the purpose of preventing exploration and development of the OCS.
