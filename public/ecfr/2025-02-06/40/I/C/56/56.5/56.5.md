# § 56.5   Mechanisms for fairness and uniformity—Responsibilities of Regional Office employees.

(a) Each responsible official in a Regional Office, including the Regional Administrator, shall assure that actions taken under the act:


(1) Are carried out fairly and in a manner that is consistent with the Act and Agency policy as set forth in the Agency rules and program directives,


(2) Are as consistent as reasonably possible with the activities of other Regional Offices, and


(3) Comply with the mechanisms developed under § 56.4 of this part.


(b) A responsible official in a Regional office shall seek concurrence from the appropriate EPA Headquarters office on any interpretation of the Act, or rule, regulation, or program directive when such interpretation may result in application of the act or rule, regulation, or program directive that is inconsistent with Agency policy. However, the responsible official in a Regional office will not be required to seek such concurrence from the appropriate EPA Headquarters office for actions that may result in inconsistent application if such inconsistent application is required in order to act in accordance with a federal court decision:


(1) Issued by a Circuit Court in challenges to “locally or regionally applicable” actions, as provided in Clean Air Act section 307(b) (42 U.S.C. 7607(b)), if that circuit court has direct jurisdiction over the geographic areas that the Regional office official is addressing, or (2) Issued by a district court in a specific case if the party the Regional office official is addressing was also a party in the case that resulted in the decision.


(c) In reviewing State Implementation Plans, the Regional Office shall follow the provisions of the guideline, revisions to State Implementation Plans—Procedures for Approval/Disapproval Actions, OAQPS No. 1.2-005A, or revision thereof. Where regulatory actions may involve inconsistent application of the requirements of the act, the Regional Offices shall classify such actions as special actions.
