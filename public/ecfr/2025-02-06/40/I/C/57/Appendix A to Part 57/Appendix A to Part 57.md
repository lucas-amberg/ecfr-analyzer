# Appendix A to Part 57—Primary Nonferrous Smelter Order (NSO) Application


1.1 Purpose of the application. This application provides financial reporting schedules and the accompanying instructions for EPA's determination of eligibility for a nonferrous smelter order (NSO), and for a waiver of the interim constant controls requirement of an NSO. Although the determination of eligibility for an NSO is prerequisite for the determination of a waiver, appendix A, as a matter of convenience to applicants, includes both the NSO and waiver tests and reporting schedules.


In order to support an NSO eligibility determination, the applicant must submit operating and financial data as specified by the schedules included in this application. Specific instructions for completing each schedule are provided in subsequent sections of the instructions. In general, applicants must provide:


(a) Annual income statements, balance sheets and supporting data covering the five most recent fiscal years for the smelter for which the NSO requested.


(b) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated smelter operations without any sulfur dioxide air pollution control facilities that have not been installed as of the NSO application date.


(c) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated smelter operations with expected additional sulfur dioxide control facilities required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation.


(d) For smelters applying for a waiver of interim constant controls, forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations prepared on the basis of two alternative assumptions: (1) Installation of additional pollution control facilities required to comply with interim constant control requirements, no installation of any additional SO_2_ controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure of the smelter after January 1, 1988; and (2) installation of additional pollution control facilities required to comply with interim constant control requirements, installation of any additional SO_2_ controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued operation of the smelter after January 1, 1988.


1.2 NSO financial tests. EPA will use separate tests to determine eligibility for an NSO and to evaluate applications for a waiver of the interim constant control requirement. The two tests for NSO eligibility employ a present value approach for determining the reasonable availability of constant control technology that will enable an applicant to achieve full compliance with its SIP sulfur dioxide emission limitation. The tests for the waiver of the interim constant control requirements employ variable costing and discounted cash flow standards for evaluating an applicant's economic capability to implement those requirements.


1.2.1 *NSO Eligibility Tests.* Each applicant must establish that the system of production and/or constant control technology that will enable the smelter to achieve full compliance with its SIP SO_2_ emission limitation standard is not reasonably available. An applicant will determine financial eligibility for an NSO by passing at least one of the following two tests.


(a) *Profit Protection Test.* The smelter will experience a reduction in pre-tax profits of 50 percent or more after undertaking the required installation of constant controls.


(b) *Rate of Return Test.* The smelter will earn a rate of return on historical net investment, expressed in constant dollars, below the industry average cost of capital after undertaking the required installation of constant controls.


1.2.2 *Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls.* Applicants that do not have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a temporary waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in this application that the imposition of such control requirements would economically necessitate closure of the smelter facility for a period of one year or longer. The economic justification for a non-permanent closure under this temporary waiver test is defined as a situation in which the smelter's projected operating revenues for one or more years during which the NSO is in effect are inadequate to cover variable operating costs anticipated after installing the required interim control technology. Temporary waivers will be granted for only the period of time over which applicants can establish an inability by the firm to cover its variable operating costs. Interim control waiver requests based on the smelter's projected inability to earn adequate income after installation of interim pollution control equipment will be subject to the permanent waiver test.


1.2.3 Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls. Applicants that do not have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a permanent waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in this application that an imposition of such control requirements would necessitate permanent closure of the smelter. Economic justification for a permanent closure is defined as a situation in which the present value of future cash flows anticipated from the smelter after installing the required interim control technology is less than the smelter's current salvage value under an orderly plan of liquidation. Future cash flows are determined under two alternative assumptions. The higher present value of cash flows computed under these assumptions is then compared to salvage value.


1.2.4 EPA Contact for NSO Inquiries. Inquiries concerning this portion of the requirements for NSO application should be addressed to Laxmi M. Kesari, Environmental Protection Agency, EN 341, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.


1.2.5 Certification. The NSO Certification Statement must be signed by an authorized officer of the applicant firm.


1.3 Confidentiality. Applicants may request that information contained in this application be treated as confidential. Agency regulations concerning claims of confidentiality of business information are contained in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B (41 FR 36902 *et seq.,* September 1, 1976, as amended by 43 FR 39997 *et seq.,* September 8, 1978). The regulations provide that a business may, if it desires, assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information furnished to EPA. The claim must be made at the same time the applicable information is submitted. The manner of asserting such claims is specified in 40 CFR 2.203(b). Information covered by such a claim will be handled by the Agency in accordance with procedures set forth in the subpart B regulations. EPA will not disclose information on a business that has made a claim of confidentiality, except to the extent of and in accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. However, if no claim of confidentiality is made when information is furnished to EPA, the information may be made available to the public without notice to the business.


2.1 Revenue and Cost Assignment. The amounts assigned to operations of the smelter subject to this NSO application should include (1) revenues and costs directly attributable to the smelter's operating activities and (2) indirect operating costs shared with other segments of the firm to the extent that a specific causal and beneficial relationship can be identified for the allocation of such costs to the smelter. Do not allocate revenues and costs associated with central administrative activities for which specific causal and beneficial relationships to the activities of the smelter cannot be established. Nonallocable items include, but are not restricted to, amounts such as dividend and interest income on centrally administered portfolio investments, central corporate administrative office expenses and, except for schedules supporting the Profit Protection Test, interest on long-term debt financing arrangements. Provide a detailed explanation of amounts classified as nontraceable on a separate schedule and attach as part of Exhibit B.


2.2 Transfer Prices on Affiliated Part Transactions. Certain transactions by the smelter subject to an NSO application may reflect sales to or purchases from “affiliated” customers or suppliers with whom the smelter has a common bond of ownership and/or managerial control. In preparing this application, affiliated party transactions shall be defined as transactions with any entity that the firm, or its owners, controls directly or indirectly either through an ownership of 10 percent or more of the entity's voting interests or through an exercise of managerial responsibility. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B supporting schedules explaining the pricing policies established on affiliated party transactions incorporated in the financial reporting schedules.


Prices on inter-segment material and product transfers within a firm, or on external purchases from and sales to other affiliated suppliers and customers, may differ from the prices on comparable transactions with unaffiliated suppliers and customers. In this event, applicants also must present in the Exhibit B supporting schedules and incorporate in the NSO financial reporting schedules appropriate adjustments for restating affiliated party transactions. Affiliated party transactions must be restated at either (a) equivalent prices on comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties if such price quotations can be obtained or (b) prices that provide the selling entity with a normal profit margin above its cost of sales if a meaningful comparison with unaffiliated transaction prices cannot be established.


A “normal” profit margin is defined as the gross operating profit per dollar of operating revenue that will provide an average after-tax rate of return on permanent capital (total assets less current liabilities). This average rate of return is defined differently for the historical and forecast periods. The applicant must use a rate of return of 8.0 percent for the *historical* period. This figure is based on a historical average earned rate of return for the nonferrous metals industry. 
1 EPA may update this figure periodically. The updates will be available in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT noted in the _Federal Register._ For the *forecast* period, the applicant must use a rate of return equal to the current weighted average cost of capital for the nonferrous metals industry, as computed in Section 2.6.


Forecast smelting charges for integrated smelters can be computed from forecast market smelting charges. Integrated copper smelters may use as the basis of their forecast revenues the forecast copper smelting charges provided by EPA, adjusted as described in Section 2.4.1. An applicant may submit other forecasts, providing the forecast methodology is in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 and fully documented as part of Exhibit B.


2.3 Forecasting Requirements. NSO applicants must provide the Agency with financial forecasts in Schedules B.1 through B.6 and C.1 through C.2. Applicants requesting either a temporary or permanent waiver from interim constant control requirements also must provide an additional set of financial forecasts in Schedules D.1 through D.4.


2.3.1 Forecast Period. The forecast period must include at least two full years following completion and startup of the required pollution control system. The forecast period shall be from 1984 through 1990 for an NSO application filed in 1984. If an application is filed in a later year, the 1984 through 1990 period should be adjusted accordingly. All references in this appendix to the period 1984 through 1990 should be interpreted accordingly.


2.3.2 Forecast Adjustment by Control Case. Some line items that have the same title in several schedules may contain different information because they are based on different assumptions regarding pollution controls. Production interruptions or curtailments due to the installation of pollution control facilities may require adjustments to certain revenue and cost estimates in the respective control cases. For example, production curtailments associated with supplementary control systems may be the basis for the pre-control case, yet are eliminated when constant controls replace supplementary control systems in the constant controls case. The application of pollution control techniques that involve process changes in the smelter's operations (e.g., conversion to flash smelting) also may require specific forecasts by applications of associated impacts on incremental operating revenues and costs.


2.3.3 Nominal Dollar Basis. Applicants must make their financial forecasts in terms of nominal dollars. Forecasts of selected parameters provided by EPA will furnish guidelines to an applicant in preparing the required cost and revenue estimates. In particular, copper smelting charges provided in nominal-dollar terms must be used directly by the applicant as given; i.e., the stipulated charge estimates should not be inflated.


2.3.4 Tolling Service Equivalent Basis. Applicants must express all revenue forecasts on a tolling service equivalent basis. Thus, forecast revenues are computed as the product of the forecast quantity of processed concentrate, the forecast average product grade of the concentrate (the percent of metal in the concentrate), and the forecast smelting charge. Smelters that are not tolling smelters and that do not use the copper smelting charges provided by EPA (as described in Section 2.4.1) can forecast a smelting charge from forecast product grade of the concentrate, percent recovery, and product and concentrate prices. The forecast prices and derivation of the smelting charge must be in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5, and the methodology must be fully documented in Exhibit B.


2.4 EPA Furnished Forecast Data. In making projection for the period 1984 through 1990, applicants must, except as noted below, use the indices provided by EPA. The table below presents yearly values for each index (expressed as annual percentage rates of change) to be used by smelters applying for an NSO before January 1, 1985. If forecasts are needed for 1991 and EPA has not provided new forecasts, applicants should use the Data Resources, Inc. forecasts for 1991 (Docket Item No. IV-A-6c) and the average of CRU's forecasts for 1989 and 1990 (expressed in 1991 dollars).


2.4.1 Copper smelting charge. EPA will supply a forecast of reference copper smelting charges. These charges, which are f.o.b. U.S. mine, are based on an estimate of export smelting charges and on the differential value of copper in the U.S. and the world market. They must be used in forecasting unaffiliated party revenues for the period following the expiration of existing contracts and in forecasting affiliated party revenues for the entire forecast period. The applicant may submit its own smelting charge forecast for the post-contract period, provided that such forecast is in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 and fully documented and substantiated as part of Exhibit B.


The EPA forecast export charge represents the world market copper smelting charge with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price. This charge serves as the reference charge for the applicant copper smelter in calculating its smelting charges. Applicant copper smelters must derive their smelting charges from this world market charge as described in paragraph (a) below.


The applicant may adjust the derived smelter-specific smelting charge to account for other factors, provided the adjustments are fully documented as part of Exhibit B. An example of such a factor is the unit deduction for metallurgical losses in smelting. Adjustment for this factor is discussed in paragraph (b) below.


(a) The derivation of a smelter-specific smelting charge from the world market charge is based on assumptions regarding transportation costs and the U.S. producer-world copper price differential. The EPA forecast export charge is the forecast smelting charge available at a Japanese smelter, with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange copper price. The charge includes no freight costs, which must be paid by the mine. A U.S. smelter determines its smelting charge to a mine by meeting the combined world market smelting charge, adjusted to reflect copper valued at the U.S. producer price, and the transportation charge from the mine to the Japanese smelter. This combined price is the highest that a mine is willing to pay for smelting.


The smelter's net smelting charge is equal to the combined world smelting charge, adjusted to the U.S. producer price for copper (i.e., the export forecast charge plus the U.S. producer price premium), and the transportation cost between the mine and a Far East smelter, minus the cost of transporting the concentrate between the mine and the applicant smelter.


The applicant smelter's net smelting charge for concentrate from an individual mine is computed by first adding the U.S. producer Price-LME world price differential to the EPA-supplied forecast. The cost of transporting copper from the U.S. mine to the Far East is then added to this figure. The net smelting charge is obtained by subtracting from this total the cost of transporting copper from the mine to the applicant smelter. In making these calculations, an applicant must supply (and fully document in Exhibit B), the freight cost between the mine and the Far East and between the mine and the smelter. This freight cost must be converted to nominal dollars of the respective forecast years by applying the GNP percentage price change forecasts supplied by EPA or smelter-provided forecasts of transportation price changes. The smelter-provided forecasts of transportation price changes must comply with guidelines regarding such forecasts in Section 2.5.


An applicant must use a 3 cent per pound U.S. producer price premium (relative to the LME price) in calculating the smelter's net smelting charge. The applicant may substitute its own forecasts of the U.S. producer price premium if it can substantiate such forecasts in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 regarding applicant-provided smelting charge forecasts of principal products. All supporting documentation for such applicant-supplied forecasts must be supplied in Exhibit B. Any updates of the producer price premium will be available in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT noted in the _Federal Register._

The following two representative examples illustrate this methodology for making the transportation and U. S. producer price premium adjustment.


(1) The applicant smelter, located in Arizona, obtains concentrate from an adjacent mine. The freight charge from mine to smelter is zero. The mine is willing to pay the applicant smelter an amount no higher than the sum of the world market smelting charge (adjusted for the copper value differential) and the transportation cost of shipping copper from the mine to the Far East. This combined cost is the net charge received by the applicant smelter. If the export smelting charge is 12 cents per pound and the freight cost between the mine and the Far East is 13 cents per pound, the applicant smelter would calculate a net smelting charge equal to 28 cents: 12 cents plus 3 cents (for the U.S. producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight cost between the mine and the Far East).


(2) The applicant smelter obtains concentrate from a nonadjacent mine. The mine will pay a charge no higher than the total market smelting charge, valued at the U.S. producer price, and the transportation costs between the mine and a Far East smelter. The applicant's net smelting charge is equal to this combined cost minus the transportation costs for shipping the concentrate between mine and applicant smelter.


Suppose that the mine to Far East freight charge is 13 cents per pound and the mine to applicant smelter freight charge is 4 cents per pound. If the export smelting charge is 12 cents per pound, the net smelting charge is equal to 24 cents per pound: 12 cents plus 3 cents (for the U.S. producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight cost to the Far East) minus 4 cents (for the freight cost to the applicant smelter).


(b) The EPA forecast charges are based on a one unit deduction for metallurgical losses. This means that if a concentrate grades 25 percent copper, the mine is only credited with 24 percent for metal return. The one unit deduction on 25 percent concentrate is equivalent to a 96 percent payment for contained copper. Should a smelter recover less than 96 percent, its revenue would be less than the EPA forecast smelting charge. Should a smelter recover more than 96 percent, its revenue would be greater than the EPA forecast smelting charge.


2.4.2 Indices (Annual Percentage Changes). These indices, which are expressed as annual percentage rate changes in price (wages, energy prices, and GNP price deflator) must be used only for estimating the rate of price increases for the forecast period following the expiration of the applicant's current contracts. The applicant may use alternative forecasts of annual percentage changes for the forecast period following the expiration of current contracts, if justification is provided. Any such alternative forecasts must be prepared by a widely-recognized forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA. In addition, the documentation of these forecasts must be comparable to that provided by EPA's forecaster.


The wage indices are to be applied to wage paid to manufacturing labor. The energy price indices are to be applied to prices of the respective energy products. The GNP price deflators are to be applied to prices for non-metal, non-labor, and non-energy inputs.


2.5 Applicant Generated Forecasts. Within the specified limitations, applicants may submit a method of forecasting smelting charges and by-product, co-product and other prices. The method selected must be explained and unit prices or costs provided where applicable. The forecast elements must be compatible with an applicant's historical cost and revenue elements to permit direct comparisons of historical and forecast data. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B appropriate schedules explaining variances between forecast and historical unit costs for the smelter.


Forecasts of the smelting charges of the smelter's principal product (i.e., copper, lead, zinc, etc.) may be prepared either by an independent forecasting authority or by the smelter's in-house personnel. If the forecasts are prepared by an independent forecasting authority, the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) The forecasting authority must have expertise comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA. (2) As much documentation of the forecasting methodology as can reasonably be obtained must be made available to EPA. Such documentation must, at a minimum, be comparable to the documentation supporting EPA smelting charge forecasts. 
2

If the smelting charge forecasts are prepared by in-house personnel, the following conditions must be met: (1) The in-house forecasts must be certified as being based on sound methodology by an independent forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the forecaster who prepared the EPA-supplied smelting charges. The independent forecasting authority shall also provide a brief explanation of the basis for the conclusion reached in the certification. (2) The smelter owner shall provide EPA with the documentation of the forecasting methodology employed, which must at a minimum be comparable to the extent of documentation supporting EPA's smelting charge forecasts. The smelter owner shall also make available upon request by EPA such additional documentation of the methodology and underlying data as EPA considers appropriate for evaluation of the forecasts.


Forecasts of freight cost changes, which are applied to the freight costs used in calculating a smelter's net smelting charges, must be prepared by a widely-recognized forecasting authority. The forecaster's expertise must be comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA in forecasting the annual percentage changes in wages, energy prices, and GNP. The documentation of these forecasts must be comparable to that provided by EPA's forecaster.


To the maximum extent practicable, by-product, co-product and (when applicable) unaffiliated smelting charges must be stated at market prices adjusted to f.o.b. smelter. Adjustments of these pricing bases must be made to reflect differences in grades and types of production. All adjustments must be consistent with expected sales, grades and types of concentrate processed. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B schedules describing and explaining the methods used to forecast these revenue items and the adjustments required for these revenue forecasts.


Applicants must explain fully any changes from the historical data that are required to forecast labor productivity, ore-concentrate grade and composition, materials and energy consumption per unit of output, yield rates and other physical input/output relationships.


Existing contractual terms must be used in forecasting those sales or input costs or prices to which the applicant is committed by contracts. The use of contract-dictated prices must be disclosed and supported by attaching as part of Exhibit B the terms and duration of labor and other supplier arrangements.


Cost of compliance estimates need not be to the accuracy of final design/bid estimates; feasibility grade estimates will be acceptable. Updated cost of compliance estimates used in internal five year plans or specially prepared estimates of costs of compliance will generally be satisfactory.


2.6 Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Nonferrous Metal Producers. The industry average cost of capital is a weighted average of the rates of return for equity and debt. Its components are the interest rate and the return on equity specific to the nonferrous metals industry.


2.6.1 Computation. 
3 The applicant must compute the cost of capital according to the following formula:


(a) *Return on equity for the nonferrous metals industry.* The 20 year Treasury bond yield to maturity plus a risk premium of 8.6 percent.


(b) *Interest Rate.* The 20 year Treasury bond yield to maturity plus a risk premium of 3.0 percent.


(c) *Source of the 20 Year Treasury bond yield. Federal Reserve Bulletin,* most recent monthly issue. Use the average yield for the most recent full month.


2.6.2 Discount Factor. The discount factor corresponding to the weighted average cost of capital for any forecast year is computed according to the following equation:


The horizon value, which is described in Section 2.7, is computed as of 1990, the end of the detailed forecast period. The discount factor to be applied to the horizon value is the same as for any other 1990 figure. For example, if the application is made in 1984, the value of N is 7.


2.7 Horizon Value. The horizon value is the present value of a stream of cash flows or net income for 15 years beyond the last forecast year. Applicants must compute the horizon value by capitalizing the average forecast value of the last two forecast years using the current real weighted cost of capital. The line item instructions for schedules having a horizon value entry will specify the values to be capitalized.


The applicant averages the values of the last two years after expressing both values in terms of the last year's dollars. The two-year average value is then multiplied by 9.6. This is the factor associated with capitalizing a 15 year value stream at the current *real* weighted cost of capital of 6.2 percent.


Applicants must use a separate schedule to calculate the horizon value for the Rate of Return Test and the Interim Controls Test (Schedule C.5 and D.7, respectively). These separate schedules adjust for potential overstatements in the horizon value cash flows that may be caused by control equipment depreciation reported for tax purposes.


2.8 Data Entry


2.8.1 Rounding. All amounts (including both dollar values and physical units) reported in the schedules and exhibits accompanying this application must be rounded to the nearest thousand and expressed in thousands of dollars or units unless otherwise indicated in the instructions.


2.8.2 Estimates. Where an applicant's records cannot produce the specific data required by this application, the use of estimates will be allowed if a meaningful estimate can be made without significant distortion of the reported results. Data estimates must be supported by attaching on a separate sheet of paper as a part of Exhibit B an explanation identifying where such estimates are used and showing explicitly how the estimates were made.


2.8.3 Missing Data. Applicants must provide, where applicable, all operating and financial data requested by this application. Only substantially complete applications can be accepted for processing by the Agency. Questions concerning data entries for which information is not provided by or cannot reasonably be estimated from the applicant's existing accounting records should be addressed to the EPA Contact for NSO Inquiries.


2.8.4 Historical Period. The annual data requested in the historical schedules, Schedules A.1 through A.4, must be reported for each of the five fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which this application is filed. The historical period shall be from fiscal years 1979 through 1983 for an NSO application filed in 1984. If an application is filed in a later year, the references in this appendix to the period 1979 through 1983 should be interpreted accordingly.


2.9 Use of schedules. All applicants must complete Schedules A.1 through A.4, which record historical revenues, cost, and capital investment data. These schedules will be used by EPA to assist in evaluating forecast data. Completion of the remaining schedules depends on the test required of the applicant.


2.9.1 NSO Eligibility. An NSO applicant must pass one of the following two tests and complete the corresponding schedules.


(a) *Profit Protection Test.* The applicant must complete Schedules B.1 through B.7 to determine eligibility under the Profit Protection Test. Schedules B.1 and B.2 report the base case (without constant controls) revenue and cost forecast, respectively, and Schedule B.3 summarizes Schedules B.1 and B.2. Base case production forecasts should reflect any production curtailments associated with interim controls currently (preforecast) installed on smelters. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule B.6 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Profit Protection Test.


Schedule B.7 presents the calculations for the Profit Protection Test. The applicant enters the forecast profits from Schedules B.3 and B.6. The present value of the forecast profits is then computed for each case. If the present value of forecast pre-tax profits with constant controls is less than 50 percent of the present value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) the smelter passes the test and is eligible for an NSO. The smelter also passes the test if the present value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) is negative.


(b) *Rate of Return Test.* The applicant must complete Schedules B.4, B.5, and C.1 through C.5 to determine eligibility under the Rate of Return Test. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule C.1 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Rate of Return Test. Schedule C.2 reports forecast sustaining capital investment for the constant controls case. Schedule C.3 reports historical net investment for the most recent fiscal year expressed in constant dollars, i.e., dollars of the year in which the application is made.


Schedule C.4 presents the calculations for the Rate of Return Test. The applicant reports in Schedule C.4 the forecast cash flows from Schedules C.1 and C.2 and the horizon value from Schedule C.5, computes their present value, and subtracts the value of invested capital in constant dollars (taken from Schedule C.3) to yield net present value. If the net present value is less than zero, the smelter passes the test and is eligible to receive an NSO. This result indicates that the smelter is expected to earn a rate of return less than the industry average cost of capital.


2.9.2 Interim Control Waivers. An applicant for a waiver from interim controls must complete either a portion or all of Schedules D.1 through D.7, depending on whether the application is for a temporary or permanent waiver.


(a) *Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls Test.* The applicant must complete Schedules D.1 through D.3 to establish eligibility for a temporary waiver from interim controls. Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under the assumption of installation of interim constant control equipment and no installation of any additional SO_2_ controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2 and calculates gross operating profit. If gross operating profit is negative for any year during which the NSO is in effect, the applicant is eligible for a temporary waiver.


(b) *Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls Test.* The applicant must complete Schedules D.1 through D.7. All schedules except for Schedule D.5 must be completed twice, based on two alternative assumptions: (1) installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of any additional SO_2_ controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO, and closure of the smelter after January 1, 1988; and (2) installation of interim constant control equipment, installation of any additional SO_2_ controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued operation of the smelter after January 1, 1988.


Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under each assumption. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2, and Schedule D.4 reports forecast sustaining capital under each assumption. Schedule D.5 reports cash proceeds from liquidation.


Schedule D.6 presents the calculations for the permanent waiver test. In Schedule D.6, the applicant reports cash flow projections from Schedules D.3 and D.4 and the horizon value from Schedule D.7, computes their present value and subtracts the current salvage value (taken from Schedule D.5) to yield net present value. The higher of the two net present value figures computed under the two alternative assumptions must be used in the test. If the higher net present value figure is negative, the applicant is eligible for a permanent waiver.


2.10 Use of exhibits. In addition to data required by the schedules included in this application, the following information must be attached as exhibits.


2.10.1 Exhibit A. Background information on the firm's organizational structure and its associated accounting and financial reporting systems for primary nonferrous activities. This information must include, where applicable, the firm's:


(a) Operating association with an ownership control in consolidated subsidiaries, unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures and other affiliated companies.


(b) Organizational subdivision of its primary nonferrous activities into profit centers, cost centers and/or related financial reporting entities employed to control the operation of its mines, concentrators, smelters, refineries and other associated facilities.


(c) Material and product flows among the smelter subject to this NSO application, other integrated facilities and its affiliated suppliers and/or customers. In the case of integrated facilities, applicants must provide process flow diagrams depicting the operating interrelationships among its mines, concentrators, smelters, refineries and other integrated facilities. For both integrated and nonintegrated facilities, applicants also must describe the proportion contributed to its primary nonferrous activities by material purchases from and product sales to affiliated suppliers and customers.


(d) Annual operating capacity over the five most recent fiscal years for the smelter subject to this application. Operating capacity must be defined in terms of the total quantity of throughput that could have been processed with the available facilities after giving appropriate allowance to normal downtime requirements for maintenance and repairs. Operating capacity data also must consider both capacity balancing requirements among processing steps and annual processing yield rates attainable for each facility.


(e) Weighted average analysis of concentrates processed and tonnage produced annually over each of the five most recent fiscal years by the smelter subject to this application.


(f) Accounting system and policies for recording investment expenditures, operating revenues, operating costs and income taxes associated with its primary nonferrous activities. Applicants also must provide a complete description of allocation techniques employed for assigning investments, revenues, costs and taxes to individual profit, cost of departmental centers for which costs are accumulated. Applicants must further indicate the relationship of cost and/or departmental accounting entities to the firm's established profit centers.


(g) Annual five-year operating and capital expenditure plans (or budgets) by individual nonferrous profit center. These documents must include previous plans prepared for the five preceding fiscal years as well as the current one-year and five-year operating and capital expenditure plans. At least the current one-year and five-year plans must provide a specific breakdown of investment expenditures and operating costs associated with the operation and maintenance of each profit center's existing and proposed pollution control facilities.


2.10.2 Exhibit B. Supplemental description and explanation of items appearing in the financial reporting schedules. Other parts of Section 2 and the detailed instructions for the Schedules specify the information required in Exhibit B.

*General.* Use Schedule C.3 to report the end-of-period asset investments and current liabilities for the most recent fiscal year: (a) expressed in nominal dollars as of the date of the original transaction, and (b) expressed in the current year's dollars, i.e. 1984 dollars. The value of net investment in constant dollars (1984 dollars for smelters applying for an NSO in 1984) is used in Schedule C.4 as the benchmark of the Rate of Return Test.


Applicants should complete Schedule C.3 according to the following instructions. Transfer into the first column of Schedule C.3 the historical cost figures that are reported in the last (1983) column of Table A.4. In the second column of Schedule C.3, report the figures from the first column of Schedule C.3, expressed in constant (1984) dollars.


Convert each nominal dollar figure of the first column into constant (1984) dollars in accordance with the historical cost/constant dollar accounting method defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 33 (Docket Item No. IV-A-6d), with the following exception: the applicant must not report the lower recoverable amount as required by FASB No. 33.

Forecasts in Schedule D.6 shall be compatible with assumptions and forecasts in each set of Schedules D.1 through D.4. The line items in Schedule D.6 are explained in the following instructions.


*Line 01—Net Income from Operations.* Enter for each year the amounts reported in Schedule D.3, Line 24.


*Line 02—Net Income Adjustments.* Enter any adjustments to net income not included in Schedule D.3. When assuming closure after January 1, 1988, the applicant must include the proceeds from liquidation in 1988. The applicant must estimate liquidation value as of 1988 using one of two methods: (1) the applicant may complete Schedule D.5 assuming liquidation in 1988 and report the value of after-tax cash proceeds in Line 17; or (2) the applicant may use the value of after-tax cash proceeds in Line 17 of Schedule D.5, as already completed, assuming liquidation in the current (application) year, and expressing values in 1988 dollars. The current liquidation value must be inflated to 1988 dollars by applying the appropriate forecast percentage rate changes in the GNP price deflator. Attach explanatory supporting schedules in Exhibit B.


*Lines 03 and 04—Depreciation and Amortization.* Enter for each year the amounts reported in Schedule D.3, Lines 17 and 18, respectively.


*Line 05—Operating Cash Flow.* Enter for each year the total of amounts reported on Lines 01 through 04.


*Line 06—Pollution Controls Capital Investment.* Enter the estimated pollution control capital outlays projected to be made under the two alternative sets of assumptions described in the *General* section of this schedule. These controls shall include only interim control equipment for the first set of assumptions and both interim control equipment and any additional SO_2_ controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, for the second set of assumptions. The values assumed in this schedule shall correspond to the investment estimates shown in each set of supporting schedules for Line 17 of Schedule D.3. For purposes of allocating costs of the additional SO_2_ controls under the second set of assumptions, applicants must provide information establishing the period over which capital outlays for such controls would be made if installation of the controls begins the latest date that would still allow compliance to be achieved by January 2, 1988. Changes in working capital investment due to investment in control facilities may be added to the capital investment estimates shown in the corresponding supporting schedules for Schedule D.3.


*Line 07—Sustaining Capital.* Enter for each year the amounts reported in Schedule D.4, Line 07.


*Line 08—Total.* Enter for each year the sum of Lines 05 and 06.


*Line 09—Net Cash Flow Projections.* Enter for each year the difference between Lines 04 and 07.


*Line 10—Discount Factors.* Enter the discount factor for each year, computed as described in the instructions under Section 2.6.


*Line 11—Present Value of Future Cash Flows.* Enter for each year the product of Lines 08 and 09.


*Line 12—Horizon Value.* Enter under the Total column the estimated horizon value of the smelter reported in Schedule D.7, Line 16.


*Line 13—Discount Factor.* Enter under the Total column the appropriate discount factor, computed as described in the instructions under Section 2.6.


*Line 14—Present Value of Horizon Value.* Enter under the Total column the product of Lines 11 and 12.


*Line 15—Present Value of Future Cash Flows.* Enter under the Total column the sum of amounts previously reported on Line 10 for 1984 through 1990.


*Line 16—Total Present Value.* Enter the sum of Lines 13 and 14.


*Line 17—Current Salvage Value.* Enter the amount reported in Schedule D.5, Line 17, if the value is greater than zero. If the value is zero or less, enter zero.


*Line 18—Net Present Value.* Enter the difference between Lines 16 and 17. In determining eligibility for a permanent waiver from interim control requirements, an applicant must use the higher of the two net present value figures computed under the two alternative assumptions. Applicants reporting a negative value for the higher net present value figure will be eligible for a permanent waiver from interim use of a constant control system for sulfur dioxide emissions.


*General.* Use Schedule D.7 to calculate the horizon value of net cash flow projections for the Interim Controls Test. This horizon value is used in Schedule D.6. The computation of the horizon value is different for this test than for the Profit Protection Test because this test requires the reporting of depreciation for tax purposes.


In Schedule D.7, the applicant removes the tax savings of control equipment depreciation from the cash flows for the last two forecast years. A depreciation-free horizon value is then calculated from these depreciation-free cash flows. The tax savings of constant controls depreciation during the horizon years are then calculated separately. The final horizon value is equal to the sum of the depreciation-free horizon value and the tax savings from depreciation of constant controls accruing over the horizon years. The line items in Schedule D.7 are explained in the following instruction.


*Line 01—Net Cash Flow Projections.* Enter for each of the final two forecast years the values in Schedule D.6, Line 09, for the corresponding years.


*Line 02—Depreciation and Amortization.* Enter for each of the final two forecast years the value in Schedule D.6, Line 03, for the corresponding years.


*Line 03—Marginal Tax Rate.* Enter for each of the final two forecast years the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.


*Line 04—Tax Savings.* Enter for each of the final two forecast years the product of Lines 02 and 03.


*Line 05—Nominal Dollar Values.* Enter for each of the final two forecast years the difference between Lines 01 and 04.


*Line 06—1990 Dollar Values.* For each of the final two forecast years the nominal dollar values must be expressed in the last forecast year's dollars (1990 dollars). Transfer the 1990 amount in Line 05 directly to Line 06. Inflate the 1989 amount to 1990 dollars using the forecast GNP price deflator.


*Line 07—Average.* Enter under the Total column the average of the two values in Line 06.


*Line 08—Horizon Factor.* Enter under the Total column the horizon factor provided in Section 2.7.


*Line 09—Depreciation-free Horizon Value.* Enter under the Total column the product of Lines 07 and 08.


*Line 10—Depreciation and Amortization.* Enter for each year of the horizon period depreciation charges associated with the smelter's investment in equipment and facilities related to pollution controls. These investments should include those actually made and those forecast to be made by the end of the forecast period. Reported charges should be computed in accordance with depreciation and amortization methods adopted for tax reporting purposes by the firm. Attach as part of exhibit B supporting schedules consistent with those supporting Line 17 in Schedule D.3.


*Line 11—Marginal Tax Rate.* Enter for each year of the horizon period the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.


*Line 12—Tax Savings.* Enter for each year of the horizon period the product of Lines 10 and 11.


*Line 13—Discount Factors.* Enter the discount factor for each year of the horizon period. This shall be computed according to the instructions under Section 2.6, except that the variable N found in the discount factor formula represents the number of years in the future, *counting from the last forecast year.* For example, N = 1 for the first year of the horizon period.


*Line 14—Present Value of Tax Savings.* Enter for each year of the horizon period the product of Lines 12 and 13.


*Line 15—Total Present Value of Tax Savings.* Enter under the Total column the sum of values on Line 14 for the horizon years.


*Line 16—Horizon Value.* Enter under the Total column the sum of Lines 09 and 15.
