Each NSO shall require an interim level of sulfur dioxide constant controls to be operated at the smelter, unless a waiver of this requirement has been granted to the owner under subpart H of this part.

The NSO shall require the following gas streams to be treated by interim constant controls:


(a) In copper smelters, off-gases from fluidized bed roasters, flash furnaces, NORANDA reactors, electric furnaces and copper converters;


(b) In lead smelters, off-gases from the front end of the sintering machine and any other sinter gases which are recirculated;


(c) In zinc smelters, off-gases from mult-hearth roasters, flash roasters and fluidized bed roasters; and


(d) In all primary nonferrous smelters, all other strong SO_2_ streams.


(e) In all primary nonferrous smelters, any other process streams which were regularly or intermittently treated by constant controls at the smelter as of August 7, 1977.
