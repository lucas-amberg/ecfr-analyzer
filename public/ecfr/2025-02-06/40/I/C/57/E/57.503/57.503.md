# § 57.503   Control measures.

The NSO of any smelter subject to the requirements of § 57.502(b) shall be amended, if necessary, within 6 months of EPA's receipt of the analysis specified in § 57.502(b), as provided in § 57.704(c) to implement the requirement of § 57.501. Measures required to be implemented may include:


(a) *Additional supplementary control.* The use of the supplementary control system, if the additional use of the system does not interfere with the smelter owner's ability to meet the requirements of subpart D; and


(b) *Engineering and maintenance techniques.* The use of engineering and maintenance techniques to detect and prevent leaks and capture and vent fugitive emissions through appropriate stacks. These techniques include but are not limited to:


(1) For reactors, installation and proper operation of primary hoods;


(2) For roasters, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all hot calcine transfer points;


(3) For furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active matte tap holes, matte launders, slag skim bays, and transfer points;


(4) For converters, installation and proper operation of primary hoods for blowing operations, and where appropriate, secondary hoods for charging and pouring operations;


(5) For sintering machines, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on the sinter bed, all hot sinter ignition points, all concentrate laydown points, and all hot sinter transfer points;


(6) For blast furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active slag and lead bullion furnace tap holes and transfer points;


(7) For dross reverberatory furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active charging and discharging points;


(8) Maintenance of all ducts, flues and stacks in a leak-free condition to the maximum extent possible;


(9) Maintenance of all process equipment under normal operating conditions in such a fashion that out-leakage of fugitive gases will be prevented to the maximum extent possible;


(10) Secondary or tertiary hooding on process equipment where necessary; and


(11) Partial or complete building evacuation as appropriate.
