# § 57.803   Issuance of tentative determination; notice.

(a) *Tentative determination.* (1) The EPA staff shall formulate and prepare:


(i) A “Staff Computational Analysis,” using the financial information submitted by the smelter owner under § 57.802 to evaluate the economic circumstances of the smelter for which the waiver is sought;


(ii) A tentative determination as to whether an interim requirement for the use of constant controls would be so costly as to necessitate permanent or prolonged temporary cessation of operations at the smelter for which the waiver is requested. The tentative determination shall contain a “Proposed Report and Findings” summarizing the conclusions reached in the Staff Computational Analysis, discussing the estimated cost of interim controls, and assessing the effect upon the smelter of requiring those controls. The tentative determination shall also contain a proposed recommendation that the waiver be granted or denied, based upon the Proposed Report and Findings, and stating any additional considerations supporting the proposed recommendation. This tentative determination shall be a public document.


(2) In preparing the Proposed Report and Findings, the EPA staff shall attempt to the maximum extent feasible to avoid revealing confidential information which, if revealed, might damage the legitimate business interests of the applicant. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, the tentative determination shall be accompanied by a listing of all materials considered by EPA staff in developing the tentative determination. Subject to the provisions of § 57.814(a), full copies of all such materials shall be included in the administrative record under § 57.814, except that, to the extent the material consists of published material which is generally available, full citations to that material may be given instead.


(b) *Public notice.* Public notice of EPA's tentative determination to grant or deny an application for a waiver shall be given by:


(1) Publication at least once in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the smelter is located; and


(2) Posting in the principal office of the municipality in which the smelter is located.


(c) *Individual notice.* Individual notice of EPA's tentative determination to grant or deny an application for a waiver shall be mailed to the smelter owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and to the air pollution control agency for the State in which the smelter is located.


(d) *Request for individual notice.* EPA shall mail notice of its tentative determination to grant or deny an application for waiver to any person upon request. Each such request shall be submitted to the Administrator in writing, shall state that the request is for individual notice of tentative determination to grant or deny any application for a waiver under section 119(d) of the Clean Air Act, and shall describe the notice or types of notices desired (e.g., all notices, notices for a particular Region, notices for a particular State, notice for a particular city).


(e) *Form of notice.* The notice of tentative determination required to be distributed under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall include, in addition to any other materials, the following:


(1) A summary of the information contained in appendix A;


(2) The tentative determination prepared under paragraph (a) of this section: Provided, that except in the case of the smelter owner, a summary of the basis for the grant or denial of the waiver may be provided in lieu of the formal determinations required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section;


(3) A brief description of the procedures set forth in § 57.804 for requesting a public hearing on the waiver request, including a statement that such request must be filed within 30 days of the date of the notice;


(4) A statement that written comments on the tentative determination submitted to EPA within 60 days of the date of the notice will be considered by EPA in making a final decision on the application; and


(5) The location of the administrative record and the location at which interested persons may obtain further information on the tentative determination, including a copy of the index to the record, the tentative determination prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, and any other nonconfidential record materials.
