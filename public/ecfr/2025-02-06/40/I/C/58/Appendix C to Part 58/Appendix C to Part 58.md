# Appendix C to Part 58—Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Methodology






This appendix specifies the criteria pollutant monitoring methods (manual methods or automated analyzers) which must be used in SLAMS and NCore stations that are a subset of SLAMS. 


2.1 Except as otherwise provided in this appendix, a criteria pollutant monitoring method used for making NAAQS decisions at a SLAMS site must be a reference or equivalent method as defined in § 50.1 of this chapter.


2.1.1 Any NO_2_ FRM or FEM used for making primary NAAQS decisions must be capable of providing hourly averaged concentration data.


2.2 PM_10_, PM_2.5_, or PM_10-2.5_ continuous FEMs with existing valid designations may be calibrated using network data from collocated FRM and continuous FEM data under the following provisions:


2.2.1 Data to demonstrate a calibration may include valid data from State, local, or Tribal air agencies or data collected by instrument manufacturers in accordance with 40 CFR 53.35 or other data approved by the Administrator.


2.2.2 A request to update a designated methods calibration may be initiated by the instrument manufacturer of record or the EPA Administrator. State, local, Tribal, and multijurisdictional organizations of these entities may work with an instrument manufacture to update a designated method calibration.


2.2.3 Requests for approval of an updated PM_10_, PM_2.5_, or PM_10-2.5_ continuous FEM calibration must meet the general submittal requirements of section 2.7 of this appendix.


2.2.4 Data included in the request should represent a subset of representative locations where the method is operational. For cases with a small number of collocated FRMs and continuous FEMs sites, an updated candidate calibration may be limited to the sites where both methods are in use.


2.2.5 Data included in a candidate method updated calibration may include a subset of sites where there is a large grouping of sites in one part of the country such that the updated calibration would be representative of the country as a whole.


2.2.6 Improvements should be national in scope and ideally implemented through a firmware change.


2.2.7 The goal of a change to a methods calibration is to increase the number of sites meeting measurements quality objectives of the method as identified in section 2.3.1.1 of appendix A to this part.


2.2.8 For meeting measurement quality objectives (MQOs), the primary objective is to meet the bias goal as this statistic will likely have the most influence on improving the resultant data collected.


2.2.9 Precision data are to be included, but so long as precision data are at least as good as existing network data or meet the MQO referenced in section 2.2.8 of this appendix, no further work is necessary with precision.


2.2.10 Data available to use may include routine primary and collocated data.


2.2.11 Audit data may be useful to confirm the performance of a candidate updated calibration but should not be used as the basis of the calibration to keep the independence of the audit data.


2.2.12 Data utilized as the basis of the updated calibration may be obtained by accessing EPA's AQS database or future analogous EPA database.


2.2.13 Years of data to use in a candidate method calibration should include two recent years where we are past the certification period for the previous year's data, which is May 1 of each year.


2.2.14 Data from additional years is to be used to test an updated calibration such that the calibration is independent of the test years of interest. Data from these additional years need to minimally demonstrate that a larger number of sites are expected to meet bias MQO especially at sites near the level of the NAAQS for the PM indicator of interest.


2.2.15 Outliers may be excluded using routine outlier tests.


2.2.16 The range of data used in a calibration may include all data available or alternatively use data in the range from the lowest measured data available up to 125% of the 24-hour NAAQS for the PM indicator of interest.


2.2.17 Other improvements to a PM continuous method may be included as part of a recommended update so long as appropriate testing is conducted with input from EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) Reference and Equivalent (R&E) Methods Designation program.


2.2.18 EPA encourages early communication by instrument manufacturers considering an update to a PM method. Instrument companies should initiate such dialogue by contacting EPA's ORD R&E Methods Designation program. The contact information for this can be found at 40 CFR 53.4.


2.2.19 Manufacturers interested in improving instrument's performance through an updated factory calibration must submit a written modification request to EPA with supporting rationale. Because the testing requirements and acceptance criteria of any field and/or lab tests can depend upon the nature and extent of the intended modification, applicants should contact EPA's R&E Methods Designation program for guidance prior to development of the modification request.


2.3 Any manual method or analyzer purchased prior to cancellation of its reference or equivalent method designation under § 53.11 or § 53.16 of this chapter may be used at a SLAMS site following cancellation for a reasonable period of time to be determined by the Administrator.


2.4-2.5 [Reserved]


2.6 Use of Methods With Higher, Nonconforming Ranges in Certain Geographical Areas.


2.6.1 [Reserved]


2.6.2 An analyzer may be used (indefinitely) on a range which extends to concentrations higher than two times the upper limit specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter if:


2.6.2.1 The analyzer has more than one selectable range and has been designated as a reference or equivalent method on at least one of its ranges, or has been approved for use under section 2.5 (which applies to analyzers purchased before February 18, 1975);


2.6.2.2 The pollutant intended to be measured with the analyzer is likely to occur in concentrations more than two times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter in the geographical area in which use of the analyzer is proposed; and


2.6.2.3 The Administrator determines that the resolution of the range or ranges for which approval is sought is adequate for its intended use. For purposes of this section (2.6), “resolution” means the ability of the analyzer to detect small changes in concentration.


2.6.3 Requests for approval under section 2.6.2 of this appendix must meet the submittal requirements of section 2.7. Except as provided in section 2.7.3 of this appendix, each request must contain the information specified in section 2.7.2 in addition to the following:


2.6.3.1 The range or ranges proposed to be used;


2.6.3.2 Test data, records, calculations, and test results as specified in section 2.7.2.2 of this appendix for each range proposed to be used;


2.6.3.3 An identification and description of the geographical area in which use of the analyzer is proposed;


2.6.3.4 Data or other information demonstrating that the pollutant intended to be measured with the analyzer is likely to occur in concentrations more than two times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter in the geographical area in which use of the analyzer is proposed; and


2.6.3.5 Test data or other information demonstrating the resolution of each proposed range that is broader than that permitted by section 2.5 of this appendix.


2.6.4 Any person who has obtained approval of a request under this section (2.6.2) shall assure that the analyzer for which approval was obtained is used only in the geographical area identified in the request and only while operated in the range or ranges specified in the request.


2.7 Requests for Approval; Withdrawal of Approval.


2.7.1 Requests for approval under section 2.2, 2.6.2, or 2.8 of this appendix must be submitted to: Director, Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling, Reference and Equivalent Methods Designation Program (MD-D205-03), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, P.O. Box 12055, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711.


2.7.2 Except as provided in section 2.7.3 of this appendix, each request must contain:


2.7.2.1 A statement identifying the analyzer (e.g., by serial number) and the method of which the analyzer is representative (e.g., by manufacturer and model number); and


2.7.2.2 Test data, records, calculations, and test results for the analyzer (or the method of which the analyzer is representative) as specified in subpart B, subpart C, or both (as applicable) of part 53 of this chapter.


2.7.3 A request may concern more than one analyzer or geographical area and may incorporate by reference any data or other information known to EPA from one or more of the following:


2.7.3.1 An application for a reference or equivalent method determination submitted to EPA for the method of which the analyzer is representative, or testing conducted by the applicant or by EPA in connection with such an application;


2.7.3.2 Testing of the method of which the analyzer is representative at the initiative of the Administrator under § 53.7 of this chapter; or


2.7.3.3 A previous or concurrent request for approval submitted to EPA under this section (2.7).


2.7.4 To the extent that such incorporation by reference provides data or information required by this section (2.7) or by section 2.5 or 2.6 of this appendix, independent data or duplicative information need not be submitted.


2.7.5 After receiving a request under this section (2.7), the Administrator may request such additional testing or information or conduct such tests as may be necessary in his judgment for a decision on the request.


2.7.6 If the Administrator determines, on the basis of any available information, that any of the determinations or statements on which approval of a request under this section was based are invalid or no longer valid, or that the requirements of section 2.5 or 2.6, as applicable, have not been met, he/she may withdraw the approval after affording the person who obtained the approval an opportunity to submit information and arguments opposing such action.


2.8 Modifications of Methods by Users.


2.8.1 Except as otherwise provided in this section, no reference method or equivalent method may be used in a SLAMS network if it has been modified in a manner that could significantly alter the performance characteristics of the method without prior approval by the Administrator. For purposes of this section, “alternative method” means an analyzer, the use of which has been approved under section 2.5 or 2.6 of this appendix or some combination thereof.


2.8.2 Requests for approval under this section (2.8) must meet the submittal requirements of sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2.1 of this appendix.


2.8.3 Each request submitted under this section (2.8) must include:


2.8.3.1 A description, in such detail as may be appropriate, of the desired modification;


2.8.3.2 A brief statement of the purpose(s) of the modification, including any reasons for considering it necessary or advantageous;


2.8.3.3 A brief statement of belief concerning the extent to which the modification will or may affect the performance characteristics of the method; and


2.8.3.4 Such further information as may be necessary to explain and support the statements required by sections 2.8.3.2 and 2.8.3.3.


2.8.4 The Administrator will approve or disapprove the modification by letter to the person or agency requesting such approval within 75 days after receiving a request for approval under this section and any further information that the applicant may be asked to provide.


2.8.5 A temporary modification that could alter the performance characteristics of a reference or equivalent may be made without prior approval under this section if the method is not functioning or is malfunctioning, provided that parts necessary for repair in accordance with the applicable operation manual cannot be obtained within 45 days. Unless such temporary modification is later approved under section 2.8.4 of this appendix, the temporarily modified method shall be repaired in accordance with the applicable operation manual as quickly as practicable but in no event later than 4 months after the temporary modification was made, unless an extension of time is granted by the Administrator. Unless and until the temporary modification is approved, air quality data obtained with the method as temporarily modified must be clearly identified as such when submitted in accordance with § 58.16 and must be accompanied by a report containing the information specified in section 2.8.3 of this appendix. A request that the Administrator approve a temporary modification may be submitted in accordance with sections 2.8.1 through 2.8.4 of this appendix. In such cases, the request will be considered as if a request for prior approval had been made.


2.9 Use of IMPROVE Samplers at a SLAMS Site. “IMPROVE” samplers may be used in SLAMS for monitoring of regional background and regional transport concentrations of fine particulate matter. The IMPROVE samplers were developed for use in the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network to characterize all of the major components and many trace constituents of the particulate matter that impair visibility in Federal Class I Areas. Descriptions of the IMPROVE samplers and the data they collect are available in references 4, 5, and 6 of this appendix.


2.10 *Use of Pb-PM*_10_*at SLAMS Sites.*

2.10.1 The EPA Regional Administrator may approve the use of a Pb-PM _10_ FRM or Pb-PM _10_ FEM sampler in lieu of a Pb-TSP sampler as part of the network plan required under part 58.10(a)(4) in the following cases.


2.10.1.1 Pb-PM _10_ samplers can be approved for use at the non-source-oriented sites required under paragraph 4.5(b) of Appendix D to part 58 if there is no existing monitoring data indicating that the maximum arithmetic 3-month mean Pb concentration (either Pb-TSP or Pb-PM _10_) at the site was equal to or greater than 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter during the previous 3 years.


2.10.1.2 Pb-PM _10_ samplers can be approved for use at source-oriented sites required under paragraph 4.5(a) if the monitoring agency can demonstrate (through modeling or historic monitoring data from the last 3 years) that Pb concentrations (either Pb-TSP or Pb-PM _10_) will not equal or exceed 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter on an arithmetic 3-month mean and the source is expected to emit a substantial majority of its Pb in the fraction of PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.


2.10.2 The approval of a Pb-PM _10_ sampler in lieu of a Pb-TSP sampler as allowed for in paragraph 2.10.1 above will be revoked if measured Pb-PM _10_ concentrations equal or exceed 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter on an arithmetic 3-month mean. Monitoring agencies will have up to 6 months from the end of the 3-month period in which the arithmetic 3-month Pb-PM _10_ mean concentration equaled or exceeded 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter to install and begin operation of a Pb-TSP sampler at the site. 


3.1 Methods employed in NCore multipollutant sites used to measure SO_2_, CO, NO_2_, O_3_, PM_2.5_, or PM_10-2.5_ must be reference or equivalent methods as defined in § 50.1 of this chapter for any monitors intended for comparison with applicable NAAQS.


3.2 If alternative SO_2_, CO, NO_2_, O_3_, PM _2.5_, or PM _10-2.5_ monitoring methodologies are proposed for monitors not intended for NAAQS comparison, such techniques must be detailed in the network description required by § 58.10 and subsequently approved by the Administrator. Examples of locations that are not intended to be compared to the NAAQS may be rural background and transport sites or areas where the concentration of the pollutant is so low that it would be more useful to operate a higher sensitivity method that is not an FRM or FEM. 


4.1 Methods used for O_3_ monitoring at PAMS must be automated reference or equivalent methods as defined in § 50.1 of this chapter.


4.2 Methods used for NO, NO_2_ and NO_X_ monitoring at PAMS should be automated reference or equivalent methods as defined for NO_2_ in § 50.1 of this chapter. If alternative NO, NO_2_ or NO_X_ monitoring methodologies are proposed, such techniques must be detailed in the network description required by § 58.10 and subsequently approved by the Administrator.


4.3 Methods for meteorological measurements and speciated VOC monitoring are included in the guidance provided in references 2 and 3 of this appendix. If alternative VOC monitoring methodology (including the use of new or innovative technologies), which is not included in the guidance, is proposed, it must be detailed in the network description required by § 58.10 and subsequently approved by the Administrator. 


5.1 For short-term measurements of PM _10_ during air pollution episodes (see § 51.152 of this chapter) the measurement method must be:


5.1.1 Either the “Staggered PM _10_” method or the “PM _10_ Sampling Over Short Sampling Times” method, both of which are based on the reference method for PM _10_ and are described in reference 1: or


5.1.2 Any other method for measuring PM _10_:


5.1.2.1 Which has a measurement range or ranges appropriate to accurately measure air pollution episode concentration of PM _10_,


5.1.2.2 Which has a sample period appropriate for short-term PM _10_ measurements, and


5.1.2.3 For which a quantitative relationship to a reference or equivalent method for PM _10_ has been established at the use site. Procedures for establishing a quantitative site-specific relationship are contained in reference 1.


5.2 PM _10_ methods other than the reference method are not covered under the quality assessment requirements of appendix to this part. Therefore, States must develop and implement their own quality assessment procedures for those methods allowed under this section 4. These quality assessment procedures should be similar or analogous to those described in section 3 of appendix A to this part for the PM _10_ reference method.
