(6) The monitoring objective and spatial scale of representativeness for each monitor as defined in appendix D to this part.


(7) The identification of any sites that are suitable and sites that are not suitable for comparison against the annual PM _2.5_ NAAQS as described in ยง 58.30.


(8) The MSA, CBSA, CSA or other area represented by the monitor.


(9) The designation of any Pb monitors as either source-oriented or non-source-oriented according to Appendix D to 40 CFR part 58.


(10) Any monitors for which a waiver has been requested or granted by the EPA Regional Administrator as allowed for under appendix D or appendix E to this part. For those monitors where a waiver has been approved, the annual monitoring network plan shall include the date the waiver was approved.


(11) Any source-oriented or non-source-oriented site for which a waiver has been requested or granted by the EPA Regional Administrator for the use of Pb-PM _10_ monitoring in lieu of Pb-TSP monitoring as allowed for under paragraph 2.10 of Appendix C to 40 CFR part 58.

(13) The identification of any PM_2.5_ FEMs used in the monitoring agency's network where the data are not of sufficient quality such that data are not to be compared to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). For required SLAMS where the agency identifies that the PM_2.5_ Class III FEM does not produce data of sufficient quality for comparison to the NAAQS, the monitoring agency must ensure that an operating FRM or filter-based FEM meeting the sample frequency requirements described in ยง 58.12 or other Class III PM_2.5_ FEM with data of sufficient quality is operating and reporting data to meet the network design criteria described in appendix D to this part.


(14) The identification of any site(s) intended to address being sited in an at-risk community where there are anticipated effects from sources in the area as required in section 4.7.1(b)(3) of appendix D to this part. An initial approach to the question of whether any new or moved sites are needed and to identify the communities in which they intend to add monitoring for meeting the requirement in this paragraph (b)(14), if applicable, shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of section 4.7.1(b)(3) of appendix D to this part, which includes submission to the EPA Regional Administrator no later than July 1, 2024. Specifics on the resulting proposed new or moved sites for PM_2.5_ network design to address at-risk communities, if applicable, would need to be detailed in annual monitoring network plans due to each applicable EPA Regional office no later than July 1, 2025. The plan shall provide for any required sites to be operational no later than 24 months from date of approval of a plan or January 1, 2027, whichever comes first.


(c) The annual monitoring network plan must document how state and local agencies provide for the review of changes to a PM _2.5_ monitoring network that impact the location of a violating PM _2.5_ monitor. The affected state or local agency must document the process for obtaining public comment and include any comments received through the public notification process within their submitted plan.


(d) The State, or where applicable local, agency shall perform and submit to the EPA Regional Administrator an assessment of the air quality surveillance system every 5 years to determine, at a minimum, if the network meets the monitoring objectives defined in appendix D to this part, whether new sites are needed, whether existing sites are no longer needed and can be terminated, and whether new technologies are appropriate for incorporation into the ambient air monitoring network. The network assessment must consider the ability of existing and proposed sites to support air quality characterization for areas with relatively high populations of susceptible individuals (*e.g.,* children with asthma) and other at-risk populations, and, for any sites that are being proposed for discontinuance, the effect on data users other than the agency itself, such as nearby States and Tribes or health effects studies. The State, or where applicable local, agency must submit a copy of this 5-year assessment, along with a revised annual network plan, to the Regional Administrator. The assessments are due every 5 years beginning July 1, 2010.


(e) All proposed additions and discontinuations of SLAMS monitors in annual monitoring network plans and periodic network assessments are subject to approval according to ยง 58.14.
