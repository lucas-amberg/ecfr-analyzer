If no distributor is named on the label, the manufacturer or importer must maintain the specified records. The records must be retained for at least 3 years and must be in a form suitable and readily available for inspection and review.

(3) By providing this written certification to the Administrator, the certifying manufacturer accepts responsibility for compliance with the recordkeeping requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section with respect to any products covered by the written certification.

Upon expiration of the notice period, the regulated entity must assume responsibility for maintaining the records specified in this paragraph. Written certifications and revocation statements, to the Administrator from the certifying manufacturer shall be signed by the responsible official of the certifying manufacturer, provide the name and address of the certifying manufacturer, and be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional Office at the addresses listed in § 59.210 of this subpart. Such written certifications are not transferable by the manufacturer.
