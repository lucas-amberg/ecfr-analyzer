# § 59.506   How do I demonstrate compliance if I manufacture multi-component kits?

(a) If you manufacture multi-component kits as defined in § 59.503, then the Kit PWR must not exceed the Total Reactivity Limit.


(b) You must calculate the Kit PWR and the Total Reactivity Limit as follows:


(1) KIT PWR = (PWR_(1)_ × W_1_) + (PWR_(2)_ × W_2_) + . ... + (PWR_(n)_ × W_n_)


(2) Total Reactivity Limit = (RL_1_ × W_1_) + (RL_2_ × W_2_) + ... + (RL_n_ × W_n_).


(3) Kit PWR ≤Total Reactivity Limit.
