# § 59.508   What test methods must I use?

(a) Except as provided in § 59.505(c), you must use the procedures in CARB Method 310 (2018) (incorporated by reference, see § 59.515) or EPA's Method 311 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) to determine the speciated ingredients and weight percentage of each ingredient of each aerosol coating product. EPA Method 311 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) must be used in conjunction with ASTM Method D3063-94 or D3074-94 for analysis of the propellant portion of the coating. Those choosing to use CARB Method 310 (2018) must follow the procedures specified in section 5.0 of that method with the exception of section 5.3.1, which requires the analysis of the VOC content of the coating. For the purposes of this subpart, you are not required to determine the VOC content of the aerosol coating. For both CARB Method 310 (2018) and EPA Method 311 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), you must have a listing of the VOC ingredients in the coating before conducting the analysis.


(b) To determine the metal content of metallic aerosol coating products, you must use SCAQMD Method 318-95 (incorporated by reference, see § 59.515).


(c) To determine the specular gloss of flat and non-flat coatings, you must use ASTM Method D523-08 (incorporated by reference, see § 59.515).
