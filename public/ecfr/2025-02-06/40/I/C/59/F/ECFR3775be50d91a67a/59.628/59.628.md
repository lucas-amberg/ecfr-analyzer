# § 59.628   What records must I keep and what reports must I send to EPA?

(a) Organize and maintain the following records:


(1) A copy of all applications and any other information you send us.


(2) Any of the information we specify in § 59.623 that you were not required to include in your application.


(3) A detailed history of each emission-data unit. For each emission-data unit, include all of the following:


(i) The emission-data unit's construction, including its origin and buildup, steps you took to ensure that it represents production containers, any components you built specially for it, and all the components you include in your application for certification.


(ii) All your emission tests, including documentation on routine and standard tests, as specified in §§ 59.650 through 59.653, and the date and purpose of each test.


(iii) All tests to diagnose emission-control performance, giving the date and time of each and the reasons for the test.


(iv) Any other relevant events or information.


(4) Production figures for each emission family divided by assembly plant.


(5) If you identify your portable fuel containers by lot number or other identification numbers, keep a record of these numbers for all the containers you produce under each certificate of conformity.


(b) Keep required data from emission tests and all other information specified in this subpart for five years after we issue the associated certificate of conformity. If you use the same emission data or other information for a later production period, the five-year period restarts with each new production period if you continue to rely on the information.


(c) Store these records in any format and on any media, as long as you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review them at any time.


(d) Send us copies of any maintenance instructions or explanations if we ask for them.


(e) Send us an annual warranty report summarizing successful warranty claims by emission family under § 59.612, including the reason for the claim. You must submit the report by July 1 for the preceding calendar year.
