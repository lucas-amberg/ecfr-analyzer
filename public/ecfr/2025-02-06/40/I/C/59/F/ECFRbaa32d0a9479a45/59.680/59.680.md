*Act* means the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.


*Adjustable parameter* means any device, system, or element of design that someone can adjust and that, if adjusted, may affect emissions. You may ask us to exclude a parameter if you show us that it will not be adjusted in use in a way that affects emissions.


*Certification* means relating to the process of obtaining a certificate of conformity for an emission family that complies with the emission standards and requirements in this subpart.


*Configuration* means a unique combination of hardware (material, geometry, and size) and calibration within an emission family. Units within a single configuration differ only with respect to normal production variability.


*Container* means portable fuel container.


*Designated Compliance Officer* means the Manager, Engine Programs Group (6403-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.


*Designated Enforcement Officer* means the Director, Air Enforcement Division (2242A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.,Washington, DC 20460.


*Emission-control system* means any device, system, or element of design that controls or reduces the regulated evaporative emissions from.


*Emission-data unit* means a portable fuel container that is tested for certification. This includes components tested by EPA.


*Emission-related maintenance* means maintenance that substantially affects emissions or is likely to substantially affect emission deterioration.


*Emission family* has the meaning given in ยง 59.625.


*Evaporative* means relating to fuel emissions that result from permeation of fuel through the portable fuel container materials and from ventilation of the container.


*Good engineering judgment* means judgments made consistent with generally accepted scientific and engineering principles and all available relevant information. See ยง 59.603 for the administrative process we use to evaluate good engineering judgment.


*Hydrocarbon (HC)* means total hydrocarbon (THC).


*Manufacture* means the physical and engineering process of designing and/or constructing a portable fuel container.


*Manufacturer* means any person who manufactures a portable fuel container for sale in the United States.


*Nominal capacity* means the expected volumetric working capacity of a container.


*Official emission result* means the measured emission rate for an emission-data unit.


*Portable fuel container* means a reusable container of any color that is designed and marketed or otherwise intended for use by consumers for receiving, transporting, storing, and dispensing gasoline, diesel fuel, or kerosene. For the purposes of this subpart, all utility jugs that are red, yellow, or blue in color are deemed to be portable fuel containers, regardless of how they are labeled or marketed.


*Production period* means the period in which a portable fuel container will be produced under a certificate of conformity. The maximum production period is five years.


*Revoke* means to terminate the certificate or an exemption for an emission family. If we revoke a certificate or exemption, you must apply for a new certificate or exemption before continuing to introduce the affected containers into commerce. This does not apply to containers you no longer possess.


*Round* has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1065.1001.


*Suspend* means to temporarily discontinue the certificate or an exemption for an emission family. If we suspend a certificate, you may not introduce into commerce portable fuel containers from that emission family unless we reinstate the certificate or approve a new one. If we suspend an exemption, you may not introduce into commerce containers that were previously covered by the exemption unless we reinstate the exemption.


*Total hydrocarbon* means the combined mass of organic compounds measured by the specified procedure for measuring total hydrocarbon, expressed as a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen-to-carbon mass ratio of 1.85:1.


*Ultimate purchaser* means, with respect to any portable fuel container, the first person who in good faith purchases such a container for purposes other than resale.


*Ultraviolet light* means electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 300 and 400 nanometers.


*United States* means the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.


*U.S.-directed production volume* means the amount of portable fuel containers, subject to the requirements of this subpart, produced by a manufacturer for which the manufacturer has a reasonable assurance that sale was or will be made to ultimate purchasers in the United States.


*Useful life* means the period during which a portable fuel container is required to comply with all applicable emission standards. See ยง 59.611.


*Void* means to invalidate a certificate or an exemption *ab initio* (i.e. retroactively). Portable fuel containers introduced into U.S. commerce under the voided certificate or exemption is a violation of this subpart, whether or not they were introduced before the certificate or exemption was voided.


*We (us, our)* means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and any authorized representatives.
