# § 60.2   Definitions.

The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows: 


*Act* means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 *et seq.*) 


*Administrator* means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or his authorized representative. 


*Affected facility* means, with reference to a stationary source, any apparatus to which a standard is applicable. 


*Alternative method* means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant which is not a reference or equivalent method but which has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to, in specific cases, produce results adequate for his determination of compliance. 


*Approved permit program* means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to Title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).


*Capital expenditure* means an expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing facility which exceeds the product of the applicable “annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage” specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 534 and the existing facility's basis, as defined by section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing facility must not be reduced by any “excluded additions” as defined in IRS Publication 534, as would be done for tax purposes. 


*Clean coal technology demonstration project* means a project using funds appropriated under the heading ‘Department of Energy-Clean Coal Technology’, up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstrations of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. 


*Commenced* means, with respect to the definition of *new source* in section 111(a)(2) of the Act, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or modification or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification. 


*Construction* means fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected facility. 


*Continuous monitoring system* means the total equipment, required under the emission monitoring sections in applicable subparts, used to sample and condition (if applicable), to analyze, and to provide a permanent record of emissions or process parameters. 


*Electric utility steam generating unit* means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale. Any steam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose of providing steam to a steam-electric generator that would produce electrical energy for sale is also considered in determining the electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility. 


*Equivalent method* means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant which has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to have a consistent and quantitatively known relationship to the reference method, under specified conditions. 


*Excess Emissions and Monitoring Systems Performance Report* is a report that must be submitted periodically by a source in order to provide data on its compliance with stated emission limits and operating parameters, and on the performance of its monitoring systems.


*Existing facility* means, with reference to a stationary source, any apparatus of the type for which a standard is promulgated in this part, and the construction or modification of which was commenced before the date of proposal of that standard; or any apparatus which could be altered in such a way as to be of that type. 


*Force majeure* means, for purposes of § 60.8, an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying with the regulatory requirement to conduct performance tests within the specified timeframe despite the affected facility's best efforts to fulfill the obligation. Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility.


*Isokinetic sampling* means sampling in which the linear velocity of the gas entering the sampling nozzle is equal to that of the undisturbed gas stream at the sample point. 


*Issuance* of a part 70 permit will occur, if the State is the permitting authority, in accordance with the requirements of part 70 of this chapter and the applicable, approved State permit program. When the EPA is the permitting authority, issuance of a Title V permit occurs immediately after the EPA takes final action on the final permit. 


*Malfunction* means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. 


*Modification* means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, an existing facility which increases the amount of any air pollutant (to which a standard applies) emitted into the atmosphere by that facility or which results in the emission of any air pollutant (to which a standard applies) into the atmosphere not previously emitted. 


*Monitoring device* means the total equipment, required under the monitoring of operations sections in applicable subparts, used to measure and record (if applicable) process parameters. 


*Nitrogen oxides* means all oxides of nitrogen except nitrous oxide, as measured by test methods set forth in this part. 


*One-hour period* means any 60-minute period commencing on the hour. 


*Opacity* means the degree to which emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure the view of an object in the background. 


*Owner or operator* means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises an affected facility or a stationary source of which an affected facility is a part. 


*Part 70 permit* means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant to part 70 of this chapter. 


*Particulate matter* means any finely divided solid or liquid material, other than uncombined water, as measured by the reference methods specified under each applicable subpart, or an equivalent or alternative method.


*Permit program* means a comprehensive State operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in this chapter. 


*Permitting authority* means: 


(1) The State air pollution control agency, local agency, other State agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under part 70 of this chapter; or 


(2) The Administrator, in the case of EPA-implemented permit programs under title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661). 


*Proportional sampling* means sampling at a rate that produces a constant ratio of sampling rate to stack gas flow rate. 


*Reactivation of a very clean coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit* means any physical change or change in the method of operation associated with the commencement of commercial operations by a coal-fired utility unit after a period of discontinued operation where the unit: 


(1) Has not been in operation for the two-year period prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the emissions from such unit continue to be carried in the permitting authority's emissions inventory at the time of enactment; 


(2) Was equipped prior to shut-down with a continuous system of emissions control that achieves a removal efficiency for sulfur dioxide of no less than 85 percent and a removal efficiency for particulates of no less than 98 percent; 


(3) Is equipped with low-NO_X_ burners prior to the time of commencement of operations following reactivation; and 


(4) Is otherwise in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act. 


*Reference method* means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant as specified in the applicable subpart.


*Repowering* means replacement of an existing coal-fired boiler with one of the following clean coal technologies: atmospheric or pressurized fluidized bed combustion, integrated gasification combined cycle, magnetohydrodynamics, direct and indirect coal-fired turbines, integrated gasification fuel cells, or as determined by the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, a derivative of one or more of these technologies, and any other technology capable of controlling multiple combustion emissions simultaneously with improved boiler or generation efficiency and with significantly greater waste reduction relative to the performance of technology in widespread commercial use as of November 15, 1990. Repowering shall also include any oil and/or gas-fired unit which has been awarded clean coal technology demonstration funding as of January 1, 1991, by the Department of Energy. 


*Run* means the net period of time during which an emission sample is collected. Unless otherwise specified, a run may be either intermittent or continuous within the limits of good engineering practice. 


*Shutdown* means the cessation of operation of an affected facility for any purpose. 


*Six-minute period* means any one of the 10 equal parts of a one-hour period. 


*Standard* means a standard of performance proposed or promulgated under this part.
