# ยง 60.1145   What must I do with any public comments I receive during the public comment period on my siting analysis?

You must do three things: 


(a) Prepare written responses to any public comments on your siting analysis and the revised materials separation plan you received during the public comment period. Summarize the responses to public comments in a document that is separate from your materials separation plan and siting analysis. 


(b) Make the comment response document available to the public in the service area where you will construct your municipal waste combustion unit. You must distribute the document at least to the main public libraries used to announce the public meeting for the siting analysis. 


(c) Prepare a revised siting analysis for the municipal waste combustion unit that includes, as appropriate, changes made in response to any public comments you received during the public comment period.
