# § 60.1410   What must I include in my annual report?

Summarize data collected for all pollutants and parameters regulated under this subpart. Your summary must include twelve items: 


(a) The results of the annual stack test, using appropriate units, for eight pollutants, as recorded under § 60.1360(a): 


(1) Dioxins/furans. 


(2) Cadmium. 


(3) Lead. 


(4) Mercury. 


(5) Particulate matter. 


(6) Opacity. 


(7) Hydrogen chloride. 


(8) Fugitive ash. 


(b) A list of the highest average levels recorded, in the appropriate units. List the values for five pollutants or parameters: 


(1) Sulfur dioxide emissions. 


(2) For Class I municipal waste combustion units only, nitrogen oxides emissions. 


(3) Carbon monoxide emissions. 


(4) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit. 


(5) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of the particulate matter air pollution control device (4-hour block average). 


(c) The highest 6-minute opacity level measured. Base the value on all 6-minute average opacity levels recorded by your continuous opacity monitoring system (§ 60.1365(a)(1)). 


(d) For municipal waste combustion units that use activated carbon for controlling dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, include four records: 


(1) The average carbon feed rates recorded during the most recent dioxins/furans and mercury stack tests. 


(2) The lowest 8-hour block average carbon feed rate recorded during the year. 


(3) The total carbon purchased and delivered to the municipal waste combustion plant for each calendar quarter. If you choose to evaluate total carbon purchased and delivered on a municipal waste combustion unit basis, record the total carbon purchased and delivered for each individual municipal waste combustion unit at your plant. 


(4) The required quarterly carbon usage of your municipal waste combustion plant calculated using equation 4 or 5 in § 60.1460(f). If you choose to evaluate required quarterly usage for carbon on a municipal waste combustion unit basis, record the required quarterly usage for each municipal waste combustion unit at your plant. 


(e) The total number of days that you did not obtain the minimum number of hours of data for six pollutants or parameters. Include the reasons you did not obtain the data and corrective actions that you have taken to obtain the data in the future. Include data on: 


(1) Sulfur dioxide emissions. 


(2) For Class I municipal waste combustion units only, nitrogen oxides emissions. 


(3) Carbon monoxide emissions. 


(4) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit. 


(5) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of the particulate matter air pollution control device. 


(6) Carbon feed rate. 


(f) The number of hours you have excluded data from the calculation of average levels (include the reasons for excluding it). Include data for six pollutants or parameters: 


(1) Sulfur dioxide emissions. 


(2) For Class I municipal waste combustion units only, nitrogen oxides emissions. 


(3) Carbon monoxide emissions. 


(4) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit. 


(5) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of the particulate matter air pollution control device. 


(6) Carbon feed rate. 


(g) A notice of your intent to begin a reduced stack testing schedule for dioxins/furans emissions during the following calendar year, if you are eligible for alternative scheduling (§ 60.1305(a) or (b)). 


(h) A notice of your intent to begin a reduced stack testing schedule for other pollutants during the following calendar year if you are eligible for alternative scheduling (§ 60.1305(a)). 


(i) A summary of any emission or parameter level that did not meet the limits specified in this subpart. 


(j) A summary of the data in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section from the year preceding the reporting year which gives the Administrator a summary of the performance of the municipal waste combustion unit over a 2-year period. 


(k) If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas, documentation of the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide, as specified in § 60.1255. 


(l) Documentation of periods when all certified chief facility operators and certified shift supervisors are offsite for more than 12 hours.
