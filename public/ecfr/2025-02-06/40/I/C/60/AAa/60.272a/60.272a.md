# § 60.272a   Standard for particulate matter.

(a) On and after the date of which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from an EAF or an AOD vessel any gases which:


(1) Exit from a control device and contain particulate matter in excess of 12 mg/dscm (0.0052 gr/dscf);


(2) Exit from a control device and exhibit 3 percent opacity or greater, as measured in accordance with EPA Method 9 of appendix A of this part, or, as an alternative, according to ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), with the caveats described under *Shop opacity* in § 60.271; and


(3) Exit from a shop and, due solely to the operations of any affected EAF(s) or AOD vessel(s), exhibit 6 percent opacity or greater, as measured in accordance with EPA Method 9 of appendix A of this part, or, as an alternative, according to ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), with the caveats described under *Shop opacity* in § 60.271. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any point(s) where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only one observation of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop opacity observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident.


(b) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the dust-handling system any gases that exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater, as measured in accordance with EPA Method 9 of appendix A of this part, or, as an alternative, according to ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), with the caveats described under *Shop opacity* in § 60.271.
