# § 60.274a   Monitoring of operations.

(a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain records of the following information:


(1) All data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section; and 


(2) All monthly operational status inspections performed under paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall:


(1) Monitor and record once per shift the block 15-minute average furnace static pressure (if a DEC system is in use, and a furnace static pressure gauge is installed according to paragraph (f) of this section) and either:


(i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the capture system fan motor amperes and damper position(s);


(ii) Monitor and record as no greater than 15-minute integrated block average basis the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood; or


(iii) Install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device inlet and record damper positions(s).


(2) The volumetric flow monitoring device(s) may be installed in any appropriate location in the capture system such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device(s) shall have an accuracy of ±10 percent over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to EPA Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A of this part.


(3) Parameters monitored pursuant to this paragraph, excluding damper position, shall be recorded as integrated block averages not to exceed 15 minutes.


(c)(1) When the owner or operator of an affected facility is required to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 60.272a(a)(3) and at any other time that the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the CAA, as amended), the owner or operator shall, during periods in which a hood is operated for the purpose of capturing emissions from the affected facility subject to paragraph (b) of this section, either:


(i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the fan motor amperes at each damper position, and damper position consistent with paragraph (h)(5) of this section; or


(ii) Monitor and record as no greater than 15-minute integrated block average basis the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood; or


(iii) Install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device inlet and monitor and record the damper position consistent with paragraph (h)(5) of this section.


(2) Parameters monitored pursuant to this paragraph, excluding damper position, shall be recorded as integrated block averages not to exceed 15 minutes.


(3) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator or delegated authority for reestablishment of these parameters whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's or delegated authority's satisfaction that the affected facility operating conditions upon which the parameters were previously established are no longer applicable. The values of the parameters as determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be the appropriate operational range or control set point throughout each applicable period. Operation at values beyond the accepted operational range or control set point may be subject to the requirements of § 60.276a(c).


(d) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the capture system (*i.e.,* pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). This inspection shall include observations of the physical appearance of the equipment (*e.g.,* presence of holes in ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or excess accumulations of dust in ductwork, and fan erosion) and building inspections to ensure that the building does not have any holes or other openings for particulate matter laden air to escape. Any deficiencies that are determined by the operator to materially impact the efficacy of the capture system shall be noted and proper maintenance performed.


(e) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator or delegated authority to approve any alternative to either the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section or the monthly operational status inspections specified in paragraph (d) of this section if the alternative will provide a continuous record of operation of each emission capture system.


(f) Except as provided for under § 60.273a(d), if emissions during any phase of the heat cycle are controlled by the use of a DEC system, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that allows the pressure in the free space inside the EAF to be monitored. The pressure shall be recorded as no greater than 15-minute integrated block averages. The monitoring device may be installed in any appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the introduction of ambient air such that reproducible results will be obtained. The pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of ±5 mm of water gauge over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.


(g) Except as provided for under § 60.273a(d), when the owner or operator of an EAF controlled by a DEC is required to demonstrate compliance with the standard under § 60.272a(a)(3), and at any other time the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, as amended), the pressure in the free space inside the furnace shall be determined during the melting and refining period(s) using the monitoring device required under paragraph (f) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator or delegated authority for reestablishment of the pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's or delegated authority's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the pressures were previously established are no longer applicable. The pressure range or control setting during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at all times when the EAF is operating in a melting and refining period. Continuous operation at pressures higher than the operational range or control setting may be considered by the Administrator or delegated authority to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility.


(h) During any performance test required under § 60.8, and for any report thereof required by § 60.276a(f) of this subpart, or to determine compliance with § 60.272a(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats covered by the test:


(1) Charge weights and materials, and tap weights and materials;


(2) Heat times, including start and stop times, and a log of process operation, including periods of no operation during testing and, if a furnace static pressure monitoring device is operated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the pressure inside an EAF when DEC systems are used;


(3) Control device operation log;


(4) Continuous opacity monitor or EPA Method 9 data, or, as an alternative to EPA Method 9, according to ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), with the caveats described under *Shop opacity* in § 60.271;


(5) All damper positions, no less frequently than performed in the latest melt shop opacity compliance test for a full heat, if selected as a method to demonstrate compliance under paragraph (b) of this section;


(6) Fan motor amperes at each damper position, if selected as a method to demonstrate compliance under paragraph (b) of this section;


(7) Volumetric air flow rate through each separately ducted hood, if selected as a method to demonstrate compliance under paragraph (b) of this section; and


(8) Static pressure at each separately ducted hood, if selected as a method to demonstrate compliance under paragraph (b) of this section.


(9) Parameters monitored pursuant to paragraphs (h)(6) through (8) of this section shall be recorded as integrated block averages not to exceed 15 minutes.
