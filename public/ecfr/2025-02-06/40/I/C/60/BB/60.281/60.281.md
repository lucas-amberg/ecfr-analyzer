# ยง 60.281   Definitions.

As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the same meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A.


(a) *Kraft pulp mill* means any stationary source which produces pulp from wood by cooking (digesting) wood chips in a water solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide (white liquor) at high temperature and pressure. Regeneration of the cooking chemicals through a recovery process is also considered part of the kraft pulp mill.


(b) *Neutral sulfite semichemical pulping operation* means any operation in which pulp is produced from wood by cooking (digesting) wood chips in a solution of sodium sulfite and sodium bicarbonate, followed by mechanical defibrating (grinding).


(c) *Total reduced sulfur (TRS)* means the sum of the sulfur compounds hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide, that are released during the kraft pulping operation and measured by Method 16.


(d) *Digester system* means each continuous digester or each batch digester used for the cooking of wood in white liquor, and associated flash tank(s), blow tank(s), chip steamer(s), and condenser(s).


(e) *Brown stock washer system* means brown stock washers and associated knotters, vacuum pumps, and filtrate tanks used to wash the pulp following the digester system. Diffusion washers are excluded from this definition.


(f) *Multiple-effect evaporator system* means the multiple-effect evaporators and associated condenser(s) and hotwell(s) used to concentrate the spent cooking liquid that is separated from the pulp (black liquor). 


(g) *Black liquor oxidation system* means the vessels used to oxidize, with air or oxygen, the black liquor, and associated storage tank(s).


(h) *Recovery furnace* means either a straight kraft recovery furnace or a cross recovery furnace, and includes the direct-contact evaporator for a direct-contact furnace.


(i) *Straight kraft recovery furnace* means a furnace used to recover chemicals consisting primarily of sodium and sulfur compounds by burning black liquor which on a quarterly basis contains 7 weight percent or less of the total pulp solids from the neutral sulfite semichemical process or has green liquor sulfidity of 28 percent or less.


(j) *Cross recovery furnace* means a furnace used to recover chemicals consisting primarily of sodium and sulfur compounds by burning black liquor which on a quarterly basis contains more than 7 weight percent of the total pulp solids from the neutral sulfite semichemical process and has a green liquor sulfidity of more than 28 percent.


(k) *Black liquor solids* means the dry weight of the solids which enter the recovery furnace in the black liquor.


(l) *Green liquor sulfidity* means the sulfidity of the liquor which leaves the smelt dissolving tank.


(m) *Smelt dissolving tank* means a vessel used for dissolving the smelt collected from the recovery furnace.


(n) *Lime kiln* means a unit used to calcine lime mud, which consists primarily of calcium carbonate, into quicklime, which is calcium oxide.


(o) *Condensate stripper system* means a column, and associated condensers, used to strip, with air or steam, TRS compounds from condensate streams from various processes within a kraft pulp mill.
