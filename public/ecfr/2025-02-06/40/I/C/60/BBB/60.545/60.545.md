# § 60.545   Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a thermal incinerator shall maintain continuous records of the temperature of the gas stream in the combustion zone of the incinerator and records of all 3-hour periods of operation for which the average temperature of the gas stream in the combustion zone was more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the combustion zone temperature measured during the most recent determination of the destruction efficiency of the thermal incinerator that demonstrated that the affected facility was in compliance. 


(b) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a catalytic incinerator shall maintain continuous records of the temperature of the gas stream both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed of the incinerator, records of all 3-hour periods of operation for which the average temperature measured before the catalyst bed is more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the gas stream temperature measured before the catalyst bed during the most recent determination of destruction efficiency of the catalytic incinerator that demonstrated that the affected facility was in compliance, and records of all 3-hour periods for which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the temperature difference measured during the most recent determination of the destruction efficiency of the catalytic incinerator that demonstrated that the affected facility was in compliance. 


(c) Each owner or operator of an undertread cementing operation, sidewall cementing operation, green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, or Michelin-B operation that uses a carbon adsorber to meet the requirements specified under § 60.543(j)(6) shall maintain continuous records of all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average VOC concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases is more than 20 percent greater than the exhaust gas concentration level or reading measured by the organics monitoring device during the most recent determination of the recovery efficiency of the carbon adsorber that demonstrated that the affected facility was in compliance. 


(d) Each owner or operator of an undertread cementing operation, sidewall cementing operation, green tires spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, Michelin-A operation, Michelin-B operation, or Michelin-C-automatic operation who seeks to comply with a specified VOC monthly usage limit shall maintain records of monthly VOC use and the number of days in each compliance period. 


(e) Each owner or operator that is required to conduct monthly performance tests, as specified under § 60.543(b)(1), shall maintain records of the results of all monthly tests.


(f) Each owner or operator of a tread end cementing operation and green tire spraying operation using water-based cements or sprays containing less than 1.0 percent by weight of VOC, as specified under § 60.543(b)(4), shall maintain records of formulation data or the results of Method 24 analysis conducted to verify the VOC content of the spray.
