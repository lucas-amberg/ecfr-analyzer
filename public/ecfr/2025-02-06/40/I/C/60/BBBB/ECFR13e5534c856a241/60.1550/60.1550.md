# ยง 60.1550   What municipal waste combustion units must I address in my State plan?

(a) Your State plan must address all existing small municipal waste combustion units in your State that meet two criteria: 


(1) The municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust at least 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste but no more than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel. 


(2) The municipal waste combustion unit commenced construction on or before August 30, 1999. 


(b) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit makes changes that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction after June 6, 2001 for subpart AAAA of this part, the municipal waste combustion unit becomes subject to subpart AAAA of this part and the State plan no longer applies to that unit. 


(c) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit makes physical or operational changes to an existing municipal waste combustion unit primarily to comply with your State plan, subpart AAAA of this part (New Source Performance Standards for New Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units) does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not constitute modifications or reconstructions under subpart AAAA of this part.
