# ยง 60.1525   What if my State plan is not approvable?

If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative declaration letter), EPA will develop a Federal plan, according to ยง 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of municipal waste combustion units not covered by an approved and currently effective State plan must comply with the Federal plan. The Federal plan is an interim action and, by its own terms, will cease to apply when your State plan is approved and becomes effective.
