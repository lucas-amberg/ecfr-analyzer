You must also monitor three operating parameters: 


(a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit. 


(b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate matter air pollution control device. 


(c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions.
