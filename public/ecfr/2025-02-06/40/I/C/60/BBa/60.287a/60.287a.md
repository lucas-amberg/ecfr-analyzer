# § 60.287a   Recordkeeping.

(a) The owner or operator must maintain records of the performance evaluations of the continuous monitoring systems.


(b) For each continuous monitoring system, the owner or operator must maintain records of the following information, as applicable:


(1) Records of the opacity of the gases discharged into the atmosphere from any recovery furnace or lime kiln using an ESP emission control device, except as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, and records of the ESP secondary voltage and secondary current (or total secondary power) averaged over the reporting period for the opacity allowances specified in § 60.284a(e)(1)(ii) and (iv).


(2) Records of the concentration of TRS emissions on a dry basis and the percent of oxygen by volume on a dry basis in the gases discharged into the atmosphere from any lime kiln, recovery furnace, digester system, brown stock washer system, multiple-effect evaporator system, or condensate stripper system, except where the provisions of § 60.283a(a)(1)(iii) or (iv) apply.


(3) Records of the incinerator combustion temperature at the point of incineration of effluent gases which are emitted from any digester system, brown stock washer system, multiple effect evaporator system, or condensate stripper system where the provisions of § 60.283a(a)(1)(iii) apply and an incinerator is used as the combustion device.


(4) For any recovery furnace, lime kiln, or smelt dissolving tank using a wet scrubber emission control device:


(i) Records of the pressure drop of the gas stream through the control equipment (or smelt dissolving tank scrubber fan amperage or RPM), and


(ii) Records of the scrubbing liquid flow rate (or scrubbing liquid supply pressure).


(5) For any recovery furnace or lime kiln using an ESP control device:


(i) Records of the secondary voltage of each ESP collection field, and


(ii) Records of the secondary current of each ESP collection field, and


(iii) If used as an alternative to secondary voltage and current, records of the total secondary power of each ESP collection field.


(6) For any recovery furnace or lime kiln using an ESP followed by a wet scrubber, the records specified under paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section.


(7) Records of excess emissions as defined in § 60.284a(d).


(c) For each malfunction, the owner or operator must maintain records of the following information:


(1) Records of the occurrence and duration of each malfunction of operation (i.e., process equipment) or the air pollution control and monitoring equipment.


(2) Records of actions taken during periods of malfunction to minimize emissions in accordance with § 60.11(d), including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation.
