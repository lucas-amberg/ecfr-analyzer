# § 60.2210   What information must I include in my annual report?

The annual report required under § 60.2205 must include the items listed in paragraphs (a) through (p) of this section. If you have a deviation from the operating limits or the emission limitations, you must also submit deviation reports as specified in §§ 60.2215, 60.2220, and 60.2225:


(a) Company name and address;


(b) Statement by a responsible official, with that official's name, title, and signature, certifying the accuracy of the content of the report;


(c) Date of report and beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;


(d) The values for the operating limits established pursuant to § 60.2110 or § 60.2115;


(e) If no deviation from any emission limitation or operating limit that applies to you has been reported, a statement that there was no deviation from the emission limitations or operating limits during the reporting period;


(f) The highest recorded 3-hour average and the lowest recorded 3-hour average (30-day average for energy recovery units), as applicable, for each operating parameter recorded for the calendar year being reported;


(g) Information recorded under § 60.2175(b)(6) and (c) through (e) for the calendar year being reported;


(h) For each performance test conducted during the reporting period, if any performance test is conducted, the process unit(s) tested, the pollutant(s) tested and the date that such performance test was conducted. Submit, following the procedure specified in § 60.2235(b)(1), the performance test report no later than the date that you submit the annual report;


(i) If you met the requirements of § 60.2155(a) or (b), and did not conduct a performance test during the reporting period, you must state that you met the requirements of § 60.2155(a) or (b), and, therefore, you were not required to conduct a performance test during the reporting period;


(j) Documentation of periods when all qualified CISWI operators were unavailable for more than 8 hours, but less than 2 weeks;


(k) If you had a malfunction during the reporting period, the compliance report must include the number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction that occurred during the reporting period and that caused or may have caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. The report must also include a description of actions taken by an owner or operator during a malfunction of an affected source to minimize emissions in accordance with § 60.11(d), including actions taken to correct a malfunction;


(l) For each deviation from an emission or operating limitation that occurs for a CISWI for which you are not using a continuous monitoring system to comply with the emission or operating limitations in this subpart, the annual report must contain the following information:


(1) The total operating time of the CISWI at which the deviation occurred during the reporting period; and


(2) Information on the number, duration, and cause of deviations (including unknown cause, if applicable), as applicable, and the corrective action taken.


(m) If there were periods during which the continuous monitoring system, including the CEMS, was out of control as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, the annual report must contain the following information for each deviation from an emission or operating limitation occurring for a CISWI for which you are using a continuous monitoring system to comply with the emission and operating limitations in this subpart:


(1) The date and time that each malfunction started and stopped;


(2) The date, time, and duration that each CMS was inoperative, except for zero (low-level) and high-level checks;


(3) The date, time, and duration that each continuous monitoring system was out-of-control, including start and end dates and hours and descriptions of corrective actions taken;


(4) The date and time that each deviation started and stopped, and whether each deviation occurred during a period of malfunction or during another period;


(5) A summary of the total duration of the deviation during the reporting period, and the total duration as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period;


(6) A breakdown of the total duration of the deviations during the reporting period into those that are due to control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes;


(7) A summary of the total duration of continuous monitoring system downtime during the reporting period, and the total duration of continuous monitoring system downtime as a percent of the total operating time of the CISWI at which the continuous monitoring system downtime occurred during that reporting period;


(8) An identification of each parameter and pollutant that was monitored at the CISWI;


(9) A brief description of the CISWI;


(10) A brief description of the continuous monitoring system;


(11) The date of the latest continuous monitoring system certification or audit; and


(12) A description of any changes in continuous monitoring system, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.


(n) If there were periods during which the continuous monitoring system, including the CEMS, was not out of control as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, a statement that there were not periods during which the continuous monitoring system was out of control during the reporting period.


(o) A continuous monitoring system is out of control in accordance with the procedure in 40 CFR part 60, appendix F of this part, as if any of the following occur:


(1) The zero (low-level), mid-level (if applicable), or high-level calibration drift exceeds two times the applicable calibration drift specification in the applicable performance specification or in the relevant standard;


(2) The continuous monitoring system fails a performance test audit (*e.g.,* cylinder gas audit), relative accuracy audit, relative accuracy test audit, or linearity test audit; and


(3) The continuous opacity monitoring system calibration drift exceeds two times the limit in the applicable performance specification in the relevant standard.


(p) For energy recovery units, include the annual heat input and average annual heat input rate of all fuels being burned in the unit to verify which subcategory of energy recovery unit applies.
