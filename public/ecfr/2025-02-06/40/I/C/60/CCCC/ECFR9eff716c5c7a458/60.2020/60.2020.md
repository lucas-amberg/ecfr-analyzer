(1) Notify the Administrator that the unit meets these criteria; and


(2) Keep records on a calendar quarter basis of the weight of pathological waste, low-level radioactive waste, and/or chemotherapeutic waste burned, and the weight of all other fuels and wastes burned in the unit.


(b) *Municipal waste combustion units.* Incineration units that are subject to subpart Ea of this part (Standards of Performance for Municipal Waste Combustors); subpart Eb of this part (Standards of Performance for Large Municipal Waste Combustors); subpart Cb of this part (Emission Guidelines and Compliance Time for Large Municipal Combustors); subpart AAAA of this part (Standards of Performance for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units); or subpart BBBB of this part (Emission Guidelines for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units).


(c) *Medical waste incineration units.* Incineration units regulated under subpart Ec of this part (Standards of Performance for Hospital/Medical/Infectious Waste Incinerators for Which Construction is Commenced After June 20, 1996) or subpart Ce of this part (Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Hospital/Medical/Infectious Waste Incinerators).


(d) *Small power production facilities.* Units that meet the four requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section:


(1) The unit qualifies as a small power-production facility under section 3(17)(C) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(17)(C));


(2) The unit burns homogeneous waste (not including refuse-derived fuel) to produce electricity;


(3) You submit documentation to the Administrator notifying the EPA that the qualifying small power production facility is combusting homogenous waste; and


(4) You maintain the records specified in ยง 60.2175(w).


(e) *Cogeneration facilities.* Units that meet the four requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section:

(2) The unit burns homogeneous waste (not including refuse-derived fuel) to produce electricity and steam or other forms of energy used for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes;


(3) You submit documentation to the Administrator notifying the Agency that the qualifying cogeneration facility is combusting homogenous waste; and


(4) You maintain the records specified in ยง 60.2175(x).


(f) *Hazardous waste combustion units.* Units for which you are required to get a permit under section 3005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.


(g) *Materials recovery units.* Units that combust waste for the primary purpose of recovering metals, such as primary and secondary smelters.


(h) *Sewage treatment plants.* Incineration units regulated under subpart O of this part (Standards of Performance for Sewage Treatment Plants).


(i) *Sewage sludge incineration units.* Incineration units combusting sewage sludge for the purpose of reducing the volume of the sewage sludge by removing combustible matter that are subject to subpart LLLL of this part (Standards of Performance for New Sewage Sludge Incineration Units) or subpart MMMM of this part (Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Existing Sewage Sludge Incineration Units).


(j) *Other solid waste incineration units.* Incineration units that are subject to subpart EEEE of this part (Standards of Performance for Other Solid Waste Incineration Units for Which Construction is Commenced After December 9, 2004, or for Which Modification or Reconstruction is Commenced on or After June 16, 2006) or subpart FFFF of this part (Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Other Solid Waste Incineration Units That Commenced Construction On or Before December 9, 2004).
