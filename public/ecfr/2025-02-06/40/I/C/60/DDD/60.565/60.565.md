(a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep an up-to-date, readily-accessible record of the following information measured during each performance test, and shall include the following information in the report of the initial performance test in addition to the written results of such performance tests as required under § 60.8. Where a control device is used to comply with § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(D) only, a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information in § 60.565(a)(11) is required. Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater is used to comply with § 60.562-1(a), a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information in § 60.565(a)(2)(i) is required. The same information specified in this section shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a combustion device or the outlet concentration of TOC (minus methane and ethane) is determined.

(ii) The percent reduction of TOC (minus methane and ethane) achieved by the incinerator, the concentration of TOC (minus methane and ethane) (ppmv, by compound) at the outlet of the control device on a dry basis, or the emission rate in terms of kg TOC (minus methane and ethane) per Mg (lb TOC/ton) of product at the outlet of the control device, whichever is appropriate. If supplemental combustion air is used, the TOC concentration corrected to 3 percent oxygen shall be recorded and reported.

(i) All periods when flow is indicated if flow indicators are installed under § 69.563(d)(1). 


(ii) All times when maintenance is performed on car-sealed valves, when the car seal is broken, and when the valve position is changed (i.e., from open to closed for valves in the vent piping to the control device and from closed to open for valves that vent the stream directly or indirectly to the atmosphere bypassing the control device). 


(c) Where an incinerator is used to comply with § 60.562-1, except §§ 60.562(a)(1)(i)(D) and (a)(2), each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep for at least 2 years up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of:

(6) Any change in process operations that increases the uncontrolled emission rate of the process line in which the affected facility is located, as recorded in § 60.565(h).


(7) Any change in process operations that increases the uncontrolled annual emissions or the VOC weight percent of the individual stream, as recorded in § 60.565(h).


(l) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall notify the Administrator of the specific provisions of § 60.562, § 60.560(d), or § 60.560(e), as applicable, with which the owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial startup required by § 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at a later date to use an alternative provision of § 60.562 with which he or she will comply or becomes subject to § 60.562 for the first time (i.e., the owner or operator can no longer meet the requirements of this subpart by complying with the uncontrolled threshold emission rate cutoff provision in § 60.560 (d) or (e)), then the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon implementing a change, a performance test shall be performed as specified in § 60.564.


(m) The requirements of this subsection remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves alternative reporting requirements or means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this subsection, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.
