# § 60.49Da   Emission monitoring.

(a) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the opacity standard in § 60.42Da must monitor the opacity of emissions discharged from the affected facility to the atmosphere according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(2) and (4) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard, shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a COMS, and record the output of the system, for measuring the opacity of emissions discharged to the atmosphere. If opacity interference due to water droplets exists in the stack (for example, from the use of an FGD system), the opacity is monitored upstream of the interference (at the inlet to the FGD system). If opacity interference is experienced at all locations (both at the inlet and outlet of the SO_2_ control system), alternate parameters indicative of the PM control system's performance and/or good combustion are monitored (subject to the approval of the Administrator).


(2) As an alternative to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an owner or operator of an affected facility that meets the conditions in either paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may elect to monitor opacity as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(i) The affected facility uses a fabric filter (baghouse) to meet the standards in § 60.42Da and a bag leak detection system is installed and operated according to the requirements in paragraphs § 60.48Da(o)(4)(i) through (v);


(ii) The affected facility burns only gaseous or liquid fuels (excluding residual oil) with potential SO_2_ emissions rates of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less, and does not use a post-combustion technology to reduce emissions of SO_2_ or PM;


(iii) The affected facility meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section.


(A) No post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) is used for reducing PM, SO_2_, or CO emissions;


(B) Only natural gas, gaseous fuels, or fuel oils that contain less than or equal to 0.30 weight percent sulfur are burned; and


(C) Emissions of CO discharged to the atmosphere are maintained at levels less than or equal to 1.4 lb/MWh on a boiler operating day average basis as demonstrated by the use of a CEMS measuring CO emissions according to the procedures specified in paragraph (u) of this section; or


(iv) The affected facility uses an ESP and uses an ESP predictive model to monitor the performance of the ESP developed in accordance and operated according to the most current requirements in section § 60.48Da of this part.


(3) The owner or operator of an affected facility that meets the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may, as an alternative to using a COMS, elect to monitor visible emissions using the applicable procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section. The opacity performance test requirement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) must be conducted by April 29, 2011, within 45 days after stopping use of an existing COMS, or within 180 days after initial startup of the facility, whichever is later.


(i) The owner or operator shall conduct a performance test using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11. If during the initial 60 minutes of the observation all the 6-minute averages are less than 10 percent and all the individual 15-second observations are less than or equal to 20 percent, then the observation period may be reduced from 3 hours to 60 minutes.


(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests using the procedures in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section according to the applicable schedule in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, as determined by the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test results.


(A) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is less than or equal to 5 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 12 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;


(B) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 5 percent but less than or equal to 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 3 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later; or


(C) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 45 calendar days from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted.

If this option is selected: The frequency of each RATA shall be as specified in section 2.3.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable relative accuracy specifications shown in Figure 2 in appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.3.2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.3.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the relative accuracy specification in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part shall be met on a lb/MMBtu basis for SO_2_ (regardless of the SO_2_ emission level during the RATA), and for NO_X_ when the average NO_X_ emission rate measured by the reference method during the RATA is less than 0.100 lb/MMBtu;


(5) If the owner or operator elects to implement the alternative data assessment procedures described in paragraphs (w)(2) through (w)(4) of this section, each data assessment report shall include a summary of the results of all of the RATAs, linearity checks, CGAs, and calibration error or drift assessments required by paragraphs (w)(2) through (w)(4) of this section.
