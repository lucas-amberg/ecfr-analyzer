# § 60.40b   Applicability and delegation of authority.

(a) The affected facility to which this subpart applies is each steam generating unit that commences construction, modification, or reconstruction after June 19, 1984, and that has a heat input capacity from fuels combusted in the steam generating unit of greater than 29 megawatts (MW) (100 million British thermal units per hour (MMBtu/hr)).


(b) Any affected facility meeting the applicability requirements under paragraph (a) of this section and commencing construction, modification, or reconstruction after June 19, 1984, but on or before June 19, 1986, is subject to the following standards:


(1) Coal-fired affected facilities having a heat input capacity between 29 and 73 MW (100 and 250 MMBtu/hr), inclusive, are subject to the particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NO_X_) standards under this subpart.


(2) Coal-fired affected facilities having a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) and meeting the applicability requirements under subpart D (Standards of performance for fossil-fuel-fired steam generators; § 60.40) are subject to the PM and NO_X_ standards under this subpart and to the sulfur dioxide (SO_2_) standards under subpart D (§ 60.43).


(3) Oil-fired affected facilities having a heat input capacity between 29 and 73 MW (100 and 250 MMBtu/hr), inclusive, are subject to the NO_X_ standards under this subpart.


(4) Oil-fired affected facilities having a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) and meeting the applicability requirements under subpart D (Standards of performance for fossil-fuel-fired steam generators; § 60.40) are also subject to the NO_X_ standards under this subpart and the PM and SO_2_ standards under subpart D (§§ 60.42 and 60.43).


(c) Affected facilities that also meet the applicability requirements under subpart J or subpart Ja of this part are subject to the PM and NO_X_ standards under this subpart and the SO_2_ standards under subpart J or subpart Ja of this part, as applicable.


(d) Affected facilities that also meet the applicability requirements under subpart E (Standards of performance for incinerators; § 60.50) are subject to the NO_X_ and PM standards under this subpart.


(e) Steam generating units meeting the applicability requirements under subpart Da (Standards of performance for electric utility steam generating units; § 60.40Da) are not subject to this subpart.


(f) Any change to an existing steam generating unit for the sole purpose of combusting gases containing total reduced sulfur (TRS) as defined under § 60.281 is not considered a modification under § 60.14 and the steam generating unit is not subject to this subpart.


(g) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Clean Air Act, the following authorities shall be retained by the Administrator and not transferred to a State.


(1) Section 60.44b(f).


(2) Section 60.44b(g).


(3) Section 60.49b(a)(4).


(h) Any affected facility that meets the applicability requirements and is subject to subpart Ea, subpart Eb, subpart AAAA, or subpart CCCC of this part is not subject to this subpart.


(i) Affected facilities (*i.e.,* heat recovery steam generators) that are associated with stationary combustion turbines and that meet the applicability requirements of subpart KKKK of this part are not subject to this subpart. This subpart will continue to apply to all other affected facilities (*i.e.* heat recovery steam generators with duct burners) that are capable of combusting more than 29 MW (100 MMBtu/h) heat input of fossil fuel. If the affected facility (*i.e.* heat recovery steam generator) is subject to this subpart, only emissions resulting from combustion of fuels in the steam generating unit are subject to this subpart. (The stationary combustion turbine emissions are subject to subpart GG or KKKK, as applicable, of this part.)


(j) Any affected facility meeting the applicability requirements under paragraph (a) of this section and commencing construction, modification, or reconstruction after June 19, 1986 is not subject to subpart D (Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Steam Generators, § 60.40).


(k) Any affected facility that meets the applicability requirements and is subject to an EPA approved State or Federal section 111(d)/129 plan implementing subpart Cb or subpart BBBB of this part is not covered by this subpart.


(l) Affected facilities that also meet the applicability requirements under subpart BB of this part (Standards of Performance for Kraft Pulp Mills) are subject to the SO_2_ and NO_X_ standards under this subpart and the PM standards under subpart BB.


(m) Temporary boilers are not subject to this subpart.
