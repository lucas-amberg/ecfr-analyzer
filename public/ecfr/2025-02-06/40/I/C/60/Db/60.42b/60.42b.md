For facilities complying with the percent reduction standard, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in this paragraph. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels or heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.


(b) On and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, that combusts coal refuse alone in a fluidized bed combustion steam generating unit shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) or 20 percent (0.20) of the potential SO_2_ emission rate (80 percent reduction) and 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/MMBtu) heat input. If coal or oil is fired with coal refuse, the affected facility is subject to paragraph (a) or (d) of this section, as applicable. For facilities complying with the percent reduction standard, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in this paragraph.

No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels, or from the heat input derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.


(d) On and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005 and listed in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts coal, or 215 ng/J (0.5 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts oil other than very low sulfur oil. Percent reduction requirements are not applicable to affected facilities under paragraphs (d)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section. For facilities complying with paragraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in this paragraph. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels or heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.


(1) Affected facilities that have an annual capacity factor for coal and oil of 30 percent (0.30) or less and are subject to a federally enforceable permit limiting the operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor for coal and oil of 30 percent (0.30) or less;


(2) Affected facilities located in a noncontinental area; or


(3) Affected facilities combusting coal or oil, alone or in combination with any fuel, in a duct burner as part of a combined cycle system where 30 percent (0.30) or less of the heat entering the steam generating unit is from combustion of coal and oil in the duct burner and 70 percent (0.70) or more of the heat entering the steam generating unit is from the exhaust gases entering the duct burner; or


(4) The affected facility burns coke oven gas alone or in combination with natural gas or very low sulfur distillate oil.


(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, compliance with the emission limits, fuel oil sulfur limits, and/or percent reduction requirements under this section are determined on a 30-day rolling average basis.


(f) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, compliance with the emission limits or fuel oil sulfur limits under this section is determined on a 24-hour average basis for affected facilities that (1) have a federally enforceable permit limiting the annual capacity factor for oil to 10 percent or less, (2) combust only very low sulfur oil, and (3) do not combust any other fuel.


(g) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section and § 60.45b(a), the SO_2_ emission limits and percent reduction requirements under this section apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.


(h) Reductions in the potential SO_2_ emission rate through fuel pretreatment are not credited toward the percent reduction requirement under paragraph (c) of this section unless:


(1) Fuel pretreatment results in a 50 percent or greater reduction in potential SO_2_ emissions and


(2) Emissions from the pretreated fuel (without combustion or post-combustion SO_2_ control) are equal to or less than the emission limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(i) An affected facility subject to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section may combust very low sulfur oil or natural gas when the SO_2_ control system is not being operated because of malfunction or maintenance of the SO_2_ control system.


(j) Percent reduction requirements are not applicable to affected facilities combusting only very low sulfur oil. The owner or operator of an affected facility combusting very low sulfur oil shall demonstrate that the oil meets the definition of very low sulfur oil by: (1) Following the performance testing procedures as described in § 60.45b(c) or § 60.45b(d), and following the monitoring procedures as described in § 60.47b(a) or § 60.47b(b) to determine SO_2_ emission rate or fuel oil sulfur content; or (2) maintaining fuel records as described in § 60.49b(r).

For facilities complying with the percent reduction standard and paragraph (k)(3) of this section, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in paragraph (k) of this section. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels or heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.
