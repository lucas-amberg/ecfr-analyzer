(1) 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/MMBtu) heat input;


(i) If the affected facility combusts only municipal-type solid waste; or


(ii) If the affected facility combusts municipal-type solid waste and other fuels and has an annual capacity factor for the other fuels of 10 percent (0.10) or less.


(2) 86 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts municipal-type solid waste or municipal-type solid waste and other fuels; and

(ii) Has a maximum heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less;


(iii) Has a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 30 percent (0.30) or less for municipal-type solid waste, or municipal-type solid waste and other fuels; and


(iv) Construction of the affected facility commenced after June 19, 1984, but on or before November 25, 1986.


(e) For the purposes of this section, the annual capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual heat input to the steam generating unit during the calendar year from the combustion of coal, wood, or municipal-type solid waste, and other fuels, as applicable, by the potential heat input to the steam generating unit if the steam generating unit had been operated for 8,760 hours at the maximum heat input capacity.


(f) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts coal, oil, wood, or mixtures of these fuels with any other fuels shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that exhibit greater than 20 percent opacity (6-minute average), except for one 6-minute period per hour of not more than 27 percent opacity. An owner or operator of an affected facility that elects to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for measuring PM emissions according to the requirements of this subpart and is subject to a federally enforceable PM limit of 0.030 lb/MMBtu or less is exempt from the opacity standard specified in this paragraph.


(g) The PM and opacity standards apply at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
