# § 60.42c   Standard for sulfur dioxide (SO

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts only coal shall neither: cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input or 10 percent (0.10) of the potential SO_2_ emission rate (90 percent reduction), nor cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/MMBtu) heat input. If coal is combusted with other fuels, the affected facility shall neither: cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input or 10 percent (0.10) of the potential SO_2_ emission rate (90 percent reduction), nor cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of the emission limit is determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that:


(1) Combusts only coal refuse alone in a fluidized bed combustion steam generating unit shall neither:


(i) Cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input or 20 percent (0.20) of the potential SO_2_ emission rate (80 percent reduction); nor


(ii) Cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of SO_2_ in excess of 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/MMBtu) heat input. If coal is fired with coal refuse, the affected facility subject to paragraph (a) of this section. If oil or any other fuel (except coal) is fired with coal refuse, the affected facility is subject to the 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input SO_2_ emissions limit or the 90 percent SO_2_ reduction requirement specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the emission limit is determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(2) Combusts only coal and that uses an emerging technology for the control of SO_2_ emissions shall neither:


(i) Cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 50 percent (0.50) of the potential SO_2_ emission rate (50 percent reduction); nor


(ii) Cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 260 ng/J (0.60 lb/MMBtu) heat input. If coal is combusted with other fuels, the affected facility is subject to the 50 percent SO_2_ reduction requirement specified in this paragraph and the emission limit determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(c) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts coal, alone or in combination with any other fuel, and is listed in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of the emission limit determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Percent reduction requirements are not applicable to affected facilities under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4).


(1) Affected facilities that have a heat input capacity of 22 MW (75 MMBtu/h) or less;


(2) Affected facilities that have an annual capacity for coal of 55 percent (0.55) or less and are subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor for coal of 55 percent (0.55) or less.


(3) Affected facilities located in a noncontinental area; or


(4) Affected facilities that combust coal in a duct burner as part of a combined cycle system where 30 percent (0.30) or less of the heat entering the steam generating unit is from combustion of coal in the duct burner and 70 percent (0.70) or more of the heat entering the steam generating unit is from exhaust gases entering the duct burner.


(d) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts oil shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of 215 ng/J (0.50 lb/MMBtu) heat input from oil; or, as an alternative, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts oil shall combust oil in the affected facility that contains greater than 0.5 weight percent sulfur. The percent reduction requirements are not applicable to affected facilities under this paragraph.


(e) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts coal, oil, or coal and oil with any other fuel shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain SO_2_ in excess of the following:


(1) The percent of potential SO_2_ emission rate or numerical SO_2_ emission rate required under paragraph (a) or (b)(2) of this section, as applicable, for any affected facility that


(i) Combusts coal in combination with any other fuel;


(ii) Has a heat input capacity greater than 22 MW (75 MMBtu/h); and


(iii) Has an annual capacity factor for coal greater than 55 percent (0.55); and


(2) The emission limit determined according to the following formula for any affected facility that combusts coal, oil, or coal and oil with any other fuel:


(f) Reduction in the potential SO_2_ emission rate through fuel pretreatment is not credited toward the percent reduction requirement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section unless:


(1) Fuel pretreatment results in a 50 percent (0.50) or greater reduction in the potential SO_2_ emission rate; and


(2) Emissions from the pretreated fuel (without either combustion or post-combustion SO_2_ control) are equal to or less than the emission limits specified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, compliance with the percent reduction requirements, fuel oil sulfur limits, and emission limits of this section shall be determined on a 30-day rolling average basis.


(h) For affected facilities listed under paragraphs (h)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, compliance with the emission limits or fuel oil sulfur limits under this section may be determined based on a certification from the fuel supplier, as described under § 60.48c(f), as applicable.


(1) Distillate oil-fired affected facilities with heat input capacities between 2.9 and 29 MW (10 and 100 MMBtu/hr).


(2) Residual oil-fired affected facilities with heat input capacities between 2.9 and 8.7 MW (10 and 30 MMBtu/hr).


(3) Coal-fired affected facilities with heat input capacities between 2.9 and 8.7 MW (10 and 30 MMBtu/h).


(4) Other fuels-fired affected facilities with heat input capacities between 2.9 and 8.7 MW (10 and 30 MMBtu/h).


(i) The SO_2_ emission limits, fuel oil sulfur limits, and percent reduction requirements under this section apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.


(j) For affected facilities located in noncontinental areas and affected facilities complying with the percent reduction standard, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted under this section. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from wood or other fuels or for heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as stationary gas turbines, internal combustion engines, and kilns.
