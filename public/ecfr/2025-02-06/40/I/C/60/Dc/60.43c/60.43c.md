# § 60.43c   Standard for particulate matter (PM).

(a) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, that combusts coal or combusts mixtures of coal with other fuels and has a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 MMBtu/h) or greater, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of the following emission limits:


(1) 22 ng/J (0.051 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts only coal, or combusts coal with other fuels and has an annual capacity factor for the other fuels of 10 percent (0.10) or less.


(2) 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts coal with other fuels, has an annual capacity factor for the other fuels greater than 10 percent (0.10), and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor greater than 10 percent (0.10) for fuels other than coal.


(b) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, that combusts wood or combusts mixtures of wood with other fuels (except coal) and has a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 MMBtu/h) or greater, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of the following emissions limits:


(1) 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility has an annual capacity factor for wood greater than 30 percent (0.30); or


(2) 130 ng/J (0.30 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility has an annual capacity factor for wood of 30 percent (0.30) or less and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor for wood of 30 percent (0.30) or less.


(c) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts coal, wood, or oil and has a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 MMBtu/h) or greater shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that exhibit greater than 20 percent opacity (6-minute average), except for one 6-minute period per hour of not more than 27 percent opacity. Owners and operators of an affected facility that elect to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for measuring PM emissions according to the requirements of this subpart and are subject to a federally enforceable PM limit of 0.030 lb/MMBtu or less are exempt from the opacity standard specified in this paragraph (c).


(d) The PM and opacity standards under this section apply at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.


(e)(1) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commences construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, and that combusts coal, oil, wood, a mixture of these fuels, or a mixture of these fuels with any other fuels and has a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 MMBtu/h) or greater shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of 13 ng/J (0.030 lb/MMBtu) heat input, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) of this section.


(2) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility for which modification commenced after February 28, 2005, may elect to meet the requirements of this paragraph. On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commences modification after February 28, 2005 shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of both:


(i) 22 ng/J (0.051 lb/MMBtu) heat input derived from the combustion of coal, oil, wood, a mixture of these fuels, or a mixture of these fuels with any other fuels; and


(ii) 0.2 percent of the combustion concentration (99.8 percent reduction) when combusting coal, oil, wood, a mixture of these fuels, or a mixture of these fuels with any other fuels.


(3) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commences modification after February 28, 2005, and that combusts over 30 percent wood (by heat input) on an annual basis and has a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 MMBtu/h) or greater shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/MMBtu) heat input.


(4) An owner or operator of an affected facility that commences construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, and that combusts only oil that contains no more than 0.50 weight percent sulfur or a mixture of 0.50 weight percent sulfur oil with other fuels not subject to a PM standard under § 60.43c and not using a post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) to reduce PM or SO_2_ emissions is not subject to the PM limit in this section.
