(3) Each 30-day average percent of potential SO_2_ emission rate calculated during the reporting period, ending with the last 30-day period; reasons for any noncompliance with the emission standards; and a description of the corrective actions taken.


(4) Identification of any steam generating unit operating days for which SO_2_ or diluent (O_2_ or CO_2_) data have not been obtained by an approved method for at least 75 percent of the operating hours; justification for not obtaining sufficient data; and a description of corrective actions taken.


(5) Identification of any times when emissions data have been excluded from the calculation of average emission rates; justification for excluding data; and a description of corrective actions taken if data have been excluded for periods other than those during which coal or oil were not combusted in the steam generating unit.


(6) Identification of the F factor used in calculations, method of determination, and type of fuel combusted.


(7) Identification of whether averages have been obtained based on CEMS rather than manual sampling methods.


(8) If a CEMS is used, identification of any times when the pollutant concentration exceeded the full span of the CEMS.


(9) If a CEMS is used, description of any modifications to the CEMS that could affect the ability of the CEMS to comply with Performance Specifications 2 or 3 of appendix B of this part.


(10) If a CEMS is used, results of daily CEMS drift tests and quarterly accuracy assessments as required under appendix F, Procedure 1 of this part.


(11) If fuel supplier certification is used to demonstrate compliance, records of fuel supplier certification as described under paragraph (f)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, as applicable. In addition to records of fuel supplier certifications, the report shall include a certified statement signed by the owner or operator of the affected facility that the records of fuel supplier certifications submitted represent all of the fuel combusted during the reporting period.


(f) Fuel supplier certification shall include the following information:


(1) For distillate oil:


(i) The name of the oil supplier;


(ii) A statement from the oil supplier that the oil complies with the specifications under the definition of distillate oil in § 60.41c; and
