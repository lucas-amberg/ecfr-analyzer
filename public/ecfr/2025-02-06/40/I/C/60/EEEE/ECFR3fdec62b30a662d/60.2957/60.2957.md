# ยง 60.2957   What else must I report if I have a deviation from the operating limits or the emission limitations?

(a) You must submit a deviation report if any recorded 3-hour average parameter level is above the maximum operating limit or below the minimum operating limit established under this subpart, if any recorded 12-hour average carbon monoxide emission rate is above the emission limitation, if the control device was bypassed, or if a performance test was conducted that showed a deviation from any emission limitation.


(b) The deviation report must be submitted by August 1 of that year for data collected during the first half of the calendar year (January 1 to June 30), and by February 1 of the following year for data you collected during the second half of the calendar year (July 1 to December 31).
