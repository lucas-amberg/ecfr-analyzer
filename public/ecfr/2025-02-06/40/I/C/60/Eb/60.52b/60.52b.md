(5) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part, no owner or operator of an affected facility shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases that contain mercury in excess of the limits specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) or (a)(5)(ii) of this section.


(i) For affected facilities that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 20, 1994 and on or before December 19, 2005, the emission limit is 80 micrograms per dry standard cubic meter or 15 percent of the potential mercury emission concentration (85-percent reduction by weight), corrected to 7 percent oxygen, whichever is less stringent.


(ii) For affected facilities that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after December 19, 2005, the emission limit is 50 micrograms per dry standard cubic meter, or 15 percent of the potential mercury emission concentration (85-percent reduction by weight), corrected to 7 percent oxygen, whichever is less stringent.


(b) The limits for municipal waste combustor acid gases are specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. 


(1) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part, no owner or operator of an affected facility shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain sulfur dioxide in excess of 30 parts per million by volume or 20 percent of the potential sulfur dioxide emission concentration (80-percent reduction by weight or volume), corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis), whichever is less stringent. The averaging time is specified under § 60.58b(e). 


(2) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part, no owner or operator of an affected facility shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain hydrogen chloride in excess of 25 parts per million by volume or 5 percent of the potential hydrogen chloride emission concentration (95-percent reduction by weight or volume), corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis), whichever is less stringent. 


(c) The limits for municipal waste combustor organics are specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. 


(1) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part, no owner or operator of an affected facility for which construction, modification or reconstruction commences on or before November 20, 1997 shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain dioxin/furan emissions that exceed 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), corrected to 7 percent oxygen, for the first 3 years following the date of initial startup. After the first 3 years following the date of initial startup, no owner or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain dioxin/furan total mass emissions that exceed 13 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
