(a) *Percent oxygen.* Adjust all pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section.


(b) *Capacity of a very small municipal waste combustion unit.* For very small municipal waste combustion units that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the unit capacity based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:


(1) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:


(i) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).


(ii) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).


(2) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum design charging rate.


(c) *Capacity of a batch very small municipal waste combustion unit.* Calculate the capacity of a batch OSWI unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste it can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches it can process in 24 hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the OSWI unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.


(d) *Carbon monoxide pollutant rate.* When hourly average pollutant rates (E_h_) are obtained (e.g., CEMS values), compute the rolling average carbon monoxide pollutant rate (E_a_) for each 12-hour period using the following equation:
