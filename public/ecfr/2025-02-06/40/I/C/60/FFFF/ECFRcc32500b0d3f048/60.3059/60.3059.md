# § 60.3059   Am I required to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit for my unit?

(a) Yes, if your OSWI unit is an existing incineration unit subject to an applicable EPA-approved and effective Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 State or Tribal plan or an applicable and effective Federal plan, you are required to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit unless you meet the relevant requirements for an exemption specified in § 60.2993, or unless your unit is an air curtain incinerator exempt under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) If you own or operate an air curtain incinerator that burns only wood waste; clean lumber; yard waste; or a mixture of wood waste, clean lumber, and/or yard waste and is subject only to the requirements in §§ 60.3062 through 60.3068, you are exempt from the obligation to obtain a title V operating permit, provided that your air curtain incinerator is not otherwise required to obtain a title V operating permit.
