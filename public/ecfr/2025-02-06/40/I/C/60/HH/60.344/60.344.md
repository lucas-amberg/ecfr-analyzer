# § 60.344   Test methods and procedures.

(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b). 


(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.342(a) as follows: 


(1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed for each run using the following equation: 


(2) Method 5 shall be used at negative-pressure fabric filters and other types of control devices and Method 5D shall be used at positive-pressure fabric filters to determine the particulate matter concentration (c_s_) and the volumetric flow rate (Q_sd_) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.90 dscm (31.8 dscf). 


(3) The monitoring device of § 60.343(d) shall be used to determine the stone feed rate (P) for each run. 


(4) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity. 


(c) During the particulate matter run, the owner or operator shall use the monitoring devices in § 60.343(c)(1) and (2) to determine the average pressure loss of the gas stream through the scrubber and the average scrubbing liquid supply pressure.
