# § 60.4215   What requirements must I meet for engines used in Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands?

(a) Stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder that are used in Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are required to meet the applicable emission standards in §§ 60.4202 and 60.4205.


(b) Stationary CI ICE that are used in Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are not required to meet the fuel requirements in § 60.4207.


(c) Stationary CI ICE with a displacement of greater than or equal to 30 liters per cylinder that are used in Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are required to meet the following emission standards:


(1) For engines installed prior to January 1, 2012, limit the emissions of NO_X_ in the stationary CI internal combustion engine exhaust to the following:


(i) 17.0 g/KW-hr (12.7 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is less than 130 rpm;


(ii) 45 · n_−0.2_ g/KW-hr (34 · n_−0.2_ g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is 130 or more but less than 2,000 rpm, where n is maximum engine speed; and


(iii) 9.8 g/KW-hr (7.3 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is 2,000 rpm or more.


(2) For engines installed on or after January 1, 2012, limit the emissions of NO_X_ in the stationary CI internal combustion engine exhaust to the following:


(i) 14.4 g/KW-hr (10.7 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is less than 130 rpm;


(ii) 44 · n_−0.23_ g/KW-hr (33 · n_−0.23_ g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is greater than or equal to 130 but less than 2,000 rpm and where n is maximum engine speed; and


(iii) 7.7 g/KW-hr (5.7 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is greater than or equal to 2,000 rpm.


(3) Limit the emissions of PM in the stationary CI internal combustion engine exhaust to 0.40 g/KW-hr (0.30 g/HP-hr).
