The test must be conducted within 60 days after the engine commences operation after the modification or reconstruction.




(f) If you own or operate an emergency stationary ICE, you must operate the emergency stationary ICE according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section. In order for the engine to be considered an emergency stationary ICE under this subpart, any operation other than emergency operation, maintenance and testing, and operation in non-emergency situations for 50 hours per year, as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3), is prohibited. If you do not operate the engine according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3), the engine will not be considered an emergency engine under this subpart and must meet all requirements for non-emergency engines.






(1) There is no time limit on the use of emergency stationary ICE in emergency situations.




(2) You may operate your emergency stationary ICE for the purpose specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for a maximum of 100 hours per calendar year. Any operation for non-emergency situations as allowed by paragraph (f)(3) of this section counts as part of the 100 hours per calendar year allowed by this paragraph (f)(2).








(i) Emergency stationary ICE may be operated for maintenance checks and readiness testing, provided that the tests are recommended by federal, state or local government, the manufacturer, the vendor, the regional transmission organization or equivalent balancing authority and transmission operator, or the insurance company associated with the engine. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for approval of additional hours to be used for maintenance checks and readiness testing, but a petition is not required if the owner or operator maintains records indicating that federal, state, or local standards require maintenance and testing of emergency ICE beyond 100 hours per calendar year.


(ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
