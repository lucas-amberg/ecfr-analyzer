# ยง 60.4202   What emission standards must I meet for emergency engines if I am a stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturer?

(a) Stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturers must certify their 2007 model year and later emergency stationary CI ICE with a maximum engine power less than or equal to 2,237 KW (3,000 HP) and a displacement of less than 10 liters per cylinder that are not fire pump engines to the emission standards specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (2) of this section.


(1) For engines with a maximum engine power less than 37 KW (50 HP):


(i) The Tier 2 emission standards for new nonroad CI engines for the appropriate rated power as described in 40 CFR part 1039, appendix I, for all pollutants and the smoke standards as specified in 40 CFR 1039.105 for model year 2007 engines; and


(ii) The certification emission standards for new nonroad CI engines in 40 CFR 1039.104, 40 CFR 1039.105, 40 CFR 1039.107, 40 CFR 1039.115, and table 2 to this subpart, for 2008 model year and later engines.


(2) For engines with a rated power greater than or equal to 37 KW (50 HP), the Tier 2 or Tier 3 emission standards for new nonroad CI engines for the same rated power as described in 40 CFR part 1039, appendix I, for all pollutants and the smoke standards as specified in 40 CFR 1039.105 beginning in model year 2007.


(b) Stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturers must certify their 2007 model year and later emergency stationary CI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 2,237 KW (3,000 HP) and a displacement of less than 10 liters per cylinder that are not fire pump engines to the emission standards specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (2) of this section.


(1) For 2007 through 2010 model years, the emission standards in table 1 to this subpart, for all pollutants, for the same maximum engine power.


(2) For 2011 model year and later, the Tier 2 emission standards as described in 40 CFR part 1039, appendix I, for all pollutants and the smoke standards as specified in 40 CFR 1039.105.


(c) [Reserved] 


(d) Beginning with the model years in table 3 to this subpart, stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturers must certify their fire pump stationary CI ICE to the emission standards in table 4 to this subpart, for all pollutants, for the same model year and NFPA nameplate power.


(e) Stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturers must certify the following emergency stationary CI ICE that are not fire pump engines to the appropriate Tier 2 emission standards for new marine CI engines as described in 40 CFR part 1042, appendix I, for all pollutants, for the same displacement and rated power:


(1) Their 2007 model year through 2012 emergency stationary CI ICE with a displacement of greater than or equal to 10 liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder;


(2) Their 2013 model year and later emergency stationary CI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 3,700 KW (4,958 HP) and a displacement of greater than or equal to 10 liters per cylinder and less than 15 liters per cylinder;


(3) Their 2013 model year emergency stationary CI ICE with a displacement of greater than or equal to 15 liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder; and


(4) Their 2014 model year and later emergency stationary CI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 2,000 KW (2,682 HP) and a displacement of greater than or equal to 15 liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder.


(f) Stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturers must certify the following emergency stationary CI ICE to the certification emission standards and other requirements applicable to Tier 3 new marine CI engines in 40 CFR 1042.101, 40 CFR 1042.107, 40 CFR 1042.115, 40 CFR 1042.120, and 40 CFR 1042.145, for all pollutants, for the same displacement and maximum engine power:


(1) Their 2013 model year and later emergency stationary CI ICE with a maximum engine power less than 3,700 KW (4,958 HP) and a displacement of greater than or equal to 10 liters per cylinder and less than 15 liters per cylinder; and


(2) Their 2014 model year and later emergency stationary CI ICE with a maximum engine power less than 2,000 KW (2,682 HP) and a displacement of greater than or equal to 15 liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder.




(g) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, stationary emergency CI ICE identified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section may be certified to the provisions of 40 CFR part 1042 for commercial engines that are applicable for the engine's model year, displacement, power density, and maximum engine power if the engines will be used solely in either or both of the locations identified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. Engines that would be subject to the Tier 4 standards in 40 CFR part 1042 that are used solely in either or both of the locations identified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section may instead continue to be certified to the previous tier of standards in 40 CFR part 1042. The previous tier is Tier 3 in most cases; however, the previous tier is Tier 2 if there are no Tier 3 standards specified for engines of a certain size or power rating.






(1) Remote areas of Alaska; and


(2) Marine offshore installations.


(h) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturers are not required to certify reconstructed engines; however manufacturers may elect to do so. The reconstructed engine must be certified to the emission standards specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section that are applicable to the model year, maximum engine power and displacement of the reconstructed emergency stationary CI ICE.
