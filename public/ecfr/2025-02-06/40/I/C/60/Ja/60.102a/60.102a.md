(i) For a sulfur recovery plant with an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by incineration, the owner or operator shall not discharge or cause the discharge of any gases into the atmosphere containing SO_2_ in excess of the emission limit calculated using Equation 2 of this section. For Claus units that use only ambient air in the Claus burner or that elect not to monitor O_2_ concentration of the air/oxygen mixture used in the Claus burner or for non-Claus sulfur recovery plants, this SO_2_ emission limit is 2,500 ppmv (dry basis) at zero percent excess air.


(ii) For a sulfur recovery plant with a reduction control system not followed by incineration, the owner or operator shall not discharge or cause the discharge of any gases into the atmosphere containing reduced sulfur compounds in excess of the emission limit calculated using Equation 2 of this section.

The owner or operator must document the time periods during which the sulfur pit vents were not controlled and measures taken to minimize emissions during these periods. Examples of these measures include not adding fresh sulfur or shutting off vent fans.


(g) Each owner or operator of an affected fuel gas combustion device shall comply with the emissions limits in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section.

At a minimum, the request shall contain the information described in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) The design and dimensions of the process heater, evaluation of available combustion modification-based technology, description of fuel gas and, if applicable, fuel oil characteristics, information regarding the combustion conditions (temperature, oxygen content, firing rates) and other information needed to demonstrate that the process heater meets one of the four classes of process heaters listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.


(ii) An explanation of how the data in paragraph (i)(2)(i) demonstrate that ultra-low NO_X_ burners, flue gas recirculation, control of excess air or other combustion modification-based technology (including combinations of these combustion modification-based technologies) cannot be used to meet the applicable emissions limit in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.


(iii) Results of a performance test conducted under representative conditions using the applicable methods specified in § 60.104a(i) to demonstrate the performance of the technology the owner or operator will use to minimize NO_X_ emissions.


(iv) The means by which the owner or operator will document continuous compliance with the site-specific emissions limit.


(3) The request shall be submitted and followed as described in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) The owner or operator of a process heater that meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section may request approval from the Administrator within 180 days after initial startup of the process heater for a NO_X_ emissions limit which shall apply specifically to that affected facility.


(ii) The request must be submitted to the Administrator for approval. The owner or operator must comply with the request as submitted until it is approved.


(iii) The request shall also be submitted to the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Sector Policies and Programs Division, U.S. EPA Mailroom (E143-01), Attention: Refinery Sector Lead, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Electronic copies in lieu of hard copies may also be submitted to *refinerynsps@epa.gov.*

(4) The approval process for a request for a facility-specific NO_X_ emissions limit is described in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) Approval by the Administrator of a facility-specific NO_X_ emissions limit request will be based on the completeness, accuracy and reasonableness of the request. Factors that the EPA will consider in reviewing the request for approval include, but are not limited to, the following:


(A) A demonstration that the process heater meets one of the four classes of process heaters outlined in paragraphs (i)(1) of this section;


(B) A description of the low-NO_X_ burner designs and other combustion modifications considered for reducing NO_X_ emissions;


(C) The combustion modification option selected; and


(D) The operating conditions (firing rate, heater box temperature and excess oxygen concentration) at which the NO_X_ emission level was established.


(ii) If the request is approved by the Administrator, a facility-specific NO_X_ emissions limit will be established at the NO_X_ emission level demonstrated in the approved request.


(iii) If the Administrator finds any deficiencies in the request, the request must be revised to address the deficiencies and be re-submitted for approval.
