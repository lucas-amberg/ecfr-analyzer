# ยง 60.4390   What are my reporting requirements if I operate an emergency combustion turbine or a research and development turbine?

(a) If you operate an emergency combustion turbine, you are exempt from the NO_X_ limit and must submit an initial report to the Administrator stating your case.


(b) Combustion turbines engaged by manufacturers in research and development of equipment for both combustion turbine emission control techniques and combustion turbine efficiency improvements may be exempted from the NO_X_ limit on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Administrator. You must petition for the exemption.
