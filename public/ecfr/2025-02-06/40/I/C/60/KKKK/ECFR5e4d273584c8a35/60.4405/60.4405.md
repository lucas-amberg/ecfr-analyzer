# § 60.4405   How do I perform the initial performance test if I have chosen to install a NO

If you elect to install and certify a NO_X_-diluent CEMS under § 60.4345, then the initial performance test required under § 60.8 may be performed in the following alternative manner:


(a) Perform a minimum of nine RATA reference method runs, with a minimum time per run of 21 minutes, at a single load level, within plus or minus 25 percent of 100 percent of peak load. The ambient temperature must be greater than 0 °F during the RATA runs.


(b) For each RATA run, concurrently measure the heat input to the unit using a fuel flow meter (or flow meters) and measure the electrical and thermal output from the unit.


(c) Use the test data both to demonstrate compliance with the applicable NO_X_ emission limit under § 60.4320 and to provide the required reference method data for the RATA of the CEMS described under § 60.4335.


(d) Compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 60.4320 is achieved if the arithmetic average of all of the NO_X_ emission rates for the RATA runs, expressed in units of ppm or lb/MWh, does not exceed the emission limit.
