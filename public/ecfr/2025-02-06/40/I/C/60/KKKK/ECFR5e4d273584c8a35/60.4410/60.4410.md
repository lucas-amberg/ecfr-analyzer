# ยง 60.4410   How do I establish a valid parameter range if I have chosen to continuously monitor parameters?

If you have chosen to monitor combustion parameters or parameters indicative of proper operation of NO_X_ emission controls in accordance with ยง 60.4340, the appropriate parameters must be continuously monitored and recorded during each run of the initial performance test, to establish acceptable operating ranges, for purposes of the parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit, as specified in ยง 60.4355.
