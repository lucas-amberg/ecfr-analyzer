# ยง 60.4365   How can I be exempted from monitoring the total sulfur content of the fuel?

You may elect not to monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, if the fuel is demonstrated not to exceed potential sulfur emissions of 26 ng SO_2_/J (0.060 lb SO_2_/MMBtu) heat input for units located in continental areas and 180 ng SO_2_/J (0.42 lb SO_2_/MMBtu) heat input for units located in noncontinental areas or a continental area that the Administrator determines does not have access to natural gas and that the removal of sulfur compounds would cause more environmental harm than benefit. You must use one of the following sources of information to make the required demonstration:


(a) The fuel quality characteristics in a current, valid purchase contract, tariff sheet or transportation contract for the fuel, specifying that the maximum total sulfur content for oil use in continental areas is 0.05 weight percent (500 ppmw) or less and 0.4 weight percent (4,000 ppmw) or less for noncontinental areas, the total sulfur content for natural gas use in continental areas is 20 grains of sulfur or less per 100 standard cubic feet and 140 grains of sulfur or less per 100 standard cubic feet for noncontinental areas, has potential sulfur emissions of less than less than 26 ng SO_2_/J (0.060 lb SO_2_/MMBtu) heat input for continental areas and has potential sulfur emissions of less than less than 180 ng SO_2_/J (0.42 lb SO_2_/MMBtu) heat input for noncontinental areas; or


(b) Representative fuel sampling data which show that the sulfur content of the fuel does not exceed 26 ng SO_2_/J (0.060 lb SO_2_/MMBtu) heat input for continental areas or 180 ng SO_2_/J (0.42 lb SO_2_/MMBtu) heat input for noncontinental areas. At a minimum, the amount of fuel sampling data specified in section 2.3.1.4 or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter is required.
