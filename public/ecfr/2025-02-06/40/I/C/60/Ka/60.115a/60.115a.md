# ยง 60.115a   Monitoring of operations.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator subject to this subpart shall maintain a record of the petroleum liquid stored, the period of storage, and the maximum true vapor pressure of that liquid during the respective storage period. 


(b) Available data on the typical Reid vapor pressure and the maximum expected storage temperature of the stored product may be used to determine the maximum true vapor pressure from nomographs contained in API Bulletin 2517, unless the Administrator specifically requests that the liquid be sampled, the actual storage temperature determined, and the Reid vapor pressure determined from the sample(s). 


(c) The true vapor pressure of each type of crude oil with a Reid vapor pressure less than 13.8 kPa (2.0 psia) or whose physical properties preclude determination by the recommended method is to be determined from available data and recorded if the estimated true vapor pressure is greater than 6.9 kPa (1.0 psia). 


(d) The following are exempt from the requirements of this section: 


(1) Each owner or operator of each storage vessel storing a petroleum liquid with a Reid vapor pressure of less than 6.9 kPa (1.0 psia) provided the maximum true vapor pressure does not exceed 6.9 kPa (1.0 psia). 


(2) The owner or operator of each storage vessel equipped with a vapor recovery and return or disposal system in accordance with the requirements of ยง 60.112a(a)(3) and (b), or a closed vent system and control device meeting the specifications of 40 CFR 65.42(b)(4), (b)(5), or (c).
