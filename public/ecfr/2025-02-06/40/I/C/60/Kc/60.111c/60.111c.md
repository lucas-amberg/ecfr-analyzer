# ยง 60.111c   Definitions.

Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:


*Access hatch* means an opening in the roof with a vertical well and a cover attached to it. Access hatch provides passage for workers and materials through the roof for construction or maintenance.


*Closed vent system* means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device. Closed vent system does not include the vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck or railcar.


*Condensate* means hydrocarbon liquid separated from natural gas that condenses due to changes in the temperature or pressure, or both, and remains liquid at standard conditions.


*Custody transfer* means the transfer of produced petroleum and/or condensate, after processing and/or treatment in the producing operations, from storage vessels or automatic transfer facilities to pipelines or any other forms of transportation.


*Degassing* means the process of removing VOL vapors from a storage vessel during, or in preparation of, cleaning or when taking the storage vessel out of service for inspection, repair, or other reason.


*Enclosed combustion device* means a thermal combustion device used to mix and ignite fuel, air pollutants, and air to provide a flame to heat and oxidize air pollutants and that emits the oxidized pollutants through a conveyance suitable to conduct a performance test. An *enclosed combustion device* may have recovery heat to preheat combustion air, but its primary purpose is for emission control and not to produce useful heat. *Enclosed combustion devices* include, but are not limited to, thermal oxidizers and incinerators. For the purpose of this subpart, process heaters and boilers are not *enclosed combustion devices.*

*External floating roof* means a pontoon-type or double-deck type cover that rests on the liquid surface in a storage vessel without a fixed roof.


*Fill* means the introduction of VOL into a storage vessel but not necessarily to complete capacity.


*Flare* means a thermal combustion device using an open or shrouded flame (without full enclosure) such that the pollutants are not emitted through a conveyance suitable to conduct a performance test.


*Fuel gas system* means the offsite and onsite piping and control system that gathers gaseous stream(s) generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous stream for use as fuel gas in combustion devices, or in- process combustion equipment such as furnaces and gas turbines, either singly or in combination.


*Gasoline service station* means any site where gasoline is dispensed to motor vehicle fuel tanks from stationary storage vessels.


*Gauge float* means a device that is used to indicate the level of liquid within the storage vessel. The float rests on the liquid surface and is housed inside a well that is closed by a removable cover.


*Gauge hatch/sample port/sample well* means an opening in the roof that provides access for gauging or sampling. A gauge hatch is usually equipped with a closing cover or a funnel and slit-fabric seal to cover the opening.


*Internal floating roof* means a floating roof located in a storage vessel with a fixed roof. For the purposes of this subpart, an external floating roof located in a storage vessel to which a fixed roof has been added is considered to be an internal floating roof.


*Liquid-mounted primary seal* means a liquid or foam-filled seal mounted in continuous contact with the liquid between the wall of the storage vessel and the floating roof around the entire circumference of the storage vessel.


*Maximum true vapor pressure* means the equilibrium partial pressure exerted by the volatile organic compounds (as defined in 40 CFR 51.100) in the stored VOL at the temperature equal to the highest calendar-month average of the VOL storage temperature for VOLs stored above or below the ambient temperature or at the local maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather Service for VOLs stored at the ambient temperature, as determined using the procedures specified in ยง 60.113c(d).


*Mechanical shoe primary seal* means a metal sheet (the shoe) held vertically against the wall of the storage vessel by springs or weighted levels and is connected by braces to the floating roof. A flexible coated fabric (the envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.


*Petroleum* means the crude oil removed from the earth and the oils derived from tar sands, shale, and coal.


*Petroleum liquids* means petroleum, condensate, and any finished or intermediate products manufactured in a petroleum refinery.


*Pressure release* means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device or resulting from vacuum breaking device failing to close prior to the system reaching atmospheric pressure. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period.


*Pressure relief device* means a valve, rupture disk, or similar device used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage. Devices with low opening pressures must be monitored as bypass lines. A pressure relief device discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause. Such devices include conventional, spring-actuated relief valves, balanced bellows relief valves, pilot-operated relief valves, rupture disks, and breaking, buckling, or shearing pin devices. Devices that are actuated only by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices. If a device has both a pressure relief function and a vacuum breaking function, such as a conservation vent, the portion of the conservation vent that acts to relieve pressure is considered a pressure relief device and the portion of the conservation vent that acts to relieve vacuum is a vacuum breaking device and not a pressure relief device.


*Process tank* means a tank that is used within a process (including a solvent or raw material recovery process) to collect material discharged from a feedstock storage vessel or equipment within the process before the material is transferred to other equipment within the process, to a product or by-product storage vessel, or to a vessel used to store recovered solvent or raw material. In many process tanks, unit operations such as reactions and blending are conducted. Other process tanks, such as surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, however, may not involve unit operations.


*Reid vapor pressure* means the absolute vapor pressure of volatile crude oil and volatile nonviscous petroleum liquids except liquified petroleum gases.


*Rim-mounted secondary seal* means a secondary seal mounted on the rim of the floating roof of a storage vessel and forms continuous seal from the rim of the floating roof to the wall of the storage vessel.


*Rim seal system* means a primary seal or a primary and secondary seal, which is mounted above the primary seal, and is attached to the deck perimeter and contacts the storage vessel wall.


*Rim vent* means a device consisting of a weighted pallet that rests on a valve seat. Rim vents are used to release any excess pressure or vacuum present in the vapor pocket between the seal and the rim area of a floating roof storage vessel.


*Routed to a process or route to a process* means the emissions are conveyed by hardpiping or a closed vent system to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominately recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process; and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not volatile organic liquids; and/or incorporated into a product; and/or recovered.


*Storage vessel* means each tank, reservoir, or container used for the storage of volatile organic liquids but does not include:


(1) Frames, housing, auxiliary supports, or other components that are not directly involved in the containment of liquids or vapors;


(2) Subsurface caverns or porous rock reservoirs; or


(3) Process tanks.


*Vacuum breaker/automatic bleeder vent* means a device used to equalize the pressure of the vapor space across the deck of a floating roof as the floating roof is either being landed on or floated off its roof supports. A vacuum breaker/automatic bleeder vent consists of a well with a cover. The cover is designed to open as the floating roof is landed. Opening of the cover may be accomplished by mechanisms such as leg actuation or pressure actuation.


*Vacuum breaking device* means a device on a fixed roof of a storage vessel used to prevent mechanical failure of the storage vessel due to vacuum created as liquids are withdrawn from the storage vessel. If a device has both a pressure relief function and a vacuum breaking function, such as a conservation vent, the portion of the conservation vent that acts to relieve vacuum is considered a vacuum breaking device and the portion of the conservation vent that acts to relieve excess pressure is a pressure relief device and not a vacuum breaking device.


*Volatile organic liquid (VOL)* means any organic liquid which can emit volatile organic compounds (as defined in 40 CFR 51.100) into the atmosphere.


*Waste* means any liquid resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations, or from community activities that is discarded or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, or biologically treated prior to being discarded or recycled.
