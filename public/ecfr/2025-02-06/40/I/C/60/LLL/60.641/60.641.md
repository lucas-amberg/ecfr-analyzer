# ยง 60.641   Definitions.

All terms used in this subpart not defined below are given the meaning in the Act and in subpart A of this part.


*Acid gas* means a gas stream of hydrogen sulfide (H_2_S) and carbon dioxide (CO_2_) that has been separated from sour natural gas by a sweetening unit.


*Natural gas* means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's surface. The principal hydrocarbon constituent is methane.


*Onshore* means all facilities except those that are located in the territorial seas or on the outercontinental shelf.


*Reduced sulfur compounds* means H_2_S, carbonyl sulfide (COS), and carbon disulfide (CS_2_).


*Sulfur production rate* means the rate of liquid sulfur accumulation from the sulfur recovery unit.


*Sulfur recovery unit* means a process device that recovers element sulfur from acid gas.


*Sweetening unit* means a process device that separates the H_2_S and CO_2_ contents from the sour natural gas stream.


*Total SO*_2_ equivalents means the sum of volumetric or mass concentrations of the sulfur compounds obtained by adding the quantity existing as SO_2_ to the quantity of SO_2_ that would be obtained if all reduced sulfur compounds were converted to SO_2_ (ppmv or kg/dscm (lb/dscf)).
