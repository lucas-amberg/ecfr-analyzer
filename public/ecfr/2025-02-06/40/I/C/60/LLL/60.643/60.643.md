# § 60.643   Compliance provisions.

(a)(1) To determine compliance with the standards for sulfur dioxide specified in § 60.642(a), during the initial performance test as required by § 60.8, the minimum required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency (Z) is compared to the emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur recovery technology.


(i) If R ≥ Z_i_, the affected facility is in compliance.


(ii) If R < Z_i_, the affected facility is not in compliance.


(2) Following the initial determination of compliance as required by § 60.8, any subsequent compliance determinations that may be required by the Administrator would compare R to Z_c_.


(b) The emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur reduction technology shall be determined using the procedures in § 60.644(c)(1).
