(d) *Air pollution control device inspections.* Records of the results of initial and annual air pollution control device inspections conducted as specified in §§ 60.4875 and 60.4900(c), including any required maintenance and any repairs not completed within 10 days of an inspection or the timeframe established by the Administrator.


(e) *Performance test reports.* (1) The results of the initial, annual, and any subsequent performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits and standards and/or to establish operating limits, as applicable.


(2) Retain a copy of the complete performance test report, including calculations.


(3) Keep a record of the hourly dry sludge feed rate measured during performance test runs, as specified in § 60.4900(a)(2)(i).


(4) Keep any necessary records to demonstrate that the performance test was conducted under conditions representative of normal operations, including a record of the moisture content measured as required in § 60.4900(a)(2)(ii) for each grab sample taken of the sewage sludge burned during the performance test.


(f) *Continuous monitoring data.* Records of the following data, as applicable:


(1) For continuous emissions monitoring systems, all 1-hour average concentrations of particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans total mass basis, mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, and lead emissions.


(2) For continuous automated sampling systems, all average concentrations measured for mercury and dioxins/furans total mass basis at the frequencies specified in your monitoring plan.


(3) For continuous parameter monitoring systems:


(i) All 1-hour average values recorded for the following operating parameters, as applicable:


(A) Combustion chamber operating temperature (or afterburner temperature).


(B) If a wet scrubber is used to comply with the rule, pressure drop across each wet scrubber system, liquid flow rate to each wet scrubber used to comply with the emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart for particulate matter, cadmium, or lead, and scrubber liquid flow rate and scrubber liquid pH for each wet scrubber used to comply with an emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart for sulfur dioxide or hydrogen chloride.


(C) If an electrostatic precipitator is used to comply with the rule, secondary voltage and secondary amperage of the electrostatic precipitator collection plates, and effluent water flow rate at the outlet of the wet electrostatic precipitator.


(D) If activated carbon injection is used to comply with the rule, sorbent flow rate and carrier gas flow rate or pressure drop, as applicable.


(ii) All daily average values recorded for the feed rate and moisture content of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator, monitored and calculated as specified in § 60.4850(f).


(iii) If a fabric filter is used to comply with the rule, the date, time, and duration of each alarm and the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm and the corrective action taken. You must also record the percent of operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds, calculated as specified in § 60.4890.


(iv) For other control devices for which you must establish operating limits under § 60.4855, you must maintain data collected for all operating parameters used to determine compliance with the operating limits, at the frequencies specified in your monitoring plan.


(g) *Other records for continuous monitoring systems.* You must keep the following records, as applicable:


(1) Keep records of any notifications to the Administrator in § 60.4915(h)(1) of starting or stopping use of a continuous monitoring system for determining compliance with any emissions limit.


(2) Keep records of any requests under § 60.4900(b)(5) that compliance with the emission limits be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen.


(3) If activated carbon injection is used to comply with the rule, the type of sorbent used and any changes in the type of sorbent used.


(h) *Deviation Reports.* Records of any deviation reports submitted under § 60.4915(e) and (f).


(i) *Equipment specifications and operation and maintenance requirements.* Equipment specifications and related operation and maintenance requirements received from vendors for the incinerator, emission controls, and monitoring equipment.


(j) *Inspections, calibrations, and validation checks of monitoring devices.* Records of inspections, calibrations, and validations checks of any monitoring devices as required under §§ 60.4900 and 60.4905.


(k) *Monitoring plan and performance evaluations for continuous monitoring systems.* Records of the monitoring plans required under § 60.4880, and records of performance evaluations required under § 60.4885(b)(5).


(l) *Less frequent testing.* If, consistent with 60.4885(a)(3), you elect to conduct performance tests less frequently than annually, you must keep annual records that document that your emissions in the 2 previous consecutive years were at or below 75 percent of the applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, and document that there were no changes in source operations or air pollution control equipment that would cause emissions of the relevant pollutant to increase within the past 2 years.


(m) *Use of bypass stack.* Records indicating use of the bypass stack, including dates, times, and durations as required under § 60.4905(d).


(n) If a malfunction occurs, you must keep a record of the information submitted in your annual report in § 60.4915(d)(16).
