# § 60.393a   Performance test and compliance provisions.

(a) *Representative conditions.* You must conduct performance tests under representative conditions for the affected coating operation according to § 60.8(c) and under the conditions in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 60.8(b)(4).


(1) Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or nonoperation do not constitute conditions representative of normal operation for purposes of conducting a performance test. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. Emissions in excess of the applicable emission limit during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction will be considered a violation of the applicable emission limit.


(2) You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the performance test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.


(3) Section 60.8(d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test procedures required by this section.


(b) *Initial and continuous compliance requirements.* You must conduct an initial performance test in accordance with § 60.8(a) and thereafter for each calendar month for each affected facility according to the procedures in this section. You must also conduct periodic performance tests of add-on controls, except for solvent recovery systems for which liquid-liquid material balances are conducted according to paragraph (l) of this section, to reestablish the operating limits required by § 60.392a within 5 years following the previous performance test. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance.


(1) To demonstrate initial compliance, the VOC emissions from affected source must meet the applicable emission limitation in § 60.392a and the work practice standards in § 60.392a and the applicable operating limits in § 60.392a established during the initial performance test using the procedures in § 60.394a and table 1 to this subpart.


(i) You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of this section. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 60.8 and ends on the last day of the month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next month.


(ii) You must determine the mass of VOC emissions and volume of coating solids deposited in the initial compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to §§ 60.396a and 60.397a; supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period the VOC emission rate was equal to or less than the emission limit in § 60.392a; the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by § 60.394a; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plans required by § 60.392(b) and (c).


(2) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 60.392a, the VOC emission rate for each compliance period, determined according to the procedures in this section, must be equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 60.392a. A compliance period consists of 1 month. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 60.393a(b)(1)(i) is a compliance period consisting of that month. You must perform the calculations in this section on a monthly basis.


(3) If the VOC emission rate for any 1-month compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 60.392a, this is a deviation from the emission limitation for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in § 60.395a(h).


(c) *Compliance with operating limits.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by § 60.392a, using the procedures specified in § 60.394a.


(1) You do not need to comply with the operating limits for the emission capture system and add-on control device required by § 60.394a until after you have completed the initial performance test specified in paragraph (b) of this section. During the period between the startup date of the affected source and the initial performance test required by § 60.8 you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, the add-on control device, and the continuous monitoring system (CMS).


(2) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating limit required by § 60.392a that applies to you, as specified in Table 1 to this subpart, and you must conduct performance tests as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(3) If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified in table 1 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit that must be reported as specified in § 60.395a(h).


(4) If an operating parameter deviates from the operating limit specified in table 1 to this subpart, then you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation except as provided in § 60.393a (m).


(5) Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to paragraph (l) of this section for controlled coating operations, you must conduct periodic performance tests of add-on controls and reestablish the operating limits required by § 60.392a within 5 years following the previous performance test. You must conduct the first periodic performance test within 5 years following the initial performance test required by § 60.8. Thereafter, you must conduct a performance test no later than 5 years following the previous performance test. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during each performance test. If you are using the alternative monitoring option for a catalytic oxidizer according to § 60.394a(b)(3) and following the catalyst maintenance procedures in § 60.394a(b)(4), you are not required to conduct periodic control device performance testing as specified by this paragraph (c). For any control device for which instruments are used to continuously measure organic compound emissions, you are not required to conduct periodic control device performance testing as specified by this paragraph. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to measuring emission capture system efficiency.


(6) You must meet the requirements for bypass lines in § 60.394a(h) for control devices other than solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. If any bypass line is opened and emissions are diverted to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running, this is a deviation that must be reported as specified in § 60.395a(h). For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in paragraph (j) of this section, you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation.


(d) *Compliance with work practice requirements.* You must develop, implement, and document implementation of the work practice plans required by § 60.392a(b) and (c) during the initial compliance period, as specified in § 60.395a.


(1) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards in § 60.392a (b) and (c). If you did not develop a work practice plan, if you did not implement the plan, or if you did not keep the records required by § 60.395a (k)(11), this is a deviation from the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in § 60.395a (k)(4).


(2) [Reserved]


(e) *Compliance with emission limits.* You must use the following procedures in paragraphs (f) through (m) of this section to determine the monthly volume weighted average mass of VOC emitted per volume of applied coating solids for each affected facility to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limitation in § 60.392a. You may also use the guidelines presented in “Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat” EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 60.17) in making this demonstration.


(f) *Determine the mass fraction of VOC, density, and volume for each material used.* You must follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section to determine the mass fraction of VOC, the density, and volume for each coating and thinner used during each month. For the electrodeposition primer operation, the mass fraction of VOC, density, and volume used must be determined for each material added to the tank or system during each month.


(1) *Determine the mass fraction of VOC for each material used.* You must determine the mass fraction of VOC for each material used during the compliance period by using one of the options in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) *EPA Method 24 (appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60).* For coatings, you may use EPA Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for the mass fraction of VOC. As an alternative to using EPA Method 24, you may use ASTM D2369-20 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample taken in a 1-liter container.


(ii) *Alternative method.* You may use an alternative test method for determining the mass fraction of VOC once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in § 60.8(b)(3) to submit an alternative test method for approval.


(iii) *Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.* You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data. If there is a disagreement between such information and results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, then the test method results will take precedence, unless after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.


(2) *Determine the density of each material used.* Determine the density of each material used during the compliance period from test results using ASTM D1475-13 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) or for powder coatings, test method A or test method B of ASTM D5965-02 (Reapproved 2013) (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. If there is disagreement between ASTM D1475-13 test results or ASTM D5965-02 (Reapproved 2013), Test Method A or Test Method B test results and the supplier's or manufacturer's information, the test results will take precedence unless after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the supplier's or manufacturer's data are correct.


(3) *Determine the volume of each material used.* You must determine from company records on a monthly basis the volume of coating consumed, as received, and the mass of solvent used for thinning purposes.

For electrodeposition primer operations, the volume fraction of solids must be determined for each material added to the tank or system during each month. If test results obtained according to paragraph (g)(1) of this section do not agree with the information obtained under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.


(1) *ASTM Method D2697-22 or ASTM Method D6093-97.* You may use ASTM D2697-22 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or ASTM D6093-97 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), to determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Divide the nonvolatile volume percent obtained with the methods by 100 to calculate volume fraction of coating solids.


(2) *Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.* You may obtain the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating from the supplier or manufacturer.


(h) *Determine the transfer efficiency for each coating.* You must determine the transfer efficiency for each non-electrodeposition prime coat coating, each guide coat coating and each topcoat coating using ASTM Method D5066-91 (Reapproved 2017), “Standard Test Method for Determination of the Transfer Efficiency Under Production Conditions for Spray Application of Automotive Paints—Weight Basis” (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or the guidelines presented in “Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat” EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). You may conduct transfer efficiency testing on representative coatings and for representative spray booths as described in “Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat” EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). You may assume 100 percent transfer efficiency for electrodeposition primer coatings.

(4) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility using Equation 4 of this section:


(5) Select the appropriate limit according to § 60.392a. If the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids (G), calculated on a calendar month basis, is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit specified in § 60.392a, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test for the purpose of this subpart.

(ii) If two or more add-on control devices are used for the same emission stream, you must measure emissions at the outlet of each device in accordance with § 60.396a(c). If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions in accordance with § 60.396a(d). The emission destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on control device is the average of the efficiencies determined in the three test runs. The destruction or removal efficiency determined using these data shall be applied to each affected facility served by the control device.


(5) Calculate the mass of VOC for each affected facility each calendar month for each period of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an emission limitation, an operating limit or any CMS requirement for the capture system or control device serving the controlled coating operation occurred. Except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section, for any period of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an emission limitation or operating limit or from any CMS requirement of the capture system or control device serving the controlled coating operation occurred, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device. During such a deviation you must assume the affected source was uncontrolled for the duration of the deviation using the equation in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.


(6) Adjust the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids emitted after the control device for each affected facility (N) during a calendar month for periods of deviation by adding the mass of VOC for the uncontrolled period of time according to paragraph (i)(5) of this section.


(7) If the adjusted volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied solids emitted after the control device (N) calculated on a calendar month basis is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit specified in § 60.392a, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test for the purposes of this subpart.


(k) *Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC emitted per volume of applied coating solids after add-on recovery devices.* You must use the following procedures for each affected facility which uses a capture system and a control device that recovers the VOC (*e.g.,* carbon adsorber) other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under § 60.392a.

Each monthly calculation is a performance test for the purposes of this subpart.


(l) *Calculate the collection and recovery efficiency for solvent recovery systems using liquid-liquid material balances.* You must use the following procedures for each affected facility which uses a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under § 60.392a.


(1) Calculate the mass of VOC emission reduction for the coating operation controlled by the solvent recovery system using a liquid-liquid material balance for each affected facility by applying the volatile organic matter collection and recovery efficiency to the mass of VOC contained in the coatings and thinners used in the coating operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during each month. Perform a liquid-liquid material balance for each month as specified in paragraphs (l)(1) through (6) of this section.


(2) For each solvent recovery system, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the cumulative amount of volatile organic matter recovered by the solvent recovery system each month. The device must be initially certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±2.0 percent of the mass of volatile organic matter recovered.


(3) For each solvent recovery system, determine the mass of volatile organic matter recovered for the month based on measurement with the device required in paragraphs (l)(l) and (2) of this section.

(5) Calculate the solvent recovery system's volatile organic matter collection and recovery efficiency (R_V_) for each affected facility using Equation 7 of this section:


(6) For each affected facility, you may apply the solvent recovery system's volatile organic matter collection and recovery efficiency to the mass of VOC for the coating operation controlled by the solvent recovery system for each calendar month.


(m) *Deviations.* You may request approval from the Administrator to use non-zero capture efficiencies and add-on control device efficiencies for any period of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an emission limitation, operating limit or any CMS requirement for the capture system or add-on control device serving a controlled coating operation occurred.


(1) If you have manually collected parameter data indicating that a capture system or add-on control device was operating normally during a CMS malfunction, a CMS out-of-control period, or associated repair, then these data may be used to support and document your request to use the normal capture efficiency or add-on control device efficiency for that period of deviation.


(2) If you have data indicating the actual performance of a capture system or add-on control device (*e.g.,* capture efficiency measured at a reduced flow rate or add-on control device efficiency measured at a reduced thermal oxidizer temperature) during a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an emission limitation or operating limit or from any CMS requirement for the capture system or add-on control device serving a controlled coating operation, then these data may be used to support and document your request to use these values for that period of deviation.


(3) You may recalculate the adjusted volume weighted average mass of VOC emitted per volume of applied coating solids after add-on controls in paragraph (j)(6) of this section, and the adjusted volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids emitted after the recovery device in paragraph (k)(4) of this section, based on Administrator approval of the non-zero capture efficiency and add-on control device efficiency values based on data provided in accordance with paragraphs (m)(1) and (2) of this section.


(n) *No deviations.* If there were no deviations from the emission limitations, submit a statement as part of the compliance report that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the VOC emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 60.392a, you achieved the operating limits required by § 60.394a, and you achieved the work practice standards required by § 60.392a during each compliance period.
