# § 60.396a   Add-on control device destruction efficiency.

You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance test required by § 60.393a(j)(4), except as provided in § 60.8. You must conduct three test runs as specified in §§ 60.8(f) and 60.394a, and each test run must last at least 1 hour.


(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Use EPA Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.


(2) Use EPA Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, or 2F of appendix A-1, or 2G of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.


(3) Use EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. The ASME/ANSI PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 60.17), may be used as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.


(4) Use EPA Method 4 of appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60 to determine stack gas moisture.


(5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.


(b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon in the effluent gas leaving each stack not equipped with a control device and at the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously, using either EPA Method 25 or 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. You must use the same method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.


(1) Use Method 25 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be more than 50 parts per million by volume (ppmv) at the control device outlet.


(2) Use Method 25A if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be 50 ppmv or less at the control device outlet.


(3) Use Method 25A if the add-control device is not an oxidizer.


(4) You may use EPA Method 18 of appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 to subtract methane emissions from measured total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon.


(5) For Method 25 and 25A, the sampling time for each of three runs must be at least one hour. The minimum sample volume must be 0.003 dscm except that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator. The Administrator will approve the sampling of representative stacks on a case-by-case basis if you can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the testing of representative stacks would yield results comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all stacks.


(c) If two or more add-on control devices are used for the same emission stream, then you must measure emissions at the outlet of each device. For example, if one add-on control device is a concentrator with an outlet for the high-volume, dilute stream that has been treated by the concentrator, and a second add-on control device is an oxidizer with an outlet for the low-volume, concentrated stream that is treated with the oxidizer, you must measure emissions at the outlet of the oxidizer and the high-volume dilute stream outlet of the concentrator.


(d) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rates (M_f_) for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions.


(e) For each test run, determine the add-on control device organic emissions destruction or removal efficiency using Equation 2 of this section:


(f) Determine the emission destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on control device as the average of the efficiencies determined in the three test runs and calculated in Equation 2 of this section.
