# § 60.142   Standard for particulate matter.

(a) Except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall discharge or cause the discharge into the atmosphere from any affected facility any gases which:


(1) Contain particulate matter in excess of 50 mg/dscm (0.022 gr/dscf). 


(2) Exit from a control device and exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater, except that an opacity of greater than 10 percent but less than 20 percent may occur once per steel production cycle.


(b) For affected facilities constructed, modified, or reconstructed after January 20, 1983, the following limits shall apply:


(1) On or after the date on which the performance test under § 60.8 is required to be completed, no owner or operator of an affected facility for which open hooding is the method for controlling primary emissions shall cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any gases that:


(i) Contain particulate matter in excess of 50 mg/dscm (0.022 gr/dscf), as measured for the primary oxygen blow.


(ii) Exit from a control device not used solely for the collection of secondary emissions, as defined in § 60.141a, and exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater, except that an opacity greater than 10 percent but less than 20 percent may occur once per steel production cycle.


(2) On or after the date on which the performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator of an affected facility for which closed hooding is the method for controlling primary emissions shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that:


(i) Contain particulate matter in excess of 68 mg/dscm (0.030 gr/dscf), as measured for the primary oxygen blow.


(ii) Exit from a control device not used solely for the collection of secondary emissions, as defined in § 60.141a, and exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater, except that an opacity greater than 10 percent but less than 20 percent may occur once per steel production cycle.


(c) On and after the date on which the performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to paragraph (b) of this section shall operate the primary gas cleaning system during any reblow in a manner identical to operation during the primary oxygen blow.
