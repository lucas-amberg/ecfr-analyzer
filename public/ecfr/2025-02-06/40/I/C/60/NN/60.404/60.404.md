# § 60.404   Test methods and procedures.

(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided for in § 60.8(b).


(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.402 as follows:


(1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed for each run using the following equation:


(2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration (c_s_) and volumetric flow rate (Q_sd_) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).


(3) The device of § 60.403(d) shall be used to determine the phosphate rock feed rate (P) for each run.


(4) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.


(c) To comply with § 60.403(f), if applicable, the owner or operator shall use the monitoring devices in § 60.403(c) (1) and (2) to determine the average pressure loss of the gas stream through the scrubber and the average scrubbing supply pressure during the particulate matter runs.
