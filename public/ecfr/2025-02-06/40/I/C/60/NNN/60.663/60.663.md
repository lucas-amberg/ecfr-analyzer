# § 60.663   Monitoring of emissions and operations.

(a) The owner or operator of an affected facility that uses an incinerator to seek to comply with the TOC emission limit specified under § 60.662(a) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:


(1) A temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 °C, whichever is greater.


(i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox.


(ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.


(2) A flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow to the incinerator at least once every hour for each affected facility. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from each affected facility at a point closest to the inlet of each incinerator and before being joined with any other vent stream.


(b) The owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a flare to seek to comply with § 60.662(b) shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:


(1) A heat sensing device, such as an ultra-violet beam sensor or thermocouple, at the pilot light to indicate the continuous presence of a flame.


(2) A flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow to the flare at least once every hour for each affected facility. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from each affected facility at a point closest to the flare and before being joined with any other vent stream.


(c) The owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a boiler or process heater to seek to comply with § 60.662(a) shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:


(1) A flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow to the boiler or process heater at least once every hour for each affected facility. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from each distillation unit within an affected facility at a point closest to the inlet of each boiler or process heater and before being joined with any other vent stream.


(2) A temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 °C, whichever is greater, for boilers or process heaters of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr) heat input design capacity.


(d) Monitor and record the periods of operation of the boiler or process heater if the design heat input capacity of the boiler or process heater is 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr) or greater. The records must be readily available for inspection.


(e) The owner or operator of an affected facility that seeks to comply with the TRE index value limit specified under § 60.662(c) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment, unless alternative monitoring procedures or requirements are approved for that facility by the Administrator:


(1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system:


(i) A scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 °C, whichever is greater, and a specific gravity monitoring device having an accuracy of ±0.02 specific gravity units, each equipped with a continuous recorder, or


(ii) An organic monitoring device used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds exiting the recovery device based on a detection principle such as infrared, photoionization, or thermal conductivity, each equipped with a continuous recorder.


(2) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system:


(i) A condenser exit (product side) temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 °C, whichever is greater, or


(ii) An organic monitoring device used to monitor organic compounds exiting the recovery device based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photoionization, or thermal conductivity, each equipped with a continuous recorder.


(3) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device unit in the recovery system:


(i) An integrating steam flow monitoring device having an accuracy of ±10 percent, and a carbon bed temperature monitoring device having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 °C, whichever is greater, both equipped with a continuous recorder, or


(ii) An organic monitoring device used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds exiting the recovery device based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photoionization, or thermal conductivity, each equipped with a continuous recorder.


(f) An owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to demonstrate compliance with the standards specified under § 60.662 with control devices other than incinerator, boiler, process heater, or flare; or recovery device other than an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber shall provide to the Administrator information describing the operation of the control device or recovery device and the process parameter(s) which would indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The Administrator may request further information and will specify appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.
