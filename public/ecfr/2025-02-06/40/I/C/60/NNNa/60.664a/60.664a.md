# § 60.664a   What test methods and procedures must I use to determine compliance with the standards?

(a) For the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the emission limits and standards specified in table 1 to this subpart, all affected facilities must be run at full operating conditions and flow rates during any performance test. Performance tests are not required if you determine compliance using a CEMS that meets the requirements outlined in paragraph (g) of this section.


(1) Conduct initial performance tests no later than the date required by § 60.8(a).


(2) Conduct subsequent performance tests no later than 60 calendar months after the previous performance test.


(b) The following methods, except as provided in § 60.8(b) must, must be used as reference methods to determine compliance with the emission limit or percent reduction efficiency specified in table 1 to this subpart for non-flare control devices and/or recovery systems.


(1) Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 to this part, as appropriate, for selection of the sampling sites. The inlet sampling site for determination of vent stream molar composition or TOC (less methane and ethane) reduction efficiency shall be prior to the inlet of the control device or, if equipped with a recovery system, then prior to the inlet of the first recovery device in the recovery system.


(2) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A-1 to this part, as appropriate, for determination of the gas volumetric flow rates.


(3) Method 3A of appendix A-2 to this part or the manual method in ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see §  60.17) must be used to determine the oxygen concentration (%O2d) for the purposes of determining compliance with the 20 ppmv limit. The sampling site must be the same as that of the TOC samples, and the samples must be taken during the same time that the TOC samples are taken. The TOC concentration corrected to 3 percent O_2_ (C_c_) must be computed using the following equation:


(4) Method 18 of appendix A-6 to this part to determine the concentration of TOC in the control device outlet or in the outlet of the final recovery device in a recovery system, and to determine the concentration of TOC in the inlet when the reduction efficiency of the control device or recovery system is to be determined. ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) may be used in lieu of Method 18, if the target compounds are all known and are all listed in section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 as measurable; ASTM D6420-18 may not be used for methane and ethane; and ASTM D6420-18 must not be used as a total VOC method.


(i) The sampling time for each run must be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or at least four grab samples must be taken. If grab sampling is used then the samples must be taken at 15-minute intervals.


(ii) The emission reduction (R) of TOC (minus methane and ethane) must be determined using the following equation:


(iii) The mass rates of TOC (E_i_, E_o_) must be computed using the following equations:


(iv) The TOC concentration (C_TOC_) is the sum of the individual components and must be computed for each run using the following equation:


(c) The requirement for initial and subsequent performance tests are waived, in accordance with § 60.8(b), for the following:


(1) When a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to seek to comply with the emission limit or percent reduction efficiency specified in table 1 to this subpart.


(2) When a vent stream is introduced into a boiler or process heater with the primary fuel.


(3) When a boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste is used for which the owner or operator:


(i) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H;


(ii) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H;


(iii) Has submitted a Notification of Compliance under 40 CFR 63.1207(j) and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEE; or


(iv) Complies with 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEE and will submit a Notification of Compliance under 40 CFR 63.1207(j) by the date the owner or operator would have been required to submit the initial performance test report for this subpart.


(4) The Administrator reserves the option to require testing at such other times as may be required, as provided for in section 114 of the Act.


(d) For purposes of complying with the 98 weight-percent reduction in § 60.702a(a), if the vent stream entering a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) is introduced with the combustion air or as secondary fuel, the weight-percent reduction of TOC (minus methane and ethane) across the combustion device shall be determined by comparing the TOC (minus methane and ethane) in all combusted vent streams, primary fuels, and secondary fuels with the TOC (minus methane and ethane) exiting the combustion device.


(e) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660a(c)(5) must use Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A-1 to this part as appropriate, for determination of volumetric flow rate. The owner or operator must conduct three velocity traverses and determine the volumetric flow rate for each traverse. If the pipe or duct is smaller than four inches in diameter, the owner operator may conduct the measurement at the centroid of the duct instead of conducting a traverse; the measurement period must be at least five minutes long and data must be recorded at least once every 30 seconds. Owners and operators who conduct the determination with Method 2A or 2D must record volumetric flow rate every 30 seconds for at least five minutes.


(f) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660a(c)(6) must use the following methods:


(1) Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 to this part, as appropriate.


(2) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A-1 to this part, as appropriate, for determination of the gas volumetric flow rates.


(3) Method 18 of appendix A-6 to this part to determine the concentration of TOC. ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) may be used in lieu of Method 18, if the target compounds are all known and are all listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 as measurable; ASTM D6420-18 may not be used for methane and ethane; and ASTM D6420-18 must not be used as a total VOC method.


(i) The sampling site must be at a location that provides a representative sample of the vent stream.


(ii) Perform three test runs. The sampling time for each run must be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or at least four grab samples must be taken. If grab sampling is used then the samples must be taken at 15-minute intervals.


(iii) The mass rate of TOC (E) must be computed using the following equation:


(g) If you use a CEMS to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the TOC standard in table 1 of this subpart, each CEMS must be installed, operated and maintained according to the requirements in § 60.13 and paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) You must use a CEMS that is capable of measuring the target analyte(s) as demonstrated using either process knowledge of the control device inlet stream or the screening procedures of Method 18 of appendix A-6 to this part on the control device inlet stream.
