# ยง 60.141a   Definitions.

All terms in this subpart not defined below are given the same meaning as in the Clean Air Act as amended or in subpart A of this part.


*Basic oxygen process furnace (BOPF)* means any furnace with a refractory lining in which molten steel is produced by charging scrap metal, molten iron, and flux materials or alloy additions into a vessel and by introducing a high volume of oxygen-rich gas. Open hearth, blast, and reverberatory furnaces are not included in this definition.


*Bottom-blown furnace* means any BOPF in which oxygen and other combustion gases are introduced to the bath of molten iron through tuyeres in the bottom of the vessel or through tuyeres in the bottom and sides of the vessel.


*Fume suppression system* means the equipment comprising any system used to inhibit the generation of emissions from steelmaking facilities with an inert gas, flame, or steam blanket applied to the surface of molten iron or steel.


*Hot metal transfer station* means the facility where molten iron is emptied from the railroad torpedo car or hot metal car to the shop ladle. This includes the transfer of molten iron from the torpedo car or hot metal car to a mixer (or other intermediate vessel) and from a mixer (or other intermediate vessel) to the ladle. This facility is also known as the reladling station or ladle transfer station.


*Primary emission control system* means the combination of equipment used for the capture and collection of primary emissions (e.g., an open hood capture system used in conjunction with a particulate matter cleaning device such as an electrostatic precipitator or a closed hood capture system used in conjunction with a particulate matter cleaning device such as a scrubber).


*Primary emissions* means particulate matter emissions from the BOPF generated during the steel production cycle which are captured by, and do not thereafter escape from, the BOPF primary control system.


*Primary oxygen blow* means the period in the steel production cycle of a BOPF during which a high volume of oxygen-rich gas is introduced to the bath of molten iron by means of a lance inserted from the top of the vessel. This definition does not include any additional, or secondary, oxygen blows made after the primary blow.


*Secondary emission control system* means the combination of equipment used for the capture and collection of secondary emissions (e.g., 


(1) An open hood system for the capture and collection of primary and secondary emissions from the BOPF, with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device such as a baghouse for the capture and collection of emissions from the hot metal transfer and skimming station; or 


(2) An open hood system for the capture and collection of primary and secondary emissions from the furnace, plus a furnace enclosure with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device, such as a baghouse, for additional capture and collection of secondary emissions from the furnace, with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device, such as a baghouse, for the capture and collection of emissions from hot metal transfer and skimming station; or 


(3) A furnace enclosure with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device such as a baghouse for the capture and collection of secondary emissions from a BOPF controlled by a closed hood primary emission control system, with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device, such as a baghouse, for the capture and collection of emissions from hot metal transfer and skimming stations).


*Secondary emissions* means particulate matter emissions that are not captured by the BOPF primary control system, including emissions from hot metal transfer and skimming stations. This definition also includes particulate matter emissions that escape from openings in the primary emission control system, such as from lance hole openings, gaps or tears in the ductwork of the primary emission control system, or leaks in hoods.


*Skimming station* means the facility where slag is mechanically raked from the top of the bath of molten iron.


*Steel production cycle* means the operations conducted within the BOPF steelmaking facility that are required to produce each batch of steel, including the following operations: scrap charging, preheating (when used), hot metal charging, primary oxygen blowing, sampling (vessel turndown and turnup), additional oxygen blowing (when used), tapping, and deslagging. Hot metal transfer and skimming operations for the next steel production cycle are also included when the hot metal transfer station or skimming station is an affected facility.


*Top-blown furnace* means any BOPF in which oxygen is introduced to the bath of molten iron by means of an oxygen lance inserted from the top of the vessel.
