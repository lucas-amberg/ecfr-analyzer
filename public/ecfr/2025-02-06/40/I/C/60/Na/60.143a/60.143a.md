# § 60.143a   Monitoring of operations.

(a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a monitoring device that continually measures and records for each steel production cycle the various rates or levels of exhaust ventilation at each phase of the cycle through each duct of the secondary emission capture system. The monitoring device or devices are to be placed at locations near each capture point of the secondary emission capture system to monitor the exhaust ventilation rates or levels adequately, or in alternative locations approved in advance by the Administrator.


(b) If a chart recorder is used, the owner or operator shall use chart recorders that are operated at a minimum chart speed of 3.8 cm/hr (1.5 in./hr).


(c) All monitoring devices required by paragraph (a) of this section are to be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±10 percent compared to Method 2 of appendix A of this part. The owner or operator shall recalibrate and check the device(s) annually and at other times as the Administrator may require, in accordance with the written instructions of the manufacturer and by comparing the device against Method 2.


(d) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall report on a semiannual basis all measurements of exhaust ventilation rates or levels over any 3-hour period that average more than 10 percent below the average rates or levels of exhaust ventilation maintained during the most recent performance test conducted under § 60.8 in which the affected facility demonstrated compliance with the standard under § 60.142a(a)(2). The accuracy of the respective measurements, not to exceed the values specified in paragraph (c) of this section, may be considered when determining the measurement results that must be reported.


(e) If a scrubber primary emission control device is used to collect secondary emissions, the owner or operator shall report on a semiannual basis all measurements of exhaust ventilation rate over any 3-hour period that average more than 10 percent below the average levels maintained during the most recent performance test conducted under § 60.8 in which the affected facility demonstrated compliance with the standard under § 60.142(a)(1).
