# § 60.144a   Test methods and procedures.

(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).


(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.142a as follows:


(1) Start and end times of each steel production cycle during each run shall be recorded (see § 60.145a (c) and (d) for the definitions of start and end times of a cycle).


(2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration. Sampling shall be conducted only during the steel production cycle and for a sufficient number of steel production cycles to obtain a total sample volume of at least 5.67 dscm (200 dscf) for each run.


(3) Method 9 and the procedures of § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity, except sections 2.4 and 2.5 of Method 9 shall be replaced with the following instructions for recording observations and reducing data:


(i) *Section 2.4.* Opacity observations shall be recorded to the nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals. During the initial performance test conducted pursuant to § 60.8, observations shall be made and recorded in this manner for a minimum of three steel production cycles. During any subsequent compliance test, observations may be made for any number of steel production cycles, although, where conditions permit, observations will generally be made for a minimum of three steel production cycles.


(ii) *Section 2.5.* Opacity shall be determined as an average of 12 consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals. For each steel production cycle, divide the observations recorded into sets of 12 consecutive observations. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and in no case shall two sets overlap. For each set of 12 observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of 12 consecutive observations and dividing this sum by 12.


(c) In complying with the requirements of § 60.143a(c), the owner or operator shall conduct an initial test as follows:


(1) For devices that monitor and record the exhaust ventilation rate, compare velocity readings recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings at a point or points that would properly characterize the monitoring device's performance and that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device velocity is within ±10 percent of the Method 2 average.


(2) For devices that monitor the level of exhaust ventilation and record only step changes when a set point rate is reached, compare step changes recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings at a point or points that would properly characterize the performance of the monitoring device and that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device step change is within ±10 percent of the setpoint rate.


(d) To comply with § 60.143a(d) or (e), the owner or operator shall use the monitoring device of § 60.143a(a) to determine the exhaust ventilation rates or levels during the particulate matter runs. Each owner or operator shall then use these rates or levels to determine the 3-hour averages required by § 60.143a(d) and (e).
