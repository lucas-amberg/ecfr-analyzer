*Control device* means the air pollution control equipment used to reduce particulate matter emissions released to the atmosphere from one or more affected facilities at a nonmetallic mineral processing plant.


*Conveying system* means a device for transporting materials from one piece of equipment or location to another location within a plant. Conveying systems include but are not limited to the following: Feeders, belt conveyors, bucket elevators and pneumatic systems.


*Crush* or *Crushing* means to reduce the size of nonmetallic mineral material by means of physical impaction of the crusher or grinding mill upon the material.


*Crusher* means a machine used to crush any nonmetallic minerals, and includes, but is not limited to, the following types: Jaw, gyratory, cone, roll, rod mill, hammermill, and impactor.


*Enclosed truck or railcar loading station* means that portion of a nonmetallic mineral processing plant where nonmetallic minerals are loaded by an enclosed conveying system into enclosed trucks or railcars.


*Fixed plant* means any nonmetallic mineral processing plant at which the processing equipment specified in § 60.670(a) is attached by a cable, chain, turnbuckle, bolt or other means (except electrical connections) to any anchor, slab, or structure including bedrock.


*Fugitive emission* means particulate matter that is not collected by a capture system and is released to the atmosphere at the point of generation.


*Grinding mill* means a machine used for the wet or dry fine crushing of any nonmetallic mineral. Grinding mills include, but are not limited to, the following types: Hammer, roller, rod, pebble and ball, and fluid energy. The grinding mill includes the air conveying system, air separator, or air classifier, where such systems are used.


*Initial crusher* means any crusher into which nonmetallic minerals can be fed without prior crushing in the plant.


*Nonmetallic mineral* means any of the following minerals or any mixture of which the majority is any of the following minerals:


(1) Crushed and Broken Stone, including Limestone, Dolomite, Granite, Traprock, Sandstone, Quartz, Quartzite, Marl, Marble, Slate, Shale, Oil Shale, and Shell.


(2) Sand and Gravel.


(3) Clay including Kaolin, Fireclay, Bentonite, Fuller's Earth, Ball Clay, and Common Clay.


(4) Rock Salt.


(5) Gypsum (natural or synthetic).


(6) Sodium Compounds, including Sodium Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, and Sodium Sulfate.


(7) Pumice.


(8) Gilsonite.


(9) Talc and Pyrophyllite.


(10) Boron, including Borax, Kernite, and Colemanite.


(11) Barite.


(12) Fluorospar.


(13) Feldspar.


(14) Diatomite.


(15) Perlite.


(16) Vermiculite.


(17) Mica.


(18) Kyanite, including Andalusite, Sillimanite, Topaz, and Dumortierite.


*Nonmetallic mineral processing plant* means any combination of equipment that is used to crush or grind any nonmetallic mineral wherever located, including lime plants, power plants, steel mills, asphalt concrete plants, portland cement plants, or any other facility processing nonmetallic minerals except as provided in § 60.670 (b) and (c).


*Portable plant* means any nonmetallic mineral processing plant that is mounted on any chassis or skids and may be moved by the application of a lifting or pulling force. In addition, there shall be no cable, chain, turnbuckle, bolt or other means (except electrical connections) by which any piece of equipment is attached or clamped to any anchor, slab, or structure, including bedrock that must be removed prior to the application of a lifting or pulling force for the purpose of transporting the unit.


*Production line* means all affected facilities (crushers, grinding mills, screening operations, bucket elevators, belt conveyors, bagging operations, storage bins, and enclosed truck and railcar loading stations) which are directly connected or are connected together by a conveying system.


*Saturated material* means, for purposes of this subpart, mineral material with sufficient surface moisture such that particulate matter emissions are not generated from processing of the material through screening operations, bucket elevators and belt conveyors. Material that is wetted solely by wet suppression systems is not considered to be “saturated” for purposes of this definition.


*Screening operation* means a device for separating material according to size by passing undersize material through one or more mesh surfaces (screens) in series, and retaining oversize material on the mesh surfaces (screens). Grizzly feeders associated with truck dumping and static (non-moving) grizzlies used anywhere in the nonmetallic mineral processing plant are not considered to be screening operations.


*Seasonal shut down* means shut down of an affected facility for a period of at least 45 consecutive days due to weather or seasonal market conditions.


*Size* means the rated capacity in tons per hour of a crusher, grinding mill, bucket elevator, bagging operation, or enclosed truck or railcar loading station; the total surface area of the top screen of a screening operation; the width of a conveyor belt; and the rated capacity in tons of a storage bin.


*Stack emission* means the particulate matter that is released to the atmosphere from a capture system.


*Storage bin* means a facility for storage (including surge bins) of nonmetallic minerals prior to further processing or loading.


*Transfer point* means a point in a conveying operation where the nonmetallic mineral is transferred to or from a belt conveyor except where the nonmetallic mineral is being transferred to a stockpile.


*Truck dumping* means the unloading of nonmetallic minerals from movable vehicles designed to transport nonmetallic minerals from one location to another. Movable vehicles include but are not limited to: Trucks, front end loaders, skip hoists, and railcars.


*Vent* means an opening through which there is mechanically induced air flow for the purpose of exhausting from a building air carrying particulate matter emissions from one or more affected facilities.


*Wet material processing operation(s)* means any of the following:


(1) Wet screening operations (as defined in this section) and subsequent screening operations, bucket elevators and belt conveyors in the production line that process saturated materials (as defined in this section) up to the first crusher, grinding mill or storage bin in the production line; or


(2) Screening operations, bucket elevators and belt conveyors in the production line downstream of wet mining operations (as defined in this section) that process saturated materials (as defined in this section) up to the first crusher, grinding mill or storage bin in the production line.


*Wet mining operation* means a mining or dredging operation designed and operated to extract any nonmetallic mineral regulated under this subpart from deposits existing at or below the water table, where the nonmetallic mineral is saturated with water.


*Wet screening operation* means a screening operation at a nonmetallic mineral processing plant which removes unwanted material or which separates marketable fines from the product by a washing process which is designed and operated at all times such that the product is saturated with water.
