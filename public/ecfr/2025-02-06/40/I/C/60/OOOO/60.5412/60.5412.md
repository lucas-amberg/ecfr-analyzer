(i) You must reduce the mass content of VOC in the gases vented to the device by 95.0 percent by weight or greater as determined in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5413.


(ii) You must reduce the concentration of TOC in the exhaust gases at the outlet to the device to a level equal to or less than 275 parts per million by volume as propane on a wet basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen as determined in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5413.


(iii) You must operate at a minimum temperature of 760 °C for a control device that can demonstrate a uniform combustion zone temperature during the performance test conducted under § 60.5413.

(2) Each vapor recovery device (*e.g.,* carbon adsorption system or condenser) or other non-destructive control device must be designed and operated to reduce the mass content of VOC in the gases vented to the device by 95.0 percent by weight or greater as determined in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5413. As an alternative to the performance testing requirements, you may demonstrate initial compliance by conducting a design analysis for vapor recovery devices according to the requirements of § 60.5413(c).


(3) You must design and operate a flare in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5413.


(b) You must operate each control device installed on your centrifugal compressor affected facility in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) You must operate each control device used to comply with this subpart at all times when gases, vapors, and fumes are vented from the wet seal fluid degassing system affected facility, as required under § 60.5380(a), through the closed vent system to the control device. You may vent more than one affected facility to a control device used to comply with this subpart.


(2) For each control device monitored in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5417(a) through (g), you must demonstrate compliance according to the requirements of § 60.5415(b)(2), as applicable.


(c) For each carbon adsorption system used as a control device to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) or (d)(2) of this section, you must manage the carbon in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.


(1) Following the initial startup of the control device, you must replace all carbon in the control device with fresh carbon on a regular, predetermined time interval that is no longer than the carbon service life established according to § 60.5413(c)(2) or (3) or according to the design required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for the carbon adsorption system. You must maintain records identifying the schedule for replacement and records of each carbon replacement as required in § 60.5420(c)(10) and (12).


(2) You must either regenerate, reactivate, or burn the spent carbon removed from the carbon adsorption system in one of the units specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section.


(i) Regenerate or reactivate the spent carbon in a thermal treatment unit for which you have been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 that implements the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart X.


(ii) Regenerate or reactivate the spent carbon in a thermal treatment unit equipped with and operating air emission controls in accordance with this section.


(iii) Regenerate or reactivate the spent carbon in a thermal treatment unit equipped with and operating organic air emission controls in accordance with an emissions standard for VOC under another subpart in 40 CFR part 60 or this part.


(iv) Burn the spent carbon in a hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 that implements the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O.


(v) Burn the spent carbon in a hazardous waste incinerator which you have designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart O.


(vi) Burn the spent carbon in a boiler or industrial furnace for which you have been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 that implements the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.


(vii) Burn the spent carbon in a boiler or industrial furnace that you have designed and operated in accordance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.


(d) Each control device used to meet the emission reduction standard in § 60.5395(d) for your storage vessel affected facility must be installed according to paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable. As an alternative to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, you may install a control device model tested under § 60.5413(d), which meets the criteria in § 60.5413(d)(11) and § 60.5413(e).


(1) Each enclosed combustion device (*e.g.,* thermal vapor incinerator, catalytic vapor incinerator, boiler, or process heater) must be designed to reduce the mass content of VOC emissions by 95.0 percent or greater. Each flare must be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5413(a)(1). You must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) Ensure that each enclosed combustion device is maintained in a leak free condition.


(ii) Install and operate a continuous burning pilot flame.


(iii) Operate the enclosed combustion device with no visible emissions, except for periods not to exceed a total of one minute during any 15 minute period. A visible emissions test using section 11 of EPA Method 22, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, must be performed at least once every calendar month, separated by at least 15 days between each test. The observation period shall be 15 minutes. Devices failing the visible emissions test must follow manufacturer's repair instructions, if available, or best combustion engineering practice as outlined in the unit inspection and maintenance plan, to return the unit to compliant operation. All inspection, repair and maintenance activities for each unit must be recorded in a maintenance and repair log and must be available for inspection. Following return to operation from maintenance or repair activity, each device must pass a Method 22, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, visual observation as described in this paragraph.


(iv) Each enclosed combustion control device (*e.g.,* thermal vapor incinerator, catalytic vapor incinerator, boiler, or process heater) must be designed and operated in accordance with one of the performance requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section.


(A) You must reduce the mass content of VOC in the gases vented to the device by 95.0 percent by weight or greater as determined in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5413.


(B) You must reduce the concentration of TOC in the exhaust gases at the outlet to the device to a level equal to or less than 275 parts per million by volume as propane on a wet basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen as determined in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5413.


(C) You must operate at a minimum temperature of 760 °Celsius, provided the control device has demonstrated, during the performance test conducted under § 60.5413, that combustion zone temperature is an indicator of destruction efficiency.


(D) If a boiler or process heater is used as the control device, then you must introduce the vent stream into the flame zone of the boiler or process heater.


(2) Each vapor recovery device (*e.g.,* carbon adsorption system or condenser) or other non-destructive control device must be designed and operated to reduce the mass content of VOC in the gases vented to the device by 95.0 percent by weight or greater. A carbon replacement schedule must be included in the design of the carbon adsorption system.


(3) You must operate each control device used to comply with this subpart at all times when gases, vapors, and fumes are vented from the storage vessel affected facility through the closed vent system to the control device. You may vent more than one affected facility to a control device used to comply with this subpart.
