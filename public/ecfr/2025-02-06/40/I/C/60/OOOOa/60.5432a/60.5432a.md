# § 60.5432a   How do I determine whether a well is a low pressure well using the low pressure well equation?

(a) To determine that your well is a low pressure well subject to § 60.5375a(f), you must determine whether the characteristics of the well are such that the well meets the definition of low pressure well in § 60.5430a. To determine that the well meets the definition of low pressure well in § 60.5430a, you must use the low pressure well equation below:


(b) You must determine the four values in paragraphs (a)(4) through (7) of this section, using the calculations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(15) of this section.

(8) Calculate the density of oil in the well,


(9) Calculate the oil flow rate, *q*_o_ (*cu ft/sec,*) using the following equation with: the oil formation volume factor, *Bo* (bbl/STBO), as calculated in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and the estimated oil production rate at the well head, *Qo* (STBO/day):


(10) Calculate the critical pressure, P_c_ (psia), and critical temperature, T_c_ (R), using the equations below with: Gas gravity at standard conditions (pressure, *P* = 14.7 (*psia*), temperature, T = 60 (*F*)), γ = 0.75; and where the mole fractions of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in the gas are *X*_N__2_ = 0.168225, *X*_CO__2_ = 0.013163, and *X*_H__2__S_ = 0.013680, respectively:


(11) Calculate reduced pressure, P_r_, and reduced temperature, T_r_, using the following equations with: the bottom hole pressure, *P*_BH_, as determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; the bottom hole temperature, *T*_BH_ (*F*), as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the following equations:


(12)(i) Calculate the gas compressibility factor, *Z*, using the following equation with the reduced pressure, P_r_, calculated in paragraph (b)(11) of this section:
