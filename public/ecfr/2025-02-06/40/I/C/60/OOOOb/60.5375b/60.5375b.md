# § 60.5375b   What GHG and VOC standards apply to well completions at well affected facilities?

(a) You must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section for each well completion operation with hydraulic fracturing and refracturing at a well affected facility, except as provided in paragraphs (f), (g) and (h) of this section. You must maintain a log as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.


(1) For each stage of the well completion operation, follow the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) During the initial flowback stage, route the flowback into one or more well completion vessels or storage vessels and commence operation of a separator unless it is technically infeasible for a separator to function. The separator may be a production separator, but the production separator also must be designed to accommodate flowback. Any gas present in the initial flowback stage is not subject to control under this section.


(ii) During the separation flowback stage, route all recovered liquids from the separator to one or more well completion vessels or storage vessels, re-inject the recovered liquids into the well or another well, or route the recovered liquids to a collection system. Route the recovered gas from the separator into a gas flow line or collection system, re-inject the recovered gas into the well or another well, use the recovered gas as an onsite fuel source, or use the recovered gas for another useful purpose that a purchased fuel or raw material would serve. If it is technically infeasible to route the recovered gas as required above, follow the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If, at any time during the separation flowback stage, it is technically infeasible for a separator to function, you must comply with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.


(iii) You must have the separator onsite or otherwise available for use at a centralized production facility or well pad that services the well completion affected facility during well completions. The separator must be available and ready for use to comply with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section during the entirety of the flowback period, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section.


(A) A well that is not hydraulically fractured or refractured with liquids, or that does not generate condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water such that there is no liquid collection system at the well site is not required to have a separator onsite.


(B) If conditions allow for liquid collection, then the operator must immediately stop the well completion operation, install a separator, and restart the well completion operation in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(C) The owner or operator of a well that meets the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section must submit the report in § 60.5420b(b)(2) and maintain the records in § 60.5420b(c)(1)(iii).


(2) If it is technically infeasible to route the recovered gas as required in § 60.5375b(a)(1)(ii), then you must capture and direct recovered gas to a completion combustion device, except in conditions that may result in a fire hazard or explosion, or where high heat emissions from a completion combustion device may negatively impact tundra, permafrost or waterways. Completion combustion devices must be equipped with a reliable continuous pilot flame.


(3) You have a general duty to safely maximize resource recovery and minimize releases to the atmosphere during flowback and subsequent recovery.


(b) You must maintain a log for each well completion operation at each well affected facility. The log must be completed on a daily basis for the duration of the well completion operation and must contain the records specified in § 60.5420b(c)(1)(iii).


(c) You must demonstrate initial compliance with the well completion operation standards that apply to well affected facilities as required by § 60.5410b(a).


(d) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the well completion operation standards that apply to well affected facilities as required by § 60.5415b(a).


(e) You must perform the required notification, reporting and recordkeeping as required by § 60.5420b(a)(2), (b)(1) and (2), and (c)(1).


(f) For each well affected facility specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(3) and (4) of this section.


(1) Each well completion operation with hydraulic fracturing at a wildcat or delineation well.


(2) Each well completion operation with hydraulic fracturing at a non-wildcat low pressure well or non-delineation low pressure well.


(3) You must comply with paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section. You must also comply with paragraph (b) of this section. As an alternative, if you are able to operate a separator, you may comply with paragraph (b) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section. Compliance with paragraphs (f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section is not required if you meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.


(i) Route all flowback to a completion combustion device, except in conditions that may result in a fire hazard or explosion, or where high heat emissions from a completion combustion device may negatively impact tundra, permafrost or waterways. Completion combustion devices must be equipped with a reliable continuous pilot flame.


(ii) Route all flowback into one or more well completion vessels and commence operation of a separator unless it is technically infeasible for a separator to function. You must have the separator onsite or otherwise available for use at the wildcat well, delineation well, or low pressure well. The separator must be available and ready for use to comply with paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section during the entirety of the flowback period. Any gas present in the flowback before the separator can function is not subject to control under this section. Capture and direct recovered gas to a completion combustion device, except in conditions that may result in a fire hazard or explosion, or where high heat emissions from a completion combustion device may negatively impact tundra, permafrost, or waterways. Completion combustion devices must be equipped with a reliable continuous pilot flame.


(4) You must submit the notification as specified in § 60.5420b(a)(2), submit annual reports as specified in § 60.5420b(b)(1) and (2) and maintain records specified in § 60.5420b(c)(1)(i) through (iii) and (vii) for each wildcat well, each delineation well, and each low pressure well.


(g) For each well completion affected facility with less than 300 scf of gas per stock tank barrel of oil produced, you must comply with paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) You must maintain records specified in § 60.5420b(c)(1)(vi).


(2) You must submit reports specified in § 60.5420b(b)(1) and (2).


(h) A well modified in accordance with § 60.5365b(a)(1)(ii) (*i.e.,* an existing well that is hydraulically refractured) is exempt from the well completion operation standards in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, when the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section are met.
