(i) Verification that your OGI equipment meets the specifications of paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. This verification is an initial verification, and may either be performed by the facility, by the manufacturer, or by a third party. For the purposes of complying with the fugitive emissions monitoring program with OGI, fugitive emissions are defined as any visible emissions observed using OGI.


(A) Your OGI equipment must be capable of imaging gases in the spectral range for the compound of highest concentration in the potential fugitive emissions.

(8) If you are using Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, your plan must also include the elements specified in paragraphs (c)(8)(i) through (iv) of this section. For the purposes of complying with the fugitive emissions monitoring program using Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part a fugitive emission is defined as an instrument reading of 500 ppmv or greater.


(i) *Verification that your monitoring equipment meets the requirements specified in Section 6.0 of Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.* For purposes of instrument capability, the fugitive emissions definition shall be 500 ppmv or greater methane using a FID-based instrument. If you wish to use an analyzer other than an FID-based instrument, you must develop a site-specific fugitive emission definition that would be equivalent to 500 ppmv methane using a FID-based instrument (*e.g.,* 10.6 eV PID with a specified isobutylene concentration as the fugitive emission definition would provide equivalent response to your compound of interest).


(ii) *Procedures for conducting surveys.* At a minimum, the procedures shall ensure that the surveys comply with the relevant sections of Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, including Section 8.3.1.


(iii) *Procedures for calibration.* The instrument must be calibrated before use each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part. At a minimum, you must also conduct precision tests at the interval specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, Section 8.1.2, and a calibration drift assessment at the end of each monitoring day. The calibration drift assessment must be conducted as specified in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(A) of this section. Corrective action for drift assessments is specified in paragraphs (c)(8)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section.


(A) Check the instrument using the same calibration gas that was used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, Section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. If multiple scales are used, record the instrument reading for each scale used. Divide the arithmetic difference of the initial and post-test calibration response by the corresponding calibration gas value for each scale and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage.


(B) If a calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent, then all equipment with instrument readings between the fugitive emission definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift) divided by 100 and the fugitive emission definition that was monitored since the last calibration must be re-monitored.


(C) If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment with instrument readings above the fugitive emission definition and below the fugitive emission definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift) divided by 100 monitored since the last calibration may be re-monitored.


(iv) *Procedures for monitoring yard piping (other than buried yard piping).* At a minimum, place the probe inlet at the surface of the yard piping and run the probe down the length of the piping. Connection points on the piping must be monitored following the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.

Example procedures include, but are not limited to, a sitemap with an observation path, a written narrative of where the fugitive emissions components are located and how they will be monitored, or an inventory of fugitive emissions components.


(2) If you are using Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, your plan must include a list of fugitive emissions components to be monitored and method for determining the location of fugitive emissions components to be monitored in the field (*e.g.,* tagging, identification on a process and instrumentation diagram, etc.). Your fugitive emissions monitoring plan must include the written plan developed for all of the fugitive emissions components designated as difficult-to-monitor in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section, and the written plan for fugitive emissions components designated as unsafe-to-monitor in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section.


(e) *Monitoring of fugitive emissions components.* Each fugitive emissions component, except buried yard piping and associated components (*e.g.,* connectors), shall be observed or monitored for fugitive emissions during each monitoring survey.

The calendar month temperature average for each month within the quarterly monitoring period must be determined using historical monthly average temperatures over the previous three years as reported by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration source or other source approved by the Administrator. The requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section shall not be waived for two consecutive quarterly monitoring periods.

A vent blowdown is the opening of one or more blowdown valves to depressurize major production and processing equipment, other than a storage vessel.


(ii) If the repair requires replacement of a fugitive emissions component or a part thereof, but the replacement cannot be acquired and installed within the repair timelines specified in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section due to either of the conditions specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, the repair must be completed in accordance with paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(C) of this section and documented in accordance with ยง 60.5420b(c)(14)(v)(I).
