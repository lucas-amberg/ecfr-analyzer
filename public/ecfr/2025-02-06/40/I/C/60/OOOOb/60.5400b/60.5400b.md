# § 60.5400b   What GHG and VOC standards apply to process unit equipment affected facilities?

This section applies to process unit equipment affected facilities located at an onshore natural gas processing plant. You must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section to reduce methane and VOC emissions from equipment leaks, except as provided in § 60.5402b. As an alternative to the standards in this section, you may comply with the requirements in § 60.5401b.


(a) *General standards.* You must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section for each pump in light liquid service, pressure relief device in gas/vapor service, valve in gas/vapor or light liquid service, and connector in gas/vapor or light liquid service, as applicable. You must comply with the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section for each open-ended valve or line. You must comply with the requirements in paragraph (f) of this section for each closed vent system and control device used to comply with equipment leak provisions in this section. You must comply with paragraph (g) of this section for each pump, valve, and connector in heavy liquid service and pressure relief device in light liquid or heavy liquid service. You must make repairs as specified in paragraph (h) of this section. You must demonstrate initial compliance with the standards as specified in paragraph (i) of this section. You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. You must perform the reporting as specified in paragraph (k) of this section. You must perform the recordkeeping as required in paragraph (l) of this section.


(1) You may apply to the Administrator for permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of methane and VOC at least equivalent to that achieved by the controls required in this subpart according to the requirements of § 60.5399b.


(2) Each piece of equipment is presumed to have the potential to emit methane or VOC unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment does not have the potential to emit methane or VOC. For a piece of equipment to be considered not to have the potential to emit methane or VOC, the methane and VOC content of a gaseous stream must be below detection limits using Method 18 of appendix A-6 to this part. Alternatively, if the piece of equipment is in wet gas service, you may choose to determine the methane and VOC content of the stream is below the detection limit of the methods described in ASTM E168-16(R2023), E169-16(R2022), or E260-96 (all incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).


(b) *Monitoring surveys.* You must monitor for leaks using OGI in accordance with appendix K of this part, unless otherwise specified in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section.


(1) Monitoring surveys must be conducted bimonthly.


(2) Any emissions observed using OGI are defined as a leak.


(c) *Additional requirements for pumps in light liquid service.* In addition to the requirements in paragraph (b), you must conduct weekly visual inspections of all pumps in light liquid service for indications of liquids dripping from the pump seal, except as specified in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section. If there are indications of liquids dripping from the pump seal, you must follow the procedure specified in either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.


(1) Monitor the pump within 5 calendar days using OGI in accordance with Appendix K or the methods specified in § 60.5403b. A leak is detected if any emissions are observed using OGI or if an instrument reading of 2,000 ppmv or greater is provided using Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.


(2) Designate the visual indications of liquids dripping as a leak and repair the leak as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.


(3) If any pump is equipped with a closed vent system capable of capturing and transporting any leakage from the seal or seals to a process, fuel gas system, or a control device that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, it is exempt from the weekly inspection requirements in paragraph (c) of this section.


(4) Any pump that is located within the boundary of an unmanned plant site is exempt from the weekly visual inspection requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, provided that each pump is visually inspected as often as practicable and at least bimonthly.


(d) *Additional requirements for pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service.* In addition to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, you must monitor each pressure relief device as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.


(1) You must monitor each pressure relief device within 5 calendar days after each pressure release to detect leaks using the methods specified in § 60.5403b. A leak is detected if any emissions are observed using OGI or if an instrument reading of 500 ppmv or greater is provided using Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.


(2) Any pressure relief device that is located in a nonfractionating plant that is monitored only by non-plant personnel may be monitored after a pressure release the next time the monitoring personnel are onsite or within 30 calendar days after a pressure release, whichever is sooner, instead of within 5 calendar days as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. No pressure relief device described in this paragraph may be allowed to operate for more than 30 calendar days after a pressure release without monitoring.


(3) Any pressure relief device that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or equipped with a closed vent system capable of capturing and transporting leakage through the pressure relief device to a control device as described in paragraph (f) of this section is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(e) *Open-ended valves or lines.* Each open-ended valve or line must be equipped with a cap, blind flange, plug, or a second valve, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(4) and (5) of this section. The cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve must seal the open end of the valve or line at all times except during operations requiring process fluid flow through the open-ended valve or line.


(1) If evidence of a leak is found at any time by AVO, or any other detection method, a leak is detected.


(2) Each open-ended valve or line equipped with a second valve must be operated in a manner such that the valve on the process fluid end is closed before the second valve is closed.


(3) When a double block-and-bleed system is being used, the bleed valve or line may remain open during operations that require venting the line between the block valves but shall remain closed at all other times.


(4) Open-ended valves or lines in an emergency shutdown system which are designed to open automatically in the event of a process upset are exempt from the requirements of this section.


(5) Open-ended valves or lines containing materials which would autocatalytically polymerize or would present an explosion, serious overpressure, or other safety hazard if capped or equipped with a double block-and-bleed system as specified in paragraphs (e) introductory text, (e)(2), and (3) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this section.


(f) *Closed vent systems and control devices.* Closed vent systems used to comply with the equipment leak provisions of this section must comply with the requirements in §§ 60.5411b and 60.5416b. Control devices used to comply with the equipment leak provisions of this section must comply with the requirements in §§ 60.5412b, 60.5415b(f), and 60.5417b.


(g) *Pumps, valves, and connectors in heavy liquid service and pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid service.* If evidence of a potential leak is found at any time by AVO, or any other detection method, a leak is detected and must be repaired in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.


(h) *Repair requirements.* When a leak is detected, you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) through (5) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.


(1) A weatherproof and readily visible identification tag, marked with the equipment identification number, must be attached to the leaking equipment. The identification tag on equipment may be removed after it has been repaired.


(2) A first attempt at repair must be made as soon as practicable, but no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected. A first attempt at repair is not required if the leak is detected using OGI and the equipment identified as leaking would require elevating the repair personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface.


(i) First attempts at repair for pumps in light liquid or heavy liquid service include, but are not limited to, the practices described in paragraphs (h)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, where practicable.


(A) Tightening the packing gland nuts.


(B) Ensuring that the seal flush is operating at design pressure and temperature.


(ii) For each valve where a leak is detected, you must comply with (h)(2)(ii)(A), (B) or (C), and (D) of this section.


(A) Repack the existing valve with a low-e packing.


(B) Replace the existing valve with a low-e valve; or


(C) Perform a drill and tap repair with a low-e injectable packing.


(D) An owner or operator is not required to utilize a low-e valve or low-e packing to replace or repack a valve if the owner or operator demonstrates that a low-e valve or low-e packing is not technically feasible. Low-e valve or low-e packing that is not suitable for its intended use is considered to be technically infeasible. Factors that may be considered in determining technical infeasibility include: retrofit requirements for installation (*e.g.,* re-piping or space limitation), commercial unavailability for valve type, or certain instrumentation assemblies.


(3) Repair of leaking equipment must be completed within 15 calendar days after detection of each leak, except as provided in paragraphs (h)(4), (5) and (6) of this section.


(4) If the repair for visual indications of liquids dripping for pumps in light liquid service can be made by eliminating visual indications of liquids dripping, you must make the repair within 5 calendar days of detection.


(5) If the repair for AVO or other indication of a leak for open-ended valves or lines; pumps, valves, or connectors in heavy liquid service; or pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid service can be made by eliminating the AVO, or other indication of a potential leak, you must make the repair within 5 calendar days of detection.


(6) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair within 15 days is technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown or as specified in paragraphs (h)(6)(i) through (v) of this section. Repair of this equipment shall occur before the end of the next process unit shutdown. Monitoring to verify repair must occur within 15 days after startup of the process unit.


(i) Delay of repair of equipment is allowed for equipment which is isolated from the process, and which does not have the potential to emit methane or VOC.


(ii) Delay of repair for valves and connectors is allowed if the conditions in paragraphs (h)(6)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section are met.


(A) You must demonstrate that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair are greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and


(B) When repair procedures are conducted, the purged material is collected and destroyed or recovered in a control device complying with paragraph (f) of this section.


(iii) Delay of repair for pumps is allowed if the conditions in paragraphs (h)(6)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section are met.


(A) Repair requires the use of a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system, and


(B) Repair is completed as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.


(iv) If delay of repair is required to repack or replace the valve, you may use delay of repair. Delay of repair beyond a process unit shutdown is allowed for a valve, if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit shutdown, valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the next process unit shutdown will not be allowed unless the next process unit shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the first process unit shutdown.


(v) When delay of repair is allowed for a leaking pump, valve, or connector that remains in service, the pump, valve, or connector may be considered to be repaired and no longer subject to delay of repair requirements if two consecutive bimonthly monitoring results show no leak remains.


(i) *Initial compliance.* You must demonstrate initial compliance with the standards that apply to equipment leaks at onshore natural gas processing plants as required by § 60.5410b(h).


(j) *Continuous compliance.* You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards that apply to equipment leaks at onshore natural gas processing plants as required by § 60.5415b(j).


(k) *Reporting.* You must perform the reporting requirements as specified in § 60.5420b(b)(1) and (11) through (13), as applicable, and § 60.5422b.


(l) *Recordkeeping.* You must perform the recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 60.5420b(c)(8) and (10) through (13), as applicable, and § 60.5421b.
