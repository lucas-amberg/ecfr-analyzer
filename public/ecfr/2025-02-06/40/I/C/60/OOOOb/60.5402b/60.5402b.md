(c) Pumps in light liquid service, pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service, valves in gas/vapor and light liquid service, and connectors in gas/vapor service and in light liquid service within a process unit that is located in the Alaskan North Slope are exempt from the monitoring requirements § 60.5400b(b) and (c) and § 60.5401b(b), (c), (f) and (h).


(d) You may use the following provisions instead of § 60.5403b(d):


(1) Equipment is in heavy liquid service if the weight percent evaporated is 10 percent or less at 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit) as determined by ASTM D86-96 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).


(2) Equipment is in light liquid service if the weight percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit) as determined by ASTM D86-96 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).


(e) Equipment that is in vacuum service, except connectors in gas/vapor and light liquid service, is excluded from the requirements of § 60.5400b(b) through (g), if it is identified as required in § 60.5421b(b)(15). Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the requirements of § 60.5401b(b) through (g) if it is identified as required in § 60.5421b(b)(15).


(f) Equipment that you designate as having the potential to emit methane or VOC less than 300 hr/yr is excluded from the requirements of § 60.5400b(b) through (g) and § 60.5401b(b) through (h), if it is identified as required in § 60.5421b(b)(16) and it meets any of the conditions specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) The equipment has the potential to emit methane or VOC only during startup and shutdown.


(2) The equipment has the potential to emit methane or VOC only during process malfunctions or other emergencies.


(3) The equipment is backup equipment that has the potential to emit methane or VOC only when the primary equipment is out of service.
