# § 60.5416c   What are the initial and continuous cover and closed vent system inspection and monitoring requirements?

For each closed vent system and cover at your well, centrifugal compressor, reciprocating compressor, process controller, pump, storage vessel, and process unit equipment designated facilities, you must comply with the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Each self-contained natural gas process controller must comply with paragraph (b) of this section.


(a) *Inspections for closed vent systems, covers, and bypass devices.* If you install a control device or route emissions to a process, you must inspect each closed vent system according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, inspect each cover according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and inspect each bypass device according to the procedures of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(7) and (8) of this section.


(1) For each closed vent system joint, seam, or other connection that is permanently or semi-permanently sealed (*e.g.,* a welded joint between two sections of hard piping or a bolted and gasketed ducting flange), you must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) Conduct an initial inspection according to the test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that the closed vent system operates with no identifiable emissions within the first 30 calendar days after routing emissions through the closed vent system.


(ii) Conduct annual visual inspections for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in piping; loose connections; liquid leaks; or broken or missing caps or other closure devices. You must monitor a component or connection using the test methods and procedures in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that it operates with no identifiable emissions following any time the component is repaired or replaced or the connection is unsealed.


(iii) Conduct AVO inspections in accordance with and at the same frequency as specified for fugitive emissions components designated facilities located at the same type of site as specified in § 60.5397c(g). Process unit equipment designated facilities must conduct annual AVO inspections concurrent with the inspections required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.


(2) For closed vent system components other than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) Conduct an initial inspection according to the test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section within the first 30 calendars days after routing emissions through the closed vent system to demonstrate that the closed vent system operates with no identifiable emissions.


(ii) Conduct inspections according to the test methods, procedures, and frequencies specified in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that the components or connections operate with no identifiable emissions.


(iii) Conduct annual visual inspections for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in ductwork; loose connections; liquid leaks; or broken or missing caps or other closure devices. You must monitor a component or connection using the test methods and procedures in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that it operates with no identifiable emissions following any time the component is repaired or replaced or the connection is unsealed.


(iv) Conduct AVO inspections in accordance with and at the same frequency as specified for fugitive emissions components designated facilities located at the same type of site, as specified in § 60.5397c(g). Process unit equipment designated facilities must conduct annual AVO inspections concurrent with the inspections required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.


(3) For each cover, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) Conduct the inspections specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) through (iv) of this section to identify defects that could result in air emissions and to ensure the cover operates with no identifiable emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the cover, or between the cover and the separator wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices. In the case where the storage vessel is buried partially or entirely underground, you must inspect only those portions of the cover that extend to or above the ground surface, and those connections that are on such portions of the cover (*e.g.,* fill ports, access hatches, gauge wells, etc.) and can be opened to the atmosphere.


(ii) An initial inspection according to the test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section, following installation of the cover to demonstrate that each cover operates with no identifiable emissions.


(iii) Conduct AVO inspections in accordance with and at the same frequency as specified for fugitive emissions components designated facilities located at the same type of site as specified in § 60.5397b(g). Process unit equipment designated facilities must conduct annual AVO inspections concurrent with the inspections required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.


(iv) Inspections according to the test methods, procedures, and schedules specified in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that each cover operates with no identifiable emissions.


(4) For each bypass device, except as provided for in § 60.5411c(a)(4)(ii), you must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section.


(i) Set the flow indicator to take a reading at least once every 15 minutes at the inlet to the bypass device that could divert the stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere.


(ii) If the bypass device valve installed at the inlet to the bypass device is secured in the non-diverting position using a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration, visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to verify that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass device.


(b) *No identifiable emissions test methods and procedures.* If you are required to conduct an inspection of a closed vent system and cover as specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section or § 60.5398c(b), you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (4), and (9) of this section for each self-contained process controller at your process controller designated facility as specified at § 60.5394c(a)(2).


(1) *Initial and periodic inspection.* You must conduct initial and periodic no identifiable emissions inspections as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable.


(i) You must conduct inspections for no identifiable emissions from your closed vent systems and covers at your well, centrifugal compressor, reciprocating compressor, process controller, pump, or storage vessel designated facility, using the procedures for conducting OGI inspections in § 60.5397c(c)(7). As an alternative you may conduct inspections in accordance with Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part. Monitoring must be conducted at the same frequency as specified for fugitive emissions components designated facilities located at the same type of site, as specified in § 60.5397c(g).


(ii) For closed vent systems and covers located at onshore natural gas processing plants, OGI inspections for no identifiable emissions must be conducted initially and bimonthly in accordance with appendix K to this part. As an alternative you must conduct quarterly inspections for no identifiable emissions in accordance with Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.


(iii) For your self-contained process controller, you must conduct initial and quarterly inspections for no identifiable emissions using the procedures for conducting OGI inspections in § 60.5397c(c)(7). As an alternative you may conduct quarterly inspections in accordance with Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.


(2) *OGI inspection.* Where OGI is used, the closed vent system, cover, or self-contained process controller is determined to operate with no identifiable emissions if no emissions are imaged during the inspection. Emissions imaged by OGI constitute a deviation of the no identifiable emissions standard until an OGI inspection conducted in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2) of this section determines that the closed vent system, cover, or self-contained process controller, as applicable, operates with no identifiable emissions.


(3) *AVO inspection.* Where AVO inspections are required, the closed vent system or cover is determined to operate with no identifiable emissions if no emissions are detected by AVO. Emissions detected by AVO constitute a deviation of the no identifiable emissions standard until an AVO inspection determines that the closed vent system or cover operates with no identifiable emissions.


(4) *Method 21 inspection.* Where Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part is used for the inspection, the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (vii) of this section apply.


(i) The detection instrument must meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, except that the instrument response factor criteria in section 8.1.1 of Method 21 must be for the average composition of the fluid and not for each individual organic compound in the stream.


(ii) You must calibrate the detection instrument before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.


(iii) Calibration gases must be as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.


(A) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million by volume hydrocarbon in air).


(B) A mixture of methane in air at a concentration less than 500 ppmv.


(iv) You may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If you choose to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, you must determine the background level value according to the procedures in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part.


(v) Your detection instrument must meet the performance criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(v)(A) and (B) of this section.


(A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B) of this section, the detection instrument must meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 8.1.1 of Method 21 must be for the average composition of the process fluid, not each individual volatile organic compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts that are not organic hazardous air pollutants or volatile organic compounds, you must calculate the average stream response factor on an inert-free basis.


(B) If no instrument is available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section, you may adjust the instrument readings by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis, as described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section.


(vi) You must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no identifiable emissions, as applicable, using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section.


(A) If you choose not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then you must directly compare the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section.


(B) If you choose to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, you must compare the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section.


(vii) A closed vent system, cover, or self-contained process controller is determined to operate with no identifiable emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section is less than 500 ppmv. An organic concentration value determined in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section of greater than or equal to 500 ppmv constitutes a deviation of the no identifiable emissions standard until an inspection conducted in accordance with this paragraph (b)(4) of this section determines that the closed vent system, cover, or self-contained process controller, as applicable, operates with no identifiable emissions.


(5) *Repairs.* Whenever emissions or a defect is detected, you must repair the emissions or defect as soon as practicable according to the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.


(i) A first attempt at repair must be made no later than 5 calendar days after the emissions or defect is detected.


(ii) Repair must be completed no later than 30 calendar days after the emissions or defect is detected.


(iii) For covers, grease or another substance compatible with the gasket material must be applied to deteriorating or cracked gaskets to improve the seal while awaiting repair.


(6) *Delay of repair.* Delay of repair of a closed vent system or cover for which emissions or defects have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, or if you determine that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. You must complete repair of such equipment by the end of the next shutdown.


(7) *Unsafe to inspect requirements.* You may designate any parts of the closed vent system or cover as unsafe to inspect if the requirements of paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section are met. Unsafe to inspect parts are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.


(i) You determine that the equipment is unsafe to inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent or potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.


(ii) You have a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-inspect times.


(8) *Difficult to inspect requirements.* You may designate any parts of the closed vent system or cover as difficult to inspect if the requirements of paragraphs (b)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section are met. Difficult to inspect parts are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.


(i) You determine that the equipment cannot be inspected without elevating the inspecting personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface.


(ii) You have a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years.


(9) *Records and reports.* You must maintain records of all inspection results as specified in § 60.5420c(c)(7) through (9). You must submit the reports as specified in § 60.5420c(b)(10).
