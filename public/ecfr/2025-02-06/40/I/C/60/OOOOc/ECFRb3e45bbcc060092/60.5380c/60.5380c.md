# ยง 60.5380c   What if I do not meet the final control plan increment of progress compliance date?

If you fail to meet the final compliance control plan increment of progress report compliance date, you must submit a notification to the Administrator postmarked within 10 business days after the required submittal date for that increment of progress. You must inform the Administrator that you did not meet the increment, and you must continue to submit reports each subsequent calendar month until the increment of progress is met.
