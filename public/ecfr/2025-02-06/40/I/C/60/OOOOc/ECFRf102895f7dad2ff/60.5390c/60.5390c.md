# § 60.5390c   What GHG standards apply to gas well liquids unloading operations at well designated facilities?

(a) *General requirements.* You must comply with the requirements of this section for each gas well liquids unloading operation at your gas well designated facility as specified by paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. You have a general duty to safely maximize resource recovery and minimize releases to the atmosphere during gas well liquids unloading operations.


(1) If a gas well liquids unloading operation technology or technique employed does not result in venting of methane emissions to the atmosphere, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) and (d) and (e) of this section. If an unplanned venting event occurs, you must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.


(i) Comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 60.5420c(c)(1)(i).


(ii) Submit the information specified in § 60.5420c(b)(1) and (2)(i) in the annual report.


(2) If a gas well liquids unloading operation technology or technique vents methane emissions to the atmosphere, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c), or paragraph (g) of this section.


(b) *Work Practice Standards.* If a gas well liquids unloading operation employs a technology or technique that vents methane emissions to the atmosphere, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) and paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.


(1) Employ best management practices to minimize venting of methane emissions as specified in paragraph (c) of this section for each gas well liquids unloading operation.


(2) Comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 60.5420c(c)(1)(ii).


(3) Submit the information specified in § 60.5420c(b)(1) and (2)(ii) in the annual report.


(c) *Best management practice requirements.* For each gas well liquids unloading operation complying with paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, you must develop, maintain, and follow a best management practice plan to minimize venting of methane emissions to the maximum extent possible from each gas well liquids unloading operation. This best management practice plan must meet the minimum criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Include steps that create a differential pressure to minimize the need to vent a well to unload liquids,


(2) Include steps to reduce wellbore pressure as much as possible prior to opening the well to the atmosphere,


(3) Unload liquids through the separator where feasible, and


(4) Close all wellhead vents to the atmosphere and return the well to production as soon as practicable.


(d) *Initial compliance.* You must demonstrate initial compliance with the standards that apply to well liquids unloading operations at your well designated facilities as required by § 60.5410c(a).


(e) *Continuous compliance.* You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards that apply to well liquids unloading operations at your well designated facilities as required by § 60.5415c(a).


(f) *Recordkeeping and recording.* You must perform the required notification, recordkeeping and reporting requirements as specified in § 60.5420c(b)(2) and (c)(1).


(g) *Other compliance options.* Reduce methane emissions from well designated facilities gas wells that unload liquids by 95.0 percent by complying with the requirements specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section and meeting the initial and continuous compliance and recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraphs (g)(3) through (5) of this section.


(1) You must route emissions through a closed vent system to a control device that meets the conditions specified in § 60.5412c.


(2) You must route emissions through a closed vent system that meets the requirements of § 60.5411c(a) and (c).


(3) You must demonstrate initial compliance with standards that apply to well designated facility gas well liquids unloading as required by § 60.5410c(b).


(4) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with standards that apply to well designated facility gas well liquids unloading as required by § 60.5415c(b).


(5) You must perform the reporting as required by § 60.5420c(b)(1), (2), and (10) through (12), as applicable; and the recordkeeping as required by § 60.5420c(c)(1), (7), and (9) through (12), as applicable.
