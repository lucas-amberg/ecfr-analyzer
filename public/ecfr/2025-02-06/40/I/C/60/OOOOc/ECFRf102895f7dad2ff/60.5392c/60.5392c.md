# § 60.5392c   What GHG standards apply to centrifugal compressor designated facilities?

Each centrifugal compressor designated facility must comply with the GHG standards in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.


(a) Each centrifugal compressor designated facility that is a wet or dry seal centrifugal compressor must comply with the GHG standards, using volumetric flow rate as a surrogate, as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. Alternatively, you have the option of complying with the GHG standards for your wet seal and dry seal centrifugal compressor by meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(3), and either paragraph (a)(4) or (5) of this section.


(1) If you utilize a centrifugal compressor, you must comply with the GHG standards in paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, and the seal repair requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.


(i) You must conduct volumetric flow rate measurements from each wet seal centrifugal compressor (including each self-contained wet seal centrifugal compressor) vent using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and in accordance with the schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. The volumetric flow rate, measured in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, must not exceed 3 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per seal. If the individual seals are manifolded to a single open-vented line, the volumetric flow rate must not exceed the sum of the individual seals multiplied by 3 scfm. If the volumetric flow rate exceeds 3 scfm multiplied by the number of seals connected to the vent, the seals connected to the measured vent must be repaired as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.


(A) You must conduct your first volumetric flow rate measurement from your wet seal centrifugal compressor (including self-contained wet seal centrifugal compressors) vents on or before 8,760 hours of operation 36 months after the state plan submittal deadline (as specified in § 60.5362c(c)), or on or before 8,760 hours of operation after startup, whichever date is later.


(B) You must conduct subsequent volumetric flow rate measurements from your wet seal centrifugal compressor (including self-contained wet seal centrifugal compressor) vents on or before 8,760 hours of operation after the previous measurement.


(ii) You must conduct volumetric flow rate measurements from each Alaska North Slope centrifugal compressor equipped with sour seal oil separator and capture system using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and in accordance with the schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. The volumetric flow rate, measured in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, must not exceed 9 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per seal. If the individual seals are manifolded to a single open-vented line, the volumetric flow rate must not exceed the sum of the individual seals multiplied by 9 scfm. If the volumetric flow rate exceeds 9 scfm multiplied by the number of seals connected to the vent, the seals connected to the measured vent must be repaired as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.


(A) You must conduct your first volumetric flow rate measurement from your centrifugal compressor equipped with sour seal oil separator and capture system utilized in Alaska wet seal vent on or before 8,760 hours of operation 36 months after the state plan submittal deadline (as specified in § 60.5362c(c)), or on or before 8,760 hours of operation after startup, whichever date is later.


(B) You must conduct subsequent volumetric flow rate measurements from your centrifugal compressor wet seal vents on or before 8,760 hours of operation after the previous measurement.


(iii) You must conduct volumetric flow rate vent measurements from each centrifugal compressor equipped with dry seals using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and in accordance with the schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section. The volumetric flow rate, measured in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, must not exceed 10 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per seal. If the individual seals are manifolded to a single open-vented line, the volumetric flow rate must not exceed the sum of the individual seals multiplied by 10 scfm. If the volumetric flow rate exceeds 10 scfm multiplied by the number of seals connected to the vent, the seals connected to the measured vent must be repaired as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.


(A) You must conduct your first volumetric flow rate vent measurement from your centrifugal compressor equipped with a dry seal on or before 8,760 hours of operation 36 months after the state plan submittal deadline (as specified in § 60.5362c(c)), or on or before 8,760 hours of operation after startup, whichever date is later.


(B) You must conduct subsequent volumetric flow rate vent measurements from your centrifugal compressor equipped with a dry seal on or before 8,760 hours of operation after the previous measurement.


(iv) The seal must be repaired within 90 calendar days after the date of the volumetric emissions measurement that exceeds the applicable required flow rate per seal. You must conduct follow-up volumetric flow rate measurements from seal vents using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section within 15 days after the repair to document that the rate has been reduced to less than the applicable required flow rate per seal. If the individual seals are manifolded to a single open-ended line or vent, the volumetric flow rate must be reduced to less than the sum of the individual seals multiplied by the applicable required flow rate per seal specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable. Delay of repair will be allowed if the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section are met.


(A) If the repair of the wet or dry seal is technically infeasible, would require a vent blowdown, a compressor station shutdown, or would be unsafe to repair during operation of the unit, the repair must be completed during the next scheduled compressor station shutdown for maintenance, after a scheduled vent blowdown, or within 2 years of the date of the volumetric emissions measurement that exceeds the applicable required flow rate per seal, whichever is earliest. A vent blowdown is the opening of one or more blowdown valves to depressurize major production and processing equipment, other than a storage vessel.


(B) If the repair requires replacement of the compressor seal or a part thereof, but the replacement seal or part cannot be acquired and installed within the repair timelines specified under this section due to the condition specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section, the repair must be completed in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section and documented in accordance with § 60.5420c(c)(3)(iii)(F) through (H).


(*1*) Seal or part thereof supplies had been sufficiently stocked but are depleted at the time of the required repair.


(*2*) The required replacement seal or part must be ordered no later than 10 calendar days after the centrifugal compressor is added to the delay of repair list due to parts unavailability. The repair must be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the replacement seal or part, unless the repair requires a compressor station shutdown. If the repair requires a compressor station shutdown, the repair must be completed in accordance with the timeframe specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.


(2) You must determine the volumetric flow rates from your centrifugal compressor dry or wet seal vents as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.


(i) For each dry or wet seal centrifugal compressor in operating-mode or in standby-pressurized-mode, determine volumetric flow rate at standard conditions from each dry or wet seal vent using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.


(A) You may choose to use any of the methods set forth in § 60.5405c(a) to screen for leaks/emissions. For the purposes of this paragraph, when using any of the methods in § 60.5405c(a), emissions are detected whenever a leak is detected according to the method. If emissions are detected using the methods set forth in § 60.5405c(a), then you must use one of the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) or (C) of this section to determine the volumetric flow rate. If emissions are not detected using the methods in § 60.5405c(a), then you may assume that the volumetric flow rate is zero.


(B) Use a temporary or permanent flow meter according to methods set forth in § 60.5405c(b).


(C) Use a high-volume sampler according to the methods set forth in § 60.5405c(c).


(ii) For conducting measurements on manifolded groups of dry or wet seal centrifugal compressors, you must determine the volumetric flow rate from the compressor dry or wet seal as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.


(A) Measure at a single point in the manifold downstream of all dry or wet seal compressor inputs and, if practical, prior to comingling with other non-compressor emission sources.


(B) Determine the volumetric flow rate at standard conditions from the common stack using one of the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.


(3) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for compressors with wet seals and dry seals, you have the option of reducing methane emissions from each centrifugal compressor wet seal fluid degassing system by 95.0 percent by meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, or the option of routing the emissions from each centrifugal compressor wet seal fluid degassing system or dry seal system to a process by meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.


(4) If you use a control device to reduce methane emissions by 95.0 percent, you must equip the wet seal fluid degassing system with a cover that meets the requirements of § 60.5411c(b). The cover must be connected through a closed vent system that meets the requirements of § 60.5411c(a) and (c) and the closed vent system must be routed to a control device that meets the conditions specified in § 60.5412c.


(5) If you route the emissions to a process, you must equip the wet seal fluid degassing system or dry seal system with a cover that meets the requirements of § 60.5411c(b). The cover must be connected through a closed vent system that meets the requirements of § 60.5411c(a) and (c).


(b) You must demonstrate initial compliance with the standards that apply to centrifugal compressor designated facilities as required by § 60.5410c(c).


(c) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards that apply to centrifugal compressor designated facilities as required by § 60.5415c(c).


(d) You must perform the reporting as required by § 60.5420c(b)(1) and (4) and (b)(10) through (12), as applicable; and the recordkeeping as required by § 60.5420c(c)(3) and (c)(7) through (12), as applicable.
