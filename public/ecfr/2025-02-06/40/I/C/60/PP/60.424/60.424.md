# § 60.424   Test methods and procedures.

(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).


(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.422 as follows:


(1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed for each run using the following equation:


(2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration (c_s_) and volumetric flow rate (Q_sd_) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 1.50 dscm (53 dscf).


(3) Direct measurement using product weigh scales, or the result of computations using a material balance, shall be used to determine the rate (P) of the ammonium sulfate production. If production rate is determined by material balance, the following equations shall be used:


(i) For synthetic and coke oven by-product ammonium sulfate plants:


(ii) For caprolactam by-product ammonium sulfate plants:


(4) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine the opacity.
