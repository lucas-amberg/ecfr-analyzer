As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.


*Glass pull rate* means the mass of molten glass utilized in the manufacture of wool fiberglass insulation at a single manufacturing line in a specified time period.


*Manufacturing line* means the manufacturing equipment comprising the forming section, where molten glass is fiberized and a fiberglass mat is formed; the curing section, where the binder resin in the mat is thermally “set;” and the cooling section, where the mat is cooled.


*Rotary spin* means a process used to produce wool fiberglass insulation by forcing molten glass through numerous small orifices in the side wall of a spinner to form continuous glass fibers that are then broken into discrete lengths by high velocity air flow.


*Wool fiberglass insulation* means a thermal insulation material composed of glass fibers and made from glass produced or melted at the same facility where the manufacturing line is located.
