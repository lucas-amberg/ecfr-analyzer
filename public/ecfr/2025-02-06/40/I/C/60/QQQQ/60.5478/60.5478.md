(2) The permanent label must contain the following information:


(i) Month and year of manufacture of the individual unit;


(ii) Model name and number;


(iii) Certification test emission value, test method, and standard met; and


(iv) Serial number.


(3) The permanent label must:


(i) Be affixed in a readily visible or accessible location in such a manner that it can be easily viewed before and after the appliance is installed (a easily removable façade can be used for aesthetic purposes);


(ii) Be at least 8.9 cm long and 5.1 cm wide (3
 1/2 inches long and 2 inches wide);


(iii) Be made of a material expected to last the lifetime of the central heater;


(iv) Present the required information in a manner so that it is likely to remain legible for the lifetime of the central heater; and


(v) Be affixed in such a manner that it cannot be removed without damage to the label.


(4) The permanent label may be combined with any other label, as long as the required information is displayed, the integrity of the permanent label is not compromised, and the permanent label meets the requirements of § 60.5478(a)(3).


(5) Any label statement under paragraph (b) of this section constitutes a representation by the manufacturer as to any central heater that bears it:


(i) That a certification of compliance was in effect at the time the central heater left the possession of the manufacturer;


(ii) That the manufacturer was, at the time the label was affixed, conducting a quality assurance program in conformity with § 60.5475(m); and


(iii) That all the central heaters individually tested for emissions by the manufacturer under its quality assurance program pursuant to § 60.5475(m) met the applicable emissions limit.


(b) *Permanent label requirements for central heaters.* If a central heater belongs to a model line certified under § 60.5475, and no unit in the model line has been found to exceed the applicable emission limits or tolerances through quality assurance testing, one of the following statements, as appropriate, must appear on the permanent label:


(c) *Additional permanent label content.* The permanent label for all certified central heaters must also contain the following statement on the permanent label:


(d) *Permanent label requirements for affected wood heaters with exemptions under § 60.5472(b).* (1) If an affected central heater is manufactured in the United States for export as provided in § 60.5472(b)(1), the following statement must appear on the permanent label:

(e) *Temporary label (hangtag) voluntary options.* (1) Each model line certified to meet the 2020 particulate emission standards prior to May 15, 2020 may display the hangtags specified in section 3 of appendix I of this part. The electronic template will be provided by the Administrator upon approval of the certification.


(2) The hangtags in paragraph (e)(1) of this section end upon May 15, 2020.


(3) Each model certified to meet the 2020 Cord Wood Alternative Compliance Option may display the cord wood temporary label specified in section 3 of appendix I of this part. The electronic template will be provided by the Administrator upon approval of the certification.


(f) *Owner's manual requirements.* (1) Each affected central heater offered for sale by a commercial owner must be accompanied by an owner's manual that must contain the information listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (pertaining to installation), and paragraph (f)(3) of this section (pertaining to operation and maintenance). Such information must be adequate to enable consumers to achieve optimal emissions performance. Such information must be consistent with the operating instructions provided by the manufacturer to the approved test laboratory for operating the central heater during certification testing, except for details of the certification test that would not be relevant to the ultimate user. The commercial owner must also make current and historical owner's manuals available on the company Web site and upon request to the EPA.


(2) Guidance on proper installation information, including stack height, heater location and achieving proper draft.


(3) Proper operation and maintenance information, including minimizing visible emissions.


(i) Fuel loading and re-loading procedures, recommendations on fuel selection and warnings on what fuels not to use, such as unseasoned wood, treated wood, colored paper, cardboard, solvents, trash and garbage;


(ii) Fire starting procedures;


(iii) Proper use of air controls, including how to establish good combustion and how to ensure good combustion at the lowest burn rate for which the heater is warranted;


(iv) Ash removal procedures;


(v) Instructions for replacement of gaskets and other parts that are critical to the emissions performance of the unit and other maintenance and repair instructions;


(vi) For catalytic models, information on the following pertaining to the catalytic combustor: Procedures for achieving and maintaining catalyst activity, maintenance procedures, procedures for determining deterioration or failure, procedures for replacement and information on how to exercise warranty rights;


(vii) For catalytic models, the following statement—


(viii) For noncatalytic models, the following statement—


(4) Any manufacturer using the EPA-recommended language contained in appendix I of this part to satisfy any requirement of this paragraph (f) will be considered to be in compliance with that requirement, provided that the particular model language is printed in full, with only such changes as are necessary to ensure accuracy for the particular model line.


(g) Central heaters that are affected by this subpart, but that have been owned and operated by a noncommercial owner, are not subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section when offered for resale.
