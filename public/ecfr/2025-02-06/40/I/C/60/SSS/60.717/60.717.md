# § 60.717   Reporting and monitoring requirements.

(a) For all affected coating operations subject to § 60.712(a), (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) and all affected coating mix preparation equipment subject to § 60.712(c), the performance test data and results shall be submitted to the Administrator as specified in § 60.8(a) of the General Provisions (40 CFR part 60, subpart A). In addition, the average values of the monitored parameters measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the period of the performance test shall be submitted with the results of all performance tests.


(b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation claiming to utilize less than the applicable volume of solvent specified in § 60.710(b) in the first calendar year of operation shall submit to the Administrator, with the notification of projected startup, a material flow chart indicating projected solvent use. The owner or operator shall also submit actual solvent use records at the end of the initial calendar year.


(c) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation initially utilizing less than the applicable volume of solvent specified in § 60.710(b) per calendar year shall report the first calendar year in which actual annual solvent use exceeds the applicable volume.


(d) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation, or affected coating mix preparation equipment subject to § 60.712(c), shall submit semiannual reports to the Administrator documenting the following:


(1) The 1-month amount of VOC contained in the coating, the VOC recovered, and the percent emission reduction for months of noncompliance for any affected coating operation demonstrating compliance by the performance test method described in § 60.713(b)(1) (liquid material balance);


(2) The VOC contained in the coatings for the manufacture of magnetic tape for any 1-month period during which the weighted average solvent content (G) of the coatings exceeded 0.20 kilogram per liter of coating solids for those affected facilities complying with § 60.712(e) (high-solids coatings alternative standard);


(3) For those affected facilities monitoring only the carbon adsorption system outlet concentration levels of organic compounds, the periods (during actual coating operations) specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.


(i) For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels, all periods of three consecutive adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels during which the average value of the concentration level of organic compounds in the common outlet gas stream is more than 20 percent greater than the average value measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(ii) For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber vessel when the concentration level of organic compounds in the individual outlet gas stream is more than 20 percent greater than the average value for that adsorber vessel measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(4) For those affected facilities monitoring both the carbon adsorption system inlet and outlet concentration levels of organic compounds, the periods (during actual coating operations), specified in (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.


(i) For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels, all periods of three consecutive adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels during which the average carbon adsorption system efficiency falls below the applicable level as follows:


(A) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the performance test method described in § 60.713(b)(2) or (4), the value of E determined using Equation (2) during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(B) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant to § 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(A) or § 60.713(b)(6), 0.95 (95 percent).


(C) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant to § 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(B), the required value of E determined using Equation (2) pursuant to § 60.713(a)(2) prior to modification or reconstruction or 0.95 (95 percent), whichever is lower.


(ii) For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber vessel when the efficiency falls below the applicable level as follows:


(A) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the performance test method described in § 60.713(b)(3) or (4), the value of H_v_ determined using Equation (4) during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(B) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant to § 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(A) or § 60.713(b)(6), 0.95 (95 percent).


(C) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant to § 60.713(b)(5)(iii)(B), the value of H_v_ determined using Equation 4 pursuant to § 60.713(a)(2) prior to modification or reconstruction.


(5) All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average exhaust temperature is 5 or more Celsius degrees above the average temperature measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance for those affected facilities monitoring condenser exhaust gas temperature;


(6) All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average combustion temperature is more than 28 Celsius degrees below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance for those affected facilities monitoring thermal incinerator combustion gas temperature;


(7) All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average gas temperature immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 Celsius degrees below the average gas temperature during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance and all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average gas temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average gas temperature difference during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance for those affected facilities monitoring catalytic incinerator catalyst bed temperature; and


(8) All 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average total enclosure or VOC capture system monitoring device readings vary by 5 percent or more from the average value measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance for those affected facilities monitoring a total enclosure pursuant to § 60.714(h) or VOC capture system pursuant to § 60.714(g).


(e) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation, or affected coating mix preparation equipment subject to § 60.712(c), not required to submit reports under § 60.717(d) because no reportable periods have occurred shall submit semiannual reports so affirming.


(f) Each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment that is constructed at a time when no affected coating operation is being constructed shall:


(1) Be exempt from the reporting requirements specified in § 60.7(a)(1), (2), and (4); and


(2) Submit the notification of actual startup specified in § 60.7(a)(3).


(g) The owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment that is constructed at the same time as an affected coating operation shall include the affected coating mix preparation equipment in all the reporting requirements for the affected coating operation specified in § 60.7(a)(1) through (4).


(h) The reports required under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall be postmarked within 30 days of the end of the reporting period.


(i) The requirements of this subsection remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such States. In this event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this subsection, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.
