(2) 0.14 kg VOC/*l* of coating solids applied for each calendar month for each affected facility that continuously uses an emission control device(s) operated at the most recently demonstrated overall efficiency; or


(3) 10 percent of the VOC's applied for each calendar month (90 percent emission reduction) for each affected facility that continuously uses an emission control device(s) operated at the most recently demonstrated overall efficiency; or
