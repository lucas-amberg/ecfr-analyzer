# § 60.5540a   How do I demonstrate compliance with my CO

(a) In accordance with § 60.5520a, if you are subject to an output-based emission standard or you burn non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520a(d)(2), you must demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO_2_ emission standard in table 1 to this subpart as required in this section. For the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month rolling average compliance period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section to calculate the CO_2_ mass emissions rate for your affected EGU(s) in units of the applicable emissions standard (*e.g.,* either kg/MWh or kg/GJ). You must use the hourly CO_2_ mass emissions calculated under § 60.5535a(b) or (c), as applicable, and either the generating load data from § 60.5535a(d)(1) for output-based calculations or the heat input data from § 60.5535a(d)(2) for heat-input-based calculations. Combustion turbines firing non-uniform fuels that contain CO_2_ prior to combustion (*e.g.,* blast furnace gas or landfill gas) may sample the fuel stream to determine the quantity of CO_2_ present in the fuel prior to combustion and exclude this portion of the CO_2_ mass emissions from compliance determinations.


(1) Each compliance period shall include only “valid operating hours” in the compliance period, *i.e.,* operating hours for which:


(i) “Valid data” (as defined in § 60.5580a) are obtained for all of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO_2_ mass emissions (kg) and, if a heat input-based standard applies, all the parameters used to determine total heat input for the hour are also obtained; and


(ii) The corresponding hourly gross or net energy output value is also valid data (Note: For hours with no useful output, zero is considered to be a valid value).


(2) You must exclude operating hours in which:


(i) The substitute data provisions of part 75 of this chapter are applied for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO_2_ mass emissions or, if a heat input-based standard applies, for any parameters used to determine the hourly heat input;


(ii) An exceedance of the full-scale range of a continuous emission monitoring system occurs for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO_2_ mass emissions or, if applicable, to determine the hourly heat input; or


(iii) The total gross or net energy output (P_gross/net_) or, if applicable, the total heat input is unavailable.


(3) For each compliance period, at least 95 percent of the operating hours in the compliance period must be valid operating hours, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(4) You must calculate the total CO_2_ mass emissions by summing the valid hourly CO_2_ mass emissions values from § 60.5535a for all of the valid operating hours in the compliance period.


(5) For each valid operating hour of the compliance period that was used in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to calculate the total CO_2_ mass emissions, you must determine P_gross/net_ (the corresponding hourly gross or net energy output in MWh) according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, as appropriate for the type of affected EGU(s). For an operating hour in which a valid CO_2_ mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, if there is no gross or net electrical output, but there is mechanical or useful thermal output, you must still determine the gross or net energy output for that hour. In addition, for an operating hour in which a valid CO_2_ mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, but there is no (*i.e.,* zero) gross electrical, mechanical, or useful thermal output, you must use that hour in the compliance determination. For hours or partial hours where the gross electric output is equal to or less than the auxiliary loads, net electric output shall be counted as zero for this calculation.


(i) Calculate P_gross/net_ for your affected EGU using the following equation. All terms in the equation must be expressed in units of MWh. To convert each hourly gross or net energy output (consistent with § 60.5520a) value reported under part 75 of this chapter to MWh, multiply by the corresponding EGU or stack operating time.


(ii) If applicable to your affected EGU (for example, for combined heat and power), you must calculate (Pt)PS using the following equation:


(6) Sources complying with energy output-based standards must calculate the basis (*i.e.,* denominator) of their actual annual emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Sources complying with heat input based standards must calculate the basis of their actual annual emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.


(i) In accordance with § 60.5520a if you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU's compliance period by summing the hourly gross or net energy output values for the affected EGU that you determined under paragraph (a)(5) of this section for all of the valid operating hours in the applicable compliance period.


(ii) If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period. The calculation of total heat input for each individual fuel must include all valid operating hours and must also be consistent with any fuel-specific procedures specified within your selected monitoring option under § 60.5535(d)(2).


(7) If you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the CO_2_ mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (kg/MWh) by dividing the total CO_2_ mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total gross or net energy output value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures if the calculated value is less than 1,000; round the result to three significant figures if the calculated value is greater than 1,000. If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the CO_2_ mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (kg/GJ or lb/MMBtu) by dividing the total CO_2_ mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total heat input calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures.


(8) You may exclude CO_2_ mass emissions and output generated from your affected EGU from your calculations for hours during which the affected EGU operated during a system emergency, as defined in § 60.5580a, if you can provide the information listed in § 60.5560a(i). While operating during a system emergency, your compliance determination depends on your subcategory or unit type, as listed in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (ii) of this section.


(i) For affected EGUs in the intermediate or base load subcategory, your CO_2_ emission standard while operating during a system emergency is the applicable emission standard for low load combustion turbines.


(ii) For affected modified steam generating units, your CO_2_ emission standard while operating during a system emergency is 230 lb CO_2_/MMBtu.


(b) In accordance with § 60.5520a, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO_2_ emission standard, for the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month compliance period, the CO_2_ mass emissions rate for your affected EGU must be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) through (8) of this section and must be less than or equal to the applicable CO_2_ emissions standard in table 1 to this subpart, or the emissions standard calculated in accordance with § 60.5525a(a)(2).


(c) If you are the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine operating in the base load subcategory, are installing add-on controls, and are unable to comply with the applicable Phase 2 CO_2_ emission standard specified in table 1 to this subpart due to circumstances beyond your control, you may request a compliance date extension of no longer than one year beyond the effective date of January 1, 2032, and may only receive an extension once. The extension request must contain a demonstration of necessity that includes the following:


(1) A demonstration that your affected EGU cannot meet its compliance date due to circumstances beyond your control and you have taken all steps reasonably possible to install the controls necessary for compliance by the effective date up to the point of the delay. The demonstration shall:


(i) Identify each affected unit for which you are seeking the compliance extension;


(ii) Identify and describe the controls to be installed at each affected unit to comply with the applicable CO_2_ emission standard in table 1 to this subpart;


(iii) Describe and demonstrate all progress towards installing the controls and that you have acted consistently with achieving timely compliance, including;


(A) Any and all contract(s) entered into for the installation of the identified controls or an explanation as to why no contract is necessary or obtainable;


(B) Any permit(s) obtained for the installation of the identified controls or, where a required permit has not yet been issued, a copy of the permit application submitted to the permitting authority and a statement from the permit authority identifying its anticipated timeframe for issuance of such permit(s).


(iv) Identify the circumstances that are entirely beyond your control and that necessitate additional time to install the identified controls. This may include:


(A) Information gathered from control technology vendors or engineering firms demonstrating that the necessary controls cannot be installed or started up by the applicable compliance date listed in table 1 to this subpart;


(B) Documentation of any permit delays; or


(C) Documentation of delays in construction or permitting of infrastructure (*e.g.,* CO_2_ pipelines) that is necessary for implementation of the control technology;


(v) Identify a proposed compliance date no later than one year after the applicable compliance date listed in table 1 to this subpart.


(2) The Administrator is charged with approving or disapproving a compliance date extension request based on his or her written determination that your affected EGU has or has not made each of the necessary demonstrations and provided all of the necessary documentation according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The following must be included:


(i) All documentation required as part of this extension must be submitted by you to the Administrator no later than 6 months prior to the applicable effective date for your affected EGU.


(ii) You must notify the Administrator of the compliance date extension request at the time of the submission of the request.
