# § 60.724a   Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(a) The reporting requirements of § 60.8(a) apply only to the initial performance test. Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall include the following data in the report of the initial performance test required under § 60.8(a):


(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere per volume of applied coating solids (N) for the initial nominal 1-month period for each coating operation from each affected facility.


(2) For each affected facility where compliance is determined under the provisions of § 60.723(b)(2)(iii), a list of the coatings used during the initial nominal 1-month period, the VOC content of each coating calculated from data determined using Method 24 of appendix A-7 to this part or an acceptable alternative method, and the lowest transfer efficiency at which each coating is applied during the initial nominal 1-month period. Acceptable alternative methods to Method 24 include: ASTM D2369-20; ASTM D2697-22; and ASTM D6093-97 (all incorporated by reference; see § 60.17).


(b) Following the initial report, each owner or operator shall:


(1) Report the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's per unit volume of coating solids applied for each coating operation for each affected facility during each nominal 1-month period in which the facility is not in compliance with the applicable emission limits specified in § 60.722. Reports of noncompliance shall be submitted on a quarterly basis, occurring every 3 months following the initial report; and


(2) Submit statements that each affected facility has been in compliance with the applicable emission limits specified in § 60.722 during each nominal 1-month period. Statements of compliance shall be submitted on a semiannual basis.


(c) Performance test reports, quarterly reports of noncompliance, and semiannual statements of compliance shall be submitted as a portable document format (PDF) upload not later than 10 days after the end of the periods specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, according to paragraph (f) of this section.


(d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain at the source, for a period of at least 2 years, records of all data and calculations used to determine monthly VOC emissions from each coating operation for each affected facility as specified in § 60.7(d).


(e) Monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for facilities using add-on controls will be determined by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis.


(f) The owner or operator must submit all performance test reports, quarterly reports of noncompliance, and semiannual statements in PDF format to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), which can be accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (*https://cdx.epa.gov/*). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as Confidential Business Information (CBI). Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report, you must submit a complete file, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (f).


(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address *oaqpscbi@epa.gov,* and as described in this paragraph (f), should include clear CBI markings and be flagged to the attention of the Surface Coating of Plastic Parts for Business Machines Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email *oaqpscbi@epa.gov* to request a file transfer link.


(2) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: OAQPS Document Control Officer (C404-02), OAQPS, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, Attention Surface Coating of Plastic Parts for Business Machines Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.


(3) If you are required to electronically submit a notification or report by this paragraph (f) through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.


(i) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required notification or report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.


(ii) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the notification or report is due.


(iii) The outage may be planned or unplanned.


(iv) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.


(v) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:


(A) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;


(B) A rationale for attributing the delay in submitting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;


(C) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in submitting; and


(D) The date by which you propose to submit, or if you have already met the electronic submittal requirement in this paragraph (f) at the time of the notification, the date you submitted the notification or report.


(vi) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.


(vii) In any circumstance, the notification or report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.


(4) If you are required to electronically submit a notification or report by this paragraph (f) through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of force majeure, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (f)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.


(i) You may submit a claim if a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a notification or report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (*e.g.,* hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (*e.g.,* large scale power outage).


(ii) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in submitting through CEDRI.


(iii) You must provide to the Administrator:


(A) A written description of the force majeure event;


(B) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event;


(C) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and


(D) The date by which you propose to submit the notification or report, or if you have already met the electronic submittal requirement in this paragraph (f) at the time of the notification, the date you submitted the notification or report.


(iv) The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the submittal deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.


(v) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs.


(g) Any records required to be maintained by this subpart that are submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.
