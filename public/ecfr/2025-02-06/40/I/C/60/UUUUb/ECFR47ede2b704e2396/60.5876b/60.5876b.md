# ยง 60.5876b   What are the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for EGUs that have committed to permanently cease operations by January 1, 2032?

(a) If you are the owner or operator of an EGU that has committed to permanently cease operations by January 1, 2032, you must maintain records for and submit the reports listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section according to the electronic reporting requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.


(1) Five years before any planned date to permanently cease operations or by the date upon which the State plan is submitted, whichever is later, the owner or operator of the EGU must submit an initial report to the EPA that includes the information in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(i) A summary of the process steps required for the EGU to permanently cease operation by the date included in the State plan, including the approximate timing and duration of each step and any notification requirements associated with deactivation of the unit. These process steps may include, *e.g.,* initial notice to the relevant reliability authority of the deactivation date and submittal of an official retirement filing (or equivalent filing) made to the EGU's relevant reliability authority.


(ii) Supporting regulatory documents, which include those listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (G) of this section:


(A) Correspondence and official filings with the relevant regional RTO, Independent System Operator, Balancing Authority, PUC, or other applicable authority;


(B) Any deactivation-related reliability assessments conducted by the RTO or Independent System Operator;


(C) Any filings pertaining to the affected EGU with the SEC or notices to investors, including but not limited to references in forms 10-K and 10-Q, in which plans for the EGU are mentioned;


(D) Any integrated resource plans and PUC orders approving the EGU's deactivation;


(E) Any reliability analyses developed by the RTO, Independent System Operator, or relevant reliability authority in response to the EGU's deactivation notification;


(F) Any notification from a relevant reliability authority that the EGU may be needed for reliability purposes notwithstanding the EGU's intent to deactivate; and


(G) Any notification to or from an RTO, Independent System Operator, or relevant reliability authority altering the timing of deactivation of the EGU.


(2) For each of the remaining years prior to the date by which an EGU has committed to permanently cease operations, the owner or operator of the EGU must submit an annual status report to the EPA that includes the information listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:


(i) Progress on each of the identified process steps identified in the initial report as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and


(ii) Supporting regulatory documents, including correspondence and official filings with the relevant RTO, Independent System Operator, Balancing Authority, PUC, or other applicable authority to demonstrate progress toward all steps described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.


(3) The owner or operator must submit a final report to the EPA no later than 6 months following its committed closure date. This report must document any actions that the EGU has taken subsequent to ceasing operation to ensure that such cessation is permanent, including any regulatory filings with applicable authorities or decommissioning plans.


(b) Beginning November 12, 2024, if you are the owner or operator of an EGU that has committed to permanently cease operations by January 1, 2032, you must submit all the information required in paragraph (a) of this section in a Permanent Cessation of Operation report in PDF format following the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) If you are required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (c), you must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (*https://cdx.epa.gov/*). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as CBI. Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, you must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (c).


(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address *oaqpscbi@epa.gov*, and as described above, should include clear CBI markings and be flagged to the attention of the Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Electric Utility Generating Units Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email *oaqpscbi@epa.gov* to request a file transfer link.


(2) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: U.S. EPA Attn: OAQPS Document Control Officer, Mail Drop: C404-02, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive P.O. Box 12055, RTP, NC 27711. All other files should also be sent to the attention of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Electric Utility Generating Units Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.


(d) Any records required to be maintained by this subpart that are submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.


(e) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (e)(1) through (7) of this section.


(1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.


(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.


(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.


(4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.


(5) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:


(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;


(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;


(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and


(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.


(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.


(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.


(f) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of *force majeure* for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of *force majeure,* you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs(f)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) You may submit a claim if a *force majeure* event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a *force majeure* event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (*e.g.,* hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (*e.g.,* large scale power outage).


(2) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.


(3) You must provide to the Administrator:


(i) A written description of the *force majeure* event;


(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event;


(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and


(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.


(4) The decision to accept the claim of *force majeure* and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.


(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the *force majeure* event occurs.


(g) Alternatives to any electronic reporting required by this subpart must be approved by the Administrator.
