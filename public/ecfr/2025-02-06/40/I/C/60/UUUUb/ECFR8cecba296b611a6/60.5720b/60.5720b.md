# ยง  60.5720b   What if I do not submit a State plan or my State plan is not approvable?

(a) If you do not submit an approvable State plan the EPA will develop a Federal plan for your State according to ยง  60.27a. The Federal plan will implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of affected EGUs not covered by an approved State plan must comply with a Federal plan implemented by the EPA for the State.


(b) After a Federal plan has been implemented in your State, it will be withdrawn when your State submits, and the EPA approves, a State plan replacing the relevant portion(s) of the Federal plan.
