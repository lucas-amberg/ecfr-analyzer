# ยง  60.5730b   Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

No. The EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, consistent with the electronic submission requirements in ยง  60.5875b, the EPA will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the _Federal Register._ If, at a later date, an affected EGU for which construction commenced on or before January 8, 2014, reconstruction on or before June 18, 2014, or modification on or before May 23, 2023, is found in your State, you will be found to have failed to submit a State plan as required, and a Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart, when promulgated by the EPA, will apply to that affected EGU until you submit, and the EPA approves, a State plan.
