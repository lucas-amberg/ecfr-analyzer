# ยง 60.5775b   What standards of performance must I include in my State plan?

(a) For each affected EGU, your State plan must include the standard of performance that applies for the affected EGU. A standard of performance for an affected EGU may take the following forms:


(1) A rate-based standard of performance for an individual affected EGU that does not exceed the level calculated through the use of the methods described in ยง 60.5775b(c) and (d).


(2) A standard of performance in an alternate form, which may apply for affected EGUs in the long-term coal-fired steam generating unit subcategory or the medium-term coal-fired steam generating unit subcategory, as provided for in ยง 60.5775b(e).


(b) Standard(s) of performance for affected EGUs included under your State plan must be demonstrated to be quantifiable, verifiable, non-duplicative, permanent, and enforceable with respect to each affected EGU. The State plan submittal must include the methods by which each standard of performance meets each of the following requirements:


(1) An affected EGU's standard of performance is quantifiable if it can be reliably measured in a manner that can be replicated.


(2) An affected EGU's standard of performance is verifiable if adequate monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements are in place to enable the State and the Administrator to independently evaluate, measure, and verify compliance with the standard of performance.


(3) An affected EGU's standard of performance is non-duplicative with respect to a State plan if it is not already incorporated as an standard of performance in the State plan.


(4) An affected EGU's standard of performance is permanent if the standard of performance must be met continuously unless it is replaced by another standard of performance in an approved State plan revision.


(5) An affected EGU's standard of performance is enforceable if:


(i) A technically accurate limitation or requirement, and the time period for the limitation or requirement, are specified;


(ii) Compliance requirements are clearly defined;


(iii) The affected EGUs are responsible for compliance and liable for violations identified;


(iv) Each compliance activity or measure is enforceable as a practical matter, as defined by 40 CFR 49.167; and


(v) The Administrator, the State, and third parties maintain the ability to enforce against violations (including if an affected EGU does not meet its standard of performance based on its emissions) and secure appropriate corrective actions: in the case of the Administrator, pursuant to CAA sections 113(a)-(h); in the case of a State, pursuant to its State plan, State law or CAA section 304, as applicable; and in the case of third parties, pursuant to CAA section 304.


(c) Methodology for establishing presumptively approvable standards of performance, for affected EGUs in each subcategory.


(1) Long-term coal-fired steam generating units


(i) BSER is CCS with 90 percent capture of CO_2_.


(ii) Degree of emission limitation is 88.4 percent reduction in emission rate (lb CO_2_/MWh-gross).


(iii) Presumptively approvable standard of performance is an emission rate limit defined by an 88.4 percent reduction in annual emission rate (lb CO_2_/MWh-gross) from the unit-specific baseline.


(2) Medium-term coal-fired steam generating units


(i) BSER is natural gas co-firing at 40 percent of the heat input to the unit.


(ii) Degree of emission limitation is a 16 percent reduction in emission rate (lb CO_2_/MWh-gross).


(iii) Presumptively approvable standard of performance is an emission rate limit defined by a 16 percent reduction in annual emission rate (lb CO_2_/MWh-gross) from the unit-specific baseline.


(iv) For units in this subcategory that have an amount of co-firing that is reflected in the baseline operation, States must account for such preexisting co-firing in adjusting the degree of emission limitation (*e.g.,* for an EGU co-fires natural gas at a level of 10 percent of the total annual heat input during the applicable 8-quarter baseline period, the corresponding degree of emission limitation would be adjusted to 12 percent to reflect the preexisting level of natural gas co-firing).


(3) Base load oil-fired steam generating units.


(i) BSER is routine methods of operation and maintenance.


(ii) Degree of emission limitation is a 0 percent increase in emission rate (lb CO_2_/MWh-gross).

(4) Intermediate load oil-fired steam generating units.


(i) BSER is routine methods of operation and maintenance.


(ii) Degree of emission limitation is a 0 percent increase in emission rate (lb CO_2_/MWh-gross).

(2) For the continuous 8 quarters of data, a State shall divide the total CO_2_ emissions (in the form of pounds) over that continuous time period by either the total gross electricity generation (in the form of MWh) or, for affected EGUs in the low load oil- or natural gas-fired subcategory, total heat input (in the form of MMBtu) over that same time period to calculate baseline CO_2_ emission performance in lb CO_2_ per MWh or lb CO_2_ per MMBtu.


(e) Your State plan may include a standard of performance in an alternate form that differs from the presumptively approvable standard of performance specified in ยง 60.5775b(a)(1), as follows:

(j) In order to use the provisions of ยง 60.24a(e) through (h) to apply a less stringent standard of performance or longer compliance schedule to an affected EGU based on consideration of electric grid reliability, including resource adequacy, under these emission guidelines, a State must provide the following with its State plan submission:


(1) An analysis of the reliability risk clearly demonstrating that the particular affected EGU is critical to maintaining electric reliability such that requiring it to comply with the applicable requirements under paragraph (c) of this section or ยง 60.5780b would trigger non-compliance with at least one of the mandatory reliability standards approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or would cause the loss of load expectation to increase beyond the level targeted by regional system planners as part of their established procedures for that particular region; specifically, a clear demonstration is required that the particular affected EGU would be needed to maintain the targeted level of resource adequacy. The analysis must also include a projection of the period of time for which the particular affected EGU is expected to be reliability critical and substantiate the basis for applying a less stringent standard of performance or longer compliance schedule consistent with 40 CFR 60.24a(e).
