(1) The instrument and operator identification numbers and the equipment identification number.


(2) The date the leak was detected and the dates of each attempt to repair the leak.


(3) Repair methods applied in each attempt to repair the leak.


(4) “Above 10,000” if the maximum instrument reading measured by the methods specified in § 60.485(a) after each repair attempt is equal to or greater than 10,000 ppm.


(5) “Repair delayed” and the reason for the delay if a leak is not repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak.


(6) The signature of the owner or operator (or designate) whose decision it was that repair could not be effected without a process shutdown.


(7) The expected date of successful repair of the leak if a leak is not repaired within 15 days.


(8) Dates of process unit shutdowns that occur while the equipment is unrepaired.


(9) The date of successful repair of the leak.


(d) The following information pertaining to the design requirements for closed vent systems and control devices described in § 60.482-10 shall be recorded and kept in a readily accessible location:


(1) Detailed schematics, design specifications, and piping and instrumentation diagrams.


(2) The dates and descriptions of any changes in the design specifications.


(3) A description of the parameter or parameters monitored, as required in § 60.482-10(e), to ensure that control devices are operated and maintained in conformance with their design and an explanation of why that parameter (or parameters) was selected for the monitoring.


(4) Periods when the closed vent systems and control devices required in §§ 60.482-2, 60.482-3, 60.482-4, and 60.482-5 are not operated as designed, including periods when a flare pilot light does not have a flame.


(5) Dates of startups and shutdowns of the closed vent systems and control devices required in §§ 60.482-2, 60.482-3, 60.482-4, and 60.482-5.


(e) The following information pertaining to all equipment subject to the requirements in §§ 60.482-1 to 60.482-10 shall be recorded in a log that is kept in a readily accessible location:


(1) A list of identification numbers for equipment subject to the requirements of this subpart.


(2)(i) A list of identification numbers for equipment that are designated for no detectable emissions under the provisions of §§ 60.482-2(e), 60.482-3(i) and 60.482-7(f).


(ii) The designation of equipment as subject to the requirements of § 60.482-2(e), § 60.482-3(i), or § 60.482-7(f) shall be signed by the owner or operator. Alternatively, the owner or operator may establish a mechanism with their permitting authority that satisfies this requirement.


(3) A list of equipment identification numbers for pressure relief devices required to comply with § 60.482-4.


(4)(i) The dates of each compliance test as required in §§ 60.482-2(e), 60.482-3(i), 60.482-4, and 60.482-7(f).


(ii) The background level measured during each compliance test.


(iii) The maximum instrument reading measured at the equipment during each compliance test.


(5) A list of identification numbers for equipment in vacuum service.


(6) A list of identification numbers for equipment that the owner or operator designates as operating in VOC service less than 300 hr/yr in accordance with § 60.482-1(e), a description of the conditions under which the equipment is in VOC service, and rationale supporting the designation that it is in VOC service less than 300 hr/yr.


(f) The following information pertaining to all valves subject to the requirements of § 60.482-7(g) and (h) and to all pumps subject to the requirements of § 60.482-2(g) shall be recorded in a log that is kept in a readily accessible location: 


(1) A list of identification numbers for valves and pumps that are designated as unsafe-to-monitor, an explanation for each valve or pump stating why the valve or pump is unsafe-to-monitor, and the plan for monitoring each valve or pump. 


(2) A list of identification numbers for valves that are designated as difficult-to-monitor, an explanation for each valve stating why the valve is difficult-to-monitor, and the schedule for monitoring each valve.


(g) The following information shall be recorded for valves complying with § 60.483-2:


(1) A schedule of monitoring.


(2) The percent of valves found leaking during each monitoring period.


(h) The following information shall be recorded in a log that is kept in a readily accessible location:


(1) Design criterion required in §§ 60.482-2(d)(5) and 60.482-3(e)(2) and explanation of the design criterion; and


(2) Any changes to this criterion and the reasons for the changes.


(i) The following information shall be recorded in a log that is kept in a readily accessible location for use in determining exemptions as provided in § 60.480(d):


(1) An analysis demonstrating the design capacity of the affected facility,


(2) A statement listing the feed or raw materials and products from the affected facilities and an analysis demonstrating whether these chemicals are heavy liquids or beverage alcohol, and


(3) An analysis demonstrating that equipment is not in VOC service.


(j) Information and data used to demonstrate that a piece of equipment is not in VOC service shall be recorded in a log that is kept in a readily accessible location.


(k) The provisions of § 60.7 (b) and (d) do not apply to affected facilities subject to this subpart.


(l) Any records required to be maintained by this subpart that are submitted electronically via the EPA's Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.
