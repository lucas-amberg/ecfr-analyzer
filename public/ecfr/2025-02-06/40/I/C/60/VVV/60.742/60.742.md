# § 60.742   Standards for volatile organic compounds.

(a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with the emissions limitations set forth in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated or 180 days after initial startup, whichever date comes first.


(b) For the coating operation, each owner or operator of an affected facility shall either:


(1) Reduce VOC emissions to the atmosphere from the coating operation by at least 90 percent (“emission reduction” standard); or 


(2) Install, operate, and maintain a total enclosure around the coating operation and vent the captured VOC emissions from the total enclosure to a control device that is at least 95 percent effecient (alternative standard).


(c) For the onsite coating mix preparation equipment of an affected facility, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements, as applicable:


(1) For an affected facility that has concurrent construction of a control device and uses at least 130 Mg of VOC per 12-month period, the owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected coating mix preparation equipment and vent VOC emissions from the covered mix equipment to a 95 percent efficient control device while preparation of the coating is taking place within the vessel.


(2) For an affected facility that does not have concurrent construction of a control device but uses at least 130 Mg of VOC per 12-month period, the owner or operator shall either:


(i) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected coating mix preparation equipment; or 


(ii) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected coating mix preparation equipment and vent VOC emissions to a VOC control device.


(3) For an affected facility that uses at least 95 Mg but less than 130 Mg of VOC per 12-month period, the owner or operator shall either.


(i) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected coating mix preparation equipment; or


(ii) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected coating mix preparation equipment and vent VOC emissions to a VOC control device.
