# § 60.747   Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(a) For each affected facility subject to the requirements of § 60.742(b) and (c), the owner or operator shall submit the performance test data and results to the Administrator as specified in § 60.8(a) of this part. In addition, the average values of the monitored parameters measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the period of the performance test shall be submitted with the results of all performance tests.


(b) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions specified in § 60.742(c)(3) and claiming to use less than 130 Mg of VOC in the first year of operation and each owner or operator of an affected facility claiming to use less than 95 Mg of VOC in the first year of operation shall submit to the Administrator, with the notification of anticipated startup required under § 60.7(a)(2) of the General Provisions, a material flow chart indicating projected VOC use. The owner or operator shall also submit actual VOC use records at the end of the initial year.


(c) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of § 60.742(c)(3) and initially using less than 130 Mg of VOC per year and each owner or operator of an affected facility initially using less than 95 Mg of VOC per year shall:


(1) Record semiannual estimates of projected VOC use and actual 12-month VOC use;


(2) Report the first semiannual estimate in which projected annual VOC use exceeds the applicable cutoff; and


(3) Report the first 12-month period in which the actual VOC use exceeds the applicable cutoff.


(d) Each owner or operator of an affected facility demonstrating compliance by the methods described in § 60.743(a)(1), (2), (4), (b), or (c) shall maintain records and submit quarterly reports to the Administrator documenting the following:


(1) For those affected facilities monitoring only the carbon adsorption system outlet concentration levels of organic compounds, the periods (during actual coating operations) specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.


(i) For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels, all periods of three consecutive system rotations through the adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels during which the average value of the concentration level of organic compounds in the common outlet gas stream is more than 20 percent greater than the average value measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(ii) For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber vessel when the concentration level of organic compounds in the individual outlet gas stream is more than 20 percent greater than the average value for that adsorber vessel measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(2) For those affected facilities monitoring both the carbon adsorption system inlet and outlet concentration levels of organic compounds, the periods (during actual coating operations), specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.


(i) For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels, all periods of three consecutive adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels during which the average carbon adsorption system efficiency falls below the applicable level as follows:


(A) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the performance test method described in § 60.743(a)(1), the value of E determined using Equation (1) during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(B) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the performance test described in § 60.743(a)(4), the average value of the system efficiency measured with the monitor during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(C) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance pursuant to § 60.743(b) or (c), 0.95.


(ii) For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber vessel during which the average carbon adsorber vessel efficiency falls below the applicable level as follows:


(A) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the performance test method described in § 60.743(a)(2), (b), or (c), the value of H_v_ determined using Equation (3) during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(B) For those affected facilities demonstrating compliance by the performance test described in § 60.743(a)(4), the average efficiency for that adsorber vessel measured with the monitor during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(3) For those affected facilities monitoring condenser exhaust gas temperature, all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average exhaust temperature is 5 or more Celsius degrees above the average temperature measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance;


(4) For those affected facilities monitoring thermal incinerator combustion gas temperature, all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average combustion temperature of the device is more than 28 Celsius degrees below the average combustion temperature of the device during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance;


(5) For those affected facilities monitoring catalytic incinerator catalyst bed temperature, all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average gas temperature immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 Celsius degrees below the average gas temperature during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance and all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average gas temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average gas temperature difference during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance;


(6) For each affected facility monitoring a total enclosure pursuant to § 60.744(h) or vapor capture system pursuant to § 60.744(g), all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average total enclosure or vapor capture system monitor readings vary by 5 percent or more from the average value measured during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.


(7) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation not required to submit reports under paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section because no reportable periods have occurred shall submit semiannual statements clarifying this fact.


(e) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation, demonstrating compliance by the test methods described in § 60.743(a)(3) (liquid-liquid material balance) shall submit the following:


(1) For months of compliance, semiannual reports to the Administrator stating that the affected coating operation was in compliance for each 1-month period; and


(2) For months of noncompliance, quarterly reports to the Administrator documenting the 1-month amount of VOC contained in the coatings, the 1-month amount of VOC recovered, and the percent emission reduction for each month.


(f) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation, either by itself or with associated coating mix preparation equipment, shall submit the following with the reports required under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section:


(1) All periods during actual mixing or coating operations when a required monitoring device (if any) was malfunctioning or not operating; and


(2) All periods during actual mixing or coating operations when the control device was malfunctioning or not operating.


(g) The reports required under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section shall be postmarked within 30 days of the end of the reporting period.


(h) Records required in § 60.747 must be retained for at least 2 years.


(i) The requirements of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such States. In this event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this subsection, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.
