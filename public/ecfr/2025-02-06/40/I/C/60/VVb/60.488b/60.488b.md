(b) Under § 60.15, the “fixed capital cost of new components” includes the fixed capital cost of all depreciable components (except components specified in § 60.488b(a)) which are or will be replaced pursuant to all continuous programs of component replacement which are commenced within any 2-year period following the applicability date for the appropriate subpart.
