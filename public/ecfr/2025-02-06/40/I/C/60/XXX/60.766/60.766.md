# § 60.766   Monitoring of operations.

Except as provided in § 60.767(c)(2):


(a) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii)(C) for an active gas collection system must install a sampling port and a thermometer, other temperature measuring device, or an access port for temperature measurements at each wellhead and:


(1) Measure the gauge pressure in the gas collection header on a monthly basis as provided in § 60.765(a)(3); and


(2) Monitor nitrogen or oxygen concentration in the landfill gas on a monthly basis as follows:


(i) The nitrogen level must be determined using Method 3C, unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by § 60.767(c)(2).


(ii) Unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by § 60.767(c)(2), the oxygen level must be determined by an oxygen meter using Method 3A, 3C, or ASTM D6522-11 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). Determine the oxygen level by an oxygen meter using Method 3A, 3C, or ASTM D6522-11 (if sample location is prior to combustion) except that:


(A) The span must be set between 10 and 12 percent oxygen;


(B) A data recorder is not required;


(C) Only two calibration gases are required, a zero and span;


(D) A calibration error check is not required;


(E) The allowable sample bias, zero drift, and calibration drift are ±10 percent.


(iii) A portable gas composition analyzer may be used to monitor the oxygen levels provided:


(A) The analyzer is calibrated; and


(B) The analyzer meets all quality assurance and quality control requirements for Method 3A or ASTM D6522-11 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).


(3) Monitor temperature of the landfill gas on a monthly basis as provided in 60.765(a)(5). The temperature measuring device must be calibrated annually using the procedure in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1, Method 2, section 10.3 such that a minimum of two temperature points, bracket within 10 percent of all landfill absolute temperature measurements or two fixed points of ice bath and boiling water, corrected for barometric pressure, are used.


(b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) using an enclosed combustor must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications, the following equipment:


(1) A temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having a minimum accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 degrees Celsius, whichever is greater. A temperature monitoring device is not required for boilers or process heaters with design heat input capacity equal to or greater than 44 megawatts.


(2) A device that records flow to the control device and bypass of the control device (if applicable). The owner or operator must:


(i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that must record the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; and


(ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.


(c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) using a non-enclosed flare must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:


(1) A heat sensing device, such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or thermocouple, at the pilot light or the flame itself to indicate the continuous presence of a flame.


(2) A device that records flow to the flare and bypass of the flare (if applicable). The owner or operator must:


(i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; and


(ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.


(d) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) using a device other than a non-enclosed flare or an enclosed combustor or a treatment system must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 60.767(c)(2) describing the operation of the control device, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator must review the information and either approve it, or request that additional information be submitted. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.


(e) Each owner or operator seeking to install a collection system that does not meet the specifications in § 60.769 or seeking to monitor alternative parameters to those required by §§ 60.763 through 60.766 must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 60.767(c)(2) and (3) describing the design and operation of the collection system, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.


(f) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with the 500 parts per million surface methane operational standard in § 60.763(d) must monitor surface concentrations of methane according to the procedures in § 60.765(c) and the instrument specifications in § 60.765(d). Any closed landfill that has no monitored exceedances of the operational standard in three consecutive quarterly monitoring periods may skip to annual monitoring. Any methane reading of 500 ppm or more above background detected during the annual monitoring returns the frequency for that landfill to quarterly monitoring.


(g) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) using a landfill gas treatment system must maintain and operate all monitoring systems associated with the treatment system in accordance with the site-specific treatment system monitoring plan required in § 60.768(b)(5)(ii) and must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a device that records flow to the treatment system and bypass of the treatment system (if applicable). The owner or operator must:


(1) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the treatment system at least every 15 minutes; and


(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.


(h) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) (d) and (g) of this section apply at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
