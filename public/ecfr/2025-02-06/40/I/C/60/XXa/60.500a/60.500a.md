(e) For purposes of this subpart:


(1) The cost of the following frequently replaced components of the gasoline loading rack affected facility shall not be considered in calculating either the “fixed capital cost of the new components” or the “fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility” under § 60.15: pump seals, loading arm gaskets and swivels, coupler gaskets, overfill sensor couplers and cables, flexible vapor hoses, and grounding cables and connectors.
