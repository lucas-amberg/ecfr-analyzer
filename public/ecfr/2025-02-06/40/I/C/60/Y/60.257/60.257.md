# § 60.257   Test methods and procedures.

(a) The owner or operator must determine compliance with the applicable opacity standards as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 must be used to determine opacity, with the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii).


(i) The duration of the Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test shall be 1 hour (ten 6-minute averages).


(ii) If, during the initial 30 minutes of the observation of a Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, all of the 6-minute average opacity readings are less than or equal to half the applicable opacity limit, then the observation period may be reduced from 1 hour to 30 minutes.


(2) To determine opacity for fugitive coal dust emissions sources, the additional requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) must be used.


(i) The minimum distance between the observer and the emission source shall be 5.0 meters (16 feet), and the sun shall be oriented in the 140-degree sector of the back.


(ii) The observer shall select a position that minimizes interference from other fugitive coal dust emissions sources and make observations such that the line of vision is approximately perpendicular to the plume and wind direction.


(iii) The observer shall make opacity observations at the point of greatest opacity in that portion of the plume where condensed water vapor is not present. Water vapor is not considered a visible emission.


(3) A visible emissions observer may conduct visible emission observations for up to three fugitive, stack, or vent emission points within a 15-second interval if the following conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section are met.


(i) No more than three emissions points may be read concurrently.


(ii) All three emissions points must be within a 70 degree viewing sector or angle in front of the observer such that the proper sun position can be maintained for all three points.


(iii) If an opacity reading for any one of the three emissions points is within 5 percent opacity from the applicable standard (excluding readings of zero opacity), then the observer must stop taking readings for the other two points and continue reading just that single point.


(b) The owner or operator must conduct all performance tests required by § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emissions standards specified in § 60.252 according to the requirements in § 60.8 using the applicable test methods and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section.


(1) Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to select sampling port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present) prior to any releases to the atmosphere.


(2) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.


(3) Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. The owner or operator may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses (incorporated by reference—*see* § 60.17) as an alternative to Method 3B of appendix A-2 of this part.


(4) Method 4 of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.


(5) Method 5, 5B or 5D of appendix A-4 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-7 of this part shall be used to determine the PM concentration as follows:


(i) The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf). Sampling shall begin no less than 30 minutes after startup and shall terminate before shutdown procedures begin. A minimum of three valid test runs are needed to comprise a PM performance test.


(ii) Method 5 of appendix A of this part shall be used only to test emissions from affected facilities without wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems.


(iii) Method 5B of appendix A of this part is to be used only after wet FGD systems.


(iv) Method 5D of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used for positive pressure fabric filters and other similar applications (*e.g.,* stub stacks and roof vents).


(v) Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part may be used at facilities with or without wet scrubber systems provided the stack gas temperature does not exceed a temperature of 160 °C (320 °F). The procedures of sections 8.1 and 11.1 of Method 5B of appendix A-3 of this part may be used in Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part only if it is used after a wet FGD system. Do not use Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part after wet FGD systems if the effluent is saturated or laden with water droplets.


(6) Method 6, 6A, or 6C of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the SO_2_ concentration. A minimum of three valid test runs are needed to comprise an SO_2_ performance test.


(7) Method 7 or 7E of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the NO_X_ concentration. A minimum of three valid test runs are needed to comprise an NO_X_ performance test.


(8) Method 10 of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the CO concentration. A minimum of three valid test runs are needed to comprise a CO performance test. CO performance tests are conducted concurrently (or within a 60-minute period) with NO_X_ performance tests.
