# Appendix D to Part 61—Methods for Estimating Radionuclide Emissions 


Facility owners or operators may estimate radionuclide emissions to the atmosphere for dose calculations instead of measuring emissions. Particulate emissions from mill tailings piles should be estimated using the procedures listed in reference re #2. All other emissions may be estimated by using the “Procedures” listed below, or using the method described in reference #1. 


To estimate emissions to the atmosphere: 


(a) Determine the amount (in curies) used at facilities for the period under consideration. Radioactive materials in sealed packages that remain unopened, and have not leaked during the assessment period should not be included in the calculation. 


(b) Multiply the amount used by the following factors which depend on the physical state of the radionuclide. They are: 


(i) 1 for gases; 


(ii) 10_−3_ for liquids or particulate solids; and 


(iii) 10_−6_ for solids. 


If any nuclide is heated to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or more, boils at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or less, or is intentionally dispersed into the environment, it must be considered to be a gas. 


(c) If a control device is installed between the place of use and the point of release, multiply emissions from (b) by an adjustment factor. These are presented in Table 1.
