# § 61.53   Stack sampling.

(a) *Mercury ore processing facility.* (1) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under § 61.13, each owner or operator processing mercury ore shall test emissions from the source according to Method 101 of appendix B to this part. The emission test shall be performed—


(i) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial start-up date preceding the effective date; or 


(ii) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source which did not have an initial startup date preceding the effective date. 


(2) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test, so that he may at his option observe the test. 


(3) Samples shall be taken over such a period or periods as are necessary to accurately determine the maximum emissions which will occur in a 24-hour period. No changes in the operation shall be made, which would potentially increase emissions above that determined by the most recent source test, until the new emission level has been estimated by calculation and the results reported to the Administrator. 


(4) All samples shall be analyzed and mercury emissions shall be determined within 30 days after the stack test. Each determination shall be reported to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched within 15 calendar days following the date such determination is completed. 


(5) Records of emission test results and other data needed to determine total emissions shall be retained at the source and made available, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years. 


(b) *Mercury chlor-alkali plant—hydrogen and end-box ventilation gas streams.* (1) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under § 61.13, each owner or operator employing mercury chlor-alkali cell(s) shall test emissions from hydrogen streams according to Method 102 and from end-box ventilation gas streams according to Method 101 of appendix B to this part. The emission test shall be performed—


(i) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the effective date; or 


(ii) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source which did not have an initial startup date preceding the effective date. 


(2) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test, so that he may at his option observe the test. 


(3) Samples shall be taken over such a period or periods as are necessary to accurately determine the maximum emissions which will occur in a 24-hour period. No changes in the operation shall be made, which would potentially increase emissions above that determined by the most recent source test, until the new emission has been estimated by calculation and the results reported to the Administrator. 


(4) All samples shall be analyzed and mercury emissions shall be determined within 30 days after the stack test. Each determination shall be reported to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched within 15 calendar days following the date such determination is completed. 


(5) Records of emission test results and other data needed to determine total emissions shall be retained at the source and made available, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years. 


(c) *Mercury chlor-alkali plants—cell room ventilation system.* (1) Stationary sources using mercury chlor-alkali cells may test cell room emissions in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or demonstrate compliance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section and assume ventilation emissions of 1.3 kg/day (2.9 lb/day) of mercury. 


(2) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under § 61.13, each owner or operator shall pass all cell room air in force gas streams through stacks suitable for testing and shall test emissions from the source according to Method 101 in appendix B to this part. The emission test shall be performed—


(i) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the effective date; or 


(ii) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source which did not have an initial startup date preceding the effective date. 


(3) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test, so that he may at his option observe the test. 


(4) An owner or operator may carry out approved design, maintenance, and housekeeping practices. A list of approved practices is provided in appendix A of “Review of National Emission Standards for Mercury,” EPA-450/3-84-014a, December 1984. Copies are available from EPA's Central Docket Section, Docket item number A-84-41, III-B-1. 


(d) *Sludge incineration and drying plants.* (1) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under § 61.13, each owner or operator of a source subject to the standard in § 61.52(b) shall test emissions from that source. Such tests shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth either in paragraph (d) of this section or in § 61.54. 


(2) Method 101A in appendix B or Method 29 in appendix A to part 60 shall be used to test emissions as follows:


(i) The test shall be performed by May 28, 2014 in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding February 27, 2014.


(ii) The test shall be performed within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source which did not have an initial startup date preceding February 27, 2014.


(3) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test, so that he may at his option observe the test. 


(4) Samples shall be taken over such a period or periods as are necessary to determine accurately the maximum emissions which will occur in a 24-hour period. No changes shall be made in the operation which would potentially increase emissions above the level determined by the most recent stack test, until the new emission level has been estimated by calculation and the results reported to the Administrator. 


(5) All samples shall be analyzed and mercury emissions shall be determined within 30 days after the stack test. Each determination shall be reported to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched within 15 calendar days following the date such determination is completed. 


(6) Records of emission test results and other data needed to determine total emissions shall be retained at the source and shall be made available, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years.
