# § 61.62   Emission standard for ethylene dichloride plants.

(a) *Ethylene dichloride purification.* The concentration of vinyl chloride in each exhaust gas stream from any equipment used in ethylene dichloride purification is not to exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period), except as provided in § 61.65(a). This requirement does not preclude combining of exhaust gas streams provided the combined steam is ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm, or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. This requirement does not apply to equipment that has been opened, is out of operation, and met the requirement in § 61.65(b)(6)(i) before being opened.


(b) *Oxychlorination reactor.* Except as provided in § 61.65(a), emissions of vinyl chloride to the atmosphere from each oxychlorination reactor are not to exceed 0.2 g/kg (0.4 lb/ton) (average for 3-hour period) of the 100 percent ethylene dichloride product from the oxychlorination process.
