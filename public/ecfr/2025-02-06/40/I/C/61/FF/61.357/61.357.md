# § 61.357   Reporting requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator of a chemical plant, petroleum refinery, coke by-product recovery plant, and any facility managing wastes from these industries shall submit to the Administrator within 90 days after January 7, 1993, or by the initial startup for a new source with an initial startup after the effective date, a report that summarizes the regulatory status of each waste stream subject to § 61.342 and is determined by the procedures specified in § 61.355(c) to contain benzene. Each owner or operator subject to this subpart who has no benzene onsite in wastes, products, by-products, or intermediates shall submit an initial report that is a statement to this effect. For all other owners or operators subject to this subpart, the report shall include the following information: 


(1) Total annual benzene quantity from facility waste determined in accordance with § 61.355(a) of this subpart.


(2) A table identifying each waste stream and whether or not the waste stream will be controlled for benzene emissions in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.


(3) For each waste stream identified as not being controlled for benzene emissions in accordance with the requirements of this subpart the following information shall be added to the table:


(i) Whether or not the water content of the waste stream is greater than 10 percent;


(ii) Whether or not the waste stream is a process wastewater stream, product tank drawdown, or landfill leachate;


(iii) Annual waste quantity for the waste stream;


(iv) Range of benzene concentrations for the waste stream;

(vi) Annual benzene quantity for the waste stream.


(4) The information required in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section should represent the waste stream characteristics based on current configuration and operating conditions. An owner or operator only needs to list in the report those waste streams that contact materials containing benzene. The report does not need to include a description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard or other information required in § 61.10(a). 


(b) If the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is less than 1 Mg/yr (1.1 ton/yr), then the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a report that updates the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section whenever there is a change in the process generating the waste stream that could cause the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste to increase to 1 Mg/yr (1.1 ton/yr) or more.


(c) If the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is less than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) but is equal to or greater than 1 Mg/yr (1.1 ton/yr), then the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a report that updates the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section. The report shall be submitted annually and whenever there is a change in the process generating the waste stream that could cause the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste to increase to 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) or more. If the information in the annual report required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section is not changed in the following year, the owner or operator may submit a statement to that effect. 


(d) If the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr), then the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator the following reports:
