The owner or operator of any source subject to this subpart using a wet-scrubbing emission control device shall also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a monitoring device for the continuous measurement and recording of the scrubber fluid flow rate. These continuous measurement recordings shall be maintained at the source and made available for inspection by the Administrator, or his authorized representative, for a minimum of 5 years.
