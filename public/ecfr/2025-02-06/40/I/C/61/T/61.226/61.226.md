# § 61.226   Reconsideration of rescission and reinstatement of this subpart.

(a) *Reinstatement of this subpart upon completion of reconsideration of rescission.* (1) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has: 


(i) Failed on a programmatic basis to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 
2-s flux standard; and 


(ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 
2-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site. 


(2) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T on a site-specific basis as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record: 


(i) That NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed in significant part on a site-specific basis to achieve compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States; and 


(ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 
2-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site. 


(3) Upon completion of the reconsideration of rescission pursuant to § 61.226(c) the Administrator may issue a finding that reinstatement of this subpart is not appropriate if the Administrator finds: 


(i) NRC and the affected Agreement States are on a programmatic basis implementing and enforcing, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 
2-s flux standard; or 


(ii) NRC or an affected Agreement State are on a site-specific basis, in significant part, achieving compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States. 


(b) *Procedures to petition for reconsideration of rescission of this subpart.* (1) A person may petition the Administrator to reconsider the rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(a). 


(2) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(a)(1) (programmatic basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates that written notice of the alleged failure(s) was provided to NRC at least 60 days before filing the petition with EPA. This notification shall include a statement of the grounds for such a petition and this notice requirement may be satisfied by, but is not limited to, submissions or pleadings submitted to NRC during a proceeding conducted by NRC. 


(3) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(a)(2) (site-specific basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates that a written request was made to NRC or an affected Agreement State for enforcement or other relief at least 60 days before filing its petition with EPA, and unless the petitioner alleges that NRC or the affected Agreement State failed to respond to such request by taking action, as necessary, to assure timely implementation and enforcement of the 20 pCi/m 
2-s flux standard. 


(4) Upon receipt of a petition under § 61.226(b)(1) that is not dismissed under § 61.226(b)(2) or (b)(3), EPA will propose to grant or deny an authorized petition to reconsider, take comments on the Agency's proposed action, and take final action granting or denying such petition to reconsider within 300 days of receipt. 


(c) *Reconsideration of rescission of this subpart initiated by the Administrator.* (1) The Administrator may initiate reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA has reason to believe that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 
2-s flux standard. 


(2) Before the Administrator initiates reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(c)(1), EPA shall consult with NRC to address EPA's concerns and if the consultation does not resolve the concerns, EPA shall provide NRC with 60 days notice of the Agency's intent to initiate rulemaking to reinstate this subpart.
