# ยง 62.14102   Affected facilities.

(a) The affected facility to which this subpart applies is each municipal waste combustor unit with a capacity to combust greater than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste for which construction was commenced on or before September 20, 1994 that is not regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan. Table 1 of this subpart lists those units regulated by an EPA approved State plan. Notwithstanding the exclusions in table 1 of this subpart, this subpart applies to affected facilities not regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan.


(b) A municipal waste combustor unit regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is not regulated by this subpart.


(c) Any municipal waste combustor unit that has the capacity to combust more than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste and is subject to a Federally enforceable permit limiting the maximum amount of municipal solid waste that may be combusted in the unit to less than 11 tons per day is not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator:


(1) Notifies the EPA Administrator of an exemption claim;


(2) Provides a copy of the Federally enforceable permit that limits the firing of municipal solid waste to less than 11 tons per day; and


(3) Keeps records of the amount of municipal solid waste fired on a daily basis.


(d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing municipal waste combustor unit primarily for the purpose of complying with the emission requirements of this subpart are not considered in determining whether the unit is a modified or reconstructed facility under 40 CFR part 60, subpart Ea or subpart Eb.


(e) A qualifying small power production facility, as defined in section 3(17)(C) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(17)(C)), that burns homogeneous waste (such as automotive tires or used oil, but not including refuse-derived fuel) for the production of electric energy is not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the facility notifies the EPA Administrator of this exemption and provides data documenting that the facility qualifies for this exemption.


(f) A qualifying cogeneration facility, as defined in section 3(18)(B) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(18)(B)), that burns homogeneous waste (such as automotive tires or used oil, but not including refuse-derived fuel) for the production of electric energy and steam or forms of useful energy (such as heat) that are used for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes, is not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the facility notifies the EPA Administrator of this exemption and provides data documenting that the facility qualifies for this exemption.


(g) Any unit combusting a single-item waste stream of tires is not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the unit:


(1) Notifies the EPA Administrator of an exemption claim; and


(2) Provides data documenting that the unit qualifies for this exemption.


(h) Any unit required to have a permit under section 3005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is not subject to this subpart.


(i) Any materials recovery facility (including primary or secondary smelters) that combusts waste for the primary purpose of recovering metals is not subject to this subpart.


(j) Any cofired combustor, as defined under 40 CFR 60.51b of subpart Eb that meets the capacity specifications in paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the cofired combustor:


(1) Notifies the EPA Administrator of an exemption claim;


(2) Provides a copy of the Federally enforceable permit (specified in the definition of cofired combustor in this section); and


(3) Keeps a record on a calendar quarter basis of the weight of municipal solid waste combusted at the cofired combustor and the weight of all other fuels combusted at the cofired combustor.


(k) Air curtain incinerators, as defined under 40 CFR 60.51b, that meet the capacity specifications in paragraph (a) of this section, and that combust a fuel stream composed of 100 percent yard waste are exempt from all provisions of this subpart except the opacity standard under ยง 62.14107, and the testing procedures and the reporting and recordkeeping provisions under ยง 62.14109.


(l) Air curtain incinerators that meet the capacity specifications in paragraph (a) of this section and that combust municipal solid waste other than yard waste are subject to all provisions of this subpart.


(m) Pyrolysis/combustion units that are an integrated part of a plastics/rubber recycling unit (as defined in 40 CFR 60.51b) are not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the plastics/rubber recycling unit keeps records of the weight of plastics, rubber, and/or rubber tires processed on a calendar quarter basis; the weight of chemical plant feedstocks and petroleum refinery feedstocks produced and marketed on a calendar quarter basis; and the name and address of the purchaser of the feedstocks. The combustion of gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, fuel oils, residual oil, refinery gas, petroleum coke, liquefied petroleum gas, propane, or butane produced by chemical plants or petroleum refineries that use feestocks produced by plastics/rubber recycling units are not subject to this subpart.


(n) Cement kilns firing municipal solid waste are not subject to this subpart.
