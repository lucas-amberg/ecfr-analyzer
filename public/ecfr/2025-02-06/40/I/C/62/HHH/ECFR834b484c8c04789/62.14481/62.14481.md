# § 62.14481   When must I submit a title V permit application for my HMIWI?

You must submit a title V permit application in time for it to be determined or deemed complete by no later than September 15, 2000 or by the effective date of a title V permits program in the jurisdiction in which the unit is located, whichever is later. (An earlier deadline may apply if your HMIWI is also subject to title V permitting requirements because of some other triggering requirement.) A “complete” title V permit application is one that has been approved by the appropriate permitting authority as complete under Section 503 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR parts 70 and 71. It is not enough to have submitted a title V permit application by September 15, 2000 because the application must be determined or deemed complete by the permitting authority by that date for your HMIWI to operate after that date in compliance with Federal law.
