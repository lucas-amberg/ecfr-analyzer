# ยง 62.14420   Am I required to have a trained and qualified operator?

You must have a fully trained and qualified HMIWI operator, either at your facility or able to be at your facility within 1 hour. The trained and qualified HMIWI operator may operate the HMIWI directly or be the direct supervisor of one or more HMIWI operators.
