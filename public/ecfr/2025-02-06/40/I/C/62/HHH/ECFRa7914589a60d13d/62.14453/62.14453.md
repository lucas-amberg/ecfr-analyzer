# ยง 62.14453   What must I monitor?

(a) If your HMIWI uses combustion control only, or your HMIWI is equipped with a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter (FF), a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and wet scrubber, or a selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) system:


(1) You must establish the appropriate maximum and minimum operating parameters, indicated in Table 3, as site-specific operating parameters during the initial performance test to determine compliance with the emission limits; and


(2) After the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under ยง 62.14470, whichever comes first, your HMIWI must not operate above any of the applicable maximum operating parameters or below any of the applicable minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 and measured as 3-hour rolling averages (calculated each hour as the average of the previous 3 operating hours), at all times except during performance tests.


(b) If you are using an air pollution control device other than a dry scrubber followed by a FF, a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and a wet scrubber, or a SNCR system to comply with the emissions limits under ยง 62.14411, you must petition the EPA Administrator for site-specific operating parameters to be established during the initial performance test and you must continuously monitor those parameters thereafter. You may not conduct the initial performance test until the EPA Administrator has approved the petition.
