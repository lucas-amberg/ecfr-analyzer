# § 62.14605a   What operating limits must I meet and by when?

(a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must establish operating limits for up to four operating parameters (as specified in table 1 to this subpart) as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial performance test.


(1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.


(i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.


(ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.


(2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet particulate matter scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average pressure drop across the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.


(3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet acid gas or particulate matter scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.


(4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet acid gas scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride (HCl) emission limitation.


(b) You must meet the operating limits established on the date that the performance test report is submitted to the EPA's Central Data Exchange or postmarked, per the requirements of § 62.14730a(b).


(c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a and you do not use a particulate matter (PM) continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) for monitoring PM compliance, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during any 6-month period. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.


(d) If you use an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must measure the (secondary) voltage and amperage of the electrostatic precipitator collection plates during the particulate matter performance test. Calculate the average electric power value (secondary voltage × secondary current = secondary electric power) for each test run. The operating limit for the electrostatic precipitator is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average secondary electric power measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.


(e) If you use activated carbon sorbent injection to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must measure the sorbent flow rate during the performance testing. The operating limit for the carbon sorbent injection is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average sorbent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limitations. For energy recovery units (ERU), when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (*e.g.,* for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).


(f) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must measure the charge rate, the secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI), and the reagent flow rate during the nitrogen oxides (NO_X_) performance testing. The operating limits for the selective noncatalytic reduction are calculated as the highest 1-hour average charge rate, lowest secondary chamber temperature, and lowest reagent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limitations.


(g) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must measure the injection rate of each sorbent during the performance testing. The operating limit for the injection rate of each sorbent is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average injection rate of each sorbent measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (*e.g.,* for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).


(h) If you do not use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, and if you do not determine compliance with your particulate matter emission limitation with either a particulate matter continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) or a particulate matter CPMS, you must maintain opacity to less than or equal to ten percent opacity (1-hour block average).


(i) If you use a PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance with this subpart, you must establish your PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section:


(1) During the initial performance test or any subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record all hourly average output values (milliamps, or the digital signal equivalent) from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the test runs (*e.g.,* three 1-hour average PM CPMS output values for three 1-hour test runs):


(i) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output, or the digital signal equivalent, and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps or digital bits;


(ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit; and


(iii) During the initial performance test or any subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values, or their digital equivalent, from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (*e.g.,* average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour PM test runs under Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, or Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8).


(2) If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS output values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the performance tests under Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, or Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, with the procedures in (i)(1) through (5) of this section:


(i) Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:


(A) Zero point data for *in-situ* instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench;


(B) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air;


(C) The zero point can also be established by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (*e.g.,* when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept; and


(D) If none of the steps in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.


(ii) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1 to this paragraph (i)(2)(ii):


(iii) With your instrument zero expressed in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, your three run average PM CPMS milliamp value, or its digital equivalent, and your three run average PM concentration from your three compliance tests, determine a relationship of mg/dscm per milliamp or digital signal equivalent, with equation 2 to this paragraph (i)(2)(iii):


(iv) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the mg/dscm per milliamp value, or per digital signal equivalent from equation 2 to paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section, in equation 3 to this paragraph (i)(2)(iv). This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit:


(3) If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or above 75 percent of your PM emission limit you must determine your operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp or digital signal output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using equation 4 to this paragraph (i)(3) and you must submit all compliance test and PM CPMS data according to the reporting requirements in paragraph (i)(5) of this section:


(4) To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (*e.g.,* milliamps or digital signal bits, PM concentration, raw data signal) on a 30-day rolling average basis.


(5) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (*e.g.,* beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp or digital signal value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp or digital signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.
