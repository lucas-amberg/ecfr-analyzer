# ยง 62.14510a   Am I subject to this subpart?

(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a CISWI as defined in ยง 62.14780a or an air curtain incinerator as defined in ยง 62.14780a and the CISWI or air curtain incinerator meets the criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Construction of your CISWI or air curtain incinerator commenced on or before June 4, 2010, and have not been modified or reconstructed since August 7, 2013.


(2) Your CISWI is not exempt under ยง 62.14530a.


(3) Your CISWI is not regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective state or tribal plan, or your CISWI is located in any state whose approved state or tribal plan is only approved in part. In the case of a state or tribal program that is approved in part, the Federal plan applies to affected CISWI in lieu of the disapproved portions of the state or tribal program until the state or tribe plan addresses the deficiencies and the revised plan is approved by the EPA.


(b) If changes to the CISWI are made after August 7, 2013, that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction in this subpart, your CISWI is subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart CCCC, and this subpart no longer applies to that unit.


(c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing CISWI primarily to comply with this subpart, then such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under 40 CFR part 60, subpart CCCC.
