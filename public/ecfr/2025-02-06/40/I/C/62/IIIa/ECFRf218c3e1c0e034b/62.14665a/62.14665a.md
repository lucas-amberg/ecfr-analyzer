# § 62.14665a   What monitoring equipment must I install and what parameters must I monitor?

(a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitation under § 62.14600a, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in table 1 to this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in table 1 to this subpart at all times except as specified in § 62.14670a(a).


(b) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the requirements of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS or PM CEMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate a bag leak detection system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section.


(1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for each exhaust stack of the fabric filter.


(2) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.


(3) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter or less.


(4) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative or absolute particulate matter loadings.


(5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.


(6) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will alert automatically an operator when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is observed easily by plant operating personnel.


(7) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell. For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter.


(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.


(c) If you are using something other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon, selective non-catalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 62.14600a, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in § 62.14610a.


(d) If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, you must measure the minimum sorbent flow rate once per hour.


(e) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, you must complete the following:


(1) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 62.14615a, whichever date comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate above the maximum charge rate, or below the minimum secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI) or the minimum reagent flow rate measured as 3-hour block averages at all times; and


(2) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge rate, below the minimum secondary chamber temperature and below the minimum reagent flow rate simultaneously constitute a violation of the nitrogen oxides emissions limit.


(f) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limits of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must monitor the secondary power to the electrostatic precipitator collection plates and maintain the 3-hour block averages at or above the operating limits established during the mercury or particulate matter performance test.


(g) For waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring hydrogen chloride emissions discharged to the atmosphere, as specified in § 62.14640a(j), and record the output of the system. You may substitute use of a HCl CEMS for conducting the HCl initial and annual testing with EPA Method 321 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A. for units other than waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, a facility may substitute use of a HCl CEMS for conducting the HCl initial and annual performance test. For units equipped with a HCl CEMS, you are not required to monitor the minimum hydrogen chloride sorbent flow rate, monitoring the minimum scrubber liquor pH, and monitoring minimum injection rate.


(h) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emissions limit in this subpart, a facility may substitute use of either a particulate matter CEMS or a particulate matter CPMS for conducting the particulate matter annual performance test. For units equipped with a particulate matter CEMS, you are not required to use other CMS monitoring for PM compliance (*e.g.,* bag leak detectors, electrostatic precipitator secondary power, PM scrubber pressure). A facility may also substitute use of a particulate matter CEMS for conducting the PM initial performance test.


(i) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the dioxin/furan emissions limit in this subpart, a facility may substitute use of a continuous automated sampling system for the dioxin/furan initial and annual performance test. You must record the output of the system and analyze the sample according to EPA Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to dioxin/furan from continuous monitors is published in the _Federal Register._ The owner or operator who elects to continuously sample dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 23 must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system and must comply with the requirements specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q) of this chapter. A facility may substitute continuous dioxin/furan monitoring for the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit.


(j)(1) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the mercury emissions limit in this subpart, a facility may substitute use of a mercury CEMS or and integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for the mercury initial and annual performance test. The owner or operator who elects to continuously sample mercury emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 29 or 30B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, ASTM D6784-24, Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method), approved March 1, 2024 (ASTM D6784-24), or an approved alternative method for measuring mercury emissions, must install, calibrate, maintain and operate the mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system and must comply with Performance Specification 12A or 12B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, respectively, and quality assurance requirements of Procedure 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F. For the purposes of emissions calculations when using an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, the mercury concentration determined for each sampling period must be assigned to each hour during the sampling period. For units equipped with a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, you are not required to monitor the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the mercury emission limit. Waste-burning kilns must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system as specified in § 62.14640a(j).

(3) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the particulate matter emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. The relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for the affected facility must be established according to the procedures and methods specified in § 62.14640a(t)(4)(i) through (iv);


(4) The owner or operator of an affected facility must conduct an initial performance test for particulate matter emissions. If PM CEMS are elected for demonstrating compliance, and the initial performance test has not yet been conducted, then initial compliance must be determined by using the CEMS specified in this paragraph (n) to measure particulate matter.

(i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;


(ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;


(iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit in this subpart and to verify the operation of the emissions control device(s). Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph (r)(8)(iii); and

(t) If you are required to monitor clinker production because you comply with the production-rate based mercury limit in this subpart for your waste-burning kiln, you must:


(1) Determine hourly clinker production by one of two methods:


(i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of clinker produced. The system of measuring hourly clinker production must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy; or


(ii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of feed to the kiln. The system of measuring feed must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln-specific feed to clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. Update this ratio monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.


(2) Determine the accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production (or feed mass flow if applicable) before the final compliance date under this subpart and during each quarter of source operation.


(3) Conduct accuracy checks in accordance with the procedures outlined in your site-specific monitoring plan under § 62.14640a(l).
