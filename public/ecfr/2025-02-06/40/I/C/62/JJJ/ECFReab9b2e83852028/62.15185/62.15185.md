# ยง 62.15185   How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly?

(a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide. 


(b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date. 


(c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently (or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in table 6 of this subpart. Collect these data during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. Table 7 of this subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each continuous emission monitoring system. 


(d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 for each continuous emission monitoring system. These procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy determinations.
