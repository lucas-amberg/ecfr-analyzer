# § 62.15865   How do I determine if my SSI unit is covered by an approved and effective state or tribal plan?

This part contains a list of all states and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 plans in effect. However, this part is only updated once a year. Thus, if this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA regional office to determine if approval occurred since publication of the most recent version of this part. A state may also meet its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its 111(d)/129 obligations.


(a) An acceptable federal plan delegation request must include the following:


(1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the federal plan.


(2) The items under § 60.5015(a)(1), (2), and (7) of this chapter.


(3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.


(4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in the EPA's “Delegations Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) federal plans.”


(b) A state with an already approved SSI CAA section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of the EPA's previous state plan approval.


(c) A state's CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under title V of the CAA.
