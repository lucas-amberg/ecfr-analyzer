# § 62.16020   What are the monitoring and calibration requirements for compliance with my operating limits?

(a) You must install, operate, calibrate and maintain the continuous parameter monitoring systems according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Meet the following general requirements for flow, pressure, pH and operating temperature measurement devices:


(i) You must collect data using the continuous monitoring system at all times the affected SSI unit is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions that occur during periods specified defined in § 62.15995(a)(7)(i), repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments). Any such periods that you do not collect data using the continuous monitoring system constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.


(ii) You must collect continuous parameter monitoring system data in accordance with § 60.13(e)(2) of this chapter.


(iii) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities must not be included in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. Any such periods must be reported in your annual deviation report.


(iv) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in § 62.15995(a)(7)(i) must not be included in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. Any such periods that do not coincide with a monitoring system malfunction, as defined in § 62.16045, constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.


(v) You must use all the data collected during all periods except those periods specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.


(vi) Record the results of each inspection, calibration and validation check.


(2) Operate and maintain your continuous monitoring system according to your monitoring plan required under § 60.4880 of this chapter. Additionally:


(i) For carrier gas flow rate monitors (for activated carbon injection), during the performance test conducted pursuant to § 60.4885 chapter, you must demonstrate that the system is maintained within ±5-percent accuracy, according to the procedures in appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.


(ii) For carrier gas pressure drop monitors (for activated carbon injection), during the performance test conducted pursuant to § 60.4885 of this chapter, you must demonstrate that the system is maintained within ±5-percent accuracy.


(b) You must operate and maintain your bag leak detection system in continuous operation according to your monitoring plan required under § 60.4880 of this chapter. Additionally:


(1) For positive pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all compartments of cells to a common stack, a bag leak detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.


(2) Where multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.


(3) You must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 8 hours of the alarm, and you must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 24 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:


(i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media or any other condition that may cause an increase in particulate matter emissions.


(ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.


(iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.


(iv) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment.


(v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system.


(vi) Shutting down the process producing the particulate matter emissions.


(c) You must operate and maintain the continuous parameter monitoring systems specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in continuous operation according to your monitoring plan required under § 60.4880 of this chapter.


(d) If your SSI unit has a bypass stack, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate a device or method for measuring the use of the bypass stack including date, time and duration.
