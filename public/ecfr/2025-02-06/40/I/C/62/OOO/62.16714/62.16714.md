# § 62.16714   Standards for municipal solid waste landfill emissions.

(a) *Landfills.* Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams by mass and 2.5 million cubic meters by volume must collect and control MSW landfill emissions at each MSW landfill that meets the following conditions:


(1) *Waste acceptance date.* The landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987, or has additional design capacity available for future waste deposition.


(2) *Construction commencement date.* The landfill commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before July 17, 2014.


(3) *NMOC emission rate.* The landfill has an NMOC emission rate greater than or equal to 34 megagrams per year or Tier 4 SEM shows a surface emission concentration of 500 parts per million methane or greater.


(4) *Closed subcategory.* The landfill is in the closed landfill subcategory and has an NMOC emission rate greater than or equal to 50 megagrams per year.


(b) *Collection system.* Install a gas collection and control system meeting the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) and (c) of this section at each MSW landfill meeting the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section.


(1) *Collection system.* Install and start up a collection and control system that captures the gas generated within the landfill within 30 months after:


(i) The first annual report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year, unless Tier 2 or Tier 3 sampling demonstrates that the NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, as specified in § 62.16724(d)(4), or


(ii) The first annual report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year submitted under previously applicable regulations 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW, 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG, or a state plan implementing 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc for a legacy controlled landfill or landfill in the closed landfill subcategory, or


(iii) The most recent NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year based on Tier 2, if the Tier 4 SEM shows a surface methane emission concentration of 500 parts per million methane or greater as specified in § 62.16724 (d)(4)(iii).


(2) *Active.* An active collection system must:


(i) Be designed to handle the maximum expected gas flow rate from the entire area of the landfill that warrants control over the intended use period of the gas control system equipment.


(ii) Collect gas from each area, cell, or group of cells in the landfill in which the initial solid waste has been placed for a period of 5 years or more if active; or 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.


(iii) Collect gas at a sufficient extraction rate.


(iv) Be designed to minimize off-site migration of subsurface gas.


(3) *Passive.* A passive collection system must:


(i) Comply with the provisions specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section.


(ii) Be installed with liners on the bottom and all sides in all areas in which gas is to be collected. The liners must be installed as required under 40 CFR 258.40.


(c) *Control system.* Control the gas collected from within the landfill through the use of control devices meeting the following requirements, except as provided in 40 CFR 60.24.


(1) A non-enclosed flare designed and operated in accordance with the parameters established in 40 CFR 60.18 except as noted in § 62.16722(d); or


(2) A control system designed and operated to reduce NMOC by 98 weight percent; or when an enclosed combustion device is used for control, to either reduce NMOC by 98 weight percent or reduce the outlet NMOC concentration to less than 20 parts-per-million by volume, dry basis as hexane at 3-percent oxygen or less. The reduction efficiency or concentration in parts-per-million by volume must be established by an initial performance test to be completed no later than 180 days after the initial startup of the approved control system using the test methods specified in § 62.16718(d). The performance test is not required for boilers and process heaters with design heat input capacities equal to or greater than 44 megawatts that burn landfill gas for compliance with this subpart.


(i) If a boiler or process heater is used as the control device, the landfill gas stream must be introduced into the flame zone.


(ii) The control device must be operated within the parameter ranges established during the initial or most recent performance test. The operating parameters to be monitored are specified in § 62.16722.


(iii) Legacy controlled landfills or landfills in the closed landfill subcategory that have already installed control systems and completed initial or subsequent performance tests may comply with this subpart using the initial or most recent performance test conducted to comply with 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW; subpart GGG of this part; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of part 60, is sufficient for compliance with this subpart.


(3) Route the collected gas to a treatment system that processes the collected gas for subsequent sale or beneficial use such as fuel for combustion, production of vehicle fuel, production of high-Btu gas for pipeline injection, or use as a raw material in a chemical manufacturing process. Venting of treated landfill gas to the ambient air is not allowed. If the treated landfill gas cannot be routed for subsequent sale or beneficial use, then the treated landfill gas must be controlled according to either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.


(4) All emissions from any atmospheric vent from the gas treatment system are subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. For purposes of this subpart, atmospheric vents located on the condensate storage tank are not part of the treatment system and are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.


(d) *Design capacity.* Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams by mass or 2.5 million cubic meters by volume must submit an initial design capacity report to the Administrator as provided in § 62.16724(a). The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the report. Submittal of the initial design capacity report fulfills the requirements of this subpart except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) The owner or operator must submit an amended design capacity report as provided in § 62.16724(b).


(2) When an increase in the maximum design capacity of a landfill with an initial design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters results in a revised maximum design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the owner or operator must comply with paragraph (e) of this section.


(e) *Emissions.* The owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must either install a collection and control system as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or calculate an initial NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures specified in § 62.16718(a). The NMOC emission rate must be recalculated annually, except as provided in § 62.16724(c)(3).
