# § 62.16720   Compliance provisions.

Follow the compliance provisions in this section (as well as the provisions in §§ 62.16716 and 62.16722), or the compliance provisions in § 63.1960 of this chapter (as well as the provisions in §§ 63.1958 and 63.1961 of this chapter), or both as alternative means of compliance, for an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 62.16714(b) and (c). Once the owner or operator begins to comply with the provisions of § 63.1960 of this chapter, the owner or operator must continue to operate the collection and control device according to those provisions and cannot return to the provisions of this section.


(a) Except as provided in § 62.16724(d)(2), the specified methods in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section must be used to determine whether the gas collection system is in compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2).


(1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(i), either Equation 5 or Equation 6 must be used. The methane generation rate constant (k) and methane generation potential (Lo) kinetic factors should be those published in the most recent AP-42 or other site-specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in § 62.16718(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test must be used. A value of no more than 15 years must be used for the intended use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until closure.


(i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:


(ii) For sites with known year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:


(iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal the maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section or other methods must be used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.


(2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas collectors for compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(ii), the owner or operator must design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the Administrator, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the landfill sufficient to meet all operational and performance standards.


(3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(iii), the owner or operator must measure gauge pressure in the gas collection header applied to each individual well monthly. If a positive pressure exists, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days, except for the three conditions allowed under § 62.16716(b). Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.


(i) If negative pressure cannot be achieved without excess air infiltration within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of positive pressure, the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after positive pressure was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(3).


(ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the positive pressure or elevated temperature measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) or positive pressure. The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 62.16724(h)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(4).


(iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 62.16724(h)(7) and (k). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(5).


(4) For the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator must monitor each well monthly for temperature as provided in § 62.16716(c). If a well exceeds the operating parameter for temperature, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days. Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.


(i) If a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) cannot be achieved within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit), the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after a landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(3).


(ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 62.16724(h)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(4).


(iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 62.16724(h)(7) and § 62.16724(k). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(5).


(5) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(iv) through the use of a collection system not conforming to the specifications provided in § 62.16728 must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in § 62.16724(d)(3) demonstrating that off-site migration is being controlled.


(b) For purposes of compliance with § 62.16716(a), each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must place each well or design component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in § 62.16724(d). Each well must be installed no later than 60 days after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a period of:


(1) 5 years or more if active; or


(2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.


(c) The following procedures must be used for compliance with the surface methane operational standard as provided in § 62.16716(d):


(1) After installation and startup of the gas collection system, the owner or operator must monitor surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals (or a site-specific established spacing) for each collection area on a quarterly basis using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) The background concentration must be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary of the landfill at a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter wells.


(3) Surface emission monitoring must be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60, except that the probe inlet must be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the ground. Monitoring must be performed during typical meteorological conditions.


(4) Any reading of 500 parts per million or more above background at any location must be recorded as a monitored exceedance and the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section must be taken. As long as the specified actions are taken, the exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of § 62.16716(d).


(i) The location of each monitored exceedance must be marked, and the location and concentration recorded. For location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places.


(ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent wells to increase the gas collection in the vicinity of each exceedance must be made and the location must be re-monitored within 10 calendar days of detecting the exceedance.


(iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second exceedance, additional corrective action must be taken, and the location must be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section must be taken, and no further monitoring of that location is required until the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section has been taken.


(iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a methane concentration less than 500 parts-per-million methane above background at the 10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts-per-million above background, no further monitoring of that location is required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) or (v) of this section must be taken.


(v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or exceeds 500 parts-per-million above background three times within a quarterly period, a new well or other collection device must be installed within 120 calendar days of the initial exceedance. An alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.


(5) The owner or operator must implement a program to monitor for cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly basis.


(d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section or § 62.16718(a)(6) must comply with the following instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission monitoring devices:


(1) The portable analyzer must meet the instrument specifications provided in section 6 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60, except that “methane” replaces all references to “VOC.”


(2) The calibration gas must be methane, diluted to a nominal concentration of 500 parts-per-million in air.


(3) To meet the performance evaluation requirements in section 8.1 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60, the instrument evaluation procedures of section 8.1 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 must be used.


(4) The calibration procedures provided in sections 8 and 10 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 must be followed immediately before commencing a surface monitoring survey.


(e) The provisions of this subpart apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must comply with the work practice specified in § 62.16716(e) in lieu of the compliance provisions in § 62.16720.
