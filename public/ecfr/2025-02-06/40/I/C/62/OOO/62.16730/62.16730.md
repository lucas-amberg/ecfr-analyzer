# § 62.16730   Definitions.

Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and in subparts A and B of 40 CFR part 60 of this chapter.


*Achieve final compliance* means to connect and operate the collection and control system as specified in the final control plan. Within 180 days after the date the landfill is required to achieve final compliance, the initial performance test must be conducted.


*Active collection system* means a gas collection system that uses gas mover equipment.


*Active landfill* means a landfill in which solid waste is being placed or a landfill that is planned to accept waste in the future.


*Administrator* means:


(1) For municipal solid waste landfills covered by the federal plan, the Administrator of the EPA or his/her authorized representative (*e.g.,* delegated authority);


(2) For municipal solid waste landfills covered by an approved state plan, the director of the state air pollution control agency or his/her authorized representative.


*Award contract* means the MSW landfill owner or operator enters into legally binding agreements or contractual obligations that cannot be canceled or modified without substantial financial loss to the MSW landfill owner or operator. The MSW landfill owner or operator may award a number of contracts to install the collection and control system. To meet this increment of progress, the MSW landfill owner or operator must award a contract or contracts to initiate on-site construction or installation of the collection and control system.


*Closed landfill* means a landfill in which solid waste is no longer being placed, and in which no additional solid wastes will be placed without first filing a notification of modification as prescribed under 40 CFR 60.7(a)(4) of this chapter. Once a notification of modification has been filed, and additional solid waste is placed in the landfill, the landfill is no longer closed.


*Closed area* means a separately lined area of an MSW landfill in which solid waste is no longer being placed. If additional solid waste is placed in that area of the landfill, that landfill area is no longer closed. The area must be separately lined to ensure that the landfill gas does not migrate between open and closed areas.


*Closed landfill subcategory* means a closed landfill that has submitted a closure report as specified in § 62.16724(f) on or before September 27, 2017.


*Closure* means that point in time when a landfill becomes a closed landfill.


*Commercial solid waste* means all types of solid waste generated by stores, offices, restaurants, warehouses, and other nonmanufacturing activities, excluding residential and industrial wastes.


*Complete on-site construction* means that all necessary collection system components and air pollution control devices identified in the final control plan are on site, in place, and ready for operation.


*Controlled landfill* means any landfill at which collection and control systems are required under this subpart as a result of the NMOC emission rate. The landfill is considered controlled at the time a collection and control system design plan is prepared in compliance with § 62.16714(e)(2). Controlled landfills also includes those landfills that meet the definition of *legacy controlled landfills,* as defined in this subpart.


*Corrective action analysis* means a description of all reasonable interim and long-term measures, if any, that are available, and an explanation of why the selected corrective action(s) is/are the best alternative(s), including, but not limited to, considerations of cost effectiveness, technical feasibility, safety, and secondary impacts.


*Design capacity* means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually.


*Disposal facility* means all contiguous land and structures, other appurtenances, and improvements on the land used for the disposal of solid waste.


*Emission rate cutoff* means the threshold annual emission rate to which a landfill compares its estimated emission rate to determine if control under the regulation is required.


*Enclosed combustor* means an enclosed firebox which maintains a relatively constant limited peak temperature generally using a limited supply of combustion air. An enclosed flare is considered an enclosed combustor.


*EPA approved state plan* means a state plan that EPA has approved based on the requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B or Ba to implement and enforce 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cf. An approved state plan becomes effective on the date specified in the document published in the _Federal Register_ announcing EPA's approval.


*Flare* means an open combustor without enclosure or shroud.


*Final control plan (Collection and control system design plan)* means a plan that describes the collection and control system that will capture the gas generated within an MSW landfill. The collection and control system design plan must be prepared by a professional engineer and must describe a collection and control system that meets the requirements of § 62.1614(b) and (c). The final control plan must contain engineering specifications and drawings of the collection and control system. The final control plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting provisions of §§ 62.16716 through 62.16726 proposed by the owner or operator. The final control plan must either conform with the specifications for active collection systems in § 62.16728 or include a demonstration that shows that based on the size of the landfill and the amount of waste expected to be accepted, the system is sized properly to collect the gas, control emissions of NMOC to the required level and meet the operational standards for a landfill.


*Gas mover equipment* means the equipment (*i.e.,* fan, blower, compressor) used to transport landfill gas through the header system.


*Gust* means the highest instantaneous wind speed that occurs over a 3-second running average.


*Indian Country* means all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the reservation; all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state; and all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.


*Initiate on-site construction* means to begin any of the following: Installation of the collection and control system to be used to comply with the emission limits as outlined in the final control plan; physical preparation necessary for the installation of the collection and control system to be used to comply with the final emission limits as outlined in the final control plan; or, alteration of an existing collection and control system to be used to comply with the final emission limits as outlined in the final control plan.


*Household waste* means any solid waste (including garbage, trash, and sanitary waste in septic tanks) derived from households (including, but not limited to, single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day-use recreation areas). Household waste does not include fully segregated yard waste.
