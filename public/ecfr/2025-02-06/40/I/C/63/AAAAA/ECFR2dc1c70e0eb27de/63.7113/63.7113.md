# § 63.7113   What are my monitoring installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

(a) You must install, operate, and maintain each continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) according to your OM&M plan required by § 63.7100(d) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, and you must install, operate, and maintain each continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) as required by paragraph (g) of this section


(1) The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period.


(2) To calculate a valid hourly value, you must have at least four equally spaced data values (or at least two, if that condition is included to allow for periodic calibration checks) for that hour from a CPMS that is not out of control according your OM&M plan, and use all valid data.


(3) To calculate the average for each 3-hour block averaging period, you must use all valid data, and you must have at least 66 percent of the hourly averages for that period using only hourly average values that are based on valid data (*i.e.,* not from out-of-control periods).


(4) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CPMS in accordance with your OM&M plan.


(5) You must continuously operate and maintain the CPMS according to the OM&M plan, including, but not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.


(b) For each flow measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Use a flow sensor with a minimum tolerance of 2 percent of the flow rate.


(2) Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to upstream and downstream disturbances.


(3) Conduct a flow sensor calibration check at least semiannually.


(4) At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity, all electrical connections for continuity, and all mechanical connections for leakage.


(c) For each pressure measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and (c)(1) through (7) of this section.


(1) Locate the pressure sensor(s) in or as close to as possible a position that provides a representative measurement of the pressure.


(2) Minimize or eliminate pulsating pressure, vibration, and internal and external corrosion.


(3) Use a gauge with a minimum tolerance of 0.5 inch of water or a transducer with a minimum tolerance of 1 percent of the pressure range.


(4) Check pressure tap pluggage daily.


(5) Using a manometer, check gauge calibration quarterly and transducer calibration monthly.


(6) Conduct calibration checks any time the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range or install a new pressure sensor.


(7) At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity, all electrical connections for continuity, and all mechanical connections for leakage.


(d) For each bag leak detection system (BLDS), you must meet any applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and (d)(1) through (10) of this section.


(1) The BLDS must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.


(2) The sensor on the BLDS must provide output of relative PM emissions.


(3) The BLDS must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.


(4) The BLDS must have an alarm that will sound automatically when it detects an increase in relative PM emissions greater than a preset level.


(5) The alarm must be located in an area where appropriate plant personnel will be able to hear it.


(6) For a positive-pressure fabric filter (FF), each compartment or cell must have a bag leak detector (BLD). For a negative-pressure or induced-air FF, the BLD must be installed downstream of the FF. If multiple BLD are required (for either type of FF), the detectors may share the system instrumentation and alarm.


(7) Each triboelectric BLDS must be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained according to EPA-454/R-98-015, “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14). Other types of bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained according to the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations. Standard operating procedures must be incorporated into the OM&M plan.


(8) At a minimum, initial adjustment of the system must consist of establishing the baseline output in both of the following ways, according to section 5.0 of the EPA-454/R-98-015, “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14):


(i) Adjust the range and the averaging period of the device.


(ii) Establish the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.


(9) After initial adjustment, the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted except as specified in the OM&M plan required by § 63.7100(d). In no event may the range be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete FF inspection that demonstrates that the FF is in good operating condition, as defined in section 5.2 of the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14). Record each adjustment.


(10) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.


(e) For each PM detector, you must meet any applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and (e)(1) through (8) of this section.


(1) The PM detector must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.


(2) The sensor on the PM detector must provide output of relative PM emissions.


(3) The PM detector must have an alarm that will sound automatically when it detects an increase in relative PM emissions greater than a preset level.


(4) The alarm must be located in an area where appropriate plant personnel will be able to hear it.


(5) For a positive-pressure electrostatic precipitator (ESP), each compartment must have a PM detector. For a negative-pressure or induced-air ESP, the PM detector must be installed downstream of the ESP. If multiple PM detectors are required (for either type of ESP), the detectors may share the system instrumentation and alarm.


(6) Particulate matter detectors must be installed, operated, adjusted, and maintained according to the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations. Standard operating procedures must be incorporated into the OM&M plan.


(7) At a minimum, initial adjustment of the system must consist of establishing the baseline output in both of the following ways:


(i) Adjust the range and the averaging period of the device.


(ii) Establish the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.


(8) After initial adjustment, the range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted except as specified in the OM&M plan required by § 63.7100(d). In no event may the range be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless a responsible official as defined in § 63.2 certifies in writing to the Administrator that the ESP has been inspected and found to be in good operating condition.


(f) For each emission unit equipped with an add-on air pollution control device, you must inspect each capture/collection and closed vent system at least once each calendar year to ensure that each system is operating in accordance with the operating requirements in item 6 of Table 3 to this subpart and record the results of each inspection.


(g) For each COMS used to monitor an add-on air pollution control device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Install the COMS at the outlet of the control device.


(2) Install, maintain, calibrate, and operate the COMS as required by 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, General Provisions and according to Performance Specification (PS)-1 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. Facilities that operate COMS installed on or before February 6, 2001, may continue to meet the requirements in effect at the time of COMS installation unless specifically required to re-certify the COMS by their permitting authority.


(h) For each mass flow rate monitor used for measuring the dry sorbent injection rate (*e.g.,* sorbent, activated carbon, etc.) you must meet the requirements of (h)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Locate the device in a position(s) that provides a representative measurement of the total sorbent injection rate.


(2) Install and calibrate the device in accordance with manufacturer's procedures and specifications.


(3) At least annually, calibrate the device in accordance with the manufacturer's procedures and specifications.


(i) For each temperature monitoring device installed to monitor the temperature of a thermal oxidizer, you must meet the requirements of (i)(1) through (3) of this section.
