# § 63.11562   What are my initial compliance requirements?

(a) For asphalt processing operations, you must:


(1) Demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 1 of this subpart by:


(i) Conducting emission tests using the methods specified in Table 3 of this subpart; or


(ii) Using the results of a previously-conducted emission test as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) Establish the value or range of values of the operating parameters specified in Table 4 of this subpart:


(i) Using the operating parameter data recorded during the compliance emission tests; or


(ii) Using the operating parameter data recorded during a previously-conducted emission test.


(b) For asphalt roofing manufacturing lines that use a control device to comply with the emission limits in Table 2 of this subpart, you must:


(1) Demonstrate initial compliance by:


(i) Conducting emission tests using the methods specified in Table 3 of this subpart; or


(ii) Using the results of a previously-conducted emission test as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) Establish the value of the operating parameter specified in Table 4 of this subpart for thermal oxidizers:


(i) Using the operating parameter data recorded during the compliance emission tests; or


(ii) Using the operating parameter data recorded during a previously-conducted emission test.


(3) Establish the value or range of values of the operating parameters specified in Table 4 of this subpart for control devices other than thermal oxidizers:


(i) Using the operating parameter data recorded during the compliance emission tests;


(ii) Using the operating parameter data recorded during a previously-conducted emission test; or


(iii) Using manufacturer performance specifications.


(c) For asphalt roofing manufacturing lines that do not require a control device to comply with the emission limits in Table 2 of this subpart, you must:


(1) Demonstrate initial compliance by:


(i) Conducting emission tests using the methods specified in Table 3 of this subpart,


(ii) Using the results of a previously-conducted emission test as specified in paragraph (d) of this section; or


(iii) Using process knowledge and engineering calculations as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.


(2) Establish the value or range of values of the operating parameters specified in Table 4 of this subpart:


(i) Using the operating parameter data recorded during the compliance emission tests;


(ii) Using the operating parameter data recorded during a previously-conducted emission test; or


(iii) Using process knowledge and engineering calculations as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.


(d) If you are using a previously-conducted emission test to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations in this subpart for existing sources, as specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the following conditions must be met:


(1) The emission test was conducted within the last 5 years;


(2) No changes have been made to the process since the time of the emission test;


(3) The operating conditions and test methods used for the previous test conform to the requirements of this subpart; and


(4) The data used to establish the value or range of values of the operating parameters, as specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(2)(ii) of this section, were recorded during the emission test.


(e) If you are using process knowledge and engineering calculations to demonstrate initial compliance as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, you must prepare written documentation that contains the data and any assumptions used to calculate the process emission rate that demonstrate compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart.


(f) If you are using process knowledge and engineering calculations to establish the value or range of values of operating parameters as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, you must prepare written documentation that contains the data and any assumptions used to show that the process parameters and corresponding parameter values correlate to the process emissions.


(g) For existing sources, you must demonstrate initial compliance no later than 180 calendar days after December 2, 2010.


(h) For new sources, you must demonstrate initial compliance no later than 180 calendar days after December 2, 2009 or within 180 calendar days after startup of the source, whichever is later.


(i) For emission tests conducted to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits specified in Tables 1 and 2 of this subpart, you must follow the requirements specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4) of this section.


(1) You must conduct the tests while manufacturing the product that generates the greatest PAH and PM emissions to the control device inlet, or exiting the process if you are not using a control device to comply with the emissions limits specified in Tables 1 and 2 of this subpart.


(2) You must conduct a minimum of three separate test runs for each compliance test specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (b)(1)(i), and (c)(1)(i) of this section according to the requirements specified in § 63.7(e)(3). The sampling time and sample volume of each test run must be as follows:


(i) For asphalt processing operations, the sampling time and sample volume for each test run must be at least 90 minutes or the duration of the coating blow or non-coating blow, whichever is greater, and 2.25 dscm (79.4 dscf).


(ii) For asphalt coating operations, the sampling time and sample volume for each test run must be at least 120 minutes and 3.00 dscm (106 dscf).


(3) For asphalt processing operations, you must use the following equations to calculate the asphalt charging rate (P).


(i) P = (Vd)/(K′ Θ)


(ii) *d* = *K*_1_−*K*_2_*T*_i_

(4) You must use the following equation to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart:


E = [(C)*(Q)/(P)*(K)]
