# § 63.626   Performance tests and compliance provisions.

(a) You must conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, within 180 days of the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.622.


(b) After you conduct the initial performance test specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you must conduct a performance test once per calendar year.


(c) For affected sources (as defined in § 63.620) that have not operated since the previous annual performance test was conducted and more than 1 year has passed since the previous performance test, you must conduct a performance test no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected source according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2).


(d)(1) You must conduct the performance tests specified in this section at representative (normal) conditions for the process. Representative (normal) conditions means those conditions that:


(i) Represent the range of combined process and control measure conditions under which the facility expects to operate (regardless of the frequency of the conditions); and


(ii) Are likely to most challenge the emissions control measures of the facility with regard to meeting the applicable emission standards, but without creating an unsafe condition.


(2) Operations during startup, shutdown, and malfunction do not constitute representative (normal) operating conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test. You must record the process information that is necessary to document the operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent representative (normal) conditions. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.


(e) In conducting all performance tests, you must use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 63.7(f).


(f) For each phosphate fertilizer process line (*e.g.,* diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), and granular triple superphosphate process line, you must determine compliance with the applicable total fluorides standards specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Compute the emission rate (E) of total fluorides for each run using Equation BB-1:


(2) You must use Method 13A or 13B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the total fluorides concentration (C_i_) and the volumetric flow rate (Q_i_) of the effluent gas at each emission point. The sampling time for each run at each emission point must be at least 60 minutes. The sampling volume for each run at each emission point must be at least 0.85 dscm (30 dscf). If Method 13B is used, the fusion of the filtered material described in Section 7.3.1.2 and the distillation of suitable aliquots of containers 1 and 2, described in section 7.3.3 and 7.3.4 in Method 13 A, may be omitted.


(3) Compute the equivalent P_2_O_5_ feed rate (P) using Equation BB-2:


(i) Determine the mass flow rate (M_p_) of the phosphorus-bearing feed using the measurement system described in § 63.625(a).


(ii) Determine the P_2_O_5_ content (R_p_) of the feed using, as appropriate, the following methods specified in the Book of Methods Used and Adopted By The Association of Florida Phosphate Chemists (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) where applicable:

(g) For each granular triple superphosphate storage building, you must determine compliance with the applicable total fluorides standards specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section.


(1) You must conduct performance tests only when the following quantities of product are being cured or stored in the facility:


(i) Total granular triple superphosphate is at least 10 percent of the building capacity, and


(ii) Fresh granular triple superphosphate is at least six percent of the total amount of granular triple superphosphate, or


(iii) If the provision in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section exceeds production capabilities for fresh granular triple superphosphate, the fresh granular triple superphosphate is equal to at least 5 days maximum production.


(2) Compute the emission rate (E) of total fluorides for each run using Equation BB-3:


(3) You must use Method 13A or 13B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the total fluorides concentration (C_i_) and the volumetric flow rate (Q_i_) of the effluent gas at each emission point. The sampling time for each run at each emission point must be at least 60 minutes. The sampling volume for each run at each emission point must be at least 0.85 dscm (30 dscf). If Method 13B is used, the fusion of the filtered material described in Section 7.3.1.2 and the distillation of suitable aliquots of containers 1 and 2, described in section 7.3.3 and 7.3.4 in Method 13A, may be omitted.
