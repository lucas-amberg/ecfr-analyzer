# § 63.11085   What are my general duties to minimize emissions?

Each owner or operator of an affected source under this subpart must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.


(a) You must, at all times, operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.


(b) You must not allow gasoline to be handled in a manner that would result in vapor releases to the atmosphere for extended periods of time. Measures to be taken include, but are not limited to, the following:


(1) Minimize gasoline spills;


(2) Clean up spills as expeditiously as practicable;


(3) Cover all open gasoline containers and all gasoline storage tank fill-pipes with a gasketed seal when not in use; and


(4) Minimize gasoline sent to open waste collection systems that collect and transport gasoline to reclamation and recycling devices, such as oil/water separators.


(c) You must keep applicable records and submit reports as specified in §§ 63.11094(g) and 63.11095(d) or § 63.11095(e).
