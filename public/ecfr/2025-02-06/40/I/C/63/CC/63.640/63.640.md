(1) If the greatest input to the distillation unit is from a process unit located on the same plant site, then the distillation unit shall be assigned to that process unit. 


(2) If the greatest input to the distillation unit is provided from a process unit that is not located on the same plant site, then the distillation unit shall be assigned to the process unit located at the same plant site that receives the greatest amount of material from the distillation unit. 


(3) If a distillation unit is shared among process units so that there is no single predominant use, as described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section, and at least one of those process units is a petroleum refining process unit subject to this subpart, the distillation unit shall be assigned to the petroleum refining process unit that is subject to this subpart. If more than one petroleum refining process unit is subject to this subpart, the owner or operator may assign the distillation unit to any of the petroleum refining process units subject to this rule. 


(4) If the process unit to which the distillation unit is assigned is a petroleum refining process unit subject to this subpart and the vent stream contains greater than 20 parts per million by volume total organic hazardous air pollutants, then the vent from the distillation unit is considered a miscellaneous process vent (as defined in § 63.641 of this subpart) and is part of the source to which this subpart applies.
