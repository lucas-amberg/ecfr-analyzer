# § 63.652   Emissions averaging provisions.

(a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources who seek to comply with the emission standard in § 63.642(g) by using emissions averaging according to § 63.642(l) rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651. Existing marine tank vessel loading operations located at the Valdez Marine Terminal source may not comply with the standard by using emissions averaging.


(b) The owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.653(d) for all points to be included in an emissions average. The Implementation Plan shall identify all emission points to be included in the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to which the reference control technology (defined in § 63.641) is not applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the average. 


(c) The following emission points can be used to generate emissions averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point: 


(1) Group 2 emission points; 


(2) Group 1 storage vessels, Group 1 wastewater streams, Group 1 gasoline loading racks, Group 1 marine tank vessels, and Group 1 miscellaneous process vents that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section; and 


(3) Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures. Percentages of reduction for pollution prevention measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. 


(i) For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.


(ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had it been applied instead. 


(d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits: 


(1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990, in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990; 


(2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference control technology unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal floating roof meeting only the specifications stated in the reference control technology definition in § 63.641 (i.e., that meets the specifications of § 63.119(b) of subpart G but does not have controlled fittings per § 63.119 (b)(5) and (b)(6) of subpart G) applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent control; 


(3) Emission points on shutdown process units. Process units that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits; 


(4) Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. Group 1 wastewater streams cannot be left undercontrolled or uncontrolled to generate debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms “wastewater” and “wastewater stream” are used to mean process wastewater; and 


(5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average. 


(e) For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall: 


(1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits. 


(2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included. 


(3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section. 


(i) The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points must be made under representative operating conditions. 


(ii) After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used for all debit and credit calculations. 


(4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis. 


(5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.655(g)(8). Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.655(g)(8)(iii).


(f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the following: 


(1) More than 20 individual emission points. Where pollution prevention measures (as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average. For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may include up to 22 emission points. 


(2) [Reserved]


(3) For emission points for which continuous monitors are used, periods of excess emissions as defined in § 63.655(g)(6)(i). For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section. 


(i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point. 


(ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point. 


(iii) The owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section to demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned. 


(g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology, and the emissions allowed for Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows: 


(1) The overall equation for calculating sourcewide debits is: 


(2) Emissions from miscellaneous process vents shall be calculated as follows: 


(i) For purposes of determining miscellaneous process vent stream flow rate, organic HAP concentrations, and temperature, the sampling site shall be after the final product recovery device, if any recovery devices are present; before any control device (for miscellaneous process vents, recovery devices shall not be considered control devices); and before discharge to the atmosphere. Method 1 or 1A of part 60, appendix A shall be used for selection of the sampling site. 


(ii) The following equation shall be used for each miscellaneous process vent i to calculate EPV_iu_:


(A) The values of Q, C_j_, and M_j_ shall be determined during a performance test conducted under representative operating conditions. The values of Q, C_j_, and M_j_ shall be established in the Notification of Compliance Status report and must be updated as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. 


(B) If there is a change in capacity utilization other than a change in monthly operating hours, or if any other change is made to the process or product recovery equipment or operation such that the previously measured values of Q, C_j_, and M_j_ are no longer representative, a new performance test shall be conducted to determine new representative values of Q, C_j_, and M_j_. These new values shall be used to calculate debits and credits from the time of the change forward, and the new values shall be reported in the next Periodic Report. 


(iii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to calculate EPV_iACTUAL_:


(A) If the vent is not controlled by a control device or pollution prevention measure, EPV_iACTUAL_ = EPV_iu_, where EPV_iu_ is calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

For a flare meeting the criteria in § 63.116(a) of subpart G or § 63.670, as applicable, or a boiler or process heater meeting the criteria in § 63.645(d) or § 63.116(b) of subpart G, the percentage of reduction shall be 98 percent. If a noncombustion control device is used, percentage of reduction shall be demonstrated by a performance test at the inlet and outlet of the device, or, if testing is not feasible, by a control design evaluation and documented engineering calculations.


(*2*) For determining debits from miscellaneous process vents, product recovery devices shall not be considered control devices and cannot be assigned a percentage of reduction in calculating EPV_iACTUAL_.

Wastewater samples shall be collected using the sampling procedures specified in Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Where feasible, samples shall be taken from an enclosed pipe prior to the wastewater being exposed to the atmosphere. When sampling from an enclosed pipe is not feasible, a minimum of three representative samples shall be collected in a manner to minimize exposure of the sample to the atmosphere and loss of organic HAP's prior to sampling. The samples collected may be analyzed by either of the following procedures: 


(*1*) A test method or results from a test method that measures organic HAP concentrations in the wastewater, and that has been validated pursuant to section 5.1 or 5.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part may be used; or 


(*2*) Method 305 of appendix A of this part may be used to determine C_im_, the average volatile organic HAP concentration of organic HAP m in wastewater stream i, and then HAP_im_ may be calculated using the following equation: HAP_im_ = C_im_/Fm_m_, where Fm_m_ for organic HAP m is obtained from table 7 of this subpart.

If a higher nominal efficiency has been approved for the treatment process, the owner or operator shall determine EWW1_iACTUAL_ according to paragraph (h)(6)(iii)(B) of this section rather than paragraph (h)(6)(iii)(A) of this section. If PR_im_ is less than the value of FR_m_ given in table 7 of this subpart, emissions averaging shall not be used for this emission point. 


(C) If the Group 1 wastewater stream i is controlled using a treatment process or series of treatment processes with an approved nominal reduction efficiency for an individually speciated hazardous air pollutant that is greater than that specified in table 7 of this subpart, and the vapor control device has an approved nominal efficiency greater than 95 percent, the following equation shall be used:

(1) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission to take credit for use of a control technology that is different in use or design from the reference control technology, and the different control technology will be used in more than three applications at a single plant site, the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) of this section to the Administrator in writing: 


(i) Emission stream characteristics of each emission point to which the control technology is or will be applied including the kind of emission point, flow, organic HAP concentration, and all other stream characteristics necessary to design the control technology or determine its performance; 


(ii) Description of the control technology including design specifications; 


(iii) Documentation demonstrating to the Administrator's satisfaction the control efficiency of the control technology. This may include performance test data collected using an appropriate EPA method or any other method validated according to Method 301 of appendix A of this part. If it is infeasible to obtain test data, documentation may include a design evaluation and calculations. The engineering basis of the calculation procedures and all inputs and assumptions made in the calculations shall be documented; and 


(iv) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to ensure that the control technology will be operated in conformance with its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or parameters). 


(2) The Administrator shall determine within 120 calendar days whether an application presents sufficient information to determine nominal efficiency. The Administrator reserves the right to request specific data in addition to the items listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. 


(3) The Administrator shall determine within 120 calendar days of the submittal of sufficient data whether a control technology shall have a nominal efficiency and the level of that nominal efficiency. If, in the Administrator's judgment, the control technology achieves a level of emission reduction greater than the reference control technology for a particular kind of emission point, the Administrator will publish a _Federal Register_ notice establishing a nominal efficiency for the control technology. 


(4) The Administrator may grant conditional permission to take emission credits for use of the control technology on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the specified nominal efficiency. 


(5) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission to take credit for use of a control technology that is different in use or design from the reference control technology and the different control technology will be used in no more than three applications at a single plant site, the information listed in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) of this section can be submitted to the permitting authority for the source for approval instead of the Administrator. 


(i) In these instances, use and conditions for use of the control technology can be approved by the permitting authority. The permitting authority shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4) of this section except that, in these instances, a _Federal Register_ notice is not required to establish the nominal efficiency for the different technology. 


(ii) If, in reviewing the submittal, the permitting authority believes the control technology has broad applicability for use by other sources, the permitting authority shall submit the information provided in the application to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. The Administrator shall review the technology for broad applicability and may publish a _Federal Register_ notice; however, this review shall not affect the permitting authority's approval of the nominal efficiency of the control technology for the specific application. 


(6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an emission point, the Administrator or permitting authority determines the control technology is not different in use or design from the reference control technology, the Administrator or permitting authority shall deny the application. 


(j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the efficiency (percentage of reduction) of pollution prevention measures: 


(1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that meets the criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section. 


(i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control of emissions while the same product is produced. 


(ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: Substitution of feedstocks that reduce HAP emissions, alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment, equipment modifications; housekeeping measures, and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention. 


(2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990 can be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. 


(i) For pollution prevention measures, the percentage of reduction used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(4) of this section is the difference in percentage between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods. 


(ii) The following equation shall be used to calculate the percentage of reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.


(A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, E_B_, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the equations and procedures in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4), and (g)(5) of this section for miscellaneous process vents, storage vessels, gasoline loading racks, and marine tank vessels. 


(B) For wastewater, E_B_ shall be calculated as follows: 


(C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to July 14, 1994, records may be used to determine E_B_. 


(D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, E_pp_, may be determined during a performance test or by a design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio can be used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records. 


(E) For wastewater, E_pp_ shall be calculated using the following equation:


(iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percentage of reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented. 


(iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percentage of reduction in emissions for each emission point must be calculated. 


(v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(6) of this section used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percentage of reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of a source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section. 


(k) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the average will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the State or local permitting authority, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable.


(1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made to the satisfaction of the State or local permitting authority. 


(i) The State or local permitting authority may require owners and operators to use specific methodologies and procedures for making a hazard or risk determination. 


(ii) The demonstration and approval of hazard or risk equivalency may be made according to any guidance that the EPA makes available for use. 


(2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in their Implementation Plan. 


(3) An emissions averaging plan that does not demonstrate an equivalent or lower hazard or risk to the satisfaction of the State or local permitting authority shall not be approved. The State or local permitting authority may require such adjustments to the emissions averaging plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable.


(4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration shall: 


(i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment; 


(ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and 


(iii) Meet any requirements set by the State or local permitting authority for such demonstrations. 


(l) For periods of excess emissions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section. 


(1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of excess emissions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.655(g)(6).


(2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures for demonstrating compliance that are acceptable. 


(3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the period of excess emissions and the other type of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. 


(4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits upon review of the information provided.
