# § 63.671   Requirements for flare monitoring systems.

(a) *Operation of CPMS*. For each CPMS installed to comply with applicable provisions in § 63.670, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain the CPMS as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.


(1) Except for CPMS installed for pilot flame monitoring, all monitoring equipment must meet the applicable minimum accuracy, calibration and quality control requirements specified in table 13 of this subpart.


(2) The owner or operator shall ensure the readout (that portion of the CPMS that provides a visual display or record) or other indication of the monitored operating parameter from any CPMS required for compliance is readily accessible onsite for operational control or inspection by the operator of the source.


(3) All CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.


(4) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), the owner or operator shall operate all CPMS and collect data continuously at all times when regulated emissions are routed to the flare.


(5) The owner or operator shall operate, maintain, and calibrate each CPMS according to the CPMS monitoring plan specified in paragraph (b) of this section.


(6) For each CPMS except for CPMS installed for pilot flame monitoring, the owner or operator shall comply with the out-of-control procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(7) The owner or operator shall reduce data from a CPMS as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(8) The CPMS must be capable of measuring the appropriate parameter over the range of values expected for that measurement location. The data recording system associated with each CPMS must have a resolution that is equal to or better than the required system accuracy.


(b) *CPMS monitoring plan.* The owner or operator shall develop and implement a CPMS quality control program documented in a CPMS monitoring plan that covers each flare subject to the provisions in § 63.670 and each CPMS installed to comply with applicable provisions in § 63.670. The owner or operator shall have the CPMS monitoring plan readily available on-site at all times and shall submit a copy of the CPMS monitoring plan to the Administrator upon request by the Administrator. The CPMS monitoring plan must contain the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Identification of the specific flare being monitored and the flare type (air-assisted only, steam-assisted only, air- and steam-assisted, pressure-assisted, or non-assisted).


(2) Identification of the parameter to be monitored by the CPMS and the expected parameter range, including worst case and normal operation.


(3) Description of the monitoring equipment, including the information specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.


(i) Manufacturer and model number for all monitoring equipment components installed to comply with applicable provisions in § 63.670.

(1) A CPMS is out-of-control if the zero (low-level), mid-level (if applicable) or high-level calibration drift exceeds two times the accuracy requirement of table 13 of this subpart.


(2) When the CPMS is out of control, the owner or operator shall take the necessary corrective action and repeat all necessary tests that indicate the system is out of control. The owner or operator shall take corrective action and conduct retesting until the performance requirements are below the applicable limits. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour a performance check (*e.g.*, calibration drift) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established in this section is conducted. The end of the out-of-control period is the hour following the completion of corrective action and successful demonstration that the system is within the allowable limits.
