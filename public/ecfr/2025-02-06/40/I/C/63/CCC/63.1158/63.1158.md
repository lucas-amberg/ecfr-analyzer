# § 63.1158   Emission standards for new or reconstructed sources.

(a) *Pickling lines*—(1) *Continuous pickling lines.* No owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected continuous pickling line at a steel pickling facility shall cause or allow to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected pickling line:


(i) Any gases that contain HCl in a concentration in excess of 6 ppmv; or


(ii) HCl at a mass emission rate that corresponds to a collection efficiency of less than 99 percent.


(2) *Batch pickling lines.* No owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected batch pickling line at a steel pickling facility shall cause or allow to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected pickling line:


(i) Any gases that contain HCl in a concentration in excess of 18 ppmv; or


(ii) HCl at a mass emission rate that corresponds to a collection efficiency of less than 97 percent.


(b) *Hydrochloric acid regeneration plants.* (1) No owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected plant shall cause or allow to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected plant any gases that contain HCl in a concentration greater than 12 ppmv.


(2) In addition to the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, no owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected plant shall cause or allow to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected plant any gases that contain Cl_2_ in a concentration in excess of 6 ppmv.
