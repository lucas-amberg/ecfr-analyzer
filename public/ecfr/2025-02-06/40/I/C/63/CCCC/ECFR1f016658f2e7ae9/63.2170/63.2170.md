# ยง 63.2170   How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?

(a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and ยง 63.2163 or ยง 63.2164.


(b) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance, you must collect data using the CEMS or brew ethanol monitor, as applicable, at all times during each batch monitoring period.


(c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels, or to fulfill a data collection requirement. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control system.
