# ยง 63.2171   How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?

(a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limitation in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified in Table 4 to this subpart and the applicable procedures of this section.


(b) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the 98-Percent Option, you must calculate the percentage of within-concentration batches (as defined in ยง 63.2192) for each 12-month calculation period by following the procedures in this paragraph and paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. At the end of each calendar month, you must determine the percentage of batches that were in compliance with the applicable maximum concentration in the 12-month calculation period. The total number of batches in the calculation period is the sum of the numbers of batches of each fermentation stage for which emission limitations apply. To determine which batches are in the 12-month calculation period, you must include those batches for which the batch monitoring period ended at or after midnight on the first day of the period and exclude those batches for which the batch monitoring period did not end before midnight on the last day of the period.


(c) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the Average Option, you must follow the procedures in this paragraph and paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. At the end of each calendar month, you must determine the average VOC concentration from all batches in each fermentation stage in a 12-month calculation period. To determine which batches are in a 12-month calculation period, you must include those batches for which the batch monitoring period ended at or after midnight on the first day of the period and exclude those batches for which the batch monitoring period did not end before midnight on the last day of the period.


(d) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the Batch Option, you must determine the average VOC concentration in the fermenter exhaust for each batch of each fermentation stage in a semiannual reporting period (*i.e.,* January 1 through June 30 or July 1 through December 31). To determine which batches are in the semiannual reporting period, you must include those batches for which the batch monitoring period ended at or after midnight on the first day of the period and exclude those batches for which the batch monitoring period did not end before midnight on the last day of the period.


(e) To demonstrate compliance with an emission limitation using a 12-month calculation period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) The first 12-month calculation period begins on the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in ยง 63.2133 and ends on the last day of the month that includes the date 1 year after your compliance date, unless the compliance date for your affected source is the first day of the month, in which case the first 12-month calculation period ends on the last day of the month that is 11 calendar months after the compliance date.


(2) The second 12-month calculation period and each subsequent 12-month calculation period begins on the first day of the month following the first full month of the previous 12-month calculation period and ends on the last day of the month 11 calendar months later.
