# § 63.2163   If I monitor fermenter exhaust, what are my monitoring installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

(a) You must install and certify a CEMS that generates a single combined response value for VOC concentration (VOC CEMS) according to the procedures and requirements in Performance Specification 8—Performance Specifications for Volatile Organic Compound Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.


(b) You must operate and maintain your VOC CEMS according to the procedures and requirements in Procedure 1—Quality Assurance Requirements for Gas Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, except with regard to provisions concerning relative accuracy test audit (RATA), cylinder gas audit (CGA), and relative accuracy audit (RAA) frequencies; out of control period definition; and CEMS data status during out of control periods; which are instead specified in this paragraph for frequencies; and § 63.8(c)(7) for the definition of and status of CEMS data during out of control periods.


(1) You must conduct a RATA at least once every 12 calendar quarters, in accordance with sections 8 and 11, as applicable, of Performance Specification 8.


(2) You must conduct a CGA or RAA in the calendar quarters during which a RATA is not conducted, but in no more than 11 quarters in succession.


(3) As necessary, rather than relying on citation 2 of Procedure 1 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 60, you must rely on EPA/600/R-12/531 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).


(4) Your affected source must meet the criteria of Performance Specification 8, section 13.2.


(c) You must use Method 25A in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter as the Reference Method.


(d) You must calibrate your VOC CEMS with propane.


(e) You must set your VOC CEMS span at less than 5 times the relevant VOC emission limitation given in Table 1 of this subpart. Note that the EPA considers 1.5 to 2.5 times the relevant VOC emission limitation to be the optimum range, in general.


(f) You must complete the performance evaluation and submit the performance evaluation report before the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.2133.


(g) You must monitor VOC concentration in fermenter exhaust at any point prior to dilution of the exhaust stream.


(h) You must collect data using the VOC CEMS at all times during each batch monitoring period, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance.


(i) For each CEMS, you must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.


(j) You must check the zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts for each CEMS in accordance with the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. You must adjust the zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts, at a minimum, whenever the zero (low-level) drift exceeds 2 times the limits of the applicable Performance Specification. You must perform the calibration drift checks at least once daily except under the conditions of paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) If a 24-hour calibration drift check for your CEMS is performed immediately prior to, or at the start of, a batch monitoring period of a duration exceeding 24 hours, then you are not required to perform 24-hour-interval calibration drift checks during that batch monitoring period.


(2) If the 24-hour calibration drift exceeds 2.5 percent of the span value in fewer than 5 percent of the checks over a 1-month period, and the 24-hour calibration drift never exceeds 7.5 percent of the span value, then you may reduce the frequency of calibration drift checks to at least weekly (once every 7 days).


(3) If, during two consecutive weekly checks, the weekly calibration drift exceeds 5 percent of the span value, then you must resume a frequency of at least 24-hour interval calibration checks until the 24-hour calibration checks meet the test of paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
