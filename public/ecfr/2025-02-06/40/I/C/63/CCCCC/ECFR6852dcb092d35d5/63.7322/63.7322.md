# § 63.7322   What test methods and other procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits?

(a) You must conduct each performance test that applies to your affected source based on representative performance (*i.e.,* performance based on the entire range of normal operating conditions) of the affected source for the period being tested, according to the requirements in paragraph (b) through (g) of this section. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You shall not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent the entire range of normal operation, including operational conditions for maximum emission if such emissions are not expected during maximum production. You shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.


(b) To determine compliance with the emission limit for particulate matter from a control device applied to pushing emissions where a cokeside shed is the capture system, battery stack, HNR HRSG main stack, and HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack, follow the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. To determine compliance with a process-weighted mass rate of particulate matter (lb/ton of coke) from a control device applied to pushing emissions where a cokeside shed is not used, follow the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Determine the concentration of particulate matter according to the following test methods in appendices A-1 through A-3 to 40 CFR part 60.


(i) Method 1 to select sampling port locations and the number of traverse points. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.


(ii) Method 2, 2F, or 2G to determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.


(iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may also use as an alternative to Method 3B, the manual method (but not instrumental procedures) for measuring the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide content of exhaust gas, ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).


(iv) Method 4 to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.


(v) Method 5 or 5D, as applicable, to determine the concentration of filterable particulate matter in the stack gas.


(2) Collect a minimum sample volume of 30 dry standard cubic feet of gas during each test run. Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test. During each particulate matter test run to meet the emission limitations in § 63.7290, sample only during periods of actual pushing when the capture system fan and control device are engaged. For capture systems and control devices applied to pushing emissions each run must start at the beginning of a push and finish at the end of a push (*i.e.,* sample for an integral number of pushes).


(3) Determine the total combined weight in tons of coke pushed during the duration of each test run according to the procedures in your source test plan for calculating coke yield from the quantity of coal charged to an individual oven.


(4) Compute the process-weighted mass emissions (E_p, PM_) for each test run using equation 1 to this paragraph (b)(4) as follows:


(c) To determine compliance with the emission limit for mercury from a control device applied to pushing emissions where a cokeside shed is the capture system, battery stack, HNR HRSG main stack, and HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack, follow the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. To determine compliance with a process-weighted mass rate of mercury (lb/ton of coke) from a control device applied to pushing emissions and battery stack, follow the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Determine the concentration of mercury according to the following test methods.


(i) The methods specified in sections (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(ii) Method 29 in appendix A-8 to 40 CFR part 60, to determine the concentration of mercury in the stack gas. The voluntary consensus standard ASTM D6784-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 29 (portion for mercury only) as a method for measuring mercury, note: applies to concentrations approximately 0.5—100 µg/Nm3.


(2) Collect a minimum sample volume of 70 dry standard cubic feet of gas during each mercury test run. Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test. During each mercury test run to meet the emission limitations in § 63.7290, sample only during periods of actual pushing when the capture system fan and control device are engaged. For capture systems and control devices applied to pushing emissions each run must start at the beginning of a push and finish at the end of a push (*i.e.,* sample for an integral number of pushes).


(3) Determine the total combined weight in tons of coke pushed during the duration of each test run according to the procedures in your source test plan for calculating coke yield from the quantity of coal charged to an individual oven.

When using ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020), the following conditions must be met:


(A) The test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020), Annexes A1 through A8 are mandatory; and

(C) In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, % R must be greater than or equal to 70% and less than or equal to 130%. If the % R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (*i.e.,* the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The % R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated % R value for that compound by using equation 3 to this paragraph (d)((1)(ii)(C):

For capture systems and control devices applied to pushing emissions each run must start at the beginning of a push and finish at the end of a push (*i.e.,* sample for an integral number of pushes).
