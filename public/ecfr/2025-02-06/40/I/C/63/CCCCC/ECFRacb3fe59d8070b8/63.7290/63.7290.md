# ยง 63.7290   What emission limitations must I meet for capture systems and control devices applied to pushing emissions?

(a) You must not discharge to the atmosphere emissions of particulate matter from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a new or existing coke oven battery that exceed the applicable limit in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:


(1) 0.01 grain per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf) if a cokeside shed is used to capture emissions;


(2) 0.02 pound per ton (lb/ton) of coke if a moveable hood vented to a stationary control device is used to capture emissions;


(3) If a mobile scrubber car that does not capture emissions during travel is used:


(i) 0.03 lb/ton of coke for a control device applied to pushing emissions from a short battery, or


(ii) 0.01 lb/ton of coke for a control device applied to pushing emissions from a tall battery; and


(4) 0.04 lb/ton of coke if a mobile control device that captures emissions during travel is used.


(b) You must not discharge to the atmosphere emissions of mercury from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a new coke oven battery that exceeds 5.1E-07 lb/ton coke or existing coke oven battery that exceeds 8.9E-07 lb/ton coke.


(c) You must not discharge to the atmosphere emissions of total acid gases from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a new coke oven battery that exceeds 5.3E-04 lb/ton coke or existing coke oven battery that exceeds 0.013 lb/ton coke.


(d) You must not discharge to the atmosphere emissions of hydrogen cyanide from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a new coke oven battery that exceeds 3.8E-05 lb/ton coke or existing coke oven battery that exceeds 0.0015 lb/ton coke.


(e) You must not discharge to the atmosphere emissions of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a new coke oven battery that exceeds 1.4E-05 lb/ton coke or existing coke oven battery that exceeds 4.0E-04 lb/ton coke.


(f) You must meet each operating limit in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section that applies to you for a new or existing coke oven battery.


(1) For each venturi scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you must maintain the daily average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate at or above the minimum levels established during the initial performance test.


(2) For each hot water scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you must maintain the daily average water pressure and water temperature at or above the minimum levels established during the initial performance test.


(3) For each capture system applied to pushing emissions, you must maintain the daily average volumetric flow rate at the inlet of the control device at or above the minimum level established during the initial performance test; or


(i) For each capture system that uses an electric motor to drive the fan, you must maintain the daily average fan motor amperes at or above the minimum level established during the initial performance test; and


(ii) For each capture system that does not use a fan driven by an electric motor, you must maintain the daily average static pressure at the inlet to the control device at an equal or greater vacuum than the level established during the initial performance test or maintain the daily average fan revolutions per minute (RPM) at or above the minimum level established during the initial performance test.


(4) For each multicyclone, you must maintain the daily average pressure drop at or below the minimum level established during the initial performance test.
