# ยง 63.7298   What emission limitations must I meet for HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stacks?

You must not discharge to the atmosphere any emissions from any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at a new or existing HNR coke oven battery that exhibit emissions greater than the applicable limits in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.


(a) Emissions of particulate matter from any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at a new HNR coke oven battery that exceeds 0.022 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen or any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at an existing HNR coke battery that exceeds 0.032 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen.


(b) Emissions of mercury from any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at a new HNR coke oven battery that exceeds 8.6E-06 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen or any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at an existing HNR coke oven battery that exceeds 1.2E-05 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen.


(c) Emissions of total acid gases from any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at a new HNR coke oven battery that exceeds 0.12 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen or any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at an existing HNR coke battery that exceeds 0.095 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen.


(d) Emissions of total PAHs from any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at a new or existing HNR coke oven battery that exceeds 2.7E-06 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen.


(e) Emissions of formaldehyde from any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at a new HNR coke oven battery that exceeds 1.8E-05 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen or any HNR HRSG bypass/waste heat stack at an existing HNR coke oven battery that exceeds 0.0012 gr/dscf at 10 percent oxygen.
