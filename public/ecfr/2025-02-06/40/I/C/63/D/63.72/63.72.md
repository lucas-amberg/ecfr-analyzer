# ยง 63.72   General provisions for compliance extensions.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a permitting authority acting pursuant to a permitting program approved under Title V of the Act shall by permit allow an existing source to meet an alternative emission limitation in lieu of an emission limitation promulgated under section 112(d) of the Act for a period of 6 years from the compliance date of the otherwise applicable standard provided the source owner or operator demonstrates: 


(1) According to the requirements of ยง 63.74 that the source has achieved a reduction of 90 percent (95 percent or more in the case of hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) in emissions of: 


(i) Total hazardous air pollutants from the source;


(ii) Total hazardous air pollutants from the source as adjusted for high-risk pollutant weighting factors, if applicable. 


(2) That such reduction was achieved before proposal of an applicable standard or, for sources eligible to qualify for an alternative emission limitation as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, before January 1, 1994. 


(b) A source granted an alternative emission limitation shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act immediately upon expiration of the six year compliance extension period specified in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) An existing source that achieves the reduction specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section after proposal of an applicable section 112(d) standard but before January 1, 1994, may qualify for an alternative emission limitation under paragraph (a) of this section if the source makes an enforceable commitment, prior to proposal of the applicable standard, to achieve such reduction. The enforceable commitment shall be made according to the procedures and requirements of ยง 63.75.


(d) For each permit issued to a source under paragraph (a) of this section, there shall be established as part of the permit an enforceable alternative emission limitation for hazardous air pollutants reflecting the reduction which qualified the source for the alternative emission limitation.


(e) An alternative emission limitation shall not be available with respect to standards or requirements promulgated to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, and the Administrator will, for the purpose of determining whether a standard under section 112(f) of the Act is necessary, review emissions from sources granted an alternative emission limitation under this subpart at the same time that other sources in the category or subcategory are reviewed. 


(f) Nothing in this subpart shall preclude a State from requiring hazardous air pollutant reductions in excess of 90 percent (95 percent in the case of particulate hazardous air pollutants) as a condition of such State granting an alternative emission limitation authorized in paragraph (a) of this section.
