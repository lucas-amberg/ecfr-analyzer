3 is used for treatment of an off-site material by a waste stabilization process as defined in § 63.681 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall control air emissions from the container at those times during the process when the off-site material in the container is exposed to the atmosphere in accordance with the standards for Container Level 3 controls as specified in 40 CFR part 63, subpart PP—National Emission Standards for Containers.
