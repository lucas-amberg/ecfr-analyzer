# § 63.1182   How do I comply with the carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen chloride standards for existing, new, and reconstructed cupolas?

To comply with the carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen chloride standards, you must meet the following:


(a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device that continuously measures the operating temperature in the firebox of each thermal incinerator.


(b) Conduct a performance test as specified in § 63.1188 that shows compliance with the carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen chloride emissions limits specified in Table 2 to this subpart, while the device for measuring incinerator operating temperature is installed, operational, and properly calibrated. Establish the average operating temperature based on the performance test as specified in § 63.1185(a).


(c) Following the performance test, measure and record the average operating temperature of the incinerator as specified in § 63.1185(b) of this subpart.


(d) Maintain the operating temperature of the incinerator so that the average operating temperature for each three-hour block period never falls below the average temperature established during the performance test.


(e) Operate and maintain the incinerator as specified in your operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan required by § 63.1187 of this subpart.
