# § 63.1196   What definitions should I be aware of?

Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in § 63.2 of the general provisions in subpart A of this part, and in this section as follows:


*Bag leak detection system* means a monitoring device for a fabric filter that identifies an increase in particulate matter emissions resulting from a broken filter bag or other malfunction and sounds an alarm.


*Bonded product* means mineral wool to which a hazardous air pollutant-based binder (containing such hazardous air pollutants as phenol or formaldehyde) has been applied.


*Closed-top cupola* means a cupola that operates as a closed (process) system and has a restricted air flow rate.


*CO* means, for the purposes of this subpart, emissions of carbon monoxide that serve as a surrogate for emissions of carbonyl sulfide, a compound included on the list of hazardous air pollutants in section 112 of the Act.


*Combined collection/curing operations* means the combination of fiber collection operations and curing ovens used to make bonded products.


*Cupola* means a large, water-cooled metal vessel to which is charged a mixture of fuel, rock and/or slag, and additives. As the fuel is burned, the charged mixture is heated to a molten state for later processing to form mineral wool.


*Curing oven* means a chamber in which heat is used to thermoset a binder on the mineral wool fiber used to make bonded products.


*Fabric filter* means an air pollution control device used to capture particulate matter by filtering gas streams through fabric bags. It also is known as a baghouse.


*Formaldehyde* means, for the purposes of this subpart, emissions of formaldehyde that, in addition to being a HAP itself, serve as a surrogate for organic compounds included on the list of hazardous air pollutants in section 112 of the Act, including but not limited to phenol.


*Hazardous air pollutant* means any air pollutant listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.


*I* means the owner or operator of a mineral wool production facility.


*Incinerator* means an enclosed air pollution control device that uses controlled flame combustion to convert combustible materials to noncombustible gases. For the purposes of this subpart, the term “incinerator” means “regenerative thermal oxidizer”.


*Melt* means raw materials, excluding coke, that are charged into the cupola, heated to a molten state, and discharged to the fiber forming and collection process.


*Melt rate* means the mass of molten material discharged from a single cupola over a specified time period.


*Mineral wool* means a fibrous glassy substance made from natural rock (such as basalt), blast furnace slag or other slag, or a mixture of rock and slag. It may be used as a thermal or acoustical insulation material or in the making of other products to provide structural strength, sound absorbency, fire resistance, or other required properties.


*New Source* means any affected source that commences construction or reconstruction after May 8, 1997 for purposes of determining the applicability of the emissions limits in Rows 1-4 of Table 2. For all other emission limits new source means any affected source that commences construction or reconstruction after November 25, 2011.


*Open-top cupola* means a cupola that is open to the outside air and operates with an air flow rate that is unrestricted and at low pressure.


*PM* means, for the purposes of this subpart, emissions of particulate matter that serve as a surrogate for metals (in particulate or volatile form) on the list of hazardous air pollutants in section 112 of the Act, including but not limited to: antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, nickel, and selenium.


*Slag* means the by-product materials separated from metals during smelting and refining of raw ore.


*You* means the owner or operator of a mineral wool production facility.
