# § 63.1186   How may I change the compliance levels of monitored parameters?

You may change control device and process operating parameter levels established during performance tests and used to monitor compliance if you do the following:


(a) You must notify the Administrator of your desire to expand the range of a control device or process operating parameter level.


(b) Upon approval from the Administrator, you must conduct additional performance tests at the proposed new control device or process operating parameter levels.
