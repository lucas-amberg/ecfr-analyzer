(a) You must keep the records listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) A copy of each notification and report that you submitted to comply with this subpart, including all documentation supporting any Initial Notification or Notification of Compliance Status that you submitted, according to the requirements in § 63.10(b)(2)(xiv).


(2) Before August 13, 2021, the records in § 63.6(e)(3)(iii) through (v) related to startup, shutdown, and malfunction for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction before September 6, 2019. After August 13, 2020 for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after September 6, 2019, and on and after August 13, 2021 for all other affected sources, the records related to startup and shutdown, failures to meet the standard, and actions taken to minimize emissions, specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) Record the date, time, and duration of each startup and/or shutdown period, including the periods when the affected source was subject to the standard applicable to startup and shutdown.


(ii) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures; for each failure, record the date, time, cause and duration of each failure.


(iii) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, and the following information:


(A) For any failure to meet a compliance option in § 63.2240, including the compliance options in Table 1A or 1B to this subpart or the emissions averaging compliance option, record an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.


(B) For each failure to meet an operating requirement in Table 2 to this subpart or work practice requirement in Table 3 to this subpart, maintain sufficient information to estimate the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over the emission limit. This information must be sufficient to provide a reliable emissions estimate if requested by the Administrator.


(iv) Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.2250(g), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.


(3) Documentation of your approved routine control device maintenance exemption, if you request such an exemption under § 63.2251.


(4) Records of performance tests and performance evaluations as required in § 63.10(b)(2)(viii).


(b) You must keep the records required in Tables 7 and 8 to this subpart to show continuous compliance with each compliance option, operating requirement, and work practice requirement that applies to you.


(c) For each CEMS, you must keep the following records.

(2) Previous (*i.e.,* superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan, with the program of corrective action included in the plan required under § 63.8(d)(2).


(3) Request for alternatives to relative accuracy testing for CEMS as required in § 63.8(f)(6)(i).


(4) Records of the date and time that each deviation started and stopped, and whether the deviation occurred during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction or during another period.


(d) If you comply with the emissions averaging compliance option in § 63.2240(c), you must keep records of all information required to calculate emission debits and credits.


(e) If you operate a catalytic oxidizer, you must keep records of annual catalyst activity checks and subsequent corrective actions. 


(f) You must keep the written CMS quality control procedures required by § 63.8(d)(2) on record for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this subpart, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If the performance evaluation plan is revised, you must keep previous (*i.e.,* superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. The program of corrective action should be included in the plan required under § 63.8(d)(2).
