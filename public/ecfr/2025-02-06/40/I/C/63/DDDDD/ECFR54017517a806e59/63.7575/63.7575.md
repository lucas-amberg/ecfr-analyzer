An increase in the cost or unit price of natural gas due to normal market fluctuations not during periods of supplier delivery restriction does not constitute a period of natural gas curtailment or supply interruption. On-site gaseous fuel system emergencies or equipment failures qualify as periods of supply interruption when the emergency or failure is beyond the control of the facility.


*Pile burner* means a boiler design incorporating a design where the anticipated biomass fuel has a high relative moisture content. Grates serve to support the fuel, and underfire air flowing up through the grates provides oxygen for combustion, cools the grates, promotes turbulence in the fuel bed, and fires the fuel.

(1) For a boiler that produces steam for process or heating only (no power generation), the energy content in terms of MMBtu of the boiler steam output,


(2) For a boiler that cogenerates process steam and electricity (also known as combined heat and power), the total energy output, which is the sum of the energy content of the steam exiting the turbine and sent to process in MMBtu and the energy of the electricity generated converted to MMBtu at a rate of 10,000 Btu per kilowatt-hour generated (10 MMBtu per megawatt-hour), and


(3) For a boiler that generates only electricity, the alternate output-based emission limits would be the appropriate emission limit from Table 1, 2, 14, or 15 to this subpart in units of pounds per million Btu heat input (lb per MWh).


(4) For a boiler that performs multiple functions and produces steam to be used for any combination of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this definition that includes electricity generation of paragraph (3) of this definition, the total energy output, in terms of MMBtu of steam output, is the sum of the energy content of steam sent directly to the process and/or used for heating (S_1_), the energy content of turbine steam sent to process plus energy in electricity according to paragraph (2) of this definition (S_2_), and the energy content of electricity generated by a electricity only turbine as paragraph (3) of this definition (MW_3_) and would be calculated using Equation 1 to this definition. In the case of boilers supplying steam to one or more common headers, S_1_, S_2_, and MW_(3)_ for each boiler would be calculated based on its (steam energy) contribution (fraction of total steam energy) to the common header.

The types of standards that are not considered VCS are standards developed by: The United States, *e.g.,* California (CARB) and Texas (TCEQ); industry groups, such as American Petroleum Institute (API), Gas Processors Association (GPA), and Gas Research Institute (GRI); and other branches of the U.S. government, *e.g.,* Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Transportation (DOT). This does not preclude EPA from using standards developed by groups that are not VCS bodies within their rule. When this occurs, EPA has done searches and reviews for VCS equivalent to these non-EPA methods.


*Waste heat boiler* means a device that recovers normally unused energy (i.e., hot exhaust gas) and converts it to usable heat. Waste heat boilers are also referred to as heat recovery steam generators. Waste heat boilers are heat exchangers generating steam from incoming hot exhaust gas from an industrial (e.g., thermal oxidizer, kiln, furnace) or power (e.g., combustion turbine, engine) equipment. Duct burners are sometimes used to increase the temperature of the incoming hot exhaust gas.


*Waste heat process heater* means an enclosed device that recovers normally unused energy (i.e., hot exhaust gas) and converts it to usable heat. Waste heat process heaters are also referred to as recuperative process heaters. This definition includes both fired and unfired waste heat process heaters.


*Wet scrubber* means any add-on air pollution control device that mixes an aqueous stream or slurry with the exhaust gases from a boiler or process heater to control emissions of particulate matter or to absorb and neutralize acid gases, such as hydrogen chloride. A wet scrubber creates an aqueous stream or slurry as a byproduct of the emissions control process.


*Work practice standard* means any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated pursuant to section 112(h) of the Clean Air Act.
