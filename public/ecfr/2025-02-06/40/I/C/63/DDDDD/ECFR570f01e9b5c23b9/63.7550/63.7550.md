# § 63.7550   What reports must I submit and when?

(a) You must submit each report in Table 9 to this subpart that applies to you.


(b) Unless the EPA Administrator has approved a different schedule for submission of reports under § 63.10(a), you must submit each report, according to paragraph (h) of this section, by the date in Table 9 to this subpart and according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. For units that are subject only to a requirement to conduct subsequent annual, biennial, or 5-year tune-up according to § 63.7540(a)(10), (11), or (12), respectively, and not subject to emission limits or Table 4 operating limits, you may submit only an annual, biennial, or 5-year compliance report, as applicable, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, instead of a semi-annual compliance report.


(1) The first semi-annual compliance report must cover the period beginning on the compliance date that is specified for each boiler or process heater in § 63.7495 and ending on June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the first date that occurs at least 180 days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.7495. If submitting an annual, biennial, or 5-year compliance report, the first compliance report must cover the period beginning on the compliance date that is specified for each boiler or process heater in § 63.7495 and ending on December 31 within 1, 2, or 5 years, as applicable, after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.7495.


(2) The first semi-annual compliance report must be postmarked or submitted no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the first calendar half after the compliance date that is specified for each boiler or process heater in § 63.7495. The first annual, biennial, or 5-year compliance report must be postmarked or submitted no later than January 31.


(3) Each subsequent semi-annual compliance report must cover the semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31. Annual, biennial, and 5-year compliance reports must cover the applicable 1-, 2-, or 5-year periods from January 1 to December 31.


(4) Each subsequent semi-annual compliance report must be postmarked or submitted no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period. Annual, biennial, and 5-year compliance reports must be postmarked or submitted no later than January 31.


(5) For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to part 70 or part 71 of this chapter, and if the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established in the permit instead of according to the dates in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(c) A compliance report must contain the following information depending on how the facility chooses to comply with the limits set in this rule.


(1) If the facility is subject to the requirements of a tune up you must submit a compliance report with the information in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, (xiv) and (xvii) of this section, and paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section for limited-use boiler or process heater.
