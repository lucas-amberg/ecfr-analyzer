# § 63.7500   What emission limitations, work practice standards, and operating limits must I meet?

(a) You must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. You must meet these requirements at all times the affected unit is operating, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.


(1) You must meet each emission limit and work practice standard in Tables 1 through 3 and 11 through 15 to this subpart that applies to your boiler or process heater, for each boiler or process heater at your source, except as provided under § 63.7522. The output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per million Btu of steam output, in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart are an alternative applicable only to boilers and process heaters that generate either steam, cogenerate steam with electricity, or both. The output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per megawatt-hour, in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart are an alternative applicable only to boilers that generate only electricity. Boilers that perform multiple functions (cogeneration and electricity generation) or supply steam to common headers would calculate a total steam energy output using Equation 1 of § 63.7575 to demonstrate compliance with the output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per million Btu of steam output, in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. If you operate a new boiler or process heater, you can choose to comply with alternative limits as discussed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, but on or after October 6, 2025, you must comply with the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart. If you operate an existing boiler or process heater, you can choose to comply with alternative limits as discussed in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, but on or after October 6, 2025 you must comply with the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart.


(i) If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction after June 4, 2010, and before May 20, 2011, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 11 or 14 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.


(ii) If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction on or after May 20, 2011, and before December 23, 2011, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 12 or 14 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.


(iii) If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction on or after December 23, 2011, and before April 1, 2013, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 13 or 14 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.


(iv) If you operate a new boiler or process heater, you must comply with either the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart or the emission limits in Table 14 to this subpart until you must comply with the emission limits in Table 1.


(v) If you operate an existing boiler or process heater, you must comply with either the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart or the emission limits in Table 15 to this subpart until you must comply with the emission limits in Table 2.








(2) You must meet each operating limit in Table 4 to this subpart that applies to your boiler or process heater. If you use a control device or combination of control devices not covered in Table 4 to this subpart, or you wish to establish and monitor an alternative operating limit or an alternative monitoring parameter, you must apply to the EPA Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).


(3) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source (as defined in § 63.7490), including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.


(b) As provided in § 63.6(g), EPA may approve use of an alternative to the work practice standards in this section.


(c) Limited-use boilers and process heaters must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540. They are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 or Tables 11 through 15 to this subpart, the annual tune-up, or the energy assessment requirements in Table 3 to this subpart, or the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart.




(d) Boilers and process heaters with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour in the units designed to burn gas 2 (other) fuels subcategory or units designed to burn light liquid fuels subcategory must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540.


(e) Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity greater than 5 million Btu per hour and less than 10 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 2 years as specified in § 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 or Tables 11 through 15 to this subpart, or the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart.






(f) These standards apply at all times the affected unit is operating, except during periods of startup and shutdown during which time you must comply only with items 5 and 6 of Table 3 to this subpart.
