# § 63.7525   What are my monitoring, installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

(a) If your boiler or process heater is subject to a CO emission limit in Table 1 or 2 or Tables 11 through 15 to this subpart, you must install, operate, and maintain an oxygen analyzer system, as defined in § 63.7575, or install, certify, operate and maintain continuous emission monitoring systems for CO and oxygen (O_2_) (or carbon dioxide (CO_2_)) according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.


(1) Install the CO CEMS including an O_2_ (or CO_2_) analyzer by the compliance date specified in § 63.7495. The CO and O_2_ (or CO_2_) levels shall be monitored at the same location at the outlet of the boiler or process heater. An owner or operator may determine compliance with the CO emissions limit using a CO_2_ analyzer as the diluent monitor. If a CO_2_ analyzer is used as the diluent monitor, EPA Method 19 F-factors in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, for the fuel type(s) being burned in the unit and EPA Method 19 equations in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, must be used to calculate the emissions corrected to 3 percent O_2_ using the measured CO_2_ percentage, and must also take into account that the 3 percent oxygen correction is to be done on a dry basis. The equations used to calculate the emissions, must also account for any CO_2_ being added to, or removed from, the emissions gas stream as a result of limestone injection, scrubber media, etc. The methodology used to calculate the CO emissions and the methodology used to account for any CO_2_ being added to, or removed from the emissions gas stream shall be detailed and approved in the site-specific monitoring plan developed according to § 63.7505(d).


(2) To demonstrate compliance with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission standard listed in Table 1 or 2 or Tables 11 through 15 to this subpart, you must install, certify, operate, and maintain a CO CEMS and an oxygen analyzer according to the applicable procedures under Performance Specification 4, 4A, or 4B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; part 75 of this chapter (if an CO_2_ analyzer is used); the site-specific monitoring plan developed according to § 63.7505(d); and the requirements in § 63.7540(a)(8) and this paragraph (a). Any boiler or process heater that has a CO CEMS that is compliant with Performance Specification 4, 4A, or 4B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, a site-specific monitoring plan developed according to § 63.7505(d), and the requirements in § 63.7540(a)(8) and this paragraph (a) must use the CO CEMS to comply with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission standard listed in Table 1 or 2 or Tables 11 through 15 to this subpart.




(i) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CO CEMS according to the requirements in § 63.8(e) and according to Performance Specification 4, 4A, or 4B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.


(ii) During each relative accuracy test run of the CO CEMS, you must collect emission data for CO concurrently using both the CO CEMS and Method 10, 10A, or 10B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4. The relative accuracy testing must be conducted at representative operating conditions.






(iii) You must follow the quality assurance procedures (e.g., quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests) of Procedure 1 of appendix F to part 60. The measurement span value of the CO CEMS must be two times the applicable CO emission limit, expressed as a concentration.


(iv) Any CO CEMS that does not comply with this paragraph (a) cannot be used to meet any requirement in this subpart to demonstrate compliance with a CO emission limit listed in Table 1 or 2 or Tables 11 through 15 to this subpart.




(v) For a new unit, complete the initial performance evaluation no later than July 30, 2013, or 180 days after the date of initial startup, whichever is later. For an existing unit, complete the initial performance evaluation no later than July 29, 2016.


(vi) When CO_2_ is used to correct CO emissions and CO_2_ is measured on a wet basis, if needed, correct for moisture as follows: Install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system for measuring and recording the moisture content of the flue gases, in order to correct the measured hourly volumetric flow rates for moisture when calculating CO concentrations. The following continuous moisture monitoring systems are acceptable: a continuous moisture sensor; an oxygen analyzer (or analyzers) capable of measuring O_2_ both on a wet basis and on a dry basis; or a stack temperature sensor and a moisture look-up table, *i.e.,* a psychrometric chart (for saturated gas streams following wet scrubbers or other demonstrably saturated gas streams, only). The moisture monitoring system shall include as a component the automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS) for recording and reporting both the raw data (e.g., hourly average wet-and dry-basis O_2_ values) and the hourly average values of the stack gas moisture content derived from those data. When a moisture look-up table is used, the moisture monitoring system shall be represented as a single component, the certified DAHS, in the monitoring plan for the unit or common stack.




(3) Complete a minimum of one cycle of CO and oxygen (or CO_2_) CEMS operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Collect CO and oxygen (or CO_2_) data concurrently.

(5) Calculate one-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 3 percent oxygen (or corrected to an CO_2_ percentage determined to be equivalent to 3 percent oxygen) from each hour of CO CEMS data in parts per million CO concentration. The one-hour arithmetic averages required shall be used to calculate the 30-day or 10-day rolling average emissions. Use Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 for calculating the average CO concentration from the hourly values.


(6) For purposes of collecting CO data, operate the CO CEMS as specified in § 63.7535(b). You must use all the data collected during all periods in calculating data averages and assessing compliance, except that you must exclude certain data as specified in § 63.7535(c). Periods when CO data are unavailable may constitute monitoring deviations as specified in § 63.7535(d).
