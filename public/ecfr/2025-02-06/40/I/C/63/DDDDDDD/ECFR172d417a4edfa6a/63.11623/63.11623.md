# ยง 63.11623   What are the testing requirements?

(a) If you are demonstrating that the cyclone required by ยง 63.11621(e) is designed to reduce emissions of particulate matter by 95 percent or greater by the performance test option in ยง 63.11621(e)(1)(iii), you must conduct a test in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and calculate the percent reduction in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) You must use Method 5 in Appendix A to part 60 to determine the particulate matter mass rate at the inlet and outlet of the cyclone. You must conduct at least three runs at the cyclone inlet and three runs at the cyclone outlet. Each run must have a sampling time of at least 60 minutes and a sample volume of at least 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).


(c) You must calculate the percent particulate matter reduction using Equation 1.
