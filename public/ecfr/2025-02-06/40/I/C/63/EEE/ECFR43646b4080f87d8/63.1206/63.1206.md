(i) During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction; and


(ii) When hazardous waste is not in the combustion chamber (i.e., the hazardous waste feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the hazardous waste residence time) and you have documented in the operating record that you are complying with all otherwise applicable requirements and standards promulgated under authority of sections 112 (e.g., 40 CFR part 63, subparts LLL, DDDDD, and NNNNN) or 129 of the Clean Air Act in lieu of the emission standards under §§ 63.1203, 63.1204, 63.1205, 63.1215, 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1218, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221; the monitoring and compliance standards of this section and §§ 63.1207 through 63.1209, except the modes of operation requirements of § 63.1209(q); and the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of §§ 63.1210 through 63.1212. 


(2) *Methods for determining compliance.* The Administrator will determine compliance with the emission standards of this subpart as provided by § 63.6(f)(2). Conducting performance testing under operating conditions representative of the extreme range of normal conditions is consistent with the requirements of §§ 63.6(f)(2)(iii)(B) and 63.7(e)(1) to conduct performance testing under representative operating conditions.


(3) *Finding of compliance.* The Administrator will make a finding concerning compliance with the emission standards and other requirements of this subpart as provided by § 63.6(f)(3).


(4) *Extension of compliance with emission standards.* The Administrator may grant an extension of compliance with the emission standards of this subpart as provided by §§ 63.6(i) and 63.1213.

(A) *Notification.* You must notify the Administrator at least 60 days prior to the change, unless you document circumstances that dictate that such prior notice is not reasonably feasible. The notification must include:


(*1*) A description of the changes and which emission standards may be affected; and


(*2*) A comprehensive performance test schedule and test plan under the requirements of § 63.1207(f) that will document compliance with the affected emission standard(s);


(B) *Performance test.* You must conduct a comprehensive performance test under the requirements of §§ 63.1207(f)(1) and (g)(1) to document compliance with the affected emission standard(s) and establish operating parameter limits as required under § 63.1209, and submit to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d); and


(C) *Restriction on waste burning.* (*1*) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C)(*2*) of this section, after the change and prior to submitting the notification of compliance, you must not burn hazardous waste for more than a total of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator) and only for the purposes of pretesting or comprehensive performance testing. Pretesting is defined at § 63.1207(h)(2)(i) and (ii). 


(*2*) You may petition the Administrator to obtain written approval to burn hazardous waste in the interim prior to submitting a Notification of Compliance for purposes other than testing or pretesting. You must specify operating requirements, including limits on operating parameters, that you determine will ensure compliance with the emission standards of this subpart based on available information. The Administrator will review, modify as necessary, and approve if warranted the interim operating requirements.


(ii) *Changes that will not affect compliance.* If you determine that a change will not adversely affect compliance with the emission standards or operating requirements, you must document the change in the operating record upon making such change. You must revise as necessary the performance test plan, Documentation of Compliance, Notification of Compliance, and start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan to reflect these changes.


(iii) *Definition of “change.”* For purposes of paragraph (b)(5) of this section, “change” means any change in design, operation, or maintenance practices that were documented in the comprehensive performance test plan, Notification of Compliance, or startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. 


(6) *Compliance with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission standards.* This paragraph applies to sources that elect to comply with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions standards of this subpart by documenting continuous compliance with the carbon monoxide standard using a continuous emissions monitoring system and documenting compliance with the hydrocarbon standard during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) performance test or its equivalent.


(i) If a DRE test performed pursuant to § 63.1207(c)(2) is acceptable as documentation of compliance with the DRE standard, you may use the highest hourly rolling average hydrocarbon level achieved during the DRE test runs to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. An acceptable DRE test is any test for which the data and results are determined to meet quality assurance objectives (on a site-specific basis) such that the results adequately demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard. 


(ii) If during this acceptable DRE test you did not obtain hydrocarbon emissions data sufficient to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard, you must either: 


(A) Perform, as part of the performance test, an “equivalent DRE test” to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. An equivalent DRE test is comprised of a minimum of three runs each with a minimum duration of one hour during which you operate the combustor as close as reasonably possible to the operating parameter limits that you established based on the initial DRE test. You must use the highest hourly rolling average hydrocarbon emission level achieved during the equivalent DRE test to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard; or 


(B) Perform a DRE test as part of the performance test. 


(7) *Compliance with the DRE standard.* (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(7)(ii) and (b)(7)(iii) of this section: 


(A) You must document compliance with the Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE) standard under this subpart only once provided that you do not modify the source after the DRE test in a manner that could affect the ability of the source to achieve the DRE standard.


(B) You may use any DRE test data that documents that your source achieves the required level of DRE provided: 


(*1*) You have not modified the design or operation of your source in a manner that could effect the ability of your source to achieve the DRE standard since the DRE test was performed; and, 


(*2*) The DRE test data meet quality assurance objectives determined on a site-specific basis. 


(ii) *Sources that feed hazardous waste at locations other than the normal flame zone.* (A) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section, if you feed hazardous waste at a location in the combustion system other than the normal flame zone, then you must demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard during each comprehensive performance test;


(B)(*1*) A cement kiln that feeds hazardous waste at a location other than the normal flame zone need only demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard during three consecutive comprehensive performance tests provided that:


(*i*) All three tests achieve the DRE standard in this subpart; and


(*ii*) The design, operation, and maintenance features of each of the three tests are similar;


(*iii*) The data in lieu restriction of § 63.1207(c)(2)(iv) does not apply when complying with the provisions of paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section;


(*2*) If at any time you change your design, operation, and maintenance features in a manner that could reasonably be expected to affect your ability to meet the DRE standard, then you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section.


(iii) For sources that do not use DRE previous testing to document conformance with the DRE standard pursuant to § 63.1207(c)(2), you must perform DRE testing during the initial comprehensive performance test.


(8) *Applicability of particulate matter and opacity standards during particulate matter CEMS correlation tests.* (i) Any particulate matter and opacity standards of parts 60, 61, 63, 264, 265, and 266 of this chapter (i.e., any title 40 particulate or opacity standards) applicable to a hazardous waste combustor do not apply while you conduct particulate matter continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) correlation tests (i.e., correlation with manual stack methods) under the conditions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) through (vii) of this section.


(ii) Any permit or other emissions or operating parameter limits or conditions, including any limitation on workplace practices, that are applicable to hazardous waste combustors to ensure compliance with any particulate matter and opacity standards of parts 60, 61, 63, 264, 265, and 266 of this chapter (i.e., any title 40 particulate or opacity standards) do not apply while you conduct particulate matter CEMS correlation tests under the conditions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) through (vii) of this section.


(iii) For the provisions of this section to apply, you must:


(A) Develop a particulate matter CEMS correlation test plan that includes the following information. This test plan may be included as part of the comprehensive performance test plan required under §§ 63.1207(e) and (f):


(*1*) Number of test conditions and number of runs for each test condition;


(*2*) Target particulate matter emission level for each test condition;


(*3*) How you plan to modify operations to attain the desired particulate matter emission levels; and

(A) The startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan must include a description of potential causes of malfunctions, including releases from emergency safety vents, that may result in significant releases of hazardous air pollutants, and actions the source is taking to minimize the frequency and severity of those malfunctions. 


(B) You must submit the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan to the Administrator for review and approval. 


(*1*) *Approval procedure.* The Administrator will notify you of approval or intention to deny approval of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 90 calendar days after receipt of the original request and within 60 calendar days after receipt of any supplemental information that you submit. Before disapproving the plan, the Administrator will notify you of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the plan together with: 


(*i*) Notice of the information and findings on which intended disapproval is based; and 


(*ii*) Notice of opportunity for you to present additional information to the Administrator before final action on disapproval of the plan. At the time the Administrator notifies you of intention to disapprove the plan, the Administrator will specify how much time you will have after being notified on the intended disapproval to submit additional information. 


(*2*) *Responsibility of owners and operators.* You are responsible for ensuring that you submit any supplementary and additional information supporting your plan in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider whether to approve the plan. Neither your submittal of the plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the plan, relieves you of the responsibility to comply with the provisions of this subpart. 


(C) *Changes to the plan that may significantly increase emissions.* (*1*) You must request approval in writing from the Administrator within 5 days after making a change to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that may significantly increase emissions of hazardous air pollutants.

If you exceed a part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter emission standard monitored by a CEMS or COMs or operating limit specified under § 63.1209, the automatic waste feed cutoff system must immediately and automatically cutoff the hazardous waste feed, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section. If the malfunction itself prevents immediate and automatic cutoff of the hazardous waste feed, however, you must cease feeding hazardous waste as quickly as possible. 


(*2*) Although the automatic waste feed cutoff requirements continue to apply during a malfunction, an exceedance of an emission standard monitored by a CEMS or COMS or operating limit specified under § 63.1209 is not a violation of this subpart if you take the corrective measures prescribed in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.


(*3*) *Excessive exceedances during malfunctions.* For each set of 10 exceedances of an emission standard or operating requirement while hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous waste feed was cutoff) during a 60-day block period, you must: 


(*i*) Within 45 days of the 10th exceedance, complete an investigation of the cause of each exceedance and evaluation of approaches to minimize the frequency, duration, and severity of each exceedance, and revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan as warranted by the evaluation to minimize the frequency, duration, and severity of each exceedance; and 


(*ii*) Record the results of the investigation and evaluation in the operating record, and include a summary of the investigation and evaluation, and any changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, in the excess emissions report required under § 63.10(e)(3). 


(B) *Compliance with AWFCO requirements when burning hazardous waste during startup and shutdown.* (*1*) If you feed hazardous waste during startup or shutdown, you must include waste feed restrictions (e.g., type and quantity), and other appropriate operating conditions and limits in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. 


(*2*) You must interlock the operating limits you establish under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B)(*1*) of this section with the automatic waste feed cutoff system required under § 63.1206(c)(3), except for paragraphs (c)(3)(v) and (c)(3)(vi) of this section. 


(*3*) When feeding hazardous waste during startup or shutdown, the automatic waste feed cutoff system must immediately and automatically cutoff the hazardous waste feed if you exceed the operating limits you establish under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B)(*1*) of this section, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section. 


(*4*) Although the automatic waste feed cutoff requirements of this paragraph apply during startup and shutdown, an exceedance of an emission standard or operating limit is not a violation of this subpart if you comply with the operating procedures prescribed in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.


(3) *Automatic waste feed cutoff (AWFCO)*—(i) *General.* Upon the compliance date, you must operate the hazardous waste combustor with a functioning system that immediately and automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section:


(A) When any of the following are exceeded: Operating parameter limits specified under § 63.1209; an emission standard monitored by a CEMS; and the allowable combustion chamber pressure;


(B) When the span value of any CMS detector, except a CEMS, is met or exceeded;


(C) Upon malfunction of a CMS monitoring an operating parameter limit specified under § 63.1209 or an emission level; or 


(D) When any component of the automatic waste feed cutoff system fails.


(ii) *Ducting of combustion gases.* During an AWFCO, you must continue to duct combustion gasses to the air pollution control system while hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., if the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated).


(iii) *Restarting waste feed.* You must continue to monitor during the cutoff the operating parameters for which limits are established under § 63.1209 and the emissions required under that section to be monitored by a CEMS, and you must not restart the hazardous waste feed until the operating parameters and emission levels are within the specified limits.


(iv) *Failure of the AWFCO system.* If the AWFCO system fails to automatically and immediately cutoff the flow of hazardous waste upon exceedance of a parameter required to be interlocked with the AWFCO system under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, you have failed to comply with the AWFCO requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If an equipment or other failure prevents immediate and automatic cutoff of the hazardous waste feed, however, you must cease feeding hazardous waste as quickly as possible.


(v) *Corrective measures.* If, after any AWFCO, there is an exceedance of an emission standard or operating requirement, irrespective of whether the exceedance occurred while hazardous waste remained in the combustion chamber (i.e., whether the hazardous waste residence time has transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated), you must investigate the cause of the AWFCO, take appropriate corrective measures to minimize future AWFCOs, and record the findings and corrective measures in the operating record.


(vi) *Excessive exceedance reporting.* (A) For each set of 10 exceedances of an emission standard or operating requirement while hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous waste feed was cutoff) during a 60-day block period, you must submit to the Administrator a written report within 5 calendar days of the 10th exceedance documenting the exceedances and results of the investigation and corrective measures taken.


(B) On a case-by-case basis, the Administrator may require excessive exceedance reporting when fewer than 10 exceedances occur during a 60-day block period.


(vii) *Testing.* The AWFCO system and associated alarms must be tested at least weekly to verify operability, unless you document in the operating record that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspection will be adequate. At a minimum, you must conduct operability testing at least monthly. You must document and record in the operating record AWFCO operability test procedures and results.


(viii) *Ramping down waste feed.* (A) You may ramp down the waste feedrate of pumpable hazardous waste over a period not to exceed one minute, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii)(B) of this section. If you elect to ramp down the waste feed, you must document ramp down procedures in the operating and maintenance plan. The procedures must specify that the ramp down begins immediately upon initiation of automatic waste feed cutoff and the procedures must prescribe a bona fide ramping down. If an emission standard or operating limit is exceeded during the ramp down, you have failed to comply with the emission standards or operating requirements of this subpart.


(B) If the automatic waste feed cutoff is triggered by an exceedance of any of the following operating limits, you may not ramp down the waste feed cutoff: Minimum combustion chamber temperature, maximum hazardous waste feedrate, or any hazardous waste firing system operating limits that may be established for your combustor.


(4) *ESV openings*—(i) *Failure to meet standards.* If an emergency safety vent (ESV) opens when hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time has not expired) during an event other than a malfunction as defined in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan such that combustion gases are not treated as during the most recent comprehensive performance test (e.g., if the combustion gas by-passes any emission control device that was operating during the performance test), you must document in the operating record whether you remain in compliance with the emission standards of this subpart considering emissions during the ESV opening event.


(ii) *ESV operating plan.* (A) You must develop an ESV operating plan, comply with the operating plan, and keep the plan in the operating record.


(B) The ESV operating plan must provide detailed procedures for rapidly stopping the waste feed, shutting down the combustor, and maintaining temperature and negative pressure in the combustion chamber during the hazardous waste residence time, if feasible. The plan must include calculations and information and data documenting the effectiveness of the plan's procedures for ensuring that combustion chamber temperature and negative pressure are maintained as is reasonably feasible.


(iii) *Corrective measures.* After any ESV opening that results in a failure to meet the emission standards as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, you must investigate the cause of the ESV opening, take appropriate corrective measures to minimize such future ESV openings, and record the findings and corrective measures in the operating record.


(iv) *Reporting requirements.* You must submit to the Administrator a written report within 5 days of an ESV opening that results in failure to meet the emission standards of this subpart (as determined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) documenting the result of the investigation and corrective measures taken.


(5) *Combustion system leaks.* (i) Combustion system leaks of hazardous air pollutants must be controlled by:


(A) Keeping the combustion zone sealed to prevent combustion system leaks; or


(B) Maintaining the maximum combustion zone pressure lower than ambient pressure using an instantaneous monitor; or


(C) Upon prior written approval of the Administrator, an alternative means of control to provide control of combustion system leaks equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than ambient pressure; or 


(D) Upon prior written approval of the Administrator, other technique(s) which can be demonstrated to prevent fugitive emissions without use of instantaneous pressure limits; and


(ii) You must specify in the performance test workplan and Notification of Compliance the method that will be used to control combustion system leaks. If you control combustion system leaks by maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than ambient pressure using an instantaneous monitor, you must also specify in the performance test workplan and Notification of Compliance the monitoring and recording frequency of the pressure monitor, and specify how the monitoring approach will be integrated into the automatic waste feed cutoff system.

Your recommended quality assurance procedures may include periodic testing under as-found conditions (i.e., normal operations) to obtain additional PM concentration and PMDS response run pairs, as warranted.


(*2*) *Set-points established with extrapolation.* If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that will reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the value that correlates to the alarm set-point.


(E) You must include procedures for installation, operation, maintenance, and quality assurance of the PMDS in the site-specific continuous monitoring system test plan required under §§ 63.1207(e) and 63.8(e)(3);


(F) Where multiple detectors are required to monitor multiple control devices, the system's instrumentation and alarm system may be shared among the detectors.


(G) You must establish the alarm set-point as a 6-hour rolling average as provided by paragraphs (c)(9)(ii), (c)(9)(iii), and (c)(9)(iv) of this section;


(H) Your PMDS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. You must update the 6-hour rolling average of the detector response each hour with a one-hour block average that is the average of the detector responses over each 15-minute block; and


(I) If you exceed the alarm set-point (or if your PMDS malfunctions), you must comply with the corrective measures under paragraph (c)(9)(vii) of this section.


(ii) *Establishing the alarm set-point for operations under the Documentation of Compliance.* You must establish the alarm set-point for operations under the Documentation of Compliance (i.e., after the compliance date but prior to submitting a Notification of Compliance subsequent to conducting the initial comprehensive performance test) of an existing source as follows:


(A) You must obtain a minimum of three pairs of Method 5 or 5I data, provided in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter, and PMDS data to establish an approximate correlation curve. Data obtained up to 60 months prior to the compliance date may be used provided that the design and operation of the combustor or PMDS has not changed in a manner that may adversely affect the correlation of PM concentrations and PMDS response.


(B) You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of your determination whether multiple correlation curves are needed considering the design and operation of your combustor and PMDS.


(C) You must approximate the correlation of the reference method data to the PMDS data.


(*1*) You may assume a linear correlation of the PMDS response to particulate matter emission concentrations;


(*2*) You may include a zero point correlation value. To establish a zero point, you must follow one or more of the following steps:


(*i*) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained, to the extent possible, by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench;


(*ii*) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air;


(*iii*) Zero point data also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas); and


(*iv*) If none of the steps in paragraphs (c)(9)(ii)(B)(*2*)(*i*) through (*iii*) of this section are possible, you must estimate the monitor response when no PM is in the flue gas (e.g., 4 mA = 0 mg/acm).


(*3*) For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must average the test run averages of PM concentrations and PMDS responses to obtain a single pair of data for PM concentration and PMDS response. You may use this pair of data and the zero point to define a linear correlation model for the PMDS.


(D) You must establish the alarm set-point as the PMDS response that corresponds to a PM concentration that is 50% of the PM emission standard or 125% of the highest PM concentration used to develop the correlation, whichever is greater. For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must use the average of the test run averages of PM concentrations for extrapolating the alarm set-point. The PM emission concentration used to extrapolate the alarm set-point must not exceed the PM emission standard, however.


(iii) *Establishing the initial alarm set-point for operations under the Notification of Compliance.* You must establish the initial alarm set-point for operations under the Notification of Compliance as provided by either paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) or paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section. You must periodically revise the alarm set-point as provided by paragraph (c)(9)(iv) of this section.


(A) *Establishing the initial set-point without extrapolation.* (*1*) If you establish the initial alarm set-point without extrapolation, the alarm set-point is the average of the test run averages of the PMDS response during the runs of the comprehensive performance test that document compliance with the PM emission standard.


(*2*) During the comprehensive performance test, you may simulate PM emission concentrations at the upper end of the range of normal operations by means including feeding high levels of ash and detuning the emission control equipment.


(B) *Establishing the initial set-point by extrapolation.* You may extrapolate the particulate matter detector response to establish the alarm set-point under the following procedures:


(*1*) You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the procedures you will use to establish an approximate correlation curve using the three pairs of Method 5 or 5I data (see methods in appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter) and PMDS data from the comprehensive performance test, the data pairs used to establish the correlation curve for the Documentation of Compliance under paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section, and additional data pairs, as warranted.


(*2*) You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of your determination of whether multiple correlation curves are needed considering the design and operation of your combustor and PMDS. If so, you must recommend the number of data pairs needed to establish those correlation curves and how the data will be obtained.


(*3*) During the comprehensive performance test, you may simulate PM emission concentrations at the upper end of the range of normal operations by means including feeding high levels of ash and detuning the emission control equipment.


(*4*) Data obtained up to 60 months prior to the comprehensive performance test may be used provided that the design and operation of the combustor or PMDS has not changed in a manner that may adversely affect the correlation of PM concentrations and PMDS response.


(*5*) You may include a zero point correlation value. To establish a zero point, you must follow the procedures under paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section.


(*6*) You must use a least-squares regression model to correlate PM concentrations to PMDS responses for data pairs. You may assume a linear regression model approximates the relationship between PM concentrations and PMDS responses.


(*7*) You must establish the alarm set-point as the PMDS response that corresponds to a PM concentration that is 50% of the PM emission standard or 125% of the highest PM concentration used to develop the correlation, whichever is greater. The emission concentration used to extrapolate the PMDS response must not exceed the PM emission standard.


(iv) *Revising the Notification of Compliance alarm set-point*—(A) *Revising set-points established without extrapolation.* If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must establish a new alarm set-point in the Notification of Compliance following each comprehensive performance test as the average of the test run averages of the PMDS response during the runs of the comprehensive performance test that document compliance with the PM emission standard.


(B) *Revising set-points established with extrapolation.* If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the procedures for periodically revising the alarm set-point, considering the additional data pairs obtained during periodic comprehensive performance tests and data pairs obtained from other tests, such as for quality assurance.


(v) *Quality assurance*—(A) *Set-points established without extrapolation.* If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the average of the PM concentrations demonstrated during the comprehensive performance test. Your recommended quality assurance procedures may include periodic testing under as-found conditions (i.e., normal operations) to obtain additional PM concentration and PMDS response run pairs, as warranted.


(B) *Set-points established with extrapolation.* If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the value that correlated to the alarm set-point.


(vi) *PMDS are used for compliance assurance only.* For a PMDS for which the alarm set-point is established by extrapolation using a correlation curve under paragraphs (c)(9)(ii), (c)(9)(iii)(B), and (c)(9)(iv)(B) of this section, an exceedance of the PMDS response that appears to correlate with a PM concentration that exceeds the PM emission standard is not by itself evidence that the standard has been exceeded.


(vii) *PMDS corrective measures requirements.* The operating and maintenance plan required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section must include a corrective measures plan that specifies the procedures you will follow in the case of a PMDS alarm or malfunction. The corrective measures plan must include, at a minimum, the procedures used to determine and record the time and cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction as well as the corrective measures taken to correct the control device or PMDS malfunction or minimize emissions as specified below. Failure to initiate the corrective measures required by this paragraph is failure to ensure compliance with the emission standards in this subpart.


(A) You must initiate the procedures used to determine the cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction within 30 minutes of the time the alarm first sounds or the PMDS malfunctions; and


(B) You must alleviate the cause of the alarm or the PMDS malfunction by taking the necessary corrective measure(s) which may include shutting down the combustor.


(viii) *Excessive exceedances notification.* If you operate the combustor when the detector response exceeds the alarm set-point or when the PMDS is malfunctioning more than 5 percent of the time during any 6-month block time period, you must submit a notification to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of the 6-month block time period that describes the causes of the exceedances and the revisions to the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor, emission control device, or PMDS you are taking to minimize exceedances. To document compliance with this requirement:


(A) You must keep records of the date, time, and duration of each alarm and PMDS malfunction, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction and the corrective action taken;


(B) You must record the percent of the operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds and the PMDS malfunctions;


(C) If inspection of the emission control device demonstrates that no corrective action is required, then no alarm time is counted; and


(D) If corrective action to the emission control device is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. Each PMDS malfunction shall also be counted as a minimum of 1 hour.
