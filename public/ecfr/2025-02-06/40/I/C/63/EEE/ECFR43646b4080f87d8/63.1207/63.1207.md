# § 63.1207   What are the performance testing requirements?

(a) *General.* The provisions of § 63.7 apply, except as noted below.


(b) *Types of performance tests*—(1) *Comprehensive performance test.* You must conduct comprehensive performance tests to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards provided by this subpart, establish limits for the operating parameters provided by § 63.1209, and demonstrate compliance with the performance specifications for continuous monitoring systems. 


(2) *Confirmatory performance test.* You must conduct confirmatory performance tests to:


(i) Demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard when the source operates under normal operating conditions; and


(ii) Conduct a performance evaluation of continuous monitoring systems required for compliance assurance with the dioxin/furan emission standard under § 63.1209(k).


(3) *One-Time Dioxin/Furan Test for Sources Not Subject to a Numerical Dioxin/Furan Standard.* For solid fuel boilers and hydrochloric acid production furnaces, for lightweight aggregate kilns that are not subject to a numerical dioxin/furan emission standard under § 63.1221, and liquid fuel boilers that are not subject to a numerical dioxin/furan emission standard under § 63.1217, you must conduct a one-time emission test for dioxin/furan under feed and operating conditions that are most likely to reflect daily maximum operating variability, similar to a dioxin/furan comprehensive performance test.


(i) You must conduct the dioxin/furan emissions test no later than the deadline for conducting the initial comprehensive performance test.


(ii) You may use dioxin/furan emissions data from previous testing to meet this requirement, provided that:


(A) The testing was conducted under feed and operating conditions that are most likely to reflect daily maximum operating variability, similar to a dioxin/furan compliance test;


(B) You have not changed the design or operation of the source in a manner that could significantly affect stack gas dioxin/furan emission concentrations; and


(C) The data meet quality assurance objectives that may be determined on a site-specific basis.


(iii) You may use dioxin/furan emissions data from a source to represent emissions from another on-site source in lieu of testing (i.e., data in lieu of testing) if the design and operation, including hazardous waste feed and other feedstreams, of the sources are identical.


(iv) You must include the results of the one-time dioxin/furan emissions test with the results of the initial comprehensive performance test in the Notification of Compliance.


(v) You must repeat the dioxin/furan emissions test if you change the design or operation of the source in a manner that may increase dioxin/furan emissions.


(vi) Sources that are required to perform the one-time dioxin/furan test pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section are not required to perform confirmatory performance tests.


(c) *Initial comprehensive performance test*—(1) *Test date.* Except as provided by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, you must commence the initial comprehensive performance test not later than six months after the compliance date.


(2) *Data in lieu of the initial comprehensive performance test.* (i) You may request that previous emissions test data serve as documentation of conformance with the emission standards of this subpart provided that the previous testing: 


(A) Was initiated after 54 months prior to the compliance date, except as provided by paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) or (c)(2)(iv) of this section; 


(B) Results in data that meet quality assurance objectives (determined on a site-specific basis) such that the results demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards; 


(C) Was in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section; and 


(D) Was sufficient to establish the applicable operating parameter limits under § 63.1209. 


(ii) You must submit data in lieu of the initial comprehensive performance test in lieu of (i.e., if the data are in lieu of all performance testing) or with the notification of performance test required under paragraph (e) of this section.


(iii) The data in lieu test age restriction provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not apply for the duration of the interim standards (i.e., the standards published in the _Federal Register_ on February 13, 2002, 67 FR 6792). See 40 CFR parts 63, 264, 265, 266, 270, and 271 revised as of July 1, 2002. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not apply until EPA promulgates permanent replacement standards pursuant to the Settlement Agreement noticed in the _Federal Register_ on November 16, 2001 (66 FR 57715).


(iv) The data in lieu test age restriction provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not apply to DRE data provided you do not feed hazardous waste at a location in the combustion system other than the normal flame zone.


(3) For incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns, you must commence the initial comprehensive performance test to demonstrate compliance with the standards under §§ 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221 not later than 12 months after the compliance date.


(d) *Frequency of testing.* Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, you must conduct testing periodically as prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. The date of commencement of the initial comprehensive performance test is the basis for establishing the deadline to commence the initial confirmatory performance test and the next comprehensive performance test. You may conduct performance testing at any time prior to the required date. The deadline for commencing subsequent confirmatory and comprehensive performance testing is based on the date of commencement of the previous comprehensive performance test. Unless the Administrator grants a time extension under paragraph (i) of this section, you must conduct testing as follows: 


(1) *Comprehensive performance testing.* Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, you must commence testing no later than 61 months after the date of commencing the previous comprehensive performance test used to show compliance with § 63.1216, § 63.1217, § 63.1218, § 63.1219, § 63.1220, or § 63.1221. If you submit data in lieu of the initial performance test, you must commence the subsequent comprehensive performance test within 61 months of commencing the test used to provide the data in lieu of the initial performance test.


(2) *Confirmatory performance testing.* Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, you must commence confirmatory performance testing no later than 31 months after the date of commencing the previous comprehensive performance test used to show compliance with § 63.1217, § 63.1219, § 63.1220, or § 63.1221. If you submit data in lieu of the initial performance test, you must commence the initial confirmatory performance test within 31 months of the date six months after the compliance date. To ensure that the confirmatory test is conducted approximately midway between comprehensive performance tests, the Administrator will not approve a test plan that schedules testing within 18 months of commencing the previous comprehensive performance test.


(3) *Duration of testing.* You must complete performance testing within 60 days after the date of commencement, unless the Administrator determines that a time extension is warranted based on your documentation in writing of factors beyond your control that prevent you from meeting the 60-day deadline.


(4) *Applicable testing requirements under the interim standards*—(i) *Waiver of periodic comprehensive performance tests.* Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must conduct only an initial comprehensive performance test under the interim standards (§§ 63.1203 through 63.1205); all subsequent comprehensive performance testing requirements are waived under the interim standards. The provisions in the introductory text to paragraph (d) and in paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply only to tests used to demonstrate compliance with the standards under §§ 63.1219 through 63.1221.


(ii) *Waiver of confirmatory performance tests.* You are not required to conduct a confirmatory test under the interim standards (§§ 63.1203 through 63.1205). The confirmatory testing requirements in the introductory text to paragraph (d) and in paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply only after you have demonstrated compliance with the standards under §§ 63.1219 through 63.1221.

(g) *Operating conditions during testing.* You must comply with the provisions of § 63.7(e). Conducting performance testing under operating conditions representative of the extreme range of normal conditions is consistent with the requirement of § 63.7(e)(1) to conduct performance testing under representative operating conditions.


(1) *Comprehensive performance testing*—(i) *Operations during testing.* For the following parameters, you must operate the combustor during the performance test under normal conditions (or conditions that will result in higher than normal emissions):


(A) *Chlorine feedrate.* You must feed normal (or higher) levels of chlorine during the dioxin/furan performance test;


(B) *Ash feedrate.* For hazardous waste incinerators, you must conduct the following tests when feeding normal (or higher) levels of ash: The semivolatile metal and low volatile metal performance tests; and the dioxin/furan and mercury performance tests if activated carbon injection or a carbon bed is used; and


(C) *Cleaning cycle of the particulate matter control device.* You must conduct the following tests when the particulate matter control device undergoes its normal (or more frequent) cleaning cycle: The particulate matter, semivolatile metal, and low volatile metal performance tests; and the dioxin/furan and mercury performance tests if activated carbon injection or a carbon bed is used.


(ii) *Modes of operation.* Given that you must establish limits for the applicable operating parameters specified in § 63.1209 based on operations during the comprehensive performance test, you may conduct testing under two or more operating modes to provide operating flexibility.


(iii) *Steady-state conditions.* (A) Prior to obtaining performance test data, you must operate under performance test conditions until you reach steady-state operations with respect to emissions of pollutants you must measure during the performance test and operating parameters under § 63.1209 for which you must establish limits. During system conditioning, you must ensure that each operating parameter for which you must establish a limit is held at the level planned for the performance test. You must include documentation in the performance test plan under paragraph (f) of this section justifying the duration of system conditioning.


(B) If you own or operate a hazardous waste cement kiln that recycles collected particulate matter (i.e., cement kiln dust) into the kiln, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate matter prior to obtaining performance test data for levels of selected metals that must be measured during performance testing to document that the system has reached steady-state conditions (i.e., that metals levels have stabilized). You must document the rationale for selecting metals that are indicative of system equilibrium and include the information in the performance test plan under paragraph (f) of this section. To determine system equilibrium, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate matter hourly for each selected metal, unless you submit in the performance test plan a justification for reduced sampling and analysis and the Administrator approves in writing a reduced sampling and analysis frequency.


(2) *Confirmatory performance testing.* You must conduct confirmatory performance testing for dioxin/furan under normal operating conditions for the following parameters:


(i) Carbon monoxide (or hydrocarbon) CEMS emissions levels must be within the range of the average value to the maximum value allowed, except as provided by paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. The average value is defined as the sum of the hourly rolling average values recorded (each minute) over the previous 12 months, divided by the number of rolling averages recorded during that time. The average value must not include calibration data, startup data, shutdown data, malfunction data, and data obtained when not burning hazardous waste; 


(ii) Each operating limit (specified in § 63.1209) established to maintain compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard must be held within the range of the average value over the previous 12 months and the maximum or minimum, as appropriate, that is allowed, except as provided by paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. The average value is defined as the sum of the rolling average values recorded over the previous 12 months, divided by the number of rolling averages recorded during that time. The average value must not include calibration data, startup data, shutdown data, malfunction data, and data obtained when not burning hazardous waste;


(iii) You must feed chlorine at normal feedrates or greater; and 


(iv) If the combustor is equipped with carbon injection or carbon bed, normal cleaning cycle of the particulate matter control device.


(v) The Administrator may approve an alternative range to that required by paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section if you document in the confirmatory performance test plan that it may be problematic to maintain the required range during the test. In addition, when making the finding of compliance, the Administrator may consider test conditions outside of the range specified in the test plan based on a finding that you could not reasonably maintain the range specified in the test plan and considering factors including whether the time duration and level of the parameter when operations were out of the specified range were such that operations during the confirmatory test are determined to be reasonably representative of normal operations. In addition, the Administrator will consider the proximity of the emission test results to the standard.


(h) *Operating conditions during subsequent testing.* (1) Current operating parameter limits established under § 63.1209 are waived during subsequent comprehensive performance testing. 


(2) Current operating parameter limits are also waived during pretesting prior to comprehensive performance testing for an aggregate time not to exceed 720 hours of operation (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator) under an approved test plan or if the source records the results of the pretesting. Pretesting means:


(i) Operations when stack emissions testing for dioxin/furan, mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, particulate matter, or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas is being performed; and 


(ii) Operations to reach steady-state operating conditions prior to stack emissions testing under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section.


(i) *Time extension for subsequent performance tests.* After the initial comprehensive performance test, you may request up to a one-year time extension for conducting a comprehensive or confirmatory performance test to consolidate performance testing with other state or federally required emission testing, or for other reasons deemed acceptable by the Administrator. If the Administrator grants a time extension for a comprehensive performance test, the deadlines for commencing the next comprehensive and confirmatory tests are based on the date that the subject comprehensive performance test commences.


(1) You must submit in writing to the Administrator any request under this paragraph for a time extension for conducting a performance test.


(2) You must include in the request for an extension for conducting a performance test the following:


(i) A description of the reasons for requesting the time extension;


(ii) The date by which you will commence performance testing.


(3) The Administrator will notify you in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of your request for an extension for conducting a performance test within 30 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate your request. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after you have been notified in writing that your application is complete. The Administrator will notify you in writing whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that you submit.


(4) When notifying you that your application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application. The Administrator will also provide notice of opportunity for you to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after notification of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.


(5) Before denying any request for an extension for performance testing, the Administrator will notify you in writing of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with:


(i) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and


(ii) Notice of opportunity for you to present in writing, within 15 calendar days after notification of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on the request.


(6) The Administrator's final determination to deny any request for an extension will be in writing and will set forth specific grounds upon which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 30 calendar days after the presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.


(j) *Notification of compliance*—(1) *Comprehensive performance test.* (i) Except as provided by paragraphs (j)(4) and (j)(5) of this section, within 90 days of completion of a comprehensive performance test, you must postmark a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance with the emission standards and continuous monitoring system requirements, and identifying operating parameter limits under § 63.1209.


(ii) Upon postmark of the Notification of Compliance, you must comply with all operating requirements specified in the Notification of Compliance in lieu of the limits specified in the Documentation of Compliance required under § 63.1211(c).


(2) *Confirmatory performance test.* Except as provided by paragraph (j)(4) of this section, within 90 days of completion of a confirmatory performance test, you must postmark a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance or noncompliance with the applicable dioxin/furan emission standard.


(3) See §§ 63.7(g), 63.9(h), and 63.1210(d) for additional requirements pertaining to the Notification of Compliance (e.g., you must include results of performance tests in the Notification of Compliance). 


(4) *Time extension.* You may submit a written request to the Administrator for a time extension documenting that, for reasons beyond your control, you may not be able to meet the 90-day deadline for submitting the Notification of Compliance after completion of testing. The Administrator will determine whether a time extension is warranted.


(5) *Early compliance.* If you conduct the initial comprehensive performance test prior to the compliance date, you must postmark the Notification of Compliance within 90 days of completion of the performance test or by the compliance date, whichever is later.


(k) *Failure to submit a timely notification of compliance.* (1) If you fail to postmark a Notification of Compliance by the specified date, you must cease hazardous waste burning immediately.


(2) Prior to submitting a revised Notification of Compliance as provided by paragraph (k)(3) of this section, you may burn hazardous waste only for the purpose of pretesting or comprehensive performance testing and only for a maximum of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator).


(3) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance subsequent to a new comprehensive performance test before resuming hazardous waste burning.


(l) *Failure of performance test*—(1) *Comprehensive performance test.* The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the initial comprehensive performance test if you conduct the test prior to your compliance date. 


(i) If you determine (based on CEM recordings, results of analyses of stack samples, or results of CMS performance evaluations) that you have exceeded any emission standard during a comprehensive performance test for a mode of operation, you must cease hazardous waste burning immediately under that mode of operation. You must make this determination within 90 days following completion of the performance test.


(ii) If you have failed to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards for any mode of operation:


(A) Prior to submitting a revised Notification of Compliance as provided by paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, you may burn hazardous waste only for the purpose of pretesting or comprehensive performance testing under revised operating conditions, and only for a maximum of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator), except as provided by paragraph (l)(3) of this section;


(B) You must conduct a comprehensive performance test under revised operating conditions following the requirements for performance testing of this section; and


(C) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance subsequent to the new comprehensive performance test.


(2) *Confirmatory performance test.* If you determine (based on CEM recordings, results of analyses of stack samples, or results of CMS performance evaluations) that you have failed the dioxin/furan emission standard during a confirmatory performance test, you must cease burning hazardous waste immediately. You must make this determination within 90 days following completion of the performance test. To burn hazardous waste in the future:


(i) You must submit to the Administrator for review and approval a test plan to conduct a comprehensive performance test to identify revised limits on the applicable dioxin/furan operating parameters specified in § 63.1209(k);


(ii) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard under the provisions of paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section and this paragraph (l). You must include in the Notification of Compliance the revised limits on the applicable dioxin/furan operating parameters specified in § 63.1209(k); and


(iii) Until the Notification of Compliance is submitted, you must not burn hazardous waste except for purposes of pretesting or confirmatory performance testing, and for a maximum of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator), except as provided by paragraph (l)(3) of this section.


(3) You may petition the Administrator to obtain written approval to burn hazardous waste in the interim prior to submitting a Notification of Compliance for purposes other than testing or pretesting. You must specify operating requirements, including limits on operating parameters, that you determine will ensure compliance with the emission standards of this subpart based on available information including data from the failed performance test. The Administrator will review, modify as necessary, and approve if warranted the interim operating requirements. An approval of interim operating requirements will include a schedule for submitting a Notification of Compliance.


(m) *Waiver of performance test.* You are not required to conduct performance tests to document compliance with the mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas emission standards under the conditions specified in paragraphs (m)(1) or (m)(2) of this section. The waiver provisions of this paragraph apply in addition to the provisions of § 63.7(h).


(1) *Emission standards based on exhaust gas flow rate.* (i) You are deemed to be in compliance with an emission standard based on the volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas (i.e., µg/dscm or ppmv) if the maximum theoretical emission concentration (MTEC) does not exceed the emission standard over the relevant averaging period specified under § 63.1209(l), (n), and (o) of this section for the standard: 


(A) Determine the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, or total chlorine and chloride from all feedstreams;


(B) Determine the stack gas flowrate; and


(C) Calculate a MTEC for each standard assuming all mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, or total chlorine (organic and inorganic) from all feedstreams is emitted;


(ii) To document compliance with this provision, you must:


(A) Monitor and record the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and total chlorine and chloride from all feedstreams according to § 63.1209(c);


(B) Monitor with a CMS and record in the operating record the gas flowrate (either directly or by monitoring a surrogate parameter that you have correlated to gas flowrate);


(C) Continuously calculate and record in the operating record the MTEC under the procedures of paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section; and


(D) Interlock the MTEC calculated in paragraph (m)(1)(i)(C) of this section to the AWFCO system to stop hazardous waste burning when the MTEC exceeds the emission standard.


(iii) In lieu of the requirement in paragraphs (m)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section, you may:


(A) Identify in the Notification of Compliance a minimum gas flowrate limit and a maximum feedrate limit of mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and/or total chlorine and chloride from all feedstreams that ensures the MTEC as calculated in paragraph (m)(1)(i)(C) of this section is below the applicable emission standard; and


(B) Interlock the minimum gas flowrate limit and maximum feedrate limit of paragraph (m)(1)(iii)(A) of this section to the AWFCO system to stop hazardous waste burning when the gas flowrate or mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and/or total chlorine and chloride feedrate exceeds the limits of paragraph (m)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.


(2) *Emission standards based on hazardous waste thermal concentration.* (i) You are deemed to be in compliance with an emission standard specified on a hazardous waste thermal concentration basis (i.e., pounds emitted per million Btu of heat input) if the HAP thermal concentration in the waste feed does not exceed the allowable HAP thermal concentration emission rate.


(ii) To document compliance with this provision, you must:


(A) Monitor and record the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and total chlorine and chloride from all hazardous waste feedstreams in accordance with § 63.1209(c);


(B) Determine and record the higher heating value of each hazardous waste feed;


(C) Continuously calculate and record the thermal feed rate of all hazardous waste feedstreams by summing the products of each hazardous waste feed rate multiplied by the higher heating value of that hazardous waste;


(D) Continuously calculate and record the total HAP thermal feed concentration for each constituent by dividing the HAP feedrate determined in paragraph (m)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by the thermal feed rate determined in paragraph (m)(2)(ii)(C) of this section for all hazardous waste feedstreams;


(E) Interlock the HAP thermal feed concentration for each constituent with the AWFCO to stop hazardous waste feed when the thermal feed concentration exceeds the applicable thermal emission standard.


(3) When you determine the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, or total chlorine and chloride for purposes of this provision, except as provided by paragraph (m)(4) of this section, you must assume that the analyte is present at the full detection limit when the feedstream analysis determines that the analyte in not detected in the feedstream.


(4) Owners and operators of hazardous waste burning cement kilns and lightweight aggregate kilns may assume that mercury is present in raw material at half the detection limit when the raw material feedstream analysis determines that mercury is not detected.


(5) You must state in the site-specific test plan that you submit for review and approval under paragraph (e) of this section that you intend to comply with the provisions of this paragraph. You must include in the test plan documentation that any surrogate that is proposed for gas flowrate adequately correlates with the gas flowrate.
