# § 63.1208   What are the test methods?

(a) [Reserved]


(b) *Test methods.* You must use the following test methods to determine compliance with the emissions standards of this subpart:


(1) *Dioxins and furans.* (i) To determine compliance with the emission standard for dioxins and furans, you must use:


(A) Method 0023A, Sampling Method for Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans emissions from Stationary Sources, EPA Publication SW-846 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14); or


(B) Method 23, provided in Appendix A, Part 60 of this chapter.


(ii) You must sample for a minimum of three hours, and you must collect a minimum sample volume of 2.5 dscm.


(iii) You may assume that nondetects are present at zero concentration.


(2) *Mercury.* You must use Method 29, provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter, to demonstrate compliance with emission standard for mercury.


(3) *Cadmium and lead.* You must use Method 29, provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter, to determine compliance with the emission standard for cadmium and lead (combined).


(4) *Arsenic, beryllium, and chromium.* You must use Method 29, provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter, to determine compliance with the emission standard for arsenic, beryllium, and chromium (combined).


(5) *Hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas*—(i) *Compliance with MACT standards.* To determine compliance with the emission standard for hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas (combined), you must use:


(A) Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter; or


(B) Methods 320 or 321 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this chapter, or


(C) ASTM D 6735-01, Standard Test Method for Measurement of Gaseous Chlorides and Fluorides from Mineral Calcining Exhaust Sources—Impinger Method to measure emissions of hydrogen chloride, and Method 26/26A to measure emissions of chlorine gas, provided that you follow the provisions in paragraphs (b)(5)(C)(*1*) through (*6*) of this section. ASTM D 6735-01 is available for purchase from at least one of the following addresses: American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 100 Barr Harbor Drive, Post Office Box C700, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959; or ProQuest, 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.


(*1*) A test must include three or more runs in which a pair of samples is obtained simultaneously for each run according to section 11.2.6 of ASTM Method D6735-01.


(*2*) You must calculate the test run standard deviation of each set of paired samples to quantify data precision, according to Equation 1 of this section: 


(*3*) You must calculate the test average relative standard deviation according to Equation 2 of this section: 


(*4*) If RSDTA is greater than 20 percent, the data are invalid and the test must be repeated.


(*5*) The post-test analyte spike procedure of section 11.2.7 of ASTM Method D6735-01 is conducted, and the percent recovery is calculated according to section 12.6 of ASTM Method D6735-01.


(*6*) If the percent recovery is between 70 percent and 130 percent, inclusive, the test is valid. If the percent recovery is outside of this range, the data are considered invalid, and the test must be repeated.


(ii) *Compliance with risk-based limits under § 63.1215.* To demonstrate compliance with emission limits established under § 63.1215, you must use Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter, Method 320 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this chapter, Method 321 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this chapter, or ASTM D 6735-01, Standard Test Method for Measurement of Gaseous Chlorides and Fluorides from Mineral Calcining Exhaust Sources—Impinger Method (following the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(C)(*1*) through (*6*) of this section), except:


(A) For cement kilns and sources equipped with a dry acid gas scrubber, you must use Methods 320 or 321 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this chapter, or ASTM D 6735-01 to measure hydrogen chloride, and the back-half, caustic impingers of Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter to measure chlorine gas; and


(B) For incinerators, boilers, and lightweight aggregate kilns, you must use Methods 320 or 321 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this chapter, or ASTM D 6735-01 to measure hydrogen chloride, and Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter to measure total chlorine, and calculate chlorine gas by difference if:


(*1*) The bromine/chlorine ratio in feedstreams is greater than 5 percent; or


(*2*) The sulfur/chlorine ratio in feedstreams is greater than 50 percent. 


(6) *Particulate matter.* You must use Methods 5 or 5I, provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter, to demonstrate compliance with the emission standard for particulate matter.


(7) *Other test methods.* You may use applicable test methods in EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in paragraph (a) of this section, as necessary to demonstrate compliance with requirements of this subpart, except as otherwise specified in paragraphs (b)(2)-(b)(6) of this section.


(8) *Feedstream analytical methods.* You may use any reliable analytical method to determine feedstream concentrations of metals, chlorine, and other constituents. It is your responsibility to ensure that the sampling and analysis procedures are unbiased, precise, and that the results are representative of the feedstream.


(9) *Opacity.* If you determine compliance with the opacity standard under the monitoring requirements of §§ 63.1209(a)(1)(iv) and (a)(1)(v), you must use Method 9, provided in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter.
