# § 63.1215   What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine?

(a) *General*—(1) *Overview.* You may establish and comply with health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine under the procedures prescribed in this section for your hazardous waste combustors other than hydrochloric acid production furnaces. You may comply with these health-based compliance alternatives in lieu of the emission standards for total chlorine provided under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221. To identify and comply with the limits, you must:


(i) Identify a total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv) expressed as chloride (Cl(−)) equivalent for each on site hazardous waste combustor. You may select total chlorine emission concentrations as you choose to demonstrate eligibility for the risk-based limits under this section, except as provided by paragraph (b)(7) of this section; 


(ii) Apportion the total chlorine emission concentration between HCl and Cl_2_ according to paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, and calculate HCl and Cl_2_ emission rates (lb/hr) using the gas flowrate and other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.


(iii) Calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(iv) Perform an eligibility demonstration to determine if your HCl-equivalent emission rate meets the national exposure standard and thus is below the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, as prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section;


(v) Submit your eligibility demonstration for review and approval, as prescribed by paragraph (e) of this section, which must include information to ensure that the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit is not exceeded, as prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section;


(vi) Demonstrate compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit during the comprehensive performance test, as prescribed by the testing and monitoring requirements under paragraph (e) of this section;


(vii) Comply with compliance monitoring requirements, including establishing feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride, and operating parameter limits on emission control equipment, as prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section; and


(viii) Comply with the requirements for changes, as prescribed by paragraph (h) of this section.


(2) *Definitions.* In addition to the definitions under § 63.1201, the following definitions apply to this section:


*1-Hour Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate* means the HCl-equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of chlorine to HCl using aRELs as the health risk metric for acute exposure.


*1-Hour Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate Limit* means the HCl-equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of chlorine to HCl using aRELs as the health risk metric for acute exposure and which ensures that maximum 1-hour average ambient concentrations of HCl-equivalents do not exceed a Hazard Index of 1.0, rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1), at an off-site receptor location.


*Acute Reference Exposure Level (aREL)* means health thresholds below which there would be no adverse health effects for greater than once in a lifetime exposures of one hour. ARELs are developed by the California Office of Health Hazard Assessment and are available at *http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/acute_rels/acuterel.html.*

*Annual Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate* means the HCl-equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of chlorine to HCl using RfCs as the health risk metric for long-term exposure.


*Annual Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate Limit* means the HCl-equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of chlorine to HCl using RfCs as the health risk metric for long-term exposure and which ensures that maximum annual average ambient concentrations of HCl equivalents do not exceed a Hazard Index of 1.0, rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1), at an off-site receptor location.


*Hazard Index (HI)* means the sum of more than one Hazard Quotient for multiple substances and/or multiple exposure pathways. In this section, the Hazard Index is the sum of the Hazard Quotients for HCl and chlorine.


*Hazard Quotient (HQ)* means the ratio of the predicted media concentration of a pollutant to the media concentration at which no adverse effects are expected. For chronic inhalation exposures, the HQ is calculated under this section as the air concentration divided by the RfC. For acute inhalation exposures, the HQ is calculated under this section as the air concentration divided by the aREL.


*Look-up table analysis* means a risk screening analysis based on comparing the HCl-equivalent emission rate from the affected source to the appropriate HCl-equivalent emission rate limit specified in Tables 1 through 4 of this section.


*Reference Concentration (RfC)* means an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. It can be derived from various types of human or animal data, with uncertainty factors generally applied to reflect limitations of the data used.


(b) *HCl-equivalent emission rates.* (1) You must express total chlorine emission rates for each hazardous waste combustor as HCl-equivalent emission rates.


(2) *Annual average rates.* You must calculate annual average toxicity-weighted HCl-equivalent emission rates for each combustor as follows:


(3) *1-hour average rates.* You must calculate 1-hour average toxicity-weighted HCl-equivalent emission rates for each combustor as follows:


(4) You must use the RfC values for hydrogen chloride and chlorine found at *http://epa.gov/ttn/atw/toxsource/ summary.html.*

(5) You must use the aREL values for hydrogen chloride and chlorine found at *http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/ acute_rels/acuterel.html.*

(6) *Cl*_2_*HCl ratios*—(i) *Ratio for calculating annual average HCl-equivalent emission rates.* (A) To calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) for each combustor, you must apportion the total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv chloride (Cl_(−)_) equivalent) between HCl and chlorine according to the historical average Cl_2_/HCl volumetric ratio for all regulatory compliance tests.


(B) You must calculate HCl and Cl_2_ emission rates (lb/hr) using the apportioned emission concentrations and the gas flowrate and other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.


(C) You must calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate using these HCl and Cl_2_ emission rates and the equation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(ii) *Ratio for calculating 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rates.* (A) To calculate the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each combustor as a criterion for you to determine under paragraph (d) of this section if an hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride may be waived, you must apportion the total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv chloride (Cl_(−)_) equivalent) between HCl and chlorine according to the historical highest Cl_2_/HCl volumetric ratio for all regulatory compliance tests.


(B) You must calculate HCl and Cl_2_ emission rates (lb/hr) using the apportioned emission concentrations and the gas flowrate and other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.


(C) You must calculate the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate using these HCl and Cl_2_ emission rates and the equation in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(iii) *Ratios for new sources.* (A) You must use engineering information to estimate the Cl_2_/HCl volumetric ratio for a new source for the initial eligibility demonstration.


(B) You must use the Cl_2_/HCl volumetric ratio demonstrated during the initial comprehensive performance test to demonstrate in the Notification of Compliance that your HCl-equivalent emission rate does not exceed your HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.


(C) When approving the test plan for the initial comprehensive performance test, the permitting authority will establish a periodic testing requirement, such as every 3 months for 1 year, to establish a record of representative Cl_2_/HCl volumetric ratios.


(*1*) You must revise your HCl-equivalent emission rates and HCl-equivalent emission rate limits after each such test using the procedures prescribed in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(*2*) If you no longer are eligible for the health-based compliance alternative, you must notify the permitting authority immediately and either:


(*i*) Submit a revised eligibility demonstration requesting lower HCl-equivalent emission rate limits, establishing lower HCl-equivalent emission rates, and establishing by downward extrapolation lower feedrate limits for total chlorine and chloride; or


(*ii*) Request a compliance schedule of up to three years to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221.


(iv) *Unrepresentative or inadequate historical Cl*_2_*/HCl volumetric ratios.* (A) If you believe that the Cl_2_/HCl volumetric ratio for one or more historical regulatory compliance tests is not representative of the current ratio, you may request that the permitting authority allow you to screen those ratios from the analysis of historical ratios.


(B) If the permitting authority believes that too few historical ratios are available to calculate a representative average ratio or establish a maximum ratio, the permitting authority may require you to conduct periodic testing to establish representative ratios.


(v) *Updating Cl*_2_*/HCl ratios.* You must include the Cl_2_/HCl volumetric ratio demonstrated during each performance test in your data base of historical Cl2/HCl ratios to update the ratios you establish under paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section for subsequent calculations of the annual average and 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rates.


(7) *Emission rates are capped.* The hydrogen chloride and chlorine emission rates you use to calculate the HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns must not result in total chlorine emission concentrations exceeding:


(i) For incinerators that were existing sources on April 19, 1996: 77 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl_(−)_) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;


(ii) For incinerators that are new or reconstructed sources after April 19, 1996: 21 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl_(−)_) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(c) *Eligibility demonstration*—(1) *General.* (i) You must perform an eligibility demonstration to determine whether the total chlorine emission rates you select for each on-site hazardous waste combustor meet the national exposure standards using either a look-up table analysis prescribed by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or a site-specific compliance demonstration prescribed by paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(ii) You must also determine in your eligibility demonstration whether each combustor may exceed the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate limit absent an hourly rolling average limit on the feedrate of total chlorine and chloride, as provided by paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) *Definition of eligibility.* (i) Eligibility for the risk-based total chlorine standard is determined by comparing the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for the total chlorine emission rate you select for each combustor to the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.


(ii) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit ensures that the Hazard Index for chronic exposure from HCl and chlorine emissions from all on-site hazardous waste combustors is less than or equal to 1.0, rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1), for the actual individual most exposed to the facility's emissions, considering off-site locations where people reside and where people congregate for work, school, or recreation.


(iii) Your facility is eligible for the health-based compliance alternative for total chlorine if either:


(A) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each on-site hazardous waste combustor is below the appropriate value in the look-up table determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or


(B) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each on-site hazardous waste combustor is below the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit you calculate based on a site-specific compliance demonstration under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(3) *Look-up table analysis.* Look-up tables for the eligibility demonstration are provided as Tables 1 and 2 to this section.


(i) Table 1 presents annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limits for sources located in flat terrain. For purposes of this analysis, flat terrain is terrain that rises to a level not exceeding one half the stack height within a distance of 50 stack heights.


(ii) Table 2 presents annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limits for sources located in simple elevated terrain. For purposes of this analysis, simple elevated terrain is terrain that rises to a level exceeding one half the stack height, but that does not exceed the stack height, within a distance of 50 stack heights.


(iii) To determine the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for a source from the look-up table, you must use the stack height and stack diameter for your hazardous waste combustors and the distance between the stack and the property boundary.


(iv) If any of these values for stack height, stack diameter, and distance to nearest property boundary do not match the exact values in the look-up table, you must use the next lowest table value.


(v) *Adjusted HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for multiple on-site combustors.* (A) If you have more than one hazardous waste combustor on site, the sum across all hazardous waste combustors of the ratio of the adjusted HCl-equivalent emission rate limit to the HCl-equivalent emission rate limit provided by Tables 1 or 2 cannot exceed 1.0, according to the following equation:


(B) The adjusted HCl-equivalent emission rate limit becomes the HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.


(4) *Site-specific compliance demonstration.* (i) You may use any scientifically-accepted peer-reviewed risk assessment methodology for your site-specific compliance demonstration to calculate an annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each on-site hazardous waste combustor. An example of one approach for performing the demonstration for air toxics can be found in the EPA's “Air Toxics Risk Assessment Reference Library, Volume 2, Site-Specific Risk Assessment Technical Resource Document,” which may be obtained through the EPA's Air Toxics Web site at *http://www.epa.gov/ttn/fera/risk_atra_main.html.*

(ii) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit is the HCl-equivalent emission rate that ensures that the Hazard Index associated with maximum annual average exposures is not greater than 1.0 rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1).


(iii) To determine the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, your site-specific compliance demonstration must, at a minimum:


(A) Estimate long-term inhalation exposures through the estimation of annual or multi-year average ambient concentrations;


(B) Estimate the inhalation exposure for the actual individual most exposed to the facility's emissions from hazardous waste combustors, considering off-site locations where people reside and where people congregate for work, school, or recreation;


(C) Use site-specific, quality-assured data wherever possible;


(D) Use health-protective default assumptions wherever site-specific data are not available, and:


(E) Contain adequate documentation of the data and methods used for the assessment so that it is transparent and can be reproduced by an experienced risk assessor and emissions measurement expert.


(iv) Your site-specific compliance demonstration need not:


(A) Assume any attenuation of exposure concentrations due to the penetration of outdoor pollutants into indoor exposure areas;


(B) Assume any reaction or deposition of the emitted pollutants during transport from the emission point to the point of exposure.


(d) *Assurance that the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate limit will not be exceeded.* To ensure that the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate limit will not be exceeded when complying with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, you must establish a 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each combustor, establish a 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each combustor, and consider site-specific factors including prescribed criteria to determine if the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit may be exceeded absent an hourly rolling average limit on the feedrate of total chlorine and chloride. If the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit may be exceeded, you must establish an hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine as provided by paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(1) *1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate.* You must calculate the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate from the total chlorine emission concentration you select for each source as prescribed in paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.


(2) *1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.* You must establish the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each affected source using either a look-up table analysis or site-specific analysis:


(i) *Look-up table analysis.* Look-up tables are provided for 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limits as Table 3 and Table 4 to this section. Table 3 provides limits for facilities located in flat terrain. Table 4 provides limits for facilities located in simple elevated terrain. You must use the Tables to establish 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limits as prescribed in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) through (c)(3)(v) of this section for annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limits.


(ii) *Site-specific analysis.* The 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit is the HCl-equivalent emission rate that ensures that the Hazard Index associated with maximum 1-hour average exposures is not greater than 1.0 rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1). You must follow the risk assessment procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to estimate short-term inhalation exposures through the estimation of maximum 1-hour average ambient concentrations.


(3) *Criteria for determining whether the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate may be exceeded absent an hourly rolling average limit on the feedrate of total chlorine and chloride.* An hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride is waived if you determine considering the criteria listed below that the long-term feedrate limit (and averaging period) established under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section will also ensure that the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate will not exceed the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit you calculate for each combustor.


(i) The ratio of the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate based on the total chlorine emission rate you select for each hazardous waste combustor to the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for the combustor; and

You must also submit a separate copy of the eligibility demonstration to: U.S. EPA, Risk and Exposure Assessment Group, Emission Standards Division (C404-01), Attn: Group Leader, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, electronic mail address *REAG@epa.gov.*

(B) Your permitting authority should notify you of approval or intent to disapprove your eligibility demonstration within 6 months after receipt of the original demonstration, and within 3 months after receipt of any supplemental information that you submit. A notice of intent to disapprove your eligibility demonstration, whether before or after the compliance date, will identify incomplete or inaccurate information or noncompliance with prescribed procedures and specify how much time you will have to submit additional information or to achieve the MACT standards for total chlorine under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221. If your eligibility demonstration is disapproved, the permitting authority may extend the compliance date of the total chlorine standards up to one year to allow you to make changes to the design or operation of the combustor or related systems as quickly as practicable to enable you to achieve compliance with the MACT total chlorine standards.


(C) If your permitting authority has not approved your eligibility demonstration by the compliance date, and has not issued a notice of intent to disapprove your demonstration, you may begin complying, on the compliance date, with the HCl-equivalent emission rate limits you present in your eligibility demonstration provided that you have made a good faith effort to provide complete and accurate information and to respond to any requests for additional information in a timely manner. If the permitting authority believes that you have not made a good faith effort to provide complete and accurate information or to respond to any requests for additional information, however, the authority may notify you in writing by the compliance date that you have not met the conditions for complying with the health-based compliance alternative without prior approval. Such notice will explain the basis for concluding that you have not made a good faith effort to comply with the health-based compliance alternative by the compliance date.


(D) If your permitting authority issues a notice of intent to disapprove your eligibility demonstration after the compliance date, the authority will identify the basis for that notice and specify how much time you will have to submit additional information or to comply with the MACT standards for total chlorine under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221. The permitting authority may extend the compliance date of the total chlorine standards up to one-year to allow you to make changes to the design or operation of the combustor or related systems as quickly as practicable to enable you to achieve compliance with the MACT standards for total chlorine.


(ii) *New or reconstructed sources*—(A) *General.* The procedures for review and approval of eligibility demonstrations applicable to existing sources under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section also apply to new or reconstructed sources, except that the date you must submit the eligibility demonstration is as prescribed in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii).


(B) If you operate a new or reconstructed source that starts up before April 12, 2007, or a solid fuel boiler or liquid fuel boiler that is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP before April 12, 2007, you must either:


(*1*) Comply with the final total chlorine emission standards under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221, by October 12, 2005, or upon startup, whichever is later, except for a standard that is more stringent than the standard proposed on April 20, 2004 for your source. If a final standard is more stringent than the proposed standard, you may comply with the proposed standard until October 14, 2008, after which you must comply with the final standard; or


(*2*) Submit an eligibility demonstration for review and approval under this section by April 12, 2006, and comply with the HCl-equivalent emission rate limits and operating requirements you establish in the eligibility demonstration.


(C) If you operate a new or reconstructed source that starts up on or after April 12, 2007, or a solid fuel boiler or liquid fuel boiler that is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP on or after April 12, 2007, you must either:


(*1*) Comply with the final total chlorine emission standards under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221 upon startup. If the final standard is more stringent than the standard proposed for your source on April 20, 2004, however, and if you start operations before October 14, 2008, you may comply with the proposed standard until October 14, 2008, after which you must comply with the final standard; or


(*2*) Submit an eligibility demonstration for review and approval under this section 12 months prior to startup.


(3) The operating requirements in the eligibility demonstration are applicable requirements for purposes of parts 70 and 71 of this chapter and will be incorporated in the title V permit.


(f) *Testing requirements*—(1) *General.* You must comply with the requirements for comprehensive performance testing under § 63.1207.


(2) *System removal efficiency.* (i) You must calculate the total chlorine removal efficiency of the combustor during each run of the comprehensive performance test.

(iii) If your source does not control emissions of total chlorine, you must assume zero system removal efficiency.


(3) *Annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.* If emissions during the comprehensive performance test exceed the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, eligibility for emission limits under this section is not affected. This emission rate limit is an annual average limit even though compliance is based on a 12-hour or (up to) an annual rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride because the feedrate limit is also used for compliance assurance for the semivolatile metal emission standard


(4) *1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.* Total chlorine emissions during each run of the comprehensive performance test cannot exceed the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.


(5) *Test methods.* (i) If you operate a cement kiln or a combustor equipped with a dry acid gas scrubber, you must use EPA Method 320/321 or ASTM D 6735-01, or an equivalent method, to measure hydrogen chloride, and the back-half (caustic impingers) of Method 26/26A, or an equivalent method, to measure chlorine gas.


(ii) *Bromine and sulfur considerations.* If you operate an incinerator, boiler, or lightweight aggregate kiln and your feedstreams contain bromine or sulfur during the comprehensive performance test at levels specified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, you must use EPA Method 320/321 or ASTM D 6735-01, or an equivalent method, to measure hydrogen chloride, and Method 26/26A, or an equivalent method, to measure chlorine and hydrogen chloride, and determine your chlorine emissions as follows:


(A) You must determine your chlorine emissions to be the higher of the value measured by Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A-8, part 60 of this chapter, or an equivalent method, or the value calculated by the difference between the combined hydrogen chloride and chlorine levels measured by Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A-8, part 60 of this chapter, or an equivalent method, and the hydrogen chloride measurement from EPA Method 320/321 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this chapter, or ASTM D 6735-01 as described under § 63.1208(b)(5)(i)(C), or an equivalent method.


(B) The procedures under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for determining hydrogen chloride and chlorine emissions apply if you feed bromine or sulfur during the performance test at the levels specified in this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B):


(*1*) If the bromine/chlorine ratio in feedstreams is greater than 5 percent by mass; or


(*2*) If the sulfur/chlorine ratio in feedstreams is greater than 50 percent by mass.


(g) *Monitoring requirements*—(1) *General.* You must establish and comply with limits on the same operating parameters that apply to sources complying with the MACT standard for total chlorine under § 63.1209(o), except that feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride must be established according to paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section:


(2) *Feedrate limit to ensure compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.* (i) For sources subject to the feedrate limit for total chlorine and chloride under § 63.1209(n)(4) to ensure compliance with the semivolatile metals standard:


(A) The feedrate limit (and averaging period) for total chlorine and chloride to ensure compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit is the same as required by § 63.1209(n)(4), except as provided by paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.


(B) The numerical value of the total chlorine and chloride feedrate limit (i.e., not considering the averaging period) you establish under § 63.1209(n)(4) must not exceed the value you calculate as the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit (lb/hr) divided by [1 − system removal efficiency], where the system removal efficiency is calculated as prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section. 


(ii) For sources exempt from the feedrate limit for total chlorine and chloride under § 63.1209(n)(4) because they comply with § 63.1207(m)(2), the feedrate limit for total chlorine and chloride to ensure compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate must be established as follows:


(A) You must establish an average period for the feedrate limit that does not exceed an annual rolling average;


(B) The numerical value of the total chlorine and chloride feedrate limit (i.e., not considering the averaging period) must not exceed the value you calculate as the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit (lb/hr) divided by [1 − system removal efficiency], where the system removal efficiency is calculated as prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section.


(C) You must calculate the initial rolling average as though you had selected a 12-hour rolling average, as provided by paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. You must calculate rolling averages thereafter as the average of the available one-minute values until enough one-minute values are available to calculate the rolling average period you select. At that time and thereafter, you update the rolling average feedrate each hour with a 60-minute average feedrate.


(3) *Feedrate limit to ensure compliance with the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.* (i) You must establish an hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride to ensure compliance with the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit unless you determine that the hourly rolling average feedrate limit is waived under paragraph (d) of this section.


(ii) You must calculate the hourly rolling average feedrate limit for total chlorine and chloride as the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit (lb/hr) divided by [1 − system removal efficiency], where the system removal efficiency is calculated as prescribed by paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.


(h) *Changes*—(1) *Changes over which you have control*—(i) *Changes that would affect the HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.* (A) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the facility in a manner than would decrease the annual average or 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, you must submit to the permitting authority prior to the change a revised eligibility demonstration documenting the lower emission rate limits and calculations of reduced total chlorine and chloride feedrate limits.


(B) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the facility in a manner than would increase the annual average or 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, and you elect to increase your total chlorine and chloride feedrate limits. You must also submit to the permitting authority prior to the change a revised eligibility demonstration documenting the increased emission rate limits and calculations of the increased feedrate limits prior to the change.


(ii) *Changes that could affect system removal efficiency.* (A) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor in a manner than could decrease the system removal efficiency, you are subject to the requirements of § 63.1206(b)(5) for conducting a performance test to reestablish the combustor's system removal efficiency and you must submit a revised eligibility demonstration documenting the lower system removal efficiency and the reduced feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride.


(B) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor in a manner than could increase the system removal efficiency, and you elect to document the increased system removal efficiency to establish higher feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride, you are subject to the requirements of § 63.1206(b)(5) for conducting a performance test to reestablish the combustor's system removal efficiency. You must also submit to the permitting authority a revised eligibility demonstration documenting the higher system removal efficiency and the increased feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride.


(2) *Changes over which you do not have control that may decrease the HCl-equivalent emission rate limits.* These requirements apply if you use a site-specific risk assessment under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to demonstrate eligibility for the health-based limits.


(i) *Proactive review.* You must submit for review and approval with each comprehensive performance test plan either a certification that the information used in your eligibility demonstration has not changed in a manner that would decrease the annual average or 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, or a revised eligibility demonstration.


(ii) *Reactive review.* If in the interim between your comprehensive performance tests you have reason to know of changes that would decrease the annual average or 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, you must submit a revised eligibility demonstration as soon as practicable but not more frequently than annually.


(iii) *Compliance schedule.* If you determine that you cannot demonstrate compliance with a lower annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit during the comprehensive performance test because you need additional time to complete changes to the design or operation of the source, you may request that the permitting authority grant you additional time to make those changes as quickly as practicable.
