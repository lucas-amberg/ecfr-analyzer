# § 63.1218   What are the standards for hydrochloric acid production furnaces that burn hazardous waste?

(a) *Emission limits for existing sources.* You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:


(1) For dioxins and furans, either carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon emissions in excess of the limits provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this section;


(2) For mercury, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section;


(3) For lead and cadmium, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section;


(4) For arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section;


(5) For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, either:


(i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or


(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;


(6) For hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas, either:


(i) Emission in excess of 150 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as a chloride (Cl_(−)_ equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or


(ii) Emissions greater than the levels that would be emitted if the source is achieving a system removal efficiency (SRE) of less than 99.923 percent for total chlorine and chloride fed to the combustor. You must calculate SRE from the following equation: 


(7) For particulate matter, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section.


(b) *Emission limits for new sources.* You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:


(1) For dioxins and furans, either carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon emissions in excess of the limits provided by paragraph (b)(5) of this section;


(2) For mercury, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (b)(6) of this section;


(3) For lead and cadmium, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (b)(6) of this section;


(4) For arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (b)(6) of this section;


(5) For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, either:


(i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or


(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;


(6) For hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas, either:


(i) Emission in excess of 25 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as a chloride (Cl_(−)_ equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or


(ii) Emissions greater than the levels that would be emitted if the source is achieving a system removal efficiency (SRE) of less than 99.987 percent for total chlorine and chloride fed to the combustor. You must calculate SRE from the following equation: 


(7) For particulate matter, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (b)(6) of this section.


(c) *Destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) standard*—(1) *99.99% DRE.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must achieve a DRE of 99.99% for each principle organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation: 


(2) *99.9999% DRE.* If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see § 261.31 of this chapter), you must achieve a DRE of 99.9999% for each POHC that you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-*p*-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the Administrator of your intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027.


(3) *Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs).* (i) You must treat the POHCs in the waste feed that you specify under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to the extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.


(ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.


(d) *Significant figures.* The emission limits provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two significant figures to document compliance.


(e) *Elective standards for area sources.* Area sources as defined under § 63.2 are subject to the standards for cadmium and lead, the standards for arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, the standards for hydrogen chloride and chlorine, and the standards for particulate matter under this section if they elect under § 266.100(b)(3) of this chapter to comply with those standards in lieu of the standards under 40 CFR 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 to control those pollutants.
