You must calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation: 


(2) *99.9999% DRE.* If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see § 261.31 of this chapter), you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999% for each principle organic hazardous constituent (POHC) that you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-*p*-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the Administrator of your intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027. 


(3) *Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs).* (i) You must treat the Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) in the waste feed that you specify under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to the extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. 


(ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information. 


(d) *Cement kilns with in-line kiln raw mills*—(1) *General.* (i) You must conduct performance testing when the raw mill is on-line and when the mill is off-line to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards, and you must establish separate operating parameter limits under § 63.1209 for each mode of operation, except as provided by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. 


(ii) You must document in the operating record each time you change from one mode of operation to the alternate mode and begin complying with the operating parameter limits for that alternate mode of operation. 


(iii) You must calculate rolling averages for operating parameter limits as provided by § 63.1209(q)(2).


(iv) If your in-line kiln raw mill has dual stacks, you may assume that the dioxin/furan emission levels in the by-pass stack and the operating parameter limits determined during performance testing of the by-pass stack when the raw mill is off-line are the same as when the mill is on-line. 


(2) *Emissions averaging.* You may comply with the mercury, semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, and hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas emission standards on a time-weighted average basis under the following procedures: 


(i) *Averaging methodology.* You must calculate the time-weighted average emission concentration with the following equation:

(B) You must include historical raw mill operation data in the performance test plan to estimate future raw mill down-time and document in the performance test plan that estimated emissions and estimated raw mill down-time will not result in an exceedance of an emission standard on an annual basis. 


(C) You must document in the notification of compliance submitted under § 63.1207(j) that an emission standard will not be exceeded based on the documented emissions from the performance test and predicted raw mill down-time. 


(e) *Preheater or preheater/precalciner kilns with dual stacks*—(1) *General.* You must conduct performance testing on each stack to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards, and you must establish operating parameter limits under § 63.1209 for each stack, except as provided by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section for dioxin/furan emissions testing and operating parameter limits for the by-pass stack of in-line raw mills. 


(2) *Emissions averaging.* You may comply with the mercury, semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, and hydrochloric acid/chlorine gas emission standards specified in this section on a gas flowrate-weighted average basis under the following procedures: 


(i) *Averaging methodology.* You must calculate the gas flowrate-weighted average emission concentration using the following equation:


(ii) *Compliance.* (A) You must demonstrate compliance with the emission standard(s) using the emission concentrations determined from the performance tests and the equation provided by paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and 


(B) You must develop operating parameter limits for bypass stack and main stack flowrates that ensure the emission concentrations calculated with the equation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section do not exceed the emission standards on a 12-hour rolling average basis. You must include these flowrate limits in the Notification of Compliance. 


(iii) *Notification.* If you elect to document compliance under this emissions averaging provision, you must: 


(A) Notify the Administrator in the initial comprehensive performance test plan submitted under § 63.1207(e). The performance test plan must include, at a minimum, information describing the flowrate limits established under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section; and 


(B) Document in the Notification of Compliance submitted under § 63.1207(j) the demonstrated gas flowrate-weighted average emissions that you calculate with the equation provided by paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 


(f) *Significant figures.* The emission limits provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two significant figures to document compliance. 


(g) [Reserved] 


(h) When you comply with the particulate matter requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) or (b)(7) of this section, you are exempt from the New Source Performance Standard for particulate matter and opacity under § 60.60 of this chapter.


(i) The provisions of this section no longer apply after any of the following dates, whichever occurs first:


(1) The date that your source begins to comply with § 63.1220 by placing a Documentation of Compliance in the operating record pursuant to § 63.1211(c);


(2) The date that your source begins to comply with § 63.1220 by submitting a Notification of Compliance pursuant to § 63.1210(b); or
