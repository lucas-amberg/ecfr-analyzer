# § 63.1205   What are the standards for hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kilns that are effective until compliance with the standards under § 63.1221?

(a) *Emission limits for existing sources.* You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain: 


(1) For dioxins and furans: 


(i) Emissions in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or 


(ii) Rapid quench of the combustion gas temperature at the exit of the (last) combustion chamber (or exit of any waste heat recovery system) to 400 °F or lower based on the average of the test run average temperatures. You must also notify in writing the RCRA authority that you are complying with this option; 


(2) Mercury in excess of 120 µg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen; 


(3) Lead and cadmium in excess of 250 µg/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen; 


(4) Arsenic, beryllium, and chromium in excess of 110 µg/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen; 


(5) *Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.* (i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, you also must document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 20 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or 


(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 20 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average, dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; 


(6) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in excess of 600 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as hydrochloric acid equivalents, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and 


(7) Particulate matter in excess of 57 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen. 


(b) *Emission limits for new sources.* You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain: 


(1) For dioxins and furans: 


(i) Emissions in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or 


(ii) Rapid quench of the combustion gas temperature at the exit of the (last) combustion chamber (or exit of any waste heat recovery system) to 400 °F or lower based on the average of the test run average temperatures. You must also notify in writing the RCRA authority that you are complying with this option; 


(2) Mercury in excess of 120 µg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen; 


(3) Lead and cadmium in excess of 43 µg/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen; 


(4) Arsenic, beryllium, and chromium in excess of 110 µg/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen; 


(5) *Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.* (i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, you also must document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 20 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or 


(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 20 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average, dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; 


(6) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in excess of 600 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as hydrochloric acid equivalents, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and 


(7) Particulate matter in excess of 57 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen. 


(c) *Destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) standard*—(1) *99.99% DRE.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation: 


(2) *99.9999% DRE.* If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see § 261.31 of this chapter), you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) that you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the Administrator of your intent to burn hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027. 


(3) *Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs).* (i) You must treat the Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) in the waste feed that you specify under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to the extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. 


(ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information. 


(d) *Significant figures.* The emission limits provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two significant figures to document compliance.


(e) The provisions of this section no longer apply after any of the following dates, whichever occurs first:


(1) The date that your source begins to comply with § 63.1221 by placing a Documentation of Compliance in the operating record pursuant to § 63.1211(c);


(2) The date that your source begins to comply with § 63.1221 by submitting a Notification of Compliance pursuant to § 63.1210(b); or


(3) The date for your source to comply with § 63.1221 pursuant to § 63.1206 and any extensions granted there under.
