(iv) If your in-line kiln raw mill has dual stacks, you may assume that the dioxin/furan emission levels in the by-pass stack and the operating parameter limits determined during performance testing of the by-pass stack when the raw mill is off-line are the same as when the mill is on-line.


(v) In lieu of conducting a performance test to demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standards for the mode of operation when the raw mill is on-line, you may specify in the performance test workplan and Notification of Compliance the same operating parameter limits required under § 63.1209(k) for the mode of operation when the raw mill is on-line as you establish during performance testing for the mode of operation when the raw mill is off-line.

(B) You must include historical raw mill operation data in the performance test plan to estimate future raw mill down-time and document in the performance test plan that estimated emissions and estimated raw mill down-time will not result in an exceedance of an emission standard on an annual basis.


(C) You must document in the notification of compliance submitted under § 63.1207(j) that an emission standard will not be exceeded based on the documented emissions from the performance test and predicted raw mill down-time.


(e) *Preheater or preheater/precalciner kilns with dual stacks*—(1) *General.* You must conduct performance testing on each stack to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards, and you must establish operating parameter limits under § 63.1209 for each stack, except as provided by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section for dioxin/furan emissions testing and operating parameter limits for the by-pass stack of in-line raw mills.


(2) *Emissions averaging.* You may comply with the mercury, semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, and hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas emission standards specified in this section on a gas flowrate-weighted average basis under the following procedures:


(i) *Averaging methodology.* You must calculate the gas flowrate-weighted average emission concentration using the following equation:

(f) *Significant figures.* The emission limits provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two significant figures to document compliance.


(g) [Reserved]


(h) When you comply with the particulate matter requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) or (b)(7) of this section, you are exempt from the New Source Performance Standard for particulate matter and opacity under § 60.60 of this chapter.
