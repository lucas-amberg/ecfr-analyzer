(a) This subpart provides applicability provisions, definitions, and other general provisions that are applicable to subparts G and H of this part. This subpart also provides requirements for certain heat exchange systems, maintenance wastewater, and flares.

 


(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this section, the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part apply to chemical manufacturing process units that meet all the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section: 


(1) Manufacture as a primary product one or more of the chemicals listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.


(i) One or more of the chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart; or


(ii) One or more of the chemicals listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section:


(A) Tetrahydrobenzaldehyde (CAS Number 100-50-5); or


(B) Crotonaldehyde (CAS Number 123-73-9).


(2) Use as a reactant or manufacture as a product, or co-product, one or more of the organic hazardous air pollutants listed in table 2 of this subpart; 


(3) Are located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in section 112(a) of the Act. 


(4) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing processing unit is exempt from all requirements of subparts F, G, and H of this part until not later than April 22, 1997 if the owner or operator certifies, in a notification to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, not later than May 14, 1996, that the plant site at which the chemical manufacturing processing unit is located emits, and will continue to emit, during any 12-month period, less than 10 tons per year of any individual hazardous air pollutants (HAP), and less than 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP. 


(i) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are not federally enforceable (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator shall document the basis for the determination as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) through (b)(4)(i)(C) and comply with the recordkeeping requirement in 63.103(f). 


(A) The owner or operator shall identify all HAP emission points at the plant site, including those emission points subject to and emission points not subject to subparts F, G, and H; 


(B) The owner or operator shall calculate the amount of annual HAP emissions released from each emission point at the plant site, using acceptable measurement or estimating techniques for maximum expected operating conditions at the plant site. Examples of estimating procedures that are considered acceptable include the calculation procedures in § 63.150 of subpart G, the early reduction demonstration procedures specified in §§ 63.74 (c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (g), or accepted engineering practices. If the total annual HAP emissions for the plant site are annually reported under Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) section 313, then such reported annual emissions may be used to satisfy the requirements of § 63.100(b)(4)(i)(B). 


(C) The owner or operator shall sum the amount of annual HAP emissions from all emission points on the plant site. If the total emissions of any one HAP are less than 10 tons per year and the total emissions of any combination of HAP are less than 25 tons per year, the plant site qualifies for the exemption described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, provided that emissions are kept below these thresholds. 


(ii) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are federally enforceable (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 


(c) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing process unit that meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section but does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product, any organic hazardous air pollutant listed in table 2 of this subpart shall comply only with the requirements of § 63.103(e) of this subpart. To comply with this subpart, such chemical manufacturing process units shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subpart A of this part. 


(d) The primary product of a chemical manufacturing process unit shall be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section.


(1) If a chemical manufacturing process unit produces more than one intended chemical product, the product with the greatest annual design capacity on a mass basis determines the primary product of the process. 


(2) If a chemical manufacturing process unit has two or more products that have the same maximum annual design capacity on a mass basis and if one of those chemicals is listed in table 1 of this subpart, then the listed chemical is considered the primary product and the chemical manufacturing process unit is subject to this subpart. If more than one of the products is listed in table 1 of this subpart, then the owner or operator may designate as the primary product any of the listed chemicals and the chemical manufacturing process unit is subject to this subpart. 


(3) For chemical manufacturing process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units producing one or more chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart, the primary product shall be determined for existing sources based on the expected utilization for the five years following April 22, 1994 and for new sources based on the expected utilization for the first five years after initial start-up.


(i) If the predominant use of the flexible operation unit, as described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section, is to produce one or more chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart, then the flexible operation unit shall be subject to the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part. 


(A) If the flexible operation unit produces one product for the greatest annual operating time, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit. 


(B) If the flexible operation unit produces multiple chemicals equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest annual production on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.


(ii) The determination of applicability of this subpart to chemical manufacturing process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units shall be reported as part of an operating permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority. 


(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, for chemical manufacturing process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units producing a chemical listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the primary product shall be determined for existing sources based on the expected utilization for the five years following May 12, 1998 and for new sources based on the expected utilization for the first five years after initial start-up.


(i) The predominant use of the flexible operation unit shall be determined according to paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section. If the predominant use is to produce one of the chemicals listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, then the flexible operation unit shall be subject to the provisions of this subpart and subparts G and H of this part.


(ii) The determination of applicability of this subpart to chemical manufacturing process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units shall be reported as part of an operating permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority.

(1) Where a storage vessel is dedicated to a chemical manufacturing process unit, the storage vessel shall be considered part of that chemical manufacturing process unit.


(i) If the chemical manufacturing process unit is subject to this subpart according to the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then the storage vessel is part of the source to which this subpart applies. 


(ii) If the chemical manufacturing process unit is not subject to this subpart according to the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then the storage vessel is not part of the source to which this subpart applies. 


(2) If a storage vessel is not dedicated to a single chemical manufacturing process unit, then the applicability of this subpart F and subpart G of this part shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (g)(2)(iii) of this section. 


(i) If a storage vessel is shared among chemical manufacturing process units and one of the process units has the predominant use, as determined by paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) and (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, then the storage vessel is part of that chemical manufacturing process unit. 


(A) If the greatest input into the storage vessel is from a chemical manufacturing process unit that is located on the same plant site, then that chemical manufacturing process unit has the predominant use. 


(B) If the greatest input into the storage vessel is provided from a chemical manufacturing process unit that is not located on the same plant site, then the predominant use is the chemical manufacturing process unit on the same plant site that receives the greatest amount of material from the storage vessel. 


(ii) If a storage vessel is shared among chemical manufacturing process units so that there is no single predominant use, and at least one of those chemical manufacturing process units is subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be considered to be part of the chemical manufacturing process unit that is subject to this subpart. If more than one chemical manufacturing process unit is subject to this subpart, the owner or operator may assign the storage vessel to any of the chemical manufacturing process units subject to this subpart. 


(iii) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the criteria in paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(A) and (g)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, as applicable. This determination shall be reported as part of an operating permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority. 


(A) For chemical manufacturing process units that produce one or more of the chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart and meet the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the applicability shall be based on the utilization that occurred during the 12-month period preceding April 22, 1994.
