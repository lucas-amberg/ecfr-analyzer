In the case of duplicate units in the BOPF Group, the BOPF Group for purposes of this rule means only those units operating at the time of the test sequence. See related definitions in this section for “primary emissions,” “primary emission control system,” “secondary emissions,” and “secondary emission control system.”

*Emission limitation* means any emission limit, opacity limit, or operating limit.


*Hot metal transfer station* means the location in a basic oxygen process furnace shop where molten iron (hot metal) is transferred from a torpedo car or hot metal car used to transport hot metal from the blast furnace casthouse to a holding vessel or ladle in the basic oxygen process furnace shop. This location also is known as the reladling station or ladle transfer station.


*Integrated iron and steel manufacturing facility* means an establishment engaged in the production of steel from iron ore.


*Iron beaching operation* means pouring hot molten iron from a torpedo car onto the ground when the iron from the blast furnace cannot be charged to the basic oxygen process furnace.








*Ladle metallurgy* means a secondary steelmaking process that is performed typically in a ladle after initial refining in a basic oxygen process furnace to adjust or amend the chemical and/or mechanical properties of steel. This definition does not include vacuum degassing.




*Large blast furnace* means a blast furnace with a working volume of greater than 2,500 m
3.




*Mercury switch* means each mercury-containing capsule or switch assembly that is part of a convenience light switch mechanism installed in a motor vehicle.


*Motor vehicle* means an automotive vehicle not operated on rails and usually operated with rubber tires for use on roads and highways.


*Motor vehicle scrap* means post-consumer scrap from discarded automotive vehicles, in whole or in part, including automobile body hulks that have been processed through a shredder. Motor vehicle scrap does not include automobile manufacturing bundles or miscellaneous vehicle parts, such as wheels and bumpers, which do not contain mercury switches.


*Opening* means any roof monitor, vent, door, window, hole, crack or other conduit that allows gas to escape to the atmosphere from a blast furnace casthouse or BOPF shop.




*Planned bleeder valve opening* means the opening of a blast furnace pressure relief safety valve that is initiated by an operator.






*Post-consumer steel scrap* means steel scrap that is composed of materials made of steel that were purchased by households or by commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities in their role as end-users of the product and which can no longer be used for its intended purpose.


*Pre-consumer steel scrap* means steel scrap that is left over from industrial or manufacturing processes and which is subsequently recycled as scrap. Other terms used to describe this scrap are new, home, run-around, prompt-industrial, and return scrap.


*Primary emissions* means particulate matter emissions from the basic oxygen process furnace generated during the steel production cycle which are captured and treated in the furnace's primary emission control system.


*Primary emission control system* means the combination of equipment used for the capture and collection of primary emissions (*e.g.,* an open hood capture system used in conjunction with an electrostatic precipitator or a closed hood system used in conjunction with a scrubber).


*Primary oxygen blow* means the period in the steel production cycle of a basic oxygen process furnace during which oxygen is blown through the molten iron bath by means of a lance inserted from the top of the vessel (top-blown) or through tuyeres in the bottom and/or sides of the vessel (bottom-blown).


*Responsible official* means responsible official as defined in § 63.2.


*Scrap provider* means the company or person (including a broker) who contracts directly with an integrated iron and steel manufacturing facility to provide steel scrap. Scrap processors, such as shredder operators or vehicle dismantlers, who do not sell scrap directly to an integrated iron and steel manufacturing facility are not scrap providers.


*Secondary emissions* means particulate matter emissions that are not controlled by a primary emission control system, including emissions that escape from open and closed hoods, lance hole openings, and gaps or tears in ductwork to the primary emission control system.

*Sinter cooler* means the apparatus used to cool the hot sinter product that is transferred from the discharge end through contact with large volumes of induced or forced draft air.


*Sinter plant* means the machine used to produce a fused clinker-like aggregate or sinter of fine iron-bearing materials suited for use in a blast furnace. The machine is composed of a continuous traveling grate that conveys a bed of ore fines and other finely divided iron-bearing material and fuel (typically coke breeze), a burner at the feed end of the grate for ignition, and a series of downdraft windboxes along the length of the strand to support downdraft combustion and heat sufficient to produce a fused sinter product.


*Skimming station* means the locations inside a basic oxygen process furnace shop where slag is removed from the top of the molten metal bath.


*Slip* means when raw materials loaded in the top of the furnace fail to descend smoothly in the furnace and bind together to form a “bridge” which than “hangs” (*i.e.,* accumulates) in one position in the furnace. When a “hang” eventually falls, or “slips,” it creates a pressure surge that may open the bleeder valves, releasing emissions in the form of a large dust cloud.


*Small blast furnace* means a blast furnace with a working volume of less than 2,500 m
3.








*Specialty metal scrap* means scrap where the only materials from motor vehicles in the scrap are materials (such as certain exhaust systems) recovered for their specialty alloy content (including, but not limited to, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or other alloys), and, based on the nature of the scrap and purchase specifications, the scrap is not expected to contain mercury switches.


*Steel production cycle* means the operations conducted within the basic oxygen process furnace shop that are required to produce each batch of steel. The following operations are included: scrap charging, preheating (when done), hot metal charging, primary oxygen blowing, sampling, (vessel turndown and turnup), additional oxygen blowing (when done), tapping, and deslagging. The steel production cycle begins when the scrap is charged to the furnace and ends after the slag is emptied from the vessel Into the slag pot.


*Steel scrap* means pre-consumer and post-consumer discarded steel that is processed by scrap providers for resale (post-consumer) or used on-site (pre-consumer or run-around scrap from within a facility or company). Post-consumer steel scrap may or may not contain motor vehicle scrap, depending on the type of scrap.


*Top-blown furnace* means any basic oxygen process furnace in which oxygen is introduced into the bath of molten iron by means of an oxygen lance inserted from the top of the vessel.


*Total hydrocarbons (THC)* means the sum of organic compounds measured as carbon using EPA Method 25A (appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter).


*Unplanned bleeder valve opening* means the opening of a blast furnace pressure relief safety valve that is not a planned bleeder valve opening.
