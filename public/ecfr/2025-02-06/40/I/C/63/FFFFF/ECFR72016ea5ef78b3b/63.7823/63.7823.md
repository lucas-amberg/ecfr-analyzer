# § 63.7823   What test methods and other procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance with the opacity limits?

(a) For each discharge end of a sinter plant, sinter plant cooler, blast furnace casthouse, BOPF shop, and large bell on a blast furnace, you must conduct each performance test that applies to your affected source based on representative performance (*i.e.,* performance based on normal operating conditions) of the affected source for the period being tested, according to the conditions detailed in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You shall not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.




(b) You must conduct each visible emissions performance test such that the opacity observations overlap with the performance test for particulate matter.


(c) To determine compliance with the applicable opacity limit in Table 1 to this subpart for a sinter plant discharge end or a blast furnace casthouse:


(1) Using a certified observer, determine the opacity of emissions according to EPA Method 9 in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter. Alternatively, ASTM D7520-16, (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) may be used with the following conditions:


(i) During the digital camera opacity technique (DCOT) certification procedure outlined in Section 9.2 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), the owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must present the plumes in front of various backgrounds of color and contrast representing conditions anticipated during field use such as blue sky, trees, and mixed backgrounds (clouds and/or a sparse tree stand).


(ii) The owner or operator must also have standard operating procedures in place including daily or other frequency quality checks to ensure the equipment is within manufacturing specifications as outlined in Section 8.1 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).


(iii) The owner or operator must follow the recordkeeping procedures outlined in § 63.10(b)(1) for the DCOT certification, compliance report, data sheets, and all raw unaltered JPEGs used for opacity and certification determination.


(iv) The owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must have a minimum of four independent technology users apply the software to determine the visible opacity of the 300 certification plumes. For each set of 25 plumes, the user may not exceed 15-percent opacity of anyone reading and the average error must not exceed 7.5-percent opacity.


(v) Use of this approved alternative does not provide or imply a certification or validation of any vendor's hardware or software. The onus to maintain and verify the certification and/or training of the DCOT camera, software, and operator in accordance with ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and these requirements is on the facility, DCOT operator, and DCOT vendor.


(2) Obtain a minimum of 30 6-minute block averages. For a blast furnace casthouse, make observations during tapping of the furnace. Tapping begins when the furnace is opened, usually by creating a hole near the bottom of the furnace, and ends when the hole is plugged.




(3) For the blast furnace casthouse, make observations at each opening:


(i) If EPA Method 9 is used, observations should be made separately at each opening.


(ii) If ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is used, observations may be read for more than one opening at the same time.
