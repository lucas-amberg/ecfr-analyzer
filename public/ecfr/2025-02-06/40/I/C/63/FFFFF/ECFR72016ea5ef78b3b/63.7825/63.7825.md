# § 63.7825   What test methods and other procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits for hazardous air pollutants?

(a) If demonstrating compliance with the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart through performance testing, you must conduct a performance test to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limit. If demonstrating compliance with the emission limit through performance testing, you must conduct each performance test that applies to your affected source based on representative performance (*i.e.,* performance based on normal operating conditions) of the affected source for the period being tested, according to the conditions detailed in paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You shall not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. Initial compliance tests must be conducted by the deadlines in § 63.7820(e).




(1) You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.


(2) For sources with multiple emission units ducted to a common control device and stack, compliance testing must be performed either by conducting a single compliance test with all affected emissions units in operation or by conducting a separate compliance test on each emissions unit. Alternatively, the owner or operator may request approval from the permit authority for an alternative testing approach. If the units are tested separately, any emissions unit that is not tested initially must be tested as soon as is practicable.


(b) To demonstrate compliance with the emission limit for mercury in Table 1 to this subpart through performance testing, follow the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Determine the concentration of mercury according to the following test methods:


(i) EPA Method 1 in appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter to select sampling port locations and the number of traverse points. Sampling ports must be located at the outlet of the control device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.


(ii) EPA Method 2 or 2F in appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter or EPA Method 2G in appendix A-2 to part 60 of this chapter to determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.


(iii) EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3B in appendix A-2 to part 60 of this chapter to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. The manual procedures (but not instrumental procedures) of voluntary consensus standard ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981—Part 10 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) may be used as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.


(iv) EPA Method 4 in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.


(v) EPA Method 29 or 30B in appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter to determine the concentration of mercury from the exhaust stream stack of each unit. If performing measurements using EPA Method 29, you must collect a minimum sample volume of 1.7 dscm (60 dscf). Alternative test methods may be considered on a case-by-case basis per § 63.7(f).


(2) Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test of each unit in table 1 to this subpart as applicable. If the performance testing results for any of the emission points yields a non-detect value, then the method detection limit (MDL) must be used to calculate the mass emissions (lb) for that emission unit and, in turn, for calculating the sum of the emissions (in units of pounds of mercury per ton of steel scrap or pounds of mercury per ton of product sinter) for all units subject to the emission standard for determining compliance. If the resulting mercury emissions are greater than the MACT emission standard, the owner or operator may use procedures that produce lower MDL results and repeat the mercury performance testing one additional time for any emission point for which the measured result was below the MDL. If this additional testing is performed, the results from that testing must be used to determine compliance (*i.e.,* there are no additional opportunities allowed to lower the MDL).










(3) For a primary emission control device applied to emissions from a BOPF with a closed hood system, sample only during the primary oxygen blow and do not sample during any subsequent reblows. Continue sampling for each run for an integral number of primary oxygen blows.


(4) For a primary emission control system applied to emissions from a BOPF with an open hood system and for a control device applied solely to secondary emissions from a BOPF, you must complete the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section:


(i) Sample only during the steel production cycle. Conduct sampling under conditions that are representative of normal operation. Record the start and end time of each steel production cycle and each period of abnormal operation; and


(ii) Sample for an integral number of steel production cycles. The steel production cycle begins when the scrap is charged to the furnace and ends 3 minutes after the slag is emptied from the vessel into the slag pot.


(5) For a control device applied to emissions from BOPF shop ancillary operations (hot metal transfer, skimming, desulfurization, or ladle metallurgy), sample only when the operation(s) is being conducted.


(c) Calculate the mass emissions, based on the average of three test run values, for each BOPF Group unit (or combination of units that are ducted to a common stack and are tested when all affected sources are operating pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section) using equation 1 to this paragraph (c) as follows:


(d) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate an appropriate weight measurement device, to measure the tons of steel scrap input to the BOPF cycle simultaneous with each BOPF Group unit's stack test.


(e) You must maintain the systems for measuring weight within ±5 percent accuracy. You must describe the specific equipment used to make measurements at your facility and how that equipment is periodically calibrated. You must also explain, document, and maintain written procedures for determining the accuracy of the measurements and make these written procedures available to your permitting authority upon request. You must determine, record, and maintain a record of the accuracy of the measuring systems before the beginning of your initial compliance test and during each subsequent quarter of affected source operation.


(f) Calculate the emissions from each new and existing affected source in pounds of mercury per ton of steel scrap to determine initial compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 1. Sum the mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all BOPF Group units calculated using Equation 1 of this section. Divide that sum by the sum of the total amount of steel scrap charged to the BOPFs (in tons).


(g) To demonstrate compliance with the emission limit for hydrogen chloride in table 1 to this subpart through performance testing, follow the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Determine the concentration of hydrogen chloride according to the following test methods:


(i) The methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, and


(ii) EPA Method 26A in appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter to determine the concentration of hydrogen chloride from the exhaust stream stack of each unit, with the following conditions; or


(A) Collect a minimum sample volume of 70 dscf (2 dscm) of gas during each run.


(B) [Reserved]


(iii) EPA Method 320 in appendix A to this part to determine the concentration of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the exhaust stream stack of each unit. Alternatively, ASTM D6348-12(R2020), (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) may be used with the following conditions:


(A) The test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM D 6348-12(R2020), Annexes A1 through A8 are mandatory; and


(B) In ASTM D6348-12(R2020) Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (Equation A5.5). In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, %R must be 70% ≥ R ≤ 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (*i.e.,* the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the equation 2 o to this paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(B) as follows:


(2) At least three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test of each unit in table 1 to this subpart. If the performance testing results for any of the emission points yields a non-detect value, then the MDL must be used to calculate the mass emissions (lb) for that unit and, in turn, for calculating the emissions rate (lb/ton of product sinter, lb/ton of iron, or lb/ton of steel).


(3) Calculate the emissions from each new and existing affected source in pounds of hydrogen chloride per ton of throughput processed or unit of energy (tons of product sinter, tons of iron, tons of steel, or MMBtu) to determine initial compliance with the emission limits in table 1 to this subpart.

(A) The test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM D 6348-12 (R2020), Annexes A1 through A8 are mandatory; and


(B) In ASTM D6348-12 (R2020) Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (Equation A5.5). In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, %R must be 70% ≥ R ≤ 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (*i.e.,* the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the Equation 2 of this section.

(2) Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test of each unit in table 1 to this subpart. For determination of TEQ, zero may be used in subsequent calculations for values less than the estimated detection limit (EDL). For estimated maximum pollutant concentration (EMPC) results, when the value is greater than the EDL, the EMPC value must be used in determination of TEQ, when the EMPC is less than the EDL, zero may be used.
