# § 63.7793   What work practice standards must I meet?

(a) You must meet each work practice limit in table 1 to this subpart that applies to you.


(b) For unplanned bleeder valve openings on a new and existing blast furnace, you must meet each work practice standard listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Develop and operate according to a “Slip Avoidance Plan” to minimize slips and submit it to EPA for approval;


(2) Install devices to continuously measure/monitor material levels in the furnace (*i.e.,* stockline), at a minimum of three locations, with alarms to inform operators of static (*i.e.,* not moving) stockline conditions which increase the likelihood of slips; and


(3) Install and use instruments on the furnace to monitor temperature and pressure to help determine when a slip is likely to occur.


(c) For each large bell on a new and existing blast furnace, you must meet each work practice standard listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Maintain metal seats to minimize wear on seals and emissions; and


(2) Replace or repair large bell seals according to § 63.7833(j).


(d) For each small bell on a new and existing blast furnace, you must meet each work practice standard listed in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Maintain metal seats to minimize wear on seals; and


(2) You must repair or replace small bell seals prior to the time period or metal throughput limit that has been proven and documented to produce no opacity from the small bell.


(e) For each iron beaching operation, you must meet each work practice standard listed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Minimize the drop height of molten metal to the ground, the slope or grade of the area where beaching occurs, and the rate at which molten metal is poured onto the ground; and


(2) Use carbon dioxide shielding during beaching event; and/or use full or partial (hoods) enclosures around beached iron.


(f) For each BOPF at a new or existing shop, you must develop and operate according to a “BOPF Shop Operating Plan” to minimize fugitive emissions and detect openings and leaks and submit it to EPA for approval. Your BOPF Shop Operating Plan may include, but is not limited to, any of the items listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section.


(1) List all events that generate VE, including slopping and other steps company will take to reduce incidence rate. State the specific actions that operators will take when slag foaming approaches the mouth of the vessel in order to prevent slopping;


(2) Minimize hot iron pour/charge rate (minutes) and set a maximum pour rate in tons/second;


(3) Schedule of regular inspections of BOPF shop structure for openings and leaks to the atmosphere;


(4) Optimize positioning of hot metal ladles with respect to hood face and furnace mouth;


(5) Optimize furnace tilt angle during charging and set a maximum tilt angle during charging;


(6) Keep all openings, except roof monitors, closed, especially during transfer, to extent feasible and safe. All openings shall be closed unless the opening was in the original design of the Shop;


(7) Use higher draft velocities to capture more fugitives at a given distance from hood, if possible; and


(8) Monitor opacity periodically (*e.g.,* once per month) from all openings with EPA Method Alt-082 (camera) or with EPA Method 9 in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter.
