(f) For each new or existing sinter plant subject to the operating limit in § 63.7790(d), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by either:


(1) For the sinter plant feedstock oil content operating limit in § 63.7790(d)(1), 


(i) Computing and recording the 30-day rolling average of the percent oil content for each operating day according to the performance test procedures in § 63.7824(d); 


(ii) Recording the sampling date and time, oil content values, and sinter produced (tons/day); and


(iii) Maintaining the 30-day rolling average oil content of the feedstock no higher than 0.02 percent.


(2) For the volatile organic compound operating limit in § 63.7790(d)(2), 


(i) Computing and recording the 30-day rolling average of the volatile organic compound emissions for each operating day according to the performance test procedures in § 63.7824(e); 


(ii) Recording the sampling date and time, sampling values, and sinter produced (tons/day); and


(iii) Maintaining the 30-day rolling average of volatile organic compound emissions no higher than 0.2 lb/ton of sinter produced.


(g) If the hourly average pressure drop or water flow rate for a venturi scrubber or hourly average opacity for an electrostatic precipitator exceeds the operating limit, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) You must initiate corrective action to determine the cause of the exceedance within 1 hour. During any period of corrective action, you must continue to monitor and record all required operating parameters for equipment that remains in operation. Within 24 hours of the exceedance, you must measure and record the hourly average operating parameter value for the emission unit on which corrective action was taken. If the hourly average parameter value meets the applicable operating limit, then the corrective action was successful and the emission unit is in compliance with the applicable operating limit.


(2) If the initial corrective action required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section was not successful, you must complete additional corrective action within the next 24 hours (48 hours from the time of the exceedance). During any period of corrective action, you must continue to monitor and record all required operating parameters for equipment that remains in operation. After this second 24-hour period, you must again measure and record the hourly average operating parameter value for the emission unit on which corrective action was taken. If the hourly average parameter value meets the applicable operating limit, then the corrective action was successful and the emission unit is in compliance with the applicable operating limit.


(3) For purposes of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of an exceedance of the hourly average opacity operating limit for an electrostatic precipitator, measurements of the hourly average opacity based on visible emission observations in accordance with EPA Method 9 (in appendix A-4 to part 60) may be taken to evaluate the effectiveness of corrective action. ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) may be used with the following conditions:


(i) During the DCOT certification procedure outlined in Section 9.2 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), the owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must present the plumes in front of various backgrounds of color and contrast representing conditions anticipated during field use such as blue sky, trees, and mixed backgrounds (clouds and/or a sparse tree stand).


(ii) The owner or operator must also have standard operating procedures in place including daily or other frequency quality checks to ensure the equipment is within manufacturing specifications as outlined in Section 8.1 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).


(iii) The owner or operator must follow the recordkeeping procedures outlined in § 63.10(b)(1) for the DCOT certification, compliance report, data sheets, and all raw unaltered JPEGs used for opacity and certification determination.


(iv) The owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must have a minimum of four independent technology users apply the software to determine the visible opacity of the 300 certification plumes. For each set of 25 plumes, the user may not exceed 15-percent opacity of anyone reading and the average error must not exceed 7.5-percent opacity.


(v) Use of this approved alternative does not provide or imply a certification or validation of any vendor's hardware or software. The onus to maintain and verify the certification and/or training of the DCOT camera, software, and operator in accordance with ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and these requirements is on the facility, DCOT operator, and DCOT vendor.


(4) If the second attempt at corrective action required in paragraph (g)(2) of this section was not successful, you must report the exceedance as a deviation in your next semiannual compliance report according to § 63.7841(b).


(h) If you are demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limits in Table 1 of this section for your BOPF Groups through performance testing, you must conduct mercury performance tests in accordance with §§ 63.7821(e) and 63.7825 and calculate the emissions from each new and existing affected source in pounds of mercury per ton of steel scrap to determine compliance with the mercury emission limits in Table 1. Sum the mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all BOPF Group units calculated using Equation 1 of § 63.7825. Divide that sum by the sum of the total amount of steel scrap charged to the BOPFs (in tons).


(i) If you are demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limits in Table 1 of this section for your BOPF Groups by certifying participation in the NVMSRP or another EPA-approved mercury program, or by using scrap that does not contain mercury switches, you must obtain and certify your use of steel scrap per § 63.7791(c), (d), or (e), as applicable, and § 63.7841(b)(11) to demonstrate continuous compliance with the standard.


(j) For large bells on each blast furnace, you must demonstrate continuous compliance by following the requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section if a bell seal exceeds a 20 percent average of 3 instantaneous opacity readings of the interbell relief valve emissions.


(1) Initiate corrective action within five business days.


(2) Ten business days after the initial opacity exceedance of 20 percent, if the average of 3 instantaneous visible emissions readings from this test exceeds 20 percent, you must repair or replace that bell seal within 4 months.
