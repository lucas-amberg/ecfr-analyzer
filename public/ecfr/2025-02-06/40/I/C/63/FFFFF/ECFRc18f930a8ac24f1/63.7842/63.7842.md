# § 63.7842   What records must I keep?

(a) You must keep the following records:


(1) A copy of each notification and report that you submitted to comply with this subpart, including all documentation supporting any initial notification or notification of compliance status that you submitted, according to the requirements in § 63.10(b)(2)(xiv).


(2) For existing sources and for new or reconstructed sources which commenced construction or reconstruction on or before August 16, 2019, before January 11, 2021, the records in § 63.6(e)(3)(iii) through (v) related to startup, shutdown, and malfunction for a period of five years. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is not required after January 11, 2021.


(3) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.


(4) Records of the actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.7810(d), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.


(5) Records of performance tests, performance evaluations, and opacity observations as required in § 63.10(b)(2)(viii).


(b) For each COMS, you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Records described in § 63.10(b)(2)(vi) through (xi).


(2) Monitoring data for a performance evaluation as required in § 63.6(h)(7)(i) and (ii).


(3) Previous (that is, superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan required under § 63.8(d)(2), with the program of corrective action included in the plan.


(4) Records of the date and time that each deviation started and stopped, and whether the deviation occurred during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction or during another period.


(c) You must keep the records required in § 63.6(h)(6) for visual observations.


(d) You must keep the records required in §§ 63.7823, 63.7833, and 63.7834 to show continuous compliance with each emission limitation and operation and maintenance requirement that applies to you. This includes a record of each large and small bell repair and replacement, a record of the date on which the large bell opacity has exceeded 20 percent, and the most current time period or throughput over which no opacity was observed from the small bell.




(e) If you are demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 1 through § 63.7791(c), you must keep records to demonstrate compliance with the requirements for mercury in § 63.7791(c) as applicable. If you are demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 1 through § 63.7791(d), you must keep records documenting compliance with § 63.7791(d) for scrap that does not contain mercury switches. If you are demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 1 through § 63.7791(e), you must maintain records identifying each scrap provider and documenting the scrap provider's participation in an approved mercury switch removal program. If you purchase scrap from a broker, you must maintain records identifying each broker and documentation that all scrap provided by the broker was obtained from other scrap providers who participate in an approved mercury switch removal program.


(f) For fenceline monitoring systems subject to § 63.7792 of this subpart, each owner or operator must keep the records specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (11) of this section.


(1) Coordinates of samplers, including co-located samplers and field blanks, and if applicable, the meteorological station. The owner or operator shall determine the coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 3 meters. The coordinates shall be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places.


(2) The start and stop times and dates for each sample, as well as the sample identifying information.


(3) Sampling period average temperature and barometric pressure measurements.


(4) For each outlier determined in accordance with the procedures specified in the fenceline metals method, the sampler location and the concentration of the outlier and the evidence used to conclude that the result is an outlier.


(5) For samples that will be adjusted for uniform background, the location of and the concentration measured simultaneously by the background sampler, and the perimeter samplers to which it applies.


(6) Individual sample results, the calculated Δc for each sampling period and the two samples used to determine it, whether background correction was used, and the annual average Δc calculated after each sampling period.


(7) Method detection limit for each sample, including co-located samples and blanks.


(8) Documentation of the root cause analysis and any resulting corrective action taken each time an action level is exceeded, including the dates the root cause analysis was initiated and the resulting correction action(s) were taken.


(9) Any corrective action plan developed under § 63.7792(e).


(10) Other records as required by the sampling method.


(11) If a near-field source correction is used as provided in § 63.7792(f), or if an alternative test method is used that provides time-resolved measurements, records of hourly meteorological data, including temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction, calculated daily unit vector wind direction, and daily sigma theta, and other records specified in the site-specific monitoring plan.


(g) For each unplanned bleeder valve opening for each blast furnace, you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) The start date and start time of the event.


(2) The duration of the event in minutes.


(3) Any corrective actions taken in response to the event.
