# § 63.121   Storage vessel provisions—alternative means of emission limitation.

(a) Determination of equivalence to the reduction in emissions achieved by the requirements of § 63.119 (b), (c), or (d) of this subpart will be evaluated according to § 63.102(b) of subpart F of this part. 


(b) The determination of equivalence referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will be based on the application to the Administrator which shall include the information specified in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. 


(1) Actual emissions tests that use full-size or scale-model storage vessels that accurately collect and measure all organic HAP emissions from a given control technique, and that accurately simulate wind and account for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure, or 


(2) An engineering analysis that the Administrator determines is an accurate method of determining equivalence.
