# § 63.126   Transfer operations provisions—reference control technology.

(a) For each Group 1 transfer rack the owner or operator shall equip each transfer rack with a vapor collection system and control device. 


(1) Each vapor collection system shall be designed and operated to collect the organic hazardous air pollutants vapors displaced from tank trucks or railcars during loading, and to route the collected hazardous air pollutants vapors to a process, or to a fuel gas system, or to a control device as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(2) Each vapor collection system shall be designed and operated such that organic HAP vapors collected at one loading arm will not pass through another loading arm in the rack to the atmosphere. 


(3) Whenever organic hazardous air pollutants emissions are vented to a process, fuel gas system, or control device used to comply with the provisions of this subpart, the process, fuel gas system, or control device shall be operating. 


(b) For each Group 1 transfer rack the owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section. 


(1) Use a control device to reduce emissions of total organic hazardous air pollutants by 98 weight-percent or to an exit concentration of 20 parts per million by volume. For combustion devices, the emission reduction or concentration shall be calculated on a dry basis, corrected to 3-percent oxygen. If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the percent reduction requirement, then the vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device. Compliance may be achieved by using any combination of combustion, recovery, and/or recapture devices.






(2) Reduce emissions of organic HAP's using a flare.


(i) Except as specified in § 63.108(a), the flare shall comply with the requirements of § 63.11(b).








(ii) Halogenated vent streams, as defined in § 63.111 of this subpart, shall not be vented to a flare.


(3) Reduce emissions of organic hazardous air pollutants using a vapor balancing system designed and operated to collect organic hazardous air pollutants vapors displaced from tank trucks or railcars during loading; and to route the collected hazardous air pollutants vapors to the storage vessel from which the liquid being loaded originated, or to another storage vessel connected to a common header, or to compress and route to a process collected hazardous air pollutants vapors. 


(4) Route emissions of organic hazardous air pollutants to a fuel gas system or to a process where the organic hazardous air pollutants in the emissions shall predominantly meet one of, or a combination of, the ends specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(iv) of this section. 


(i) Recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in that process; 


(ii) Transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not organic hazardous air pollutants; 


(iii) Incorporated into a product; and/or 


(iv) Recovered. 


(c) For each Group 2 transfer rack, the owner or operator shall maintain records as required in § 63.130(f). No other provisions for transfer racks apply to the Group 2 transfer rack.


(d) Halogenated emission streams from Group 1 transfer racks that are combusted shall be controlled according to paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. Determination of whether a vent stream is halogenated shall be made using procedures in (d)(3).


(1) If a combustion device is used to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a halogenated vent stream, then the vent stream exiting the combustion device shall be ducted to a halogen reduction device, including, but not limited to, a scrubber before it is discharged to the atmosphere. 


(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the halogen reduction device shall reduce overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens, as defined in § 63.111, by 99 percent or shall reduce the outlet mass emission rate of total hydrogen halides and halogens to 0.45 kilograms per hour or less.


(ii) If a scrubber or other halogen reduction device was installed prior to December 31, 1992, the halogen reduction device shall reduce overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens, as defined in § 63.111, by 95 percent or shall reduce the outlet mass of total hydrogen halides and halogens to less than 0.45 kilograms per hour.








(2) A halogen reduction device, such as a scrubber, or other technique may be used to make the vent stream non-halogenated by reducing the vent stream halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilograms per hour prior to any combustion control device used to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. 


(3) In order to determine whether a vent stream is halogenated, the mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in organic compounds shall be calculated.


(i) The vent stream concentration of each organic compound containing halogen atoms (parts per million by volume by compound) shall be determined based on the following procedures:


(A) Process knowledge that no halogen or hydrogen halides are present in the process, or


(B) Applicable engineering assessment as specified in § 63.115(d)(1)(iii), or


(C) Concentration of organic compounds containing halogens measured by Method 18 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter,


(D) Any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part, or


(E) ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see §  63.14) may also be used in lieu of Method 18 of appendix A-6 to part 60 of this chapter, if the target compounds are all known and are all listed in section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 as measurable; ASTM D6420-18 must not be used for methane and ethane; and ASTM D6420-18 may not be used as a total VOC method.








(ii) The following equation shall be used to calculate the mass emission rate of halogen atoms: 


(e) For each Group 1 transfer rack the owner or operator shall load organic HAP's into only tank trucks and railcars which: 


(1) Have a current certification in accordance with the U. S. Department of Transportation pressure test requirements of 49 CFR part 180 for tank trucks and 49 CFR 173.31 for railcars; or 


(2) Have been demonstrated to be vapor-tight within the preceding 12 months, as determined by the procedures in § 63.128(f) of this subpart. Vapor-tight means that the truck or railcar tank will sustain a pressure change of not more than 750 pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 pascals. 


(f) The owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to the provisions of this subpart shall load organic HAP's to only tank trucks or railcars equipped with vapor collection equipment that is compatible with the transfer rack's vapor collection system. 


(g) The owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to this subpart shall load organic HAP's to only tank trucks or railcars whose collection systems are connected to the transfer rack's vapor collection systems. 


(h) Except as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to the provisions of this subpart shall ensure that no pressure-relief device in the transfer rack's vapor collection system or in the organic hazardous air pollutants loading equipment of each tank truck or railcar shall begin to open during loading. Pressure relief devices needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph (h).


(1) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), this paragraph (h) does not apply. Instead, pressure relief devices are subject to the requirements specified in § 63.165(e).


(2) [Reserved]


(i) Each valve in the vent system that would divert the vent stream to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, shall be secured in a non-diverting position using a carseal or a lock-and-key type configuration, or shall be equipped with a flow indicator. Except as specified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief devices needed for safety purposes is not subject to this paragraph (i).


(1) For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, the last sentence in paragraph (i) of this section no longer applies. Instead, the exemptions specified in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.


(i) Except for pressure relief devices subject to § 63.165(e)(4) of subpart H of this part, equipment such as low leg drains and equipment subject to the requirements of subpart H of this part are not subject to this paragraph (i).


(ii) Open-ended valves or lines that use a cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve and follow the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) or follow requirements codified in another regulation that are the same as § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) are not subject to this paragraph (i).
