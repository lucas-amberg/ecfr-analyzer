# § 63.130   Transfer operations provisions—periodic recordkeeping and reporting.

(a) Each owner or operator using a control device to comply with § 63.126(b)(1) or (b)(2) of this subpart shall keep the following up-to-date, readily accessible records: 


(1) While the transfer vent stream is being vented to the control device, continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 63.127, and listed in table 7 of this subpart or specified by the Administrator in accordance with §§ 63.127(c) and 63.129(b). For flares complying with§ 63.11(b), the hourly records and records of pilot flame outages specified in table 7 shall be maintained in place of continuous records. For flares complying with § 63.108, the owner or operator must comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified therein.


(2) Records of the daily average value of each monitored parameter for each operating day determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.152(f), except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iv) of this section.


(i) For flares, except as specified in paragraph (a) of § 63.108, records of the times and duration of all periods during which the pilot flame is absent shall be kept rather than daily averages.


(ii) If carbon adsorber regeneration stream flow and carbon bed regeneration temperature are monitored, the records specified in table 7 to this subpart shall be kept instead of the daily averages.


(iii) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, records of the duration of all periods when the vent stream is diverted through bypass lines shall be kept rather than daily averages.


(iv) For each flow event from a bypass line subject to the requirements in § 63.127(d) for each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the owner or operator must also maintain records sufficient to determine whether or not the detected flow included flow requiring control. For each flow event from a bypass line requiring control that is released either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements in this subpart, the owner or operator must include an estimate of the volume of gas, the concentration of organic HAP in the gas and the resulting emissions of organic HAP that bypassed the control device using process knowledge and engineering estimates.





 


(3) For boilers or process heaters, records of any changes in the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone as required under the reduction of total organic HAP emissions in § 63.126(b)(1) of this subpart. 


(b) If a vapor collection system containing valves that could divert the emission stream away from the control device is used, each owner or operator of a Group 1 transfer rack subject to the provisions of § 63.127(d) shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of:


(1) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator specified under § 63.127(d)(1) was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator is not operating.


(2) Where a seal mechanism is used to comply with § 63.127(d)(2), hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, the owner or operator shall record that the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done, and shall record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type lock has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken, as listed in table 7 of this subpart.


(3) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the owner or operator must comply with this paragraph in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. For each flow event from a bypass line subject to the requirements in § 63.127(d), the owner or operator must maintain records sufficient to determine whether or not the detected flow included flow requiring control. For each flow event from a bypass line requiring control that is released either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements in this subpart, the owner or operator must include an estimate of the volume of gas, the concentration of organic HAP in the gas and the resulting emissions of organic HAP that bypassed the control device using process knowledge and engineering estimates.


(c) Except as specified in paragraph (a) of § 63.108, each owner or operator of a Group 1 transfer rack who uses a flare to comply with § 63.126(b)(2) shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of the flare pilot flame monitoring specified under § 63.127(a)(2).


(d) Each owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to the requirements of § 63.126 shall submit to the Administrator Periodic Reports of the following information according to the schedule in § 63.152(c):


(1) Reports of daily average values of monitored parameters for all operating days when the daily average values were outside the range established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit. Additionally, report the identification of the transfer rack, the monitored parameter out of range, and the date of such occurrences.


(2) Reports of the start date and duration (in hours) of periods when monitoring data are not collected for each excursion caused by insufficient monitoring data as defined in § 63.152(c)(2)(ii)(A).


(3) Reports of the start date and time and duration (in hours) of all periods recorded under paragraph (b)(1) of this section when the vent stream was diverted from the control device, and if applicable, the information in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.


(4) Reports of the start date and time and duration (in hours) recorded under paragraph (b)(2) of this section when maintenance is performed on car-sealed valves, when the car seal is broken, when the bypass line valve position is changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out, and if applicable, the information in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.


(5) Except as specified in paragraph (a) of § 63.108, reports of the times and durations of all periods recorded under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section in which all pilot flames of a flare were absent.


(6) Reports of all carbon bed regeneration cycles during which the parameters recorded under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section were outside the ranges established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit. Include the identification of the carbon bed, the monitored parameter that was outside the established range, and the start date, start time, and duration (in hours) for the regeneration cycle in the report.


(7) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the owner or operator must comply with this paragraph in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section. For bypass lines subject to the requirements in § 63.127(d), the Periodic Report must include the start date, start time, duration in hours, estimate of the volume of gas in standard cubic feet, the concentration of organic HAP in the gas in parts per million by volume and the resulting mass emissions of organic HAP in pounds that bypass a control device. For periods when the flow indicator is not operating, report the start date, start time, and duration in hours.






(e) The owner or operator of a Group 1 transfer rack shall record that the verification of DOT tank certification or Method 27 testing, required in § 63.126(e) of this subpart, has been performed. Various methods for the record of verification can be used, such as: A check off on a log sheet; a list of DOT serial numbers or Method 27 data; or a position description for gate security, showing that the security guard will not allow any trucks on site that do not have the appropriate documentation. 


(f) Each owner or operator of a Group 1 or Group 2 transfer rack shall record, update annually, and maintain the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section in a readily accessible location on site: 


(1) An analysis demonstrating the design and actual annual throughput of the transfer rack; 


(2) An analysis documenting the weight-percent organic HAP's in the liquid loaded. Examples of acceptable documentation include but are not limited to analyses of the material and engineering calculations. 


(3) An analysis documenting the annual rack weighted average HAP partial pressure of the transfer rack. 


(i) For Group 2 transfer racks that are limited to transfer of organic HAP's with partial pressures less than 10.3 kilopascals, documentation is required of the organic HAP's (by compound) that are transferred. The rack weighted average partial pressure does not need to be calculated. 


(ii) For racks transferring one or more organic HAP's with partial pressures greater than 10.3 kilopascals, as well as one or more organic HAP's with partial pressures less than 10.3 kilopascals, a rack weighted partial pressure shall be documented. The rack weighted average HAP partial pressure shall be weighted by the annual throughput of each chemical transferred.
