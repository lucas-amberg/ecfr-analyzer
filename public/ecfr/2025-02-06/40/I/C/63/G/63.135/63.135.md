(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, if the capacity of the container is greater than 0.42 m
3, the cover and all openings (e.g., bungs, hatches, sampling ports, and pressure relief devices) shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.148 of this subpart. 


(2) If the capacity of the container is less than or equal to 0.42 m
3, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section. 


(i) The container must meet existing Department of Transportation specifications and testing requirements under 49 CFR part 178; or

(1) The submerged fill pipe outlet shall extend to no more than 6 inches or within two fill pipe diameters of the bottom of the container while the container is being filled. 


(2) The cover shall remain in place and all openings shall be maintained in a closed position except for those openings required for the submerged fill pipe and for venting of the container to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation of the container or cover. 




(d) During treatment of a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream, including aeration, thermal or other treatment, in a container, whenever it is necessary for the container to be open, the container shall be located within an enclosure with a closed vent system that routes the organic hazardous air pollutants vapors vented from the container to a control device.




(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the enclosure and all openings (e.g., doors, hatches) shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.148 of this subpart. 


(2) The control device shall be designed, operated, and inspected in accordance with § 63.139 of this subpart.

(f) Except as provided in § 63.140 of this subpart, when an improper work practice or a control equipment failure is identified, first efforts at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after identification and repair shall be completed within 15 calendar days after identification.
