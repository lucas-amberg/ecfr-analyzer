(e) The owner or operator of a control device that is used to comply with the provisions of this section shall monitor the control device in accordance with § 63.143 of this subpart. 


(f) Except as provided in § 63.140 of this subpart, if gaps, cracks, tears, or holes are observed in ductwork, piping, or connections to covers and control devices during an inspection, a first effort to repair shall be made as soon as practical but no later than 5 calendar days after identification. Repair shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after identification or discovery of the defect.
