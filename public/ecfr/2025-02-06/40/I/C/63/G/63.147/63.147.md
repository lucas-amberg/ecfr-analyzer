# § 63.147   Process wastewater provisions—recordkeeping.

(a) The owner or operator transferring a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream in accordance with § 63.132(g) of this subpart shall keep a record of the notice sent to the treatment operator stating that the wastewater stream or residual contains organic hazardous air pollutants which are required to be managed and treated in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. 


(b) The owner or operator shall keep in a readily accessible location the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of the section.


(1) A record that each waste management unit inspection required by §§ 63.133 through 63.137 of this subpart was performed. 


(2) A record that each inspection for control devices required by § 63.139 of this subpart was performed. 


(3) A record of the results of each seal gap measurement required by §§ 63.133(d) and 63.137(c) of this subpart. The records shall include the date of the measurement, the raw data obtained in the measurement, and the calculations described in § 63.120(b)(2), (3), and (4) of this subpart. 


(4) For Item 1 and Item 3 of table 12 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall keep the records approved by the Administrator.


(5) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, continuous records of the monitored parameters specified in Item 2 of table 12 and table 13 of this subpart, and in § 63.143(e)(2) of this subpart.


(6) Documentation of a decision to use an extension, as specified in § 63.133(e)(2) or (h) of this subpart, which shall include a description of the failure, documentation that alternate storage capacity is unavailable, and specification of a schedule of actions that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as practical. 


(7) Documentation of a decision to use a delay of repair due to unavailability of parts, as specified in § 63.140(c), shall include a description of the failure, the reason additional time was necessary (including a statement of why replacement parts were not kept on site and when the manufacturer promised delivery), and the date when repair was completed. 


(8) *Requirements for Group 2 wastewater streams.* This paragraph (b)(8) does not apply to Group 2 wastewater streams that are used to comply with § 63.138(g). For all other Group 2 wastewater streams, the owner or operator shall keep in a readily accessible location the records specified in paragraphs (b)(8)(i) through (iv) of this section. 


(i) Process unit identification and description of the process unit. 


(ii) Stream identification code. 


(iii) For existing sources, concentration of table 9 compound(s) in parts per million, by weight. For new sources, concentration of table 8 and/or table 9 compound(s) in parts per million, by weight. Include documentation of the methodology used to determine concentration. 


(iv) Flow rate in liter per minute.


(c) For each boiler or process heater used to comply with §§ 63.133 through 63.139 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall keep a record of any changes in the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone as required in § 63.139(c)(1) of this subpart. 




(d) The owner or operator shall keep records of the daily average value of each continuously monitored parameter for each operating day as specified in § 63.152(f), except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) For flares, except as specified in paragraph (a) of § 63.108, records of the times and duration of all periods during which the pilot flame is absent shall be kept rather than daily averages.


(2) *Regenerative carbon adsorbers.* Except as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for regenerative carbon adsorbers, the owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section instead of daily averages.


(i) Records of the total regeneration stream mass flow for each carbon bed regeneration cycle.


(ii) Records of the temperature of the carbon bed after each regeneration cycle.


(3) *Non-regenerative carbon adsorbers.* Except as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for non-regenerative carbon adsorbers using organic monitoring equipment, the owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section instead of daily averages. For non-regenerative carbon adsorbers replacing the carbon adsorption system with fresh carbon at a regular predetermined time interval that is less than the carbon replacement interval that is determined by the maximum design flow rate and organic concentration in the gas stream vented to the carbon adsorption system, the owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section instead of daily averages.


(i)(A) Record of how the monitoring frequency, as specified in table 13 of this subpart, was determined.


(B) Records of when organic compound concentration of adsorber exhaust was monitored.


(C) Records of when the carbon was replaced.


(ii)(A) Record of how the carbon replacement interval, as specified in table 13 of this subpart, was determined.


(B) Records of when the carbon was replaced.


(4) For each nonregenerative adsorber and regenerative adsorber that is regenerated offsite subject to the requirements in § 63.139(d)(5), the owner or operator must keep the applicable records specified in (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iii) of this section.


(i) Breakthrough limit and bed life established according to § 63.139(d)(5)(i).


(ii) Each outlet HAP or TOC concentration measured according to §§ 63.139(d)(5)(ii) and (d)(5)(iii).


(iii) Date and time you last replaced the adsorbent.






(e) Where the owner or operator obtains approval to use a control device other than one for which monitoring requirements are specified in § 63.143 of this subpart, or to monitor parameters other than those specified in table 12 or table 13 of this subpart, the Administrator will specify appropriate recordkeeping requirements. 


(f) If the owner or operator uses process knowledge to determine the annual average concentration of a wastewater stream as specified in § 63.144(b)(3) of this subpart and/or uses process knowledge to determine the annual average flow rate as specified in § 63.144(c)(1) of this subpart, and determines that the wastewater stream is not a Group 1 wastewater stream, the owner or operator shall keep in a readily accessible location the documentation of how process knowledge was used to determine the annual average concentration and/or the annual average flow rate of the wastewater stream.
