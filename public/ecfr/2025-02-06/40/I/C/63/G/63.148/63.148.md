# § 63.148   Leak inspection provisions.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, for each vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure required to comply with this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section.


(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, each vapor collection system and closed vent system shall be inspected according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section and each fixed roof, cover, and enclosure shall be inspected according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.




(1) If the vapor collection system or closed vent system is constructed of hard-piping, the owner or operator shall: 


(i) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section, and 


(ii) Conduct annual visual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks. 


(2) If the vapor collection system or closed vent system is constructed of ductwork, the owner or operator shall: 


(i) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section, and 


(ii) Conduct annual inspections according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(iii) Conduct annual visual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks. 


(3) For each fixed roof, cover, and enclosure, the owner or operator shall conduct initial visual inspections and semi-annual visual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks as specified in §§ 63.133 through 63.137 of this subpart.


(c) Each vapor collection system and closed vent system shall be inspected according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section.


(1) Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 


(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the process fluid not each individual volatile organic compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not organic hazardous air pollutants or volatile organic compounds, the average stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. 


(ii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. 


(3) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 


(4) Calibration gases shall be as follows: 


(i) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million hydrocarbon in air); and 


(ii) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration less than 10,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air. 


(5) An owner or operator may elect to adjust or not adjust instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects to not adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall measure background concentration using the procedures in §§ 63.180(b) and (c) of subpart H of this part. The owner or operator shall subtract background reading from the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument. 


(6) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared with 500 parts per million for determining compliance. 


(d) Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million above background or by visual inspections, shall be repaired as soon as practicable, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. 


(1) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected. 


(2) Repair shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. 


(3) For leaks found in vapor collection systems used for transfer operations, repairs shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected or at the beginning of the next transfer loading operation, whichever is later. 


(e) Delay of repair of a vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, as defined in § 63.101 of subpart F of this part, or if the owner or operator determines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment shall be complete by the end of the next shutdown. 




(f) For each vapor collection system or closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of either paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2), and (f)(4) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that determines whether vent stream flow is present at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.118(a)(3) of this subpart. The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line; or 


(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line. 


(3) Except as specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph.


(4) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10):


(i) The use of a bypass line at any time on a closed vent system to divert emissions (subject to the emission suppression requirements specified in §§ 63.133 through 63.137) to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements specified in this subpart is an emissions standards violation.


(ii) Paragraph (f)(3) of this section no longer applies. Instead, the exemptions specified in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii)(A) and (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section apply.


(A) Except for pressure relief devices subject to § 63.165(e)(4), equipment such as low leg drains and equipment subject to the requirements of subpart H of this part are not subject to this paragraph (f) of this section.


(B) Open-ended valves or lines that use a cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve and follow the requirements specified in 40 CFR 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) or follow requirements codified in another regulation that are the same as 40 CFR 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) are not subject to this paragraph (f) of this section.






(g) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, as unsafe to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3)(i) of this section if: 


(1) The owner or operator determines that the equipment is unsafe to inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent or potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(i) of this section; and 


(2) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-inspect times. 


(h) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, as difficult to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3)(i) of this section if: 


(1) The owner or operator determines that the equipment cannot be inspected without elevating the inspecting personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface; and 


(2) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years. 


(i) The owner or operator shall record the information specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(5) of this section. 


(1) Identification of all parts of the vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated as unsafe to inspect, an explanation of why the equipment is unsafe to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment. 


(2) Identification of all parts of the vapor collection system, closed vent system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated as difficult to inspect, an explanation of why the equipment is difficult to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment. 




(3) For each vapor collection system or closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall keep a record of the information specified in either paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (i)(3)(ii) of this section in addition to the information specified in paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section.








(i) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator specified under paragraph (f)(1) of this section was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator is not operating. 


(ii) Where a seal mechanism is used to comply with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, the owner or operator shall record whether the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done, and shall record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.


(iii) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the owner or operator must comply with this paragraph in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) or (i)(3)(ii) of this section. For each flow event from a bypass line subject to the requirements in paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator must maintain records sufficient to determine whether or not the detected flow included flow requiring control. For each flow event from a bypass line requiring control that is released either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements in this subpart, the owner or operator must include an estimate of the volume of gas, the concentration of organic HAP in the gas and the resulting emissions of organic HAP that bypassed the control device using process knowledge and engineering estimates.



 


(4) For each inspection during which a leak is detected, a record of the information specified in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) through (i)(4)(viii) of this section. 


(i) The instrument identification numbers; operator name or initials; and identification of the equipment. 


(ii) The date the leak was detected and the date of the first attempt to repair the leak. 


(iii) Maximum instrument reading measured by the method specified in paragraph (d) of this section after the leak is successfully repaired or determined to be nonrepairable. 


(iv) “Repair delayed” and the reason for the delay if a leak is not repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak. 


(v) The name, initials, or other form of identification of the owner or operator (or designee) whose decision it was that repair could not be effected without a shutdown. 


(vi) The expected date of successful repair of the leak if a leak is not repaired within 15 calendar days. 


(vii) Dates of shutdowns that occur while the equipment is unrepaired. 


(viii) The date of successful repair of the leak. 


(5) For each inspection conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section during which no leaks are detected, a record that the inspection was performed, the date of the inspection, and a statement that no leaks were detected. 


(6) For each visual inspection conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section during which no leaks are detected, a record that the inspection was performed, the date of the inspection, and a statement that no leaks were detected. 


(j) The owner or operator shall submit with the reports required by § 63.182(b) of subpart H of this part or with the reports required by § 63.152(c) of this subpart, the information specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section and if applicable, the information in paragraph (j)(4) of this section.


(1) The information specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section;


(2) Reports of the times of all periods recorded under paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section when the vent stream is diverted from the control device through a bypass line, including the start date, start time, and duration in hours; and


(3) Reports of all periods recorded under paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section in which the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key to unlock the bypass line valve was checked out. Include the start date, start time, and duration in hours for each period.


(4) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the owner or operator must comply with this paragraph in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section. For bypass lines subject to the requirements in paragraph (f) of this section, the Periodic Report must include the start date, start time, duration in hours, estimate of the volume of gas in standard cubic feet, the concentration of organic HAP in the gas in parts per million by volume and the resulting mass emissions of organic HAP in pounds that bypass a control device. For periods when the flow indicator is not operating, report the start date, start time, and duration in hours.


(k) If a closed vent system subject to this section is also subject to § 63.172, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of § 63.172 and is exempt from the requirements of this section.
