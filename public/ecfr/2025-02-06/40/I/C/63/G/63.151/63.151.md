The application for approval of construction or reconstruction described in § 63.5(d) of subpart A is not required for these sources.


(c) Each owner or operator of an existing source with emission points that will be included in an emissions average or new source subject to this subpart must submit an Implementation Plan to the Administrator by the dates specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, unless an operating permit application accompanied by the information specified in § 63.152(e) of this subpart has been submitted. The Implementation Plan for emissions averaging is subject to Administrator approval.
