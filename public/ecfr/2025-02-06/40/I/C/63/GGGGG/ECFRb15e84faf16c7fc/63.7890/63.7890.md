(2) Reduce from all affected process vents the emissions of total organic compounds (TOC) (minus methane and ethane) to a level below 1.4 kg/hr and 2.8 Mg/yr (3.0 lb/hr and 3.1 tpy); or 


(3) Reduce from all affected process vents the total emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart by 95 percent by weight or more; or 


(4) Reduce from all affected process vents the emissions of TOC (minus methane and ethane) by 95 percent by weight or more. 


(c) For each closed vent system and control device you use to comply with paragraph (b) of this section, you must meet the operating limit requirements and work practice standards in ยง 63.7925(c) through (j) that apply to your closed vent system and control device.
