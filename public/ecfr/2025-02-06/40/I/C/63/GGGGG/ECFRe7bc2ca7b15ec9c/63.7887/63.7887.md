# § 63.7887   What are the general standards I must meet for my affected equipment leak sources?

(a) You must control HAP emissions from equipment leaks from each equipment component that is part of the affected source by implementing leak detection and control measures according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7920 through 63.7922 unless you elect to meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) If the affected equipment leak source is also subject to another subpart in 40 CFR part 61 or 40 CFR part 63, you may control emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart from the affected equipment leak source in compliance with the standards specified in the other applicable subpart. This means you are complying with all applicable emissions limitations and work practice standards under the other subpart (*e.g.*, you implement leak detection and control measures to reduce HAP emissions as specified by the applicable subpart). This provision does not apply to any exemption of the affected source from the emissions limitations and work practice standards allowed by the other applicable subpart.
