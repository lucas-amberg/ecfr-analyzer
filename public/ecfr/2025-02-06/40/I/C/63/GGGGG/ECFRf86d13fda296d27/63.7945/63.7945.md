(1) Complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. 


(2) To calculate a valid hourly value, you must have at least three of four equally spaced data values (or at least two, if that condition is included to allow for periodic calibration checks) for that hour from a CPMS that is not out of control according to the monitoring plan referenced in ยง 63.7935. 


(3) To calculate the average emissions for each averaging period, you must have at least 75 percent of the hourly averages for that period using only block hourly average values that are based on valid data (*i.e.,* not from out-of-control periods).

(b) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check. 


(c) You must conduct a performance evaluation for each CPMS according to the requirements in ยง 63.8(e) and your site-specific monitoring plan.
