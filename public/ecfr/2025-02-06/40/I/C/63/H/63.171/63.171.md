# § 63.171   Standards: Delay of repair.

(a) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair within 15 days is technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown. Repair of this equipment shall occur by the end of the next process unit shutdown.




(b) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in organic HAP service.


(c) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, delay of repair for valves, connectors, and agitators is also allowed if:




(1) The owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and


(2) When repair procedures are effected, the purged material is collected and destroyed or recovered in a control device complying with § 63.172 of this subpart.






(d) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, delay of repair for pumps is also allowed if:




(1) Repair requires replacing the existing seal design with a new system that the owner or operator has determined under the provisions of § 63.176(d) of this subpart will provide better performance or:


(i) A dual mechanical seal system that meets the requirements of § 63.163(e) of this subpart,


(ii) A pump that meets the requirements of § 63.163(f) of this subpart, or


(iii) A closed-vent system and control device that meets the requirements of § 63.163(g) of this subpart; and


(2) Repair is completed as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.


(e) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, delay of repair beyond a process unit shutdown will be allowed for a valve if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit shutdown, valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the second process unit shutdown will not be allowed unless the third process unit shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the first process unit shutdown.


(f) For each source as defined in § 63.101, and for each source as defined in § 63.191, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(11), delay of repair is not allowed for light liquid pumps in ethylene oxide service, gas/vapor and light liquid valves in ethylene oxide service, and connectors in ethylene oxide service.
