(b) Except as specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section, each owner or operator of a facility subject to this subpart shall maintain the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (11) of this section:


(1) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by this subpart. The files shall be retained for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report or period.


(i) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed.


(ii) The most recent 12 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request.

(iv) Where a seal or closure mechanism is used to comply with § 63.771(c)(3)(i)(B), hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, the owner or operator shall record that the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanism has been done, and shall record the duration of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type lock has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.


(5) Records identifying all parts of the cover or closed-vent system that are designated as unsafe to inspect in accordance with § 63.773(c)(5), an explanation of why the equipment is unsafe to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.


(6) Records identifying all parts of the cover or closed-vent system that are designated as difficult to inspect in accordance with § 63.773(c)(6), an explanation of why the equipment is difficult to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.


(7) For each inspection conducted in accordance with § 63.773(c), during which a leak or defect is detected, a record of the information specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) through (b)(7)(viii) of this section.


(i) The instrument identification numbers, operator name or initials, and identification of the equipment.


(ii) The date the leak or defect was detected and the date of the first attempt to repair the leak or defect.


(iii) Maximum instrument reading measured by the method specified in § 63.772(c) after the leak or defect is successfully repaired or determined to be nonrepairable.


(iv) “Repair delayed” and the reason for the delay if a leak or defect is not repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak or defect.


(v) The name, initials, or other form of identification of the owner or operator (or designee) whose decision it was that repair could not be effected without a shutdown.


(vi) The expected date of successful repair of the leak or defect if a leak or defect is not repaired within 15 calendar days.


(vii) Dates of shutdowns that occur while the equipment is unrepaired.


(viii) The date of successful repair of the leak or defect.


(ix) Records identifying the carbon replacement schedule under § 63.771(d)(5) and records of each carbon replacement.


(8) For each inspection conducted in accordance with § 63.773(c) during which no leaks or defects are detected, a record that the inspection was performed, the date of the inspection, and a statement that no leaks or defects were detected.
