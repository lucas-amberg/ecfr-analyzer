(ii) Records of the daily average value of each continuously monitored parameter for each operating day determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.1283(d)(4) of this subpart, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.


(A) For flares, the records required in paragraph (e) of this section.


(B) For condensers installed to comply with § 63.1275, records of the annual 30-day rolling average condenser efficiency determined under § 63.1282(f) shall be kept in addition to the daily averages.


(C) For a control device whose model is tested under § 63.1282(g), the records required in paragraph (g) of this section.


(iii) Hourly records of the times and durations of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the device is not operating.


(iv) Where a seal or closure mechanism is used to comply with § 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(B), hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, the owner or operator shall record that the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanism has been done, and shall record the duration of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type lock has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.


(5) Records identifying all parts of the closed-vent system that are designated as unsafe to inspect in accordance with § 63.1283(c)(5), an explanation of why the equipment is unsafe to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.


(6) Records identifying all parts of the closed-vent system that are designated as difficult to inspect in accordance with § 63.1283(c)(6), an explanation of why the equipment is difficult to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.


(7) For each inspection conducted in accordance with § 63.1283(c), during which a leak or defect is detected, a record of the information specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) through (b)(7)(viii) of this section.


(i) The instrument identification numbers, operator name or initials, and identification of the equipment.


(ii) The date the leak or defect was detected and the date of the first attempt to repair the leak or defect.


(iii) Maximum instrument reading measured by the method specified in § 63.1282(b) after the leak or defect is successfully repaired or determined to be nonrepairable.


(iv) “Repair delayed” and the reason for the delay if a leak or defect is not repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak or defect.


(v) The name, initials, or other form of identification of the owner or operator (or designee) whose decision it was that repair could not be effected without a shutdown.


(vi) The expected date of successful repair of the leak or defect if a leak or defect is not repaired within 15 calendar days.


(vii) Dates of shutdowns that occur while the equipment is unrepaired.


(viii) The date of successful repair of the leak or defect.


(ix) Records identifying the carbon replacement schedule under § 63.1281(d)(5) and records of each carbon replacement.


(8) For each inspection conducted in accordance with § 63.1283(c) during which no leaks or defects are detected, a record that the inspection was performed, the date of the inspection, and a statement that no leaks or defects were detected.


(9) Records of glycol dehydration unit baseline operations calculated as required under § 63.1281(e)(1).


(10) Records required in § 63.1281(e)(3)(i) documenting that the facility continues to operate under the conditions specified in § 63.1281(e)(2).


(c) An owner or operator that elects to comply with the benzene emission limit specified in § 63.1275(b)(1)(ii) shall document, to the Administrator's satisfaction, the following items:

(d) An owner or operator that is exempt from control requirements under § 63.1274(d) shall maintain the records specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as appropriate, for each glycol dehydration unit that is not controlled according to the requirements of § 63.1274(c).


(1) The actual annual average natural gas throughput (in terms of natural gas flowrate to the glycol dehydration unit per day), as determined in accordance with § 63.1282(a)(1); or


(2) The actual average benzene emissions (in terms of benzene emissions per year), as determined in accordance with § 63.1282(a)(2).


(e) Record the following when using a flare to comply with § 63.1281(d):


(1) Flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted, or non-assisted);


(2) All visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flowrate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the compliance determination required by § 63.1282(d)(2); and


(3) All hourly records and other recorded periods when the pilot flame is absent.


(f) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart shall maintain records of the occurrence and duration of each malfunction of operation (*i.e.,* process equipment) or the air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment. The owner or operator shall maintain records of actions taken during periods of malfunction to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1274(h), including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation.
