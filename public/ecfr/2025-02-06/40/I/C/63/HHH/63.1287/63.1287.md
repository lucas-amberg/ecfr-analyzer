# § 63.1287   Alternative means of emission limitation.

(a) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in HAP emissions from that source achieved under the applicable requirements in §§ 63.1274 through 63.1281, the Administrator will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement. The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.


(b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.


(c) Any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that this means achieves equivalent emission reductions.
