# Appendix A to Subpart HHHH of Part 63—Method for Determining Free-Formaldehyde in Urea-Formaldehyde Resins by Sodium Sulfite (Iced & Cooled) 


This procedure corresponds to the Housing and Urban Development method of determining free-formaldehyde in urea-formaldehyde resins. This method applies to samples that decompose to yield formaldehyde under the conditions of other free-formaldehyde methods. The primary use is for urea-formaldehyde resins. 


Formaldehyde will react with sodium sulfite to form the sulfite addition products and liberate sodium hydroxide (NaOH); however, at room temperature, the methanol groups present will also react to liberate NaOH. Titrate at 0 degrees Celsius (°C) to minimize the reaction of the methanol groups. 


*2.1 Apparatus Required.*

2.1.1 Ice crusher. 


2.1.2 One 100-milliliter (mL) graduated cylinder. 


2.1.3 Three 400-mL beakers. 


2.1.4 One 50-mL burette. 


2.1.5 Analytical balance accurate to 0.1 milligrams (mg). 


2.1.6 Magnetic stirrer. 


2.1.7 Magnetic stirring bars. 


2.1.8 Disposable pipettes. 


2.1.9 Several 5-ounce (oz.) plastic cups. 


2.1.10 Ice cube trays (small cubes). 


*2.2 Materials Required.*

2.2.1 Ice cubes (made with distilled water). 


2.2.2 A solution of 1 molar (M) sodium sulfite (Na_2_SO_3_) (63 grams (g) Na_2_SO_3_/500 mL water (H_2_O) neutralized to thymolphthalein endpoint). 


2.2.3 Standardized 0.1 normal (N) hydrochloric acid (HCl). 


2.2.4 Thymolphthalein indicator (1.0 g thymolphthalein/199 g methanol). 


2.2.5 Sodium chloride (NaCl) (reagent grade). 


2.2.6 Sodium hydroxide (NaOH). 


*2.3 Procedure.*

2.3.1 Prepare sufficient quantity of crushed ice for three determinations (two trays of cubes). 


2.3.2 Put 70 cubic centimeters (cc) of 1 M Na_2_SO_3_ solution into a 400-mL beaker. Begin stirring and add approximately 100 g of crushed ice and 2 g of NaCl. Maintain 0 °C during test, adding ice as necessary. 


2.3.3 Add 10-15 drops of thymolphthalein indicator to the chilled solution. If the solution remains clear, add 0.1 N NaOH until the solution turns blue; then add 0.1 N HCl back to the colorless endpoint. If the solution turns blue upon adding the indicator, add 0.1 N HCl to the colorless endpoint. 


2.3.4 On the analytical balance, accurately weigh the amount of resin indicated under the “*Resin Sample Size*” chart (see below) as follows. 


2.3.4.1 Pour about 1 inch of resin into a 5 oz. plastic cup. 


2.3.4.2 Determine the gross weight of the cup, resin, and disposable pipette (with the narrow tip broken off) fitted with a small rubber bulb. 


2.3.4.3 Pipette out the desired amount of resin into the stirring, chilled solution (approximately 1.5 to 2 g per pipette-full). 


2.3.4.4 Quickly reweigh the cup, resin, and pipette with the bulb. 


2.3.4.5 The resultant weight loss equals the grams of resin being tested. 


2.3.5 Rapidly titrate the solution with 0.1 N HCl to the colorless endpoint described in Step 3 (2.3.3). 


2.3.6 Repeat the test in triplicate. 


*2.4 Calculation.*

2.4.1 The percent free-formaldehyde (%HCHO) is calculated as follows: 


2.4.2 Compute the average percent free-formaldehyde of the three tests. 


(_Note:_ If the results of the three tests are not within a range of ±0.5 percent or if the average of the three tests does not meet expected limits, carry out Part B and then repeat Part A.) 


Part B ensures that test reagents used in determining percent free-formaldehyde in urea-formaldehyde resins are of proper concentration and that operator technique is correct. Should any doubts arise in either of these areas, the formaldehyde standard solution test should be carried out. 


*3.1 Preparation and Standardization of a 1 Percent Formalin Solution.*

Prepare a solution containing approximately 1 percent formaldehyde from a stock 37 percent formalin solution. Standardize the prepared solution by titrating the hydroxyl ions resulting from the formation of the formaldehyde bisulfite complex.
