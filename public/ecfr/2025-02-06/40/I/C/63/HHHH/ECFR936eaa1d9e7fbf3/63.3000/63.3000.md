# § 63.3000   What notifications and reports must I submit?

(a) You must submit all notifications and reports required by the applicable general provisions and this section. Table 2 of this subpart presents the applicable requirements of the general provisions. 


(b) *Notification of compliance status.* You must submit the notification of compliance status, including the performance test results, the operating limits or ranges as determined during the performance test, and other information specified in § 63.9(h), before the close of business on the 60th calendar day after you complete the performance test according to § 63.10(d)(2). 


(c) *Semiannual compliance reports.* You must submit semiannual compliance reports according to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.


(1) *Dates for submitting reports.* Unless the Administrator has agreed to a different schedule for submitting reports under § 63.10(a), you must deliver or postmark each semiannual compliance report no later than 30 days following the end of each semiannual reporting period. The first semiannual reporting period begins on the compliance date for your affected source and ends on June 30 or December 31, whichever date immediately follows your compliance date. Each subsequent semiannual reporting period for which you must submit a semiannual compliance report begins on July 1 or January 1 and ends 6 calendar months later. Before March 1, 2019, as required by § 63.10(e)(3), you must begin submitting quarterly compliance reports if you deviate from the emission limits in § 63.2983 or the operating limits in § 63.2984. After February 28, 2019, you are not required to submit quarterly compliance reports. If you deviate from the emission limits in § 63.2983 or the operating limits in § 63.2984 in the quarter prior to February 28, 2019, you must include this information in the report for the first full semiannual reporting period following February 28, 2019.


(2) *Inclusion with title V report.* For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 71, and for which the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 71.6 (a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of according to the dates in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 


(3) *Contents of reports.* The semiannual compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section: 


(i) Company name and address. 


(ii) Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the content of the report.

(d) *Startup, shutdown, malfunction reports.* Before August 28, 2019, for existing drying and curing ovens and drying and curing ovens constructed or reconstructed after May 26, 2000 and before April 7, 2018, if you have a startup, shutdown, or malfunction during the semiannual reporting period, you must submit the reports specified § 63.10(d)(5). No startup, shutdown, or malfunction plan is required for any affected source that commences construction or reconstruction after April 6, 2018.


(e) *Performance test results.* You must submit results of each performance test (as defined in § 63.2) required by this subpart no later than 60 days after completing the test as specified in § 63.10(d)(2). You must include the values measured during the performance test for the parameters listed in Table 1 of this subpart and the operating limits or ranges that you will include in your OMM plan. For the thermal oxidizer temperature, you must include 15-minute averages and the average for the three 1-hour test runs. For affected sources that commence construction or reconstruction after April 6, 2018, beginning February 28, 2019, and beginning no later than August 27, 2019 for all other affected sources, you must submit the results following the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) For data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT website (*https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/electronic-reporting-tool-ert*) at the time of the test, you must submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via CEDRI (CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (*https://cdx.epa.gov/*)). You must submit performance test data in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file format consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT website.


(2) For data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the test, you must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13, unless the Administrator agrees to or specifies an alternate reporting method.


(3) If you claim that some of the performance test information you are submitting under paragraph (e)(1) is confidential business information (CBI), you must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disk, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage medium to the EPA. You must clearly mark the electronic medium as CBI and mail to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, Mail Drop C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. You must submit the same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(f) *Claims of EPA system outage.* If you are required to electronically submit a report through the CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section.


(1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required test report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX Systems.


(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.


(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.


(4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.


(5) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:


(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;


(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;


(iii) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and


(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.


(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.


(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.


(g) *Claims of force majeure.* If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. To assert a claim of force majeure, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) You may submit a claim if a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirements to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (e.g., large scale power outage).


(2) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.


(3) You must provide to the Administrator:


(i) A written description of the force majeure event;


(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event;


(iii) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and


(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.


(4) The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.


(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs.
