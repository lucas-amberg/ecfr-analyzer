# § 63.8055   How do I comply with a weight percent HAP limit in coating products?

(a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements in Table 1 to this subpart for each individual stationary process vessel at an existing source, you may elect to comply with a 5 weight percent HAP limit for process vessels at your affected source that are used to manufacture coatings with a HAP content of less than 0.05 kg per kg product as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(b) You may only comply with the alternative during the production of coatings that contain less than 5 weight percent HAP, as determined using any of the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Method 311 (appendix A to this part). As an alternative to Method 311, you may use California Air Resources Board Method 310, Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in Consumer Products and Reactive Organic Compounds (ROC) in Aerosol Coating Products (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14) for use with aerosol cans.


(2) Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). You may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for the mass fraction of HAP, or one of the alternatives in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) ASTM D2369-10 (Reapproved 2015)e1, (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14);


(ii) ASTM D2697-03 (Reapproved 2014) (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14); or


(iii) ASTM D3960-98 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14).




(3) You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.


(4) You may rely on formulation data from raw material suppliers if it represents each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for the HAP listed in Table 11 to this subpart, and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. If the HAP weight percent estimated based on formulation data conflicts with the results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, then there is a rebuttal presumption that the test results are accurate unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the permitting authority that the test results are not accurate and that the formulation data are more appropriate.
