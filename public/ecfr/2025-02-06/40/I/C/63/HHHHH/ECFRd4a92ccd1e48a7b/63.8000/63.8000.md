# § 63.8000   What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?

(a) *Applicability.* You must comply with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must be in compliance with the emission limits and work practice standards in Tables 1 through 5 to this subpart at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. You must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. You must meet the requirements specified in §§ 63.8005 through 63.8030 (or the alternative means of compliance in § 63.8050), except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. You must meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specified in §§ 63.8070, 63.8075, and 63.8080.


(2) Beginning on the compliance dates specified in § 63.7995(e), paragraph (a)(1) of this section no longer applies. Instead, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.7995(e), you must be in compliance with the emission limits and work practice standards in Tables 1 through 5 to this subpart at all times. You must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. You must meet the requirements specified in §§ 63.8005 through 63.8030 (or the alternative means of compliance in § 63.8050), except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. You must meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specified in §§ 63.8070, 63.8075, and 63.8080.




(b) *General requirements.* (1) If an emission stream contains halogen atoms, and you use a combustion-based control device (excluding a flare) to meet an organic HAP emission limit, you must determine whether the emission stream meets the definition of a halogenated stream by calculating the concentration of each organic compound that contains halogen atoms using the procedures specified in § 63.115(d)(2)(v), multiplying each concentration by the number of halogen atoms in the organic compound, and summing the resulting halogen atom concentrations for all of the organic compounds in the emission stream. Alternatively, you may elect to designate the emission stream as halogenated.


(2) You must comply with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.8105, is allowed at any time conditions require it to avoid unsafe conditions.


(ii) Beginning on the compliance dates specified in § 63.7995(e), paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section no longer applies. Instead, opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.8105, is considered a deviation, as defined in § 63.8105, unless it is a bypass of a control for a process vessel and accounted for as specified in § 63.8005(h).










(c) *Compliance requirements for closed vent systems and control devices.* If you use a control device to comply with an emission limit in Table 1, 2, or 5 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(1) If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to any combination of control devices (except a flare), you must meet the requirements of § 63.982(c) and the requirements referenced therein.


(2) If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to a flare, you must meet the requirements of § 63.982(b) and the requirements referenced therein. You may not use a flare to control halogenated vent streams or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions.




(3) If you use a halogen reduction device to reduce hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions that are generated by combusting halogenated vent streams, you must meet the requirements of § 63.994, except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, and the requirements referenced therein. If you use a halogen reduction device before a combustion device, you must determine the halogen atom emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in § 63.115(d)(2)(v).










(d) *Exceptions to the requirements specified in other subparts of this part 63*—(1) *Requirements for performance tests.* The requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section apply instead of or in addition to the requirements for performance testing of control devices as specified in subpart SS of this part.




(i) Conduct gas molecular weight analysis using Method 3, 3A, or 3B in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. As an alternative to EPA Method 3B for the manual procedures only and not the instrumental procedures, you may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19-10-1981 Part 10 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14) as an acceptable alternative.




(ii) Measure moisture content of the stack gas using Method 4 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.




(iii) As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to comply with any of the emission limits specified in Tables 1 through 6 to this subpart you may use the alternatives specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.


(A) As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, you may use Method 320 of appendix A to this part. When using Method 320, you must follow the analyte spiking procedures of section 13 of Method 320, unless you demonstrate that the complete spiking procedure has been conducted at a similar source. As an alternative to Method 320 of appendix A to this part, you may use ASTM Method D6348-12e1 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14), with the caveats that the test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM Method D6348-12el, Sections Al through A8 are mandatory; and in ASTM Method D6348-12e1 Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (Equation A5.5). In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, %R must be 70% ≥ R ≤ 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (*i.e.,* the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the following equation:


(B) As an alternative to using EPA Method 18, you may also use ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14), but only when the target compounds are all known and the target compounds are all listed in ASTM D6420-18 as measurable; ASTM D6420-18 should not be used for methane and ethane; and ASTM D6420-18 may not be used as a total VOC method.




(iv) Section 63.997(c)(1) does not apply. For the purposes of this subpart, results of all initial compliance demonstrations must be included in the notification of compliance status report, which is due 150 days after the compliance date, as specified in § 63.8075(d)(1).


(v) If you do not have a closed-vent system as defined in § 63.981, you must determine capture efficiency using Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for all stationary process vessels subject to requirements of Table 1 to this subpart.


(vi) You must conduct periodic performance tests and establish the operating limits required by §§ 63.8005(e), 63.8010(b)(1), and 63.8050(d)(3) within 5 years following the previous performance test. You must conduct the initial or first periodic performance test before August 14, 2023, unless you are already required to complete periodic performance tests as a requirement of renewing your facility's operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, and have conducted a performance test on or after August 15, 2018. Thereafter you must conduct a performance test no later than 5 years following the previous performance test. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during each performance test.


(vii) You must conduct periodic performance tests and establish the operating limits required by § 63.8005(i) within 5 years following the previous performance test. You must conduct the initial or first periodic performance test before February 22, 2024, unless you are already required to complete a periodic performance test as a requirement of renewing your facility's operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, and have conducted a performance test on or before February 22, 2024. Thereafter you must conduct a performance test no later than 5 years following the previous performance test. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during each performance test.




(2) [Reserved]


(3) *Periodic verification.* For a control device with total inlet HAP emissions less than 1 ton per year (tpy), you must establish at least one operating limit for a parameter that you will measure and record at least once per averaging period (*i.e.,* daily or block) to verify that the control device is operating properly. You may elect to measure the same parameter that is required for control devices that control inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the operating limit or range and the measurement frequency, and you must provide rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control device is operating properly.
















(4) *Continuous emissions monitoring systems.* Each continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the requirements in § 63.8 and paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) Each CEMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and according to paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section. For any CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8, you must also comply with appendix F, procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60.




(A) If you wish to use a CEMS other than a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 15 in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60 or a hydrogen chloride (HCl) CEMS meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 18 in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60 and Quality Assurance Procedure 6 in appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 to measure hydrogen halide and halogen HAP before we promulgate a Performance Specification for such CEMS, you must prepare a monitoring plan and submit it for approval in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.8.




(B) [Reserved]


(ii) You must determine the calibration gases and reporting units for TOC CEMS in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.


(A) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 9 or 15 requirements, determine the target analyte(s) for calibration using either process knowledge of the control device inlet stream or the screening procedures of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream.


(B) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a combustion device, calibrate the instrument on the predominant organic HAP and report the results as carbon (C_1_), and use Method 25A or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests.


(C) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a noncombustion device, determine the predominant organic HAP using either process knowledge or the screening procedures of Method 18 in appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 on the control device inlet stream, calibrate the monitor on the predominant organic HAP, and report the results as C_1_. Use Method 18, ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 63.14), or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests, and report the results as C_1._

(iii) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except that the schedule in § 63.8(e)(4) does not apply, and the results of the performance evaluation must be included in the notification of compliance status report.




(iv) The CEMS data must be reduced to operating day or operating block averages computed using valid data, except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed. An operating block is a period of time from the beginning to end of batch operations in the manufacturing of a coating. Operating block averages may be used only for process vessel data.








(5) *Continuous parameter monitoring.* The provisions in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section apply in addition to the requirements for continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63.


(i) You must record the results of each calibration check and all maintenance performed on the CPMS as specified in § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(A).


(ii) When subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 uses the term a range or operating range of a monitored parameter, it means an operating limit for a monitored parameter for the purposes of this subpart.


(iii) As an alternative to measuring pH as specified in § 63.994(c)(1)(i), you may elect to continuously monitor the caustic strength of the scrubber effluent.


(6) *Startup, shutdown, and malfunction.* Sections 63.998(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(6)(i)(A), which apply to the exclusion of monitoring data collected during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) from daily averages, do not apply for the purposes of this subpart.


(7) *Reporting.* (i) When §§ 63.8005 through 63.8025 reference other subparts in this part 63 that use the term periodic report, it means compliance report for the purposes of this subpart.


(ii) When there are conflicts between this subpart and referenced subparts for the due dates of reports required by this subpart, reports must be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.


(iii) Excused excursions, as defined in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63, are not allowed.




(8) *Quality control program.* Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.7995(e), in lieu of the requirements specified in § 63.8(d)(3), you must keep the written quality control program procedures required by § 63.8(d)(2) on record for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If the performance evaluation plan is revised, you shall keep previous (*i.e.,* superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. The program of corrective action should be included in the plan required under § 63.8(d)(2).


(e) *General duty.* Beginning no later than August 14, 2023, at all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.


(f) *Removal of startup, shutdown, and malfunction requirements.* Beginning on the compliance dates specified in § 63.7995(e), the referenced provisions specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (22) of this section do not apply when demonstrating compliance with this subpart through referenced provisions of subparts SS, UU, and TT of this part.
