# § 63.8005   What requirements apply to my process vessels?

(a) *General.* (1) You must meet each emission limit and work practice standard in table 1 to this subpart that applies to you, and you must meet each applicable requirement specified in §  63.8000(b), except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, you are not required to meet the emission limits and work practice standards in table 1 to this subpart if you comply with §  63.8050 or §  63.8055.






(ii) You must meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from automatic cleaning operations. You are not required to meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from cleaning operations that are conducted manually.


(iii) You must meet the inorganic HAP emissions limit in table 1 to this subpart during the addition of material containing metal HAP to a process vessel. You are not required to meet this limit for the addition of pigments and other solids that are in paste, slurry, or liquid form.










(2) For each control device used to comply with Table 1 to this subpart, you must comply with subpart SS of this part as specified in § 63.8000(c), except as specified in § 63.8000(d) and (f) and paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.




(b) When subpart SS of this part 63 refers to process vents, it means process vessel vents for the purposes of this section.


(c) Process condensers, as defined in § 63.1251, are not considered to be control devices for process vessels.


(d) *Initial compliance.*  

(1) To demonstrate initial compliance with a percent reduction emission limit in table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct the performance test under conditions as specified in §  63.7(e)(1), except as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, and except that the performance test must be conducted under worst-case conditions. Also, the performance test for a control device used to control emissions from process vessels must be conducted according to §  63.1257(b)(8), including the submittal of a site-specific test plan for approval prior to testing. The requirements in §  63.997(e)(1)(i) and (iii) also do not apply for performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits for process vessels.




(2) For the initial compliance demonstration for condensers, you must determine uncontrolled emissions using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2), and you must determine controlled emissions using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) and (iii).


(3) You must demonstrate that each process condenser is properly operated according to the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(*4*)(*ii*) and (d)(3)(iii)(B). The reference in § 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B) to the alternative standard in § 63.1254(c) does not apply for the purposes of this subpart. As an alternative to measuring the exhaust gas temperature, as required by § 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B), you may elect to measure the liquid temperature in the receiver.


(4) You must conduct a performance test or compliance demonstration equivalent to an initial compliance demonstration within 360 hours of a change in operating conditions that are not considered to be within the previously established worst-case conditions.


(5) Beginning on the compliance dates specified in § 63.7995(e), § 63.7(e)(1) no longer applies and performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.


(e) *Establishing operating limits.* You must establish operating limits under the conditions required for your initial compliance demonstration and periodic performance tests, except you may elect to establish operating limit(s) for conditions other than those under which a performance test was conducted as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (e)(2) of this section.












(1) The operating limits may be based on the results of the performance test and supplementary information such as engineering assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. These limits may be established for conditions as unique as individual emission episodes. You must provide rationale in the precompliance report for the specific level for each operating limit, including any data and calculations used to develop the limit and a description of why the limit indicates proper operation of the control device. The procedures provided in this paragraph (e)(1) have not been approved by the Administrator and determination of the operating limit using these procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.


(2) If you elect to establish separate operating limits for different emission episodes, you must maintain records as specified in § 63.8080(g) of each point at which you change from one operating limit to another, even if the duration of the monitoring for an operating limit is less than 15 minutes.




(f) *Averaging periods.* If you elect to establish separate operating limits for different emission episodes, you may elect to determine operating block averages instead of the daily averages specified in § 63.998(b)(3). An operating block is a period of time that is equal to the time from the beginning to end of an emission episode or sequence of emission episodes.


(g) *Flow indicators.* If flow to a control device could be intermittent or bypassed, you must install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no flow, or you must comply with the alternatives requirements of paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section. Periods of no flow may not be used in daily or block averages. You must perform a flow meter verification check annually for at least two points: One at the instrument's zero and the other at the instrument's span.


(1) You must use a valve position or bypass damper position indicator that provides a continuous reading and record of the bypass valve or damper position when the control device is in operation. You must inspect the monitoring system semiannually to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.


(2) You must secure the bypass line valve or bypass damper in the non-diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and that the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line. You must also record the occurrence of all periods when the seal or closure mechanism is broken, or the key for a lock-and-key type lock has been checked out.


(h) *Bypass.* Beginning no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.7995(e), when determining compliance with the percent emission reduction requirements in Table 1 to this subpart, you must account for the time that the control device was bypassed. You must use Equation 1 to this section to determine the allowable total hours of bypass for each semi-annual compliance period. To demonstrate compliance, the actual total hours of bypass must not exceed the allowable total hours of bypass calculated by Equation 1 to this section.


(i) *Inorganic HAP standards.* You must demonstrate initial compliance with the inorganic HAP limit in table 1 to this subpart and as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by following the requirements specified in paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section. You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the requirements in § 63.11583(a) through (e) and (h).


(1) You must follow the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section and include the results in your notification of compliance status report in accordance with § 63.8070.


(i) You must conduct the tests under conditions that represent normal operation, during which dry materials are added; tests may be conducted whether or not those dry materials contain metal HAP.


(ii) You must perform the test using EPA Method 5 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.


(iii) You must conduct a minimum of three separate test runs with a minimum sample volume of 70 dry standard cubic feet (2 dry standard cubic meters) per run for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 63.7(e)(3).


(2) For existing sources only, you may demonstrate initial compliance using the results of an emissions test conducted in the past 5 years provided the test meets the requirements in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
