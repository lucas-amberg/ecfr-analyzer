# ยง 63.11171   How do I know if my source is considered a new source or an existing source?

(a) This subpart applies to each new and existing affected area source engaged in the activities listed in ยง 63.11170, with the exception of those activities listed in ยง 63.11169(d) of this subpart.


(b) The affected source is the collection of all of the items listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section. Not all affected sources will have all of the items listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.


(1) Mixing rooms and equipment;


(2) Spray booths, ventilated prep stations, curing ovens, and associated equipment;


(3) Spray guns and associated equipment;


(4) Spray gun cleaning equipment;


(5) Equipment used for storage, handling, recovery, or recycling of cleaning solvent or waste paint; and


(6) Equipment used for paint stripping at paint stripping facilities using paint strippers containing MeCl.

(1) You commenced the construction of the source after September 17, 2007 by installing new paint stripping or surface coating equipment. If you purchase and install spray booths, enclosed spray gun cleaners, paint stripping equipment to reduce MeCl emissions, or purchase new spray guns to comply with this subpart at an existing source, these actions would not make your existing source a new source.


(2) The new paint stripping or surface coating equipment is used at a source that was not actively engaged in paint stripping and/or miscellaneous surface coating prior to September 17, 2007.


(d) An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of reconstruction in ยง 63.2.
