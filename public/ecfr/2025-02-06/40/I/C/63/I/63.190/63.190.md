(7) The owner or operator of a plant site at which a process specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section is located is exempt from all requirements of this subpart I until not later than April 22, 1997 if the owner or operator certifies, in a notification to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, not later than May 14, 1996, that the plant site at which the process is located emits, and will continue to emit, during any 12-month period, less than 10 tons per year of any individual HAP, and less than 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP.


(i) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are not federally enforceable (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator shall document the basis for the determination as specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(i)(A) through (b)(7)(i)(C).


(A) The owner or operator shall identify all HAP emission points at the plant site, including those emission points subject to and emission points not subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part;


(B) The owner or operator shall calculate the amount of annual HAP emissions released from each emission point at the plant site, using acceptable measurement or estimating techniques for maximum expected operating conditions at the plant site. Examples of estimating procedures that are considered acceptable include the calculation procedures in § 63.150 of subpart G, the early reduction demonstration procedures specified in §§ 63.74(c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (g), or accepted engineering practices. If the total annual HAP emissions for the plant site are annually reported under EPCRA section 313, then such reported annual emissions may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.


(C) The owner or operator shall sum the amount of annual HAP emissions from all emission points on the plant site. If the total emissions of any one HAP are less than 10 tons per year and the total emissions of any combination of HAP are less than 25 tons per year, the plant site qualifies for the exemption described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, provided that emissions are kept below these thresholds.


(ii) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are federally enforceable, and the plant site is not a major source (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(7) of this section.


(c) The owner or operator of a process listed in paragraph (b) of this section that does not have the designated organic hazardous air pollutants present in the process shall comply only with the requirements of § 63.192(k) of this subpart.
