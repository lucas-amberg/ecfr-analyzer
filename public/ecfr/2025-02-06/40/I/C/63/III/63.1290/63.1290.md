# ยง 63.1290   Applicability.

(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to each new and existing flexible polyurethane foam or rebond foam process that meets the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Produces flexible polyurethane or rebond foam;


(2) Emits a HAP, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and


(3) Is located at a plant site that is a major source, as defined in ยง 63.2 of subpart A.


(b) For the purpose of this subpart, an affected source includes all processes meeting the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section that are located at a contiguous plant site, with the exception of those processes listed in paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) A process meeting one of the following criteria listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section shall not be subject to the provisions of this subpart:


(1) A process exclusively dedicated to the fabrication of flexible polyurethane foam; or


(2) A research and development process.


(d) *Applicability of this subpart.* (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies.


(2) Equipment leak requirements of ยง 63.1294 shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.


(3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during times when emissions are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment.


(4) *General duty.* At all times, the owner or operator shall operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
