(1) The requirements described in Tables 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart; and


(2) The requirement to submit a compliance certification annually as required under § 63.1306(g).


(b) *All slabstock affected sources.* For slabstock affected sources, failure to meet the requirements contained in § 63.1294 shall be considered a violation of this subpart. Violation of each item listed in the paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section, as applicable, shall be considered a separate violation.


(1) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(a) in accordance with § 63.1294(a)(1), each unloading event that occurs when the diisocyanate storage vessel is not equipped with a vapor return line from the storage vessel to the tank truck or rail car, each unloading event that occurs when the vapor line is not connected, each unloading event that the vapor line is not inspected for leaks as described in § 63.1294(a)(1)(i), each unloading event that occurs after a leak has been detected and not repaired, and each calendar day after a leak is detected, but not repaired as soon as practicable;


(2) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(a) in accordance with § 63.1294(a)(2), each unloading event that the diisocyanate storage vessel is not equipped with a carbon adsorption system, each unloading event (or each month if more than one unloading event occurs in a month) that the carbon adsorption system is not monitored for breakthrough in accordance with § 63.1303(a)(3) or (4), and each unloading event that occurs when the carbon is not replaced after an indication of breakthrough;


(3) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(a) in accordance with § 63.1294(a)(2) through the alternative monitoring procedures in § 63.1303(a)(2), each unloading event that the diisocyanate storage vessel is not equipped with a carbon adsorption system, each time that the carbon adsorption system is not monitored for breakthrough in accordance with § 63.1303(b)(1) or (2) at the interval established in the design analysis, and each unloading event that occurs when the carbon is not replaced after an indication of breakthrough;


(4) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(b) in accordance with § 63.1294(b)(1), each calendar day that a transfer pump in diisocyanate service is not a sealless pump;


(5) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(b) in accordance with § 63.1294(b)(2), each calendar day that a transfer pump in diisocyanate service is not submerged as described in § 63.1294(b)(2)(i), each week that the pump is not visually monitored for leaks, each calendar day after 5 calendar days after detection of a leak that a first attempt at repair has not been made in accordance with § 63.1294(b)(2)(iii)(B), and the earlier of each calendar day after 15 calendar days after detection of a leak that a leak is not repaired, or a leak is not repaired as soon as practicable, each subsequent calendar day (with the exception of situations meeting the criteria of § 63.1294(d));


(6) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(c), each calendar day after 5 calendar days after detection of a leak that a first attempt at repair has not been made, and the earlier of each calendar day after 15 calendar days after detection of a leak that a leak is not repaired, or if a leak is not repaired as soon as practicable, each subsequent calendar day (with the exception of situations meeting the criteria of § 63.1294(d)).


(c) *Slabstock affected sources.* For slabstock foam affected sources, failure to meet the requirements contained in §§ 63.1297 and 63.1298, respectively, shall be considered a violation of this subpart. Violation of each item listed in the following paragraphs shall be considered a separate violation.


(1) For each slabstock foam affected source subject to the provisions in § 63.1297, each calendar day that a HAP ABA or HAP-based material is used as an ABA;


(2) For each slabstock foam affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.1298, each calendar day that a HAP-based material is used as an equipment cleaner.


(d) *Molded and rebond foam affected sources.* For molded and rebond foam affected sources, failure to meet the requirements contained in § 63.1300 and § 63.1301, respectively, shall be considered a violation of this subpart. Violation of each item listed in the following paragraphs shall be considered a separate violation.


(1) For each molded foam affected source subject to the provisions in § 63.1300(a), each calendar day that a HAP-based material is used as an equipment cleaner (except for diisocyanates used to flush the mixhead and associated piping during periods of startup or maintenance, provided that the diisocyanate compounds are contained in a closed-loop system and are re-used in production);


(2) For each molded foam affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.1300(b), each calendar day that a HAP-base material is used as a mold release agent;


(3) For each rebond foam affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.1301(a), each calendar day that a HAP-based material is used as an equipment cleaner; and


(4) For each rebond foam affected source complying with § 63.1301(b), each calendar day that a HAP-based mold release agent is used.
