# § 63.3094   What work practice standards must I meet?

(a) [Reserved] 


(b) You must develop and implement a work practice plan to minimize organic HAP emissions from the storage, mixing, and conveying of coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in, and waste materials generated by, all coating operations for which emission limits are established under § 63.3090(a) through (d) or § 63.3091(a) through (d). The plan must specify practices and procedures to ensure that, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section are implemented. 


(1) All organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be stored in closed containers. 


(2) The risk of spills of organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be minimized. 


(3) Organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be conveyed from one location to another in closed containers or pipes. 


(4) Mixing vessels, other than day tanks equipped with continuous agitation systems, which contain organic-HAP-containing coatings and other materials must be closed except when adding to, removing, or mixing the contents. 


(5) Emissions of organic HAP must be minimized during cleaning of storage, mixing, and conveying equipment. 


(c) You must develop and implement a work practice plan to minimize organic HAP emissions from cleaning and from purging of equipment associated with all coating operations for which emission limits are established under § 63.3090(a) through (d) or § 63.3091(a) through (d). 


(1) The plan shall, at a minimum, address each of the operations listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section in which you use organic-HAP-containing materials or in which there is a potential for emission of organic HAP. 


(i) The plan must address vehicle body wipe emissions through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Use of solvent-moistened wipes. 


(B) Keeping solvent containers closed when not in use. 


(C) Keeping wipe disposal/recovery containers closed when not in use. 


(D) Use of tack-wipes. 


(E) Use of solvents containing less than 1 percent organic HAP by weight. 


(ii) The plan must address coating line purging emissions through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Air/solvent push-out. 


(B) Capture and reclaim or recovery of purge materials (excluding applicator nozzles/tips). 


(C) Block painting to the maximum extent feasible. 


(D) Use of low-HAP or no-HAP solvents for purge. 


(iii) The plan must address emissions from flushing of coating systems through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Keeping solvent tanks closed. 


(B) Recovering and recycling solvents. 


(C) Keeping recovered/recycled solvent tanks closed. 


(D) Use of low-HAP or no-HAP solvents. 


(iv) The plan must address emissions from cleaning of spray booth grates through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (E) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Controlled burn-off. 


(B) Rinsing with high-pressure water (in place). 


(C) Rinsing with high-pressure water (off line). 


(D) Use of spray-on masking or other type of liquid masking. 


(E) Use of low-HAP or no-HAP content cleaners. 


(v) The plan must address emissions from cleaning of spray booth walls through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(v)(A) through (E) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Use of masking materials (contact paper, plastic sheet, or other similar type of material). 


(B) Use of spray-on masking. 


(C) Use of rags and manual wipes instead of spray application when cleaning walls. 


(D) Use of low-HAP or no-HAP content cleaners. 


(E) Controlled access to cleaning solvents. 


(vi) The plan must address emissions from cleaning of spray booth equipment through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(vi)(A) through (E) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Use of covers on equipment (disposable or reusable). 


(B) Use of parts cleaners (off-line submersion cleaning). 


(C) Use of spray-on masking or other protective coatings. 


(D) Use of low-HAP or no-HAP content cleaners. 


(E) Controlled access to cleaning solvents. 


(vii) The plan must address emissions from cleaning of external spray booth areas through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(vii)(A) through (F) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Use of removable floor coverings (paper, foil, plastic, or similar type of material). 


(B) Use of manual and/or mechanical scrubbers, rags, or wipes instead of spray application. 


(C) Use of shoe cleaners to eliminate coating track-out from spray booths. 


(D) Use of booties or shoe wraps. 


(E) Use of low-HAP or no-HAP content cleaners. 


(F) Controlled access to cleaning solvents. 


(viii) The plan must address emissions from housekeeping measures not addressed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section through one or more of the techniques listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(viii)(A) through (C) of this section, or an approved alternative. 


(A) Keeping solvent-laden articles (cloths, paper, plastic, rags, wipes, and similar items) in covered containers when not in use. 


(B) Storing new and used solvents in closed containers. 


(C) Transferring of solvents in a manner to minimize the risk of spills. 


(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section, if the type of coatings used in any facility with surface coating operations subject to the requirements of this section are of such a nature that the need for one or more of the practices specified under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (viii) is eliminated, then the plan may include approved alternative or equivalent measures that are applicable or necessary during cleaning of storage, conveying, and application equipment. 


(d) As provided in § 63.6(g), we, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), may choose to grant you permission to use an alternative to the work practice standards in this section. 


(e) The work practice plans developed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are not required to be incorporated in your title V permit. Any revisions to the work practice plans developed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not constitute revisions to your title V permit. 


(f) Copies of the current work practice plans developed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, as well as plans developed within the preceding 5 years must be available on-site for inspection and copying by the permitting authority.
