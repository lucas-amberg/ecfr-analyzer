You must also keep all the associated records for these procedures as specified in Table 9 to this subpart.


(A) Within 1 hour of the time the floor-level mercury concentration action level was exceeded, you must conduct each inspection specified in Table 2 to this subpart in the area where the concentration higher than the floor-level mercury concentration action level was measured, with the exception of the cell room floor and the pillars and beam inspections. (B) You must also inspect all decomposers, hydrogen system piping up to the hydrogen header, and other potential locations of mercury vapor leaks in the area using a technique specified in Table 6 to this subpart. You must correct any problem identified during these inspections according to the requirements in Tables 2 and 3 to this subpart.


(e) You must prepare, submit, and operate according to a written washdown plan designed to minimize fugitive mercury emissions through routine washing of surfaces where liquid mercury could accumulate. The written plan must address the elements contained in Table 7 to this subpart.


(f) You must keep records of the mass of all virgin mercury added to cells on an annual basis.


(g) You must institute a cell room monitoring program to continuously monitor the mercury vapor concentration in the upper portion of each cell room and to take corrective actions as quickly as possible when elevated mercury vapor levels are detected. As specified in § 63.8252(e)(1)(iv), you must prepare and submit to the Administrator, a cell room monitoring plan containing the elements listed in Table 5 to this subpart and meet the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.




(1) You must utilize mercury monitoring systems that meet the requirements of Table 8 to this subpart.


(2) You must establish an action level according to the requirements in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) Beginning on the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.8186, measure and record the mercury concentration for at least 30 days using a system that meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(ii) Using the monitoring data collected according to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, establish your action level at the 75th percentile of the data set.


(iii) Submit your action level as part of your Notification of Compliance Status report according to § 63.8252(e)(1).


(3) Beginning on the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.8186, you must continuously monitor the mercury concentration in the cell room. Failure to monitor and record the data according to § 63.8256(c) (4)(ii) for 75 percent of the time in any 6-month period constitutes a deviation.
