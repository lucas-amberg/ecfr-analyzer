(e) Pursuant to Section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, an owner or operator may request an extension allowing the existing affected source up to 1 additional year to comply with Section 112(d) standards. For purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall be submitted to the permitting authority as part of the operating permit application or to the Administrator as a separate submittal or as part of the Precompliance Report. Requests for extensions shall be submitted no later than 120 days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, or as specified elsewhere in this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The dates specified in § 63.6(i) for submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply to this subpart. 


(1) A request for an extension of compliance shall include the data described in § 63.6(i)(6)(i) (A),(B), and (D).


(2) The requirements in § 63.6(i)(8) through § 63.6(i)(14) shall govern the review and approval of requests for extensions of compliance with this subpart.


(3) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request after the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section, provided that the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and the need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request shall include, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a statement of the reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first learned of the circumstances necessitating a request for compliance extension under this paragraph (e)(3). 


(f) Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of affected sources subject to this subpart.


(g)(1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of subpart I of this part, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said affected source shall no longer be subject to subpart I of this part.


(2) Said affected sources that elected to comply with subpart I of this part through a quality improvement program, as specified in § 63.175 or § 63.176 or both, may elect to continue these programs without interruption as a means of complying with this subpart. In other words, becoming subject to this subpart does not restart or reset the “compliance clock” as it relates to reduced burden earned through a quality improvement program.


(h) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart and that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said storage vessel shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb. 


(i)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, after the compliance dates specified in this section, affected sources producing PET using a continuous terephthalic acid process, producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process, or producing polystyrene resin using a continuous process subject to this subpart that are also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD, are required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said sources shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD. 


(2) Existing affected sources producing PET using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end finisher process shall continue to be subject to 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(2)(ii)(C).

(3) Existing affected sources producing PET using a continuous terephthalic acid process, but not using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end finisher process, that are subject to and complying with 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(2)(ii)(B) shall continue to comply with said section. Existing affected sources producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalic process that are subject to and complying with 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B) shall continue to comply with said section. 


(j) Owners or operators of affected sources subject to this subpart that are also subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this part shall comply with both subparts. 


(k) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said source shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV.


(l) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a distillation operation that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart NNN, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, the distillation operation shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart NNN. 


(m) *Applicability of other regulations for monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting with respect to combustion devices, recovery devices, or recapture devices.* After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, if any combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC, or is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 265 subpart AA or CC and the owner or operator complies with the periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC that would apply to the device if the facility had final-permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart. The owner or operator shall identify which option has been selected in the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.1335(e)(5). 


(n) *Applicability of other requirements for heat exchange systems or waste management units.* Paragraphs (n)(1) and (n)(2) of this section address instances in which certain requirements from other regulations also apply for the same heat exchange system(s) or waste management unit(s) that are subject to this subpart. 


(1) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a standard identified in paragraphs (n)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in paragraphs (n)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat exchange system. 


(i) Subpart F of this part. 


(ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with § 63.104 (e.g., subpart U of this part).

(i) Subpart G of this part. 


(ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with §§ 63.132 through 63.147. 


(o) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), unless specified otherwise in the section or paragraph that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods. 


(1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the standard calendar period). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period. 


(2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (o)(2)(i) or (o)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate. 


(i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or 


(ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs. 


(3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.
