# § 63.1316   PET and polystyrene affected sources—emissions control provisions.

(a) The owner or operator of an affected source producing PET using a continuous process shall comply with paragraph (b) of this section. The owner or operator of an affected source producing polystyrene using a continuous process shall comply with paragraph (c) of this section. As specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, owners or operators shall comply with § 63.1315 for certain continuous process vents and with § 63.1321 for all batch process vents. The owner or operator of an affected source producing PET using a batch process or producing polystyrene using a batch process shall comply with § 63.1315 for continuous process vents and with § 63.1321 for batch process vents, instead of the provisions of §§ 63.1316 through 63.1320. 


(b) The owner or operator of an affected source producing PET using a continuous process shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate, and are not required to comply with the requirements specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD. Compliance can be based on either organic HAP or TOC.

Emissions from continuous process vents in the collection of material recovery sections within the affected source shall be determined by the procedures specified in § 63.1318(b). The owner or operator of a new affected source shall comply with either paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A), (b)(1)(i)(B), or (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section. 


(A) Organic HAP emissions from all continuous process vents in each individual material recovery section shall, as a whole, be no greater than 0.018 kg organic HAP per Mg of product from the associated TPPU(s)); or alternatively, organic HAP emissions from all continuous process vents in the collection of material recovery sections within the affected source shall, as a whole, be no greater than 0.018 kg organic HAP per Mg product from all associated TPPU. During periods of startup or shutdown, as an alternative to using the procedures specified in § 63.1318(b)(1), an owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit subject to an emission limit expressed as mass emissions per mass product may demonstrate compliance with the limit in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A)(*1*), (*2*), or (*3*) of this section.


(*1*) Keep records establishing that the raw material introduced and product discharged rates were both zero.


(*2*) Divide the organic HAP emission rate during startup or shutdown by the rate of polymer produced from the most recent performance test associated with a production rate greater than zero according to § 63.1318(b)(1). Keep records of this calculation.


(*3*) Keep records establishing that the operating parameters of the control device used to comply with the emission limit in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section were maintained at the level established to meet the emission limit at maximum representative operating conditions.
