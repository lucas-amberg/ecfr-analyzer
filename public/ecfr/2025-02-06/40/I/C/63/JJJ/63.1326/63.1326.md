# § 63.1326   Batch process vents—recordkeeping provisions.

(a) *Group determination records for batch process vents.* Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(7) and (a)(8) of this section, each owner or operator of an affected source shall maintain the records specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section for each batch process vent subject to the group determination procedures of § 63.1323. Except for paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the records required by this paragraph (a) are restricted to the information developed and used to make the group determination under §§ 63.1323(b) through 63.1323(g), as appropriate. If an owner or operator did not need to develop certain information (e.g., annual average batch vent flow rate) to determine the group status, this paragraph (a) does not require that additional information be developed. Paragraph (a)(9) of this section specifies the recordkeeping requirements for Group 2 batch process vents that are exempt from the batch mass input limitation provisions, as allowed under § 63.1322(h). 


(1) An identification of each unique product that has emissions from one or more batch emission episodes venting from the batch process vent, along with an identification of the single highest-HAP recipe for each product and the mass of HAP fed to the reactor for that recipe. 


(2) A description of, and an emission estimate for, each batch emission episode, and the total emissions associated with one batch cycle, as described in either paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate. 


(i) If the group determination is based on the expected mix of products, records shall include the emission estimates for the single highest-HAP recipe of each unique product identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that was considered in making the group determination under § 63.1323. 


(ii) If the group determination is based on the single highest-HAP recipe (considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation), records shall include the emission estimates for the single highest-HAP recipe. 


(3) Total annual uncontrolled TOC or organic HAP emissions, determined at the exit from the batch unit operation before any control device, determined in accordance with § 63.1323(b).


(i) For Group 2 batch process vents, said emissions shall be determined at the batch mass input limitation. 


(ii) For Group 1 batch process vents, said emissions shall be those used to determine the group status of the batch process vent.


(4) The annual average batch vent flow rate for the batch process vent, determined in accordance with § 63.1323(e). 


(5) The cutoff flow rate, determined in accordance with § 63.1323(f).


(6) The results of the batch process vent group determination, conducted in accordance with § 63.1323(g).


(7) If a batch process vent is subject to § 63.1322(a) or (b), none of the records in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section are required. 


(8) If the total annual emissions from the batch process vent during the group determination are less than the appropriate level specified in § 63.1323(d), only the records in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section are required. 


(9) For each Group 2 batch process vent that is exempt from the batch mass input limitation provisions because it meets the criteria of § 63.1322(h), the records specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (ii) shall be maintained. 


(i) Documentation of the maximum design capacity of the TPPU; and


(ii) The mass of HAP or material that can be charged annually to the batch unit operation at the maximum design capacity. 


(b) *Compliance demonstration records.* Each owner or operator of a batch process vent or aggregate batch vent stream complying with § 63.1322(a) or (b), shall keep the following records, as applicable, readily accessible:

(5) When complying with the 20 parts per million by volume outlet concentration standard specified in § 63.1322(b)(2), records of the outlet concentration of organic HAP or TOC on a dry basis. If supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions, the outlet concentration shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen. If supplemental combustion air is not used, a correction to 3 percent oxygen is not required.


(c) *Establishment of parameter monitoring level records.* For each parameter monitored according to § 63.1324(c) and Table 7 of this subpart, or for alternate parameters and/or parameters for alternate control devices monitored according to § 63.1327(f) as allowed under § 63.1324(d), maintain documentation showing the establishment of the level that indicates proper operation of the control device as required by § 63.1324(f) for parameters specified in § 63.1324(c) and as required by § 63.1335(e) for alternate parameters. Said documentation shall include the parameter monitoring data used to establish the level.


(d) *Group 2 batch process vent continuous compliance records.* The owner or operator of a Group 2 batch process vent shall comply with either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as appropriate.

In addition, monitoring data recorded during periods of non-operation of the TPPU (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of organic HAP emissions, or periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be included in computing the batch cycle daily averages. 


(iii) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are above the minimum or below the maximum level established in accordance with § 63.1324(f), the owner or operator may record that all values were above the minimum or below the maximum level established rather than calculating and recording a batch cycle daily average for that operating day.


(3) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator for bypass lines specified in § 63.1324(e)(1) was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour. Also, records of the times of all periods when the vent is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator specified in § 63.1324(e)(1) is not operating.


(4) Where a seal or closure mechanism is used to comply with § 63.1324(e)(2), hourly records of whether a diversion was detected at any time are not required.
