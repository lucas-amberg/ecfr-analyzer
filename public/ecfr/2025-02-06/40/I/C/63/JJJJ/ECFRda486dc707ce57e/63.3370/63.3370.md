# § 63.3370   How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?

You must demonstrate compliance each month with the emission limitations in § 63.3320(b)(1) through (4). For each monthly demonstration, you may apply any combination of the emission limitations to each of your web coating lines individually, to each of one or more groupings of your lines (including a single grouping encompassing all lines of your affected source), or to any combination of individual and grouped lines, so long as each web coating line is included in the compliance demonstration for the month (*i.e.,* you are not required to apply the same emission limitation to each of the individual lines or groups of lines). You may change the emission limitation that you apply each month to your individual or grouped lines, and you may change line groupings for your monthly compliance demonstration.


(a) A summary of how you must demonstrate compliance follows:


(b) *As-purchased “compliant” coating materials.* (1) If you comply by using coating materials that individually meet the emission standards in § 63.3320(b)(2) or (3), you must demonstrate that each coating material applied during the month at an existing affected source contains no more than 0.04 mass fraction organic HAP or 0.2 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids, and that each coating material applied during the month at a new affected source contains no more than 0.016 mass fraction organic HAP or 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids on an as-purchased basis as determined in accordance with § 63.3360(c).

(i) *Organic HAP emitted.* Calculate the organic HAP emissions for the affected source for the month by summing all organic HAP emissions calculated according to paragraphs (o)(1), (o)(2)(ii), (o)(3)(iii), and (o)(4) of this section.


(ii) *Coating solids applied.* If demonstrating compliance on the basis of organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied or emission of less than the calculated allowable organic HAP, the owner or operator must determine the coating solids content of each coating material applied during the month following the procedure in § 63.3360(d).


(iii) *Organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied.* Calculate the organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied for each month using Equation 13.


(iv) *Organic HAP based on materials applied.* Calculate the organic HAP emission rate based on material applied using Equation 14.


(6) *Compliance.* The affected source is in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) for the month if all operating parameters required to be monitored under paragraphs (o)(1) through (3) of this section were maintained at the values established under §§ 63.3350 and 63.3360 and one of the standards in paragraphs (o)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section were met. If operating parameter deviations occurred, the affected source is in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) for the month if, assuming no control of emissions or by estimating the emissions using a control destruction efficiency curve for each 3-hour deviation period, one of the standards in paragraphs (6)(i) through (iv) of this section were met.


(i) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on coating solids applied is no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at a new affected source; or


(ii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on material applied is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at a new affected source; or


(iii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source during the month is less than the calculated allowable organic HAP as determined using paragraph (m) of this section; or


(iv) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source was not more than 5 percent of the total mass of organic HAP applied for the month at an existing affected source and no more than 2 percent of the total mass of organic HAP applied for the month at a new affected source. The total mass of organic HAP applied by the affected source in the month must be determined using Equation 10.


(p) *Intermittently-controlled and never-controlled work stations.* If you have been expressly referenced to this paragraph by paragraph (o)(1)(ii), (o)(2)(ii)(B), or (o)(3)(iii)(B) of this section for calculation procedures to determine organic HAP emissions for your intermittently-controlled and never-controlled work stations, you must:


(1) Determine the sum of the mass of all coating materials as-applied on intermittently-controlled work stations operating in bypass mode and the mass of all coating materials as-applied on never-controlled work stations during the month.


(2) Determine the sum of the mass of all coating materials as-applied on intermittently-controlled work stations operating in a controlled mode and the mass of all coating materials applied on always-controlled work stations during the month.


(3) *Liquid-liquid material balance compliance demonstration.* For each web coating line or group of web coating lines for which you use the provisions of paragraph (o)(1)(ii) of this section, you must calculate the organic HAP emitted during the month using Equation 19 of this section:


(4) *Performance test to determine capture efficiency and control device efficiency.* For each web coating line or group of web coating lines for which you use the provisions of paragraph (o)(2)(ii)(B) or (o)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, you must calculate the organic HAP emitted during the month using Equation 20:


(q) *Always-controlled work stations with more than one capture and control system.* If you operate more than one capture system or more than one control device and only have always-controlled work stations, then you are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b)(1) for the month if for each web coating line or group of web coating lines controlled by a common control device:


(1) The volatile matter collection and recovery efficiency as determined by paragraphs (j)(1)(i), (iii), (v), and (vi) of this section is at least 95 percent at an existing affected source and at least 98 percent at a new affected source; or


(2) The overall organic HAP control efficiency as determined by paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section for each web coating line or group of web coating lines served by that control device and a common capture system is at least 95 percent at an existing affected source and at least 98 percent at a new affected source; or


(3) The overall organic HAP control efficiency as determined by paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) and (l)(2)(i) of this section for each web coating line or group of web coating lines served by that control device and a common capture system is at least 95 percent at an existing affected source and at least 98 percent at a new affected source.


(r) *Mass-balance approach.* As an alternative to § 63.3370(b) through (p), you may demonstrate monthly compliance using a mass-balance approach in accordance with this section, except for any month that you elect to meet the emission limitation in § 63.3320(b)(4). The mass-balance approach should be performed as follows:


(1) Separately for each individual/grouping(s) of lines, you must sum the mass of organic HAP emitted during the month and divide by the corresponding total mass of all organic HAP applied on the lines, or total mass of coating materials applied on the lines, or total mass of coating solids applied on the lines, for the same period, in accordance with the emission limitation that you have elected at § 63.3320(b)(1) through (3) for the month's demonstration. You may also choose to use volatile organic content as a surrogate for organic HAP for the compliance demonstration in accordance with § 63.3360(d). You are required to include all emissions and inputs that occur during periods that each line or grouping of lines operates in accordance with the applicability criteria in § 63.3300.


(2) You must include all of the organic HAP emitted by your individual/grouping(s) of lines, as follows.


(i) You must record the mass of organic HAP or volatile organic content utilized at all work stations of all of your individually/grouping(s) of lines. You must additionally record the mass of all coating materials applied at these work stations if you are demonstrating compliance for the month with the emission limitation at § 63.3320(b)(2) (the “coating materials” option). You must additionally record the mass of all coating solids applied at these work stations if you are demonstrating compliance for the month with the emission limitation at § 63.3320(b)(3) (the “coating solids” option).


(ii) You must assume that all of the organic HAP input to all never-controlled work stations is emitted, unless you have determined an emission factor in accordance with § 63.3360(g).


(iii) For all always-controlled work stations, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted, less the reductions provided by the corresponding capture system and control device, in accordance with the most recently measured capture and destruction efficiencies, or in accordance with the measured mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) recovered for the month (*e.g.,* carbon control or condensers). You may account for organic HAP or volatile organic content retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted if you have determined an emission factor in accordance with § 63.3360(g).


(iv) For all intermittently-controlled work stations, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted during periods of no control. During periods of control, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted, less the reductions provided by the corresponding capture system and control device, in accordance with the most recently measured capture and destruction efficiencies, or in accordance with the measured mass of VOC recovered for the month (*e.g.,* carbon control or condensers). You may account for organic HAP or volatile organic content retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted if you have determined an emission factor in accordance with § 63.3360(g).


(v) You must record the organic HAP or volatile organic content input to all work stations of your individual/grouping(s) of lines and the mass of coating materials and/or solids applied, if applicable, and determine corresponding emissions during all periods of operation, including malfunctions or startups and shutdowns of any web coating line or control device.


(3) You are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) if each of your individual/grouping(s) of lines, meets one of the requirements in paragraphs (r)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable. If operating parameter limit deviations occurred, including periods that the oxidizer control device(s), if any, operated at an average combustion temperature more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit below the temperature established in accordance with § 63.3360(e), or the 3-hour average temperature difference across the catalyst bed at no less than 80 percent of this average temperature differential and the catalytic oxidizer maintained a minimum temperature 50 degrees Fahrenheit above the catalyst's ignition temperature, you are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) for the month, if assuming no control of emissions for each 3-hour deviation period (or in accordance with an alternate approved method), one of the requirements in paragraphs (r)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section was met.


(i) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on HAP applied is no more than 0.05 kg organic HAP per kg HAP applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.02 kg organic HAP per kg HAP applied at a new affected source; or


(ii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on coating solids applied is no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at a new affected source; or


(iii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on material applied is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at a new affected source.


(s) *Non-HAP coating.* You must demonstrate that all of the coatings applied at all of the web coating lines at the affected source have organic HAP contents below 0.1 percent by mass for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in section A.6.4 of appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1200, and below 1.0 percent by mass for other organic HAP compounds using the procedures in § 63.3370(s)(1) through (3).


(1) Determine the organic HAP mass fraction of each coating material “as purchased” by following one of the procedures in paragraphs § 63.3360(c)(1) through (3) and determine the organic HAP mass fraction of each coating material “as applied” by following the procedures in paragraph § 63.3360(c)(4).


(2) Submit to your permitting authority a report certifying that all coatings applied at all of the web coating lines at your effected source are non-HAP coatings.


(3) Maintain records of coating formulations used as required in § 63.3410(a)(1)(iii).


(4) Resume reporting requirements if any of the coating formulations are modified to exceed the thresholds in § 63.3370(s) or new coatings which exceed the thresholds in paragraph (s) of this section are used.
