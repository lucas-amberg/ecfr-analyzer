# § 63.8450   What are my monitoring installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

(a) You must install, operate, and maintain each CMS according to your OM&M plan and the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS according to your OM&M plan.


(2) The CMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. To have a valid hour of data, you must have at least three of four equally spaced data values (or at least 75 percent if you collect more than four data values per hour) for that hour (not including startup, shutdown, malfunction, out-of-control periods, or periods of routine control device maintenance covered by the routine control device maintenance alternative standard as specified in § 63.8420(d)).


(3) Determine and record the 3-hour block averages of all recorded readings, calculated after every 3 hours of operation as the average of the previous 3 operating hours. To calculate the average for each 3-hour average period, you must have at least 75 percent of the recorded readings for that period (not including startup, shutdown, malfunction, out-of-control periods, or periods of routine control device maintenance covered by the routine control device maintenance alternative standard as specified in § 63.8420(d)).


(4) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.


(5) At all times, maintain the monitoring equipment including, but not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.


(b) For each liquid flow measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Locate the flow sensor in a position that provides a representative flowrate.


(2) Use a flow sensor with a minimum measurement sensitivity of 2 percent of the liquid flowrate.


(3) At least semiannually, conduct a flow sensor calibration check.


(c) For each pressure measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section.


(1) Locate the pressure sensor(s) in or as close to a position that provides a representative measurement of the pressure.


(2) Minimize or eliminate pulsating pressure, vibration, and internal and external corrosion.


(3) Use a gauge with a minimum measurement sensitivity of 0.5 inch of water or a transducer with a minimum measurement sensitivity of 1 percent of the pressure range.


(4) Check the pressure tap daily to ensure that it is not plugged.


(5) Using a manometer, check gauge calibration quarterly and transducer calibration monthly.


(6) Any time the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range, conduct calibration checks or install a new pressure sensor.


(7) At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity, all electrical connections for continuity, and all mechanical connections for leakage.


(d) For each pH measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Locate the pH sensor in a position that provides a representative measurement of pH.


(2) Ensure the sample is properly mixed and representative of the fluid to be measured.


(3) Check the pH meter's calibration at one point daily.


(4) At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity and all electrical connections for continuity.


(e) For each bag leak detection system, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (11) of this section.


(1) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system must be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained according to EPA-454/R-98-015, “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). Other types of bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.


(2) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.


(3) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide an output of relative PM loadings.


(4) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.


(5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an audible alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.


(6) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detector must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.


(7) For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter.


(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.


(9) The baseline output must be established by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the EPA-454/R-98-015, “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).


(10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted except as detailed in your OM&M plan. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete fabric filter inspection that demonstrates that the fabric filter is in good operating condition, as defined in section 5.2 of the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). Record each adjustment.


(11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.


(f) For each lime, chemical, or carbon feed rate measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Locate the measurement device in a position that provides a representative feed rate measurement.


(2) At least semiannually, conduct a calibration check.


(g) For each limestone feed system on a dry limestone adsorber (DLA), you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1), (4), and (5) of this section and must ensure on a monthly basis that the feed system replaces limestone at least as frequently as the schedule set during the performance test.


(h) For each temperature measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Locate the measurement device in a position that provides a representative temperature.


(2) Use a measurement device with a minimum sensitivity of 1 percent of the temperature being measured.


(3) At least semiannually, conduct a calibration check.


(i) Requests for approval of alternate monitoring procedures must meet the requirements in §§ 63.8445(h) and 63.8(f).
