# § 63.822   Definitions.

(a) All terms used in this subpart that are not defined below have the meaning given to them in the CAA and in subpart A of this part.


*Affirmative defense* means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or a defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.


*Always-controlled work station* means a work station associated with a dryer from which the exhaust is delivered to a control device, with no provision for the dryer exhaust to bypass the control device. Sampling lines for analyzers and relief valves needed for safety purposes are not considered bypass lines.


*Capture efficiency* means the fraction of all organic HAP emissions generated by a process that are delivered to a control device, expressed as a percentage.


*Capture system* means a hood, enclosed room, or other means of collecting organic HAP emissions into a closed-vent system that exhausts to a control device.


*Car-seal* means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to change the position of a valve or damper (e.g., from open to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve or damper cannot be changed without breaking the seal.


*Certified product data sheet (CPDS)* means documentation furnished by suppliers of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, and other materials or by an independent third party that provides the organic HAP weight fraction of these materials determined in accordance with § 63.827(b), or the volatile matter weight fraction or solids weight fraction determined in accordance with § 63.827(c). A material safety data sheet (MSDS) may serve as a CPDS provided the MSDS meets the data requirements of § 63.827(b) and (c). The purpose of the CPDS is to assist the owner or operator in demonstrating compliance with the emission limitations presented in §§ 63.824-63.825.


*Coating* means material applied onto or impregnated into a substrate for decorative, protective, or functional purposes. Such materials include, but are not limited to, solvent-borne coatings, waterborne coatings, wax coatings, wax laminations, extrusion coatings, extrusion laminations, 100 percent solid adhesives, ultra-violet cured coatings, electron beam cured coatings, hot melt coatings, and cold seal coatings. Materials used to form unsupported substrates such as calendaring of vinyl, blown film, cast film, extruded film, and coextruded film are not considered coatings.

The material is then transferred from the image on the plate cylinder to the web or sheet to be printed. A flexographic print station may include a fountain roller to transfer material from the reservoir to the anilox roller, or material may be transferred directly from the reservoir to the anilox roller. The materials applied are of a fluid, rather than paste, consistency.

Sampling lines for analyzers and relief valves needed for safety purposes are not considered bypass lines.


*Month* means a calendar month or a prespecified period of 28 days to 35 days.


*Narrow-web flexographic press* means a flexographic press that is not capable of printing substrates greater than 18 inches in width and that does not also meet the definition of rotogravure press (i.e., it has no rotogravure print stations).

*Other press* means a lithographic press, letterpress press, or screen printing press that does not meet the definition of rotogravure press or flexographic press (i.e., it has no rotogravure print stations and no flexographic print stations), and that does not print on fabric or other textiles as defined in the Printing, Coating, and Dyeing of Fabrics and Other Textiles NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart OOOO), wood furniture components as defined in the Wood Furniture Manufacturing Operations NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart JJ) or wood building products as defined in the Surface Coating of Wood Building Products NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart QQQQ).
