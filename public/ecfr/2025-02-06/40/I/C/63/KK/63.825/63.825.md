The device shall be initially certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±2.0 percent.


(vi) Measure the amount of volatile matter recovered for the month.

(B) The organic HAP emission rate based on solids applied, L, is 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg solids applied or less, or


(C) the organic HAP emission rate based on material applied, S, is 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg material applied or less, or
