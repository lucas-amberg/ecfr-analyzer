# ยง 63.3554   How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?

The capture efficiency of your emission capture system must be 100 percent to use the control efficiency/outlet concentration option. You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met. 


(a) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device. 


(b) All coatings and thinners used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system, and coating solvent flash-off, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system. This criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.
