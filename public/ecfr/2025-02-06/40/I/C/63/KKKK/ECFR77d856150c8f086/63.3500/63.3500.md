# § 63.3500   What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?

(a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations in this subpart as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. 


(1) Any coating operation(s) for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, as specified in § 63.3491(a) and (b), must be in compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 at all times.


(2) Any coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, as specified in § 63.3491(c), or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option, as specified in § 63.3491(d), must be in compliance with the emission limitations as specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. 


(i) The coating operation(s) must be in compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 at all times. 


(ii) The coating operation(s) must be in compliance with the operating limits for emission capture systems and add-on control devices required by § 63.3492 at all times, except for those for which you use a solvent recovery system and conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3541(i). The operating limits apply only to capture systems and control devices used for purposes of complying with this subpart. 


(iii) The coating operation(s) must be in compliance with the work practice standards in § 63.3493 at all times. 


(b) Before August 24, 2020, you must always operate and maintain your affected source, including all air pollution control and monitoring equipment you use for purposes of complying with this subpart, according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(1)(i). On and after August 24, 2020, at all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source.


(c) Before August 24, 2020, if your affected source uses an emission capture system and add-on control device for purposes of complying with this subpart, you must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (SSMP) according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(3). The plan must address startup, shutdown, and corrective actions in the event of a malfunction of the emission capture system or the add-on control device. The plan must also address any coating operation equipment that may cause increased emissions or that would affect capture efficiency if the process equipment malfunctions, such as conveyors that move parts among enclosures. On and after August 24, 2020, the SSMP is not required.
