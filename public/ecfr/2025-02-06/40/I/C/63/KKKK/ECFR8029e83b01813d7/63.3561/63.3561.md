Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in 40 CFR 63.2, and in this section as follows: 


*Add-on control* means an air pollution control device, such as a thermal oxidizer or carbon adsorber, that reduces pollution in an air stream by destruction or removal before discharge to the atmosphere. 


*Adhesive* means any chemical substance that is applied for the purpose of bonding two surfaces together. 


*Aerosol can* means any can into which a pressurized aerosol product is packaged. 


*Aseptic coating* means any coating that must withstand high temperature steam, chemicals, or a combination of both used to sterilize food cans prior to filling. 


*Can body* means a formed metal can, excluding the unattached end(s). 


*Can end* means a can part manufactured from metal substrate equal to or thinner than 0.3785 millimeters (mm) (0.0149 inch) for the purpose of sealing the ends of can bodies including nonmetal or composite can bodies.


*Capture device* means a hood, enclosure, room, floor sweep, or other means of containing or collecting emissions and directing those emissions into an add-on air pollution control device. 


*Capture efficiency* or *capture system efficiency* means the portion (expressed as a percentage) of the pollutants from an emission source that is delivered to an add-on control device. 


*Capture system* means one or more capture devices intended to collect emissions generated by a coating operation in the use of coatings, both at the point of application and at subsequent points where emissions from the coatings occur, such as flash-off, drying, or curing.


*Cleaning material* means a solvent used to remove contaminants and other materials such as dirt, grease, oil, and dried or wet coating (*e.g.,* depainting) from a substrate before or after coating application or from equipment associated with a coating operation, such as spray booths, spray guns, racks, tanks, and hangers. Thus, it includes any cleaning material used on substrates or equipment or both. 


*Coating* means a material applied to a substrate for decorative, protective, or functional purposes. Such materials include, but are not limited to, paints, sealants, caulks, inks, adhesives, and maskants. Fusion pastes, ink jet markings, mist solutions, and lubricants, as well as decorative, protective, or functional materials that consist only of protective oils for metal, acids, bases, or any combination of these substances, are not considered coatings for the purposes of this subpart. 


*Coating operation* means equipment used to apply coating to a metal can or end (including decorative tins), or metal crown or closure, and to dry or cure the coating after application. A coating operation always includes at least the point at which a coating is applied and all subsequent points in the affected source where organic HAP emissions from that coating occur. There may be multiple coating operations in an affected source. Coating application with hand-held nonrefillable aerosol containers, touch-up markers, or marking pens is not a coating operation for the purposes of this subpart.
