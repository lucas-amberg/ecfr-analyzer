(i) For coke oven doors;


(A) 4.0 percent leaking coke oven doors for each tall by-product coke oven battery, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and


(B) 3.3 percent leaking coke oven doors on each short by-product coke oven battery, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);


(ii) 0.4 percent leaking topside port lids, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);


(iii) 2.5 percent leaking offtake system(s), as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and


(iv) 12 seconds of visible emissions per charge, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(2).


(v) The requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall not apply and the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section do apply to the following brownfield or padup rebuild coke oven batteries:


(A) Bethlehem Steel-Burns Harbor, Battery No. 2;


(B) National Steel-Great Lakes, Battery No. 4; and


(C) Koppers-Woodward, Battery No. 3.


(vi) To retain the exclusion provided in paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section, a coke oven battery specified in paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section shall commence construction not later than July 1, 1996, or 1 year after obtaining a construction permit, whichever is earlier.


(5) The owner or operator of a cold-idle coke oven battery that shut down on or after November 15, 1990, shall comply with the following emission limitations:


(i) For a brownfield coke oven battery or a padup rebuild coke oven battery, coke oven emissions shall not exceed the emission limitations in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and


(ii) For a cold-idle battery other than a brownfield or padup rebuild coke oven battery, coke oven emissions shall not exceed the emission limitations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.


(6) The owner or operator of a cold-idle coke oven battery that shut down prior to November 15, 1990, shall submit a written request to the Administrator to include the battery in the design capacity of a coke plant as of November 15, 1990. A copy of the request shall also be sent to Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. The Administrator will review and approve or disapprove a request according to the following procedures:
