# ยง 63.855   Alternative emissions limits for co-controlled new and existing anode bake furnaces.

(a) *Applicability.* The owner or operator of a new anode bake furnace meeting the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section may demonstrate compliance with alternative TF and POM emission limits according to the procedures of this section.


(1) The new anode bake furnace must have been permitted to operate prior to May 1, 1998; and


(2) The new anode bake furnace must share a common control device with one or more existing anode bake furnaces.


(b) *TF emission limit.* (1) Prior to the date on which each TF emission test is required to be conducted, the owner or operator must determine the applicable TF emission limit using Equation 6-A,




(2) The owner or operator of a new anode bake furnace that is controlled by a control device that also controls emissions of TF from one or more existing anode bake furnaces must not discharge, or cause to be discharged into the atmosphere, any emissions of TF in excess of the emission limits established in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(c) *POM emission limits.* (1) Prior to the date on which each POM emission test is required to be conducted, the owner or operator must determine the applicable POM emission limit using Equation 6-B,




(2) The owner or operator of a new anode bake furnace that is controlled by a control device that also controls emissions of POM from one or more existing anode bake furnaces must not discharge, or cause to be discharged into the atmosphere, any emissions of TF in excess of the emission limits established in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
