# § 63.1348   Compliance requirements.

(a) *Initial Performance Test Requirements.* For an affected source subject to this subpart, you must demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the test methods and procedures in §§ 63.1349 and 63.7. Any affected source that was unable to demonstrate compliance before the compliance date due to being idled, or that had demonstrated compliance but was idled during the normal window for the next compliance test, must demonstrate compliance within 180 days after coming out of the idle period. Any cement kiln that has been subject to the requirements of subpart CCCC or subpart DDDD of 40 CFR Part 60, and is now electing to cease burning nonhazardous solid waste and become subject to this subpart, must meet all the initial compliance testing requirements each time it becomes subject to this subpart, even if it was previously subject to this subpart.


(1) *PM Compliance.* If you are subject to limitations on PM emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the PM emissions standards by using the test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(1).


(2) *Opacity Compliance.* If you are subject to the limitations on opacity under § 63.1345, you must demonstrate compliance with the opacity emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(2). Use the maximum 6-minute average opacity exhibited during the performance test period to determine whether the affected source is in compliance with the standard.


(3) *D/F compliance.* (i) If you are subject to limitations on D/F emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate initial compliance with the D/F emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(3). The owner or operator of a kiln with an in-line raw mill must demonstrate initial compliance by conducting separate performance tests while the raw mill is operating and the raw mill is not operating. Determine the D/F TEQ concentration for each run and calculate the arithmetic average of the TEQ concentrations measured for the three runs to determine continuous compliance.

entrations measured for the three runs to determine continuous compliance.


(ii) If you are subject to a D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the temperature operating limits specified in § 63.1346 by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(iv). Use the arithmetic average of the temperatures measured during the three runs to determine the applicable temperature limit.


(iii) If activated carbon injection is used and you are subject to a D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the activated carbon injection rate operating limits specified in § 63.1346 by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(3)(v).


(iv) If activated carbon injection is used, you must also develop a carrier gas parameter (either the carrier gas flow rate or the carrier gas pressure drop) during the initial performance test and updated during any subsequent performance test conducted under § 63.1349(b)(3) that meets the requirements of § 63.1349(b)(3)(vi). Compliance is demonstrated if the system is maintained within ±5 percent accuracy during the performance test determined in accordance with the procedures and criteria submitted for review in your monitoring plan required in § 63.1350(p).


(4)(i) *THC Compliance.* If you are subject to limitations on THC emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the THC emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(4)(i). You must use the average THC concentration obtained during the first 30 kiln operating days after the compliance date of this rule to determine initial compliance.


(ii) *Total Organic HAP Emissions Tests.* If you elect to demonstrate compliance with the total organic HAP emissions limit under § 63.1343(b) in lieu of the THC emissions limit, you must demonstrate compliance with the total organic HAP emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(7).


(iii) If you are demonstrating initial compliance, you must conduct the separate performance tests as specified in § 63.1349(b)(7) while the raw mill of the inline kiln/raw mill is operating and while the raw mill of the inline kiln/raw mill is not operating.


(iv) The time weighted average total organic HAP concentration measured during the separate initial performance test specified by § 63.1349(b)(7) must be used to determine initial compliance.


(v) The time weighted average THC concentration measured during the initial performance test specified by § 63.1349(b)(4) must be used to determine the site-specific THC limit. Using the fraction of time the inline kiln/raw mill is on and the fraction of time that the inline kiln/raw mill is off, calculate this limit as a time weighted average of the THC levels measured during raw mill on and raw mill off testing using one of the two approaches in § 63.1349(b)(7)(vii) or (viii) depending on the level of organic HAP measured during the compliance test.


(5) *Mercury Compliance.* If you are subject to limitations on mercury emissions in § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the mercury standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(5). You must demonstrate compliance by operating a mercury CEMS or a sorbent trap based CEMS. Compliance with the mercury emissions standard must be determined based on the first 30 operating days you operate a mercury CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system after the compliance date of this rule.


(i) In calculating a 30 operating day emissions value using an integrating sorbent trap CEMS, assign the average Hg emissions concentration determined for an integrating period (e.g., 7 day sorbent trap monitoring system sample) to each relevant hour of the kiln operating days spanned by each integrated sample. Calculate the 30 kiln operating day emissions rate value using the assigned hourly Hg emissions concentrations and the respective flow and production rate values collected during the 30 kiln operating day performance test period. Depending on the duration of each integrated sampling period, you may not be able to calculate the 30 kiln operating day emissions value until several days after the end of the 30 kiln operating day performance test period.


(ii) For example, a sorbent trap monitoring system producing an integrated 7-day sample will provide Hg concentration data for each hour of the first 28 kiln operating days (i.e., four values spanning 7 days each) of a 30 operating day period. The Hg concentration values for the hours of the last 2 days of the 30 operating day period will not be available for calculating the emissions for the performance test period until at least five days after the end of the subject period.


(6) *HCl Compliance.* If you are subject to limitations on HCl emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate initial compliance with the HCl standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(6).


(i) For an affected source that is equipped with a wet scrubber, tray tower or dry scrubber, you may demonstrate initial compliance by conducting a performance test as specified in § 63.1349(b)(6)(i). You must determine the HCl concentration for each run and calculate the arithmetic average of the concentrations measured for the three runs to determine compliance. You must also establish appropriate site-specific operational parameter limits.


(ii) For an affected source that is not equipped with a wet scrubber, tray tower or dry scrubber, you must demonstrate initial compliance by operating a CEMS as specified in § 63.1349(b)(6)(ii). You must use the average of the hourly HCl values obtained during the first 30 kiln operating days that occur after the compliance date of this rule to determine initial compliance.


(7) *Commingled Exhaust Requirements.* If the coal mill exhaust is commingled with kiln exhaust in a single stack, you may demonstrate compliance with the kiln emission limits by either:


(i) Performing required emissions monitoring and testing on the commingled coal mill and kiln exhaust, or


(ii) Perform required emission monitoring and testing of the kiln exhaust prior to the reintroduction of the coal mill exhaust, and also testing the kiln exhaust diverted to the coal mill. All emissions must be added together for all emission points, and must not exceed the limit per each pollutant as listed in § 63.1343(b).


(b) *Continuous Monitoring Requirements.* You must demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the performance test methods and procedures in §§ 63.1350 and 63.8 for each affected source.


(1) *General Requirements.* (i) You must monitor and collect data according to § 63.1350 and the site-specific monitoring plan required by § 63.1350(p).


(ii) Except for periods of startup and shutdown, monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected source is operating.


(iii) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system startup, shutdown or malfunctions or repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.


(iv) *Clinker Production.* If you are subject to limitations on mercury emissions (lb/MM tons of clinker) under § 63.1343(b), you must determine the hourly production rate of clinker according to the requirements of § 63.1350(d).


(2) *PM Compliance.* If you are subject to limitations on PM emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must use the monitoring methods and procedures in § 63.1350(b) and (d).


(3) *Opacity Compliance.* If you are subject to the limitations on opacity under § 63.1345, you must demonstrate compliance using the monitoring methods and procedures in § 63.1350(f) based on the maximum 6-minute average opacity exhibited during the performance test period. You must initiate corrective actions within one hour of detecting visible emissions above the applicable limit.


(i) *COMS.* If you install a COMS in lieu of conducting the daily visible emissions testing, you must demonstrate compliance using a COMS such that it is installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1350(f)(4)(i).


(ii) *Bag Leak Detection System (BLDS).* If you install a BLDS on a raw mill or finish mill in lieu of conducting the daily visible emissions testing, you must demonstrate compliance using a BLDS that is installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1350(f)(4)(ii).


(4) *D/F Compliance.* If you are subject to a D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance using a continuous monitoring system (CMS) that is installed, operated and maintained to record the temperature of specified gas streams in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1350(g).


(5) *Activated Carbon Injection Compliance.* (i) If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance using a CMS that is installed, operated, and maintained to record the rate of activated carbon injection in accordance with the requirements § 63.1350(h)(1).


(ii) If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance using a CMS that is installed, operated and maintained to record the activated carbon injection system gas parameter in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1350(h)(2).


(6) *THC Compliance.* (i) If you are subject to limitations on THC emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance using the monitoring methods and procedures in § 63.1350(i) and (j).


(ii) THC must be measured either upstream of the coal mill or in the coal mill stack.


(7) *Mercury Compliance.* (i) If you are subject to limitations on mercury emissions in § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance using the monitoring methods and procedures in § 63.1350(k). If you use an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system to determine ongoing compliance, use the procedures described in § 63.1348(a)(5) to assign hourly mercury concentration values and to calculate rolling 30 operating day emissions rates. Since you assign the mercury concentration measured with the sorbent trap to each relevant hour respectively for each operating day of the integrated period, you may schedule the sorbent trap change periods to any time of the day (i.e., the sorbent trap replacement need not be scheduled at 12:00 midnight nor must the sorbent trap replacements occur only at integral 24-hour intervals).


(ii) Mercury must be measured either upstream of the coal mill or in the coal mill stack.


(8) *HCl Compliance.* If you are subject to limitations on HCl emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(6).


(i) For an affected source that is not equipped with a wet scrubber, tray tower or a dry sorbent injection system, you must demonstrate compliance using the monitoring methods and procedures in § 63.1350(l)(1).


(ii) For an affected source that is equipped with a wet scrubber, tray tower or a dry sorbent injection system, you may demonstrate compliance using the monitoring methods and procedures in § 63.1350(l)(2).


(iii) HCl may be measured either upstream of the coal mill or in the coal mill stack.


(iv) As an alternative to paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, you may use an SO_2_ CEMS to establish an SO_2_ operating level during your initial and repeat HCl performance tests and monitor the SO_2_ level using the procedures in § 63.1350(l)(3).


(9) *Startup and Shutdown Compliance.* All dry sorbent and activated carbon systems that control hazardous air pollutants must be turned on and operating at the time the gas stream at the inlet to the baghouse or ESP reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit (five minute average) during startup. Temperature of the gas stream is to be measured at the inlet of the baghouse or ESP every minute. Such injection systems can be turned off during shutdown. Particulate control and all remaining devices that control hazardous air pollutants should be operational during startup and shutdown.


(c) *Changes in operations.* (1) If you plan to undertake a change in operations that may adversely affect compliance with an applicable standard, operating limit, or parametric monitoring value under this subpart, the source must conduct a performance test as specified in § 63.1349(b).


(2) In preparation for and while conducting a performance test required in § 63.1349(b), you may operate under the planned operational change conditions for a period not to exceed 360 hours, provided that the conditions in (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iv) of this section are met. You must submit temperature and other monitoring data that are recorded during the pretest operations.


(i) You must provide the Administrator written notice at least 60 days prior to undertaking an operational change that may adversely affect compliance with an applicable standard under this subpart for any source, or as soon as practicable where 60 days advance notice is not feasible. Notice provided under this paragraph must include a description of the planned change, the emissions standards that may be affected by the change, and a schedule for completion of the performance test required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including when the planned operational change period would begin.


(ii) The performance test results must be documented in a test report according to § 63.1349(a).


(iii) A test plan must be made available to the Administrator prior to performance testing, if requested.


(iv) The performance test must be completed within 360 hours after the planned operational change period begins.


(d) *General duty to minimize emissions.* At all times you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
