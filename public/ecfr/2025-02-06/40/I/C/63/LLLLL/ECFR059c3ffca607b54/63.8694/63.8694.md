(2) Before September 9, 2020, the records in § 63.6(e)(3)(iii) through (v) related to startup, shutdown, and malfunction. On and after September 9, 2020, this paragraph (a)(2) no longer applies.


(3) Records of performance tests, performance evaluations, and opacity and visible emission observations as required in § 63.10(b)(2)(viii). 


(b) You must keep the records in § 63.6(h)(6) for visible emission observations. 


(c) You must keep the records required in Table 5 to this subpart to show continuous compliance with each operating limit that applies to you.

(e) Any records required to be maintained by this part that are submitted electronically via EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format.
