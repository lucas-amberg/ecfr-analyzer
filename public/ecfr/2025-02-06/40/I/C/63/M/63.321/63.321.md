*Heating coil* means the device used to heat the air stream circulated from the dry cleaning machine drum, after perchloroethylene has been condensed from the air stream and before the stream reenters the dry cleaning machine drum.


*Major source* means any dry cleaning facility that meets the conditions of ยง 63.320(g).


*Muck cooker* means a device for heating perchloroethylene-laden waste material to volatilize and recover perchloroethylene.

*PCE gas analyzer* means a flame ionization detector, photoionization detector, or infrared analyzer capable of detecting vapor concentrations of PCE of 25 parts per million by volume.


*Perceptible leaks* mean any perchloroethylene vapor or liquid leaks that are obvious from:


(1) The odor of perchloroethylene;


(2) Visual observation, such as pools or droplets of liquid; or


(3) The detection of gas flow by passing the fingers over the surface of equipment.


*Perchloroethylene consumption* means the total volume of perchloroethylene purchased based upon purchase receipts or other reliable measures.


*Reclaimer* means a machine used to remove perchloroethylene from articles by tumbling them in a heated air stream (see dryer).


*Reconstruction,* for purposes of this subpart, means replacement of a washer, dryer, or reclaimer; or replacement of any components of a dry cleaning system to such an extent that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable new source.


*Refrigerated condenser* means a vapor recovery system into which an air-perchloroethylene gas-vapor stream is routed and the perchloroethylene is condensed by cooling the gas-vapor stream.


*Refrigerated condenser coil* means the coil containing the chilled liquid used to cool and condense the perchloroethylene.


*Residence* means any dwelling or housing in which people reside excluding short-term housing that is occupied by the same person for a period of less than 180 days (such as a hotel room).


*Responsible official* means one of the following:


(1) For a corporation: A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation, or a duly authorized representative of such person if the representative is responsible for the overall operation of one or more dry cleaning facilities;


(2) For a partnership: A general partner;


(3) For a sole proprietorship: The owner; or


(4) For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency: Either a principal executive officer or ranking official.

The enclosure shall be equipped with a ventilation system that exhausts outside the building and is completely separate from the ventilation system for any other area of the building. The exhaust system shall be designed and operated to maintain negative pressure and a ventilation rate of at least one air change per five minutes. The vapor barrier enclosure shall be constructed of glass, plexiglass, polyvinyl chloride, PVC sheet 22 mil thick (0.022 in.), sheet metal, metal foil face composite board, or other materials that are impermeable to perchloroethylene vapor.
