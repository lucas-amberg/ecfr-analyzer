# ยง 63.325   Determination of equivalent emission control technology.

(a) Any person requesting that the use of certain equipment or procedures be considered equivalent to the requirements under ยง 63.322 shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator the following information to show that the alternative achieves equivalent emission reductions:


(1) Diagrams, as appropriate, illustrating the emission control technology, its operation and integration into or function with dry-to-dry machine(s) or transfer machine system(s) and their ancillary equipment during each portion of the normal dry cleaning cycle;


(2) Information quantifying vented perchloroethylene emissions from the dry-to-dry machine(s) or transfer machine system(s) during each portion of the dry cleaning cycle with and without the use of the candidate emission control technology;


(3) Information on solvent mileage achieved with and without the candidate emission control technology. Solvent mileage is the average weight of articles cleaned per volume of perchloroethylene used. Solvent mileage data must be of continuous duration for at least 1 year under the conditions of a typical dry cleaning operation. This information on solvent mileage must be accompanied by information on the design, configuration, operation, and maintenance of the specific dry cleaning system from which the solvent mileage information was obtained;


(4) Identification of maintenance requirements and parameters to monitor to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the candidate emission control technology;


(5) Explanation of why this information is considered accurate and representative of both the short-term and the long-term performance of the candidate emission control technology on the specific dry cleaning system examined;


(6) Explanation of why this information can or cannot be extrapolated to dry cleaning systems other than the specific system(s) examined; and


(7) Information on the cross-media impacts (to water and solid waste) of the candidate emission control technology and demonstration that the cross-media impacts are less than or equal to the cross-media impacts of a refrigerated condenser.


(b) For the purpose of determining equivalency to control equipment required under ยง 63.322, the Administrator will evaluate the petition to determine whether equivalent control of perchloroethylene emissions has been adequately demonstrated.


(c) Where the Administrator determines that certain equipment and procedures may be equivalent, the Administrator will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ proposing to consider this equipment or these procedures as equivalent. After notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator will publish the final determination of equivalency in the _Federal Register._
