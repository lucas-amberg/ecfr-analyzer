# § 63.866   Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) [Reserved]


(b) The owner or operator of an affected source or process unit must maintain records of any occurrence when corrective action is required under § 63.864(k)(1), and when a violation is noted under § 63.864(k)(2).


(c) In addition to the general records required by § 63.10(b)(2)(iii) and (vi) through (xiv), the owner or operator must maintain records of the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section:


(1) Records of black liquor solids firing rates in units of Mg/d or ton/d for all recovery furnaces and semichemical combustion units;


(2) Records of CaO production rates in units of Mg/d or ton/d for all lime kilns;


(3) Records of parameter monitoring data required under § 63.864, including any period when the operating parameter levels were inconsistent with the levels established during the performance test, with a brief explanation of the cause of the monitoring exceedance, the time the monitoring exceedance occurred, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and the corrective action taken;


(4) Records and documentation of supporting calculations for compliance determinations made under § 63.865(a) through (d);


(5) Records of parameter operating limits established for each affected source or process unit;


(6) Records certifying that an NDCE recovery furnace equipped with a dry ESP system is used to comply with the gaseous organic HAP standard in § 63.862(c)(1);


(7) For the bag leak detection system on the hog fuel dryer fabric filter at Cosmo Specialty Fibers' Cosmopolis, Washington facility (Emission Unit no. HD-14), records of each alarm, the time of the alarm, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm and the corrective action taken; and


(8) Records demonstrating compliance with the requirement in § 63.864(e)(1) to maintain proper operation of an ESP's AVC.


(d)(1) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, including any emission limit in § 63.862 or any opacity or CPMS operating limit in § 63.864, record the number of failures. For each failure record the date, start time, and duration of each failure.


(2) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, and the following information:


(i) For any failure to meet an emission limit in § 63.862, record an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over the emission limit and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.


(ii) For each failure to meet an operating limit in § 63.864, maintain sufficient information to estimate the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over the emission limit. This information must be sufficient to provide a reliable emissions estimate if requested by the Administrator.


(3) Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.860(d) and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.
