The provisions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to design evaluations that are used to demonstrate compliance with the standards for process vents and storage vessels. The provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to performance tests that are specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. The provisions in paragraph (a)(3) of this section describe initial compliance procedures for flares. The provisions in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are used to demonstrate initial compliance with the alternative standards specified in § 63.1362(b)(6) and (c)(4). The provisions in paragraph (a)(6) of this section are used to comply with the outlet concentration requirements specified in § 63.1362(b)(2)(iv)(A), (b)(3)(ii), (b)(4)(ii)(A), (b)(5)(ii), and (b)(5)(iii).


(1) *Design evaluation.* To demonstrate that a control device meets the required control efficiency, a design evaluation must address the composition and HAP concentration of the vent stream entering the control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section, depending on the type of control device that is used. If the vent stream is not the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency demonstration also must consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.


(i) For an enclosed combustion device used to comply with the provisions of § 63.1362(b)(2)(iv), (b)(4)(ii), (c)(2)(iv)(B), or (c)(3) with a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 °C, the design evaluation must document that these conditions exist.


(ii) For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the design evaluation must document control efficiency and address the following characteristics, depending on the type of control device:


(A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, must consider the vent stream flow rate, and must establish the design minimum and average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone residence time.


(B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream flow rate and must establish the design minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and outlet.

For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop must be included.


(v) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon canister, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream mass or volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and must establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of the carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source operating schedule.


(vi) For a scrubber, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid.

(2) *Calculation of TOC or total organic HAP concentration.* The TOC concentration or total organic HAP concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components. If compliance is being determined based on TOC, the owner or operator shall compute TOC for each run using Equation 6 of this subpart. If compliance is being determined based on total organic HAP, the owner or operator shall compute total organic HAP using Equation 6 of this subpart, except that only organic HAP compounds shall be summed; when determining compliance with the wastewater provisions of § 63.1362(d), the organic HAP compounds shall consist of the organic HAP compounds in Table 9 of subpart G of this part. 


(3) *Initial compliance using flares.* When a flare is used to comply with the standards, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions in § 63.11(b) of subpart A of this part.


(i) The initial compliance determination shall consist of a visible emissions determination using Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as described in § 63.11(b)(4) of subpart A of this part, and a determination of net heating value of gas being combusted and exit velocity to comply with the requirements of § 63.11(b)(6) through (8) of subpart A of this part.

(10) *Testing conditions for continuous processes.* Testing of process vents on equipment operating as part of a continuous process shall consist of three one-hour runs. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured every 15 minutes during each 1-hour run. Organic HAP concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of each one-hour test run, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. For continuous gas streams, the emission rate used to determine compliance shall be the average emission rate of the three test runs.


(11) *Testing conditions for batch processes.* Testing of emissions on equipment where the flow of gaseous emissions is intermittent (batch operations) shall be conducted at absolute peak-case conditions or hypothetical peak-case conditions, as specified in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section, respectively. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured at 15-minute intervals. Organic HAP, TOC, or HCl and chlorine concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of the test, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. In all cases, a site-specific test plan shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval prior to testing in accordance with § 63.7(c). The test plan shall include the emissions profile described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section. The term “HAP mass loading” as used in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section refers to the class of HAP, either organic or HCl and chlorine, that the control device is intended to control. 


(i) *Absolute peak-case.* If the most challenging conditions for the control device occur under maximum HAP load, the absolute peak-case conditions shall be characterized by the criteria presented in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, absolute peak-case conditions are defined by the conditions in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(C) of this section.


(A) The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP mass load that may be vented to the control device over any 8-hour period. An emission profile as described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 8-hour period that includes the maximum projected HAP load.


(B) A 1-hour period of time in which the inlet to the control device will contain the highest hourly HAP mass loading rate that may be vented to the control device. An emission profile as described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 1-hour period of maximum HAP loading.


(C) The period of time when a condition other than the maximum HAP load is most challenging for the control device. These conditions include, but are not limited to the following:


(*1*) Periods when the streams contain the highest combined VOC and HAP hourly load, as described by the emission profiles in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section; or


(*2*) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach the limits of solubility for scrubbing media; or


(*3*) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach the limits of adsorptivity for carbon adsorption systems.


(ii) *Hypothetical peak-case.* Hypothetical peak-case conditions are simulated test conditions that, at a minimum, contain the highest total average hourly HAP load of emissions that would be predicted to be vented to the control device from the emissions profile described in either paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section.


(iii) *Emissions profile.* The owner or operator may choose to perform tests only during those periods of the peak-case episode(s) that the owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required emission reduction. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(D) of this section, the owner or operator shall develop an emission profile for the vent to the control device that describes the characteristics of the vent stream at the inlet to the control device under either absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions. The emissions profile shall be developed based on the applicable procedures described in paragraphs (b)(11)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section, as required by paragraphs (b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section. 


(A) *Emissions profile by process.* The emissions profile must consider all emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack for a period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting to the stack and shall consider production scheduling. The profile shall describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device during the period of absolute peak-case conditions specified in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(A), (B), or (C) as appropriate. Emissions per episode shall be calculated using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. When complying with paragraph (b)(11)(i)(B) of this section, emissions per episode shall be divided by the duration of the episode if the duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour.


(B) *Emission profile by equipment.* The emission profile must consist of emissions that meet or exceed the highest hourly HAP load that would be expected under actual processing conditions. The profile shall describe equipment configurations used to generate the emission events, volatility of materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale used to identify and characterize the emission events. The emissions may be based on using a compound more volatile than compounds actually used in the process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all equipment in the process(es) or only selected equipment.


(C) *Emission profile by capture and control device limitation.* The emission profile shall consider the capture and control system limitations and the highest hourly emissions that can be routed to the control device, based on maximum flow rate and concentrations possible because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment (e.g., fans, LEL alarms and safety bypasses).


(D) *Exemptions.* The owner or operator is not required to develop an emission profile under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(D)(*1*) or (*2*) of this section. 


(*1*) If all process vents for a process are controlled using a control device or series of control devices that reduce HAP emissions by 98 percent or more, no other emission streams are vented to the control device when it is used to control emissions from the subject process, and the performance test is conducted over the entire batch cycle. 


(*2*) If a control device is used to comply with the outlet concentration limit for process vent emission streams from a single process (but not necessarily all of the process vents from that process), no other emission streams are vented to the control device while it is used to control emissions from the subject process, and the performance test is conducted over the entire batch cycle. 


(iv) *Test duration.* Three runs, at a minimum of 1 hour each, are required for performance testing. When complying with a percent reduction standard, each test run may be a maximum of either 24 hours or the duration of the longest batch controlled by the control device, whichever is shorter, and each run must include the same absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section. When complying with an outlet concentration limit, each run must include the same absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section, and the duration of each run may not exceed the duration of the applicable peak-case condition.

The owner or operator shall demonstrate compliance by fulfilling the requirements in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. If an owner or operator elects to develop an emissions profile by process as described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section, uncontrolled emissions shall be determined using the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(vi) Initial compliance with the alternative standard in § 63.1362(b)(6) is demonstrated by fulfilling the requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(*1*) If the components are miscible in one another, use Raoult's law to calculate the partial pressures;


(*2*) If the solution is a dilute aqueous mixture, use Henry's law constants to calculate partial pressures;


(*3*) If Raoult's law or Henry's law are not appropriate or available, use any of the methods specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) (*3*)(*i*) through (*iii*) of this section.

(D) *Heating.* Emissions caused by heating the contents of a vessel to a temperature less than the boiling point shall be calculated using the procedures in either paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D)(*1*), (*2*), or (*4*) of this section, as appropriate. If the contents of a vessel are heated to the boiling point, emissions while boiling are assumed to be zero if the owner or operator is complying with the provisions in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C)(*3*) of this section.


(*1*) If the final temperature to which the vessel contents are heated is lower than 50 K below the boiling point of the HAP in the vessel, then emissions shall be calculated using Equations 11 through 14 of this subpart.

(*3*) While boiling, the vessel must be operated with a properly operated process condenser. An initial demonstration that a process condenser is properly operated is required for vessels that operate process condensers without secondary condensers that are air pollution control devices. The owner or operator must either measure the condenser exhaust gas temperature and show it is less than the boiling point of the substance(s) in the vessel, or perform a material balance around the vessel and condenser to show that at least 99 percent of the material vaporized while boiling is condensed. Uncontrolled emissions are assumed to be zero under these conditions.

For process vents without variable emission stream characteristics, an engineering assessment based on the results of a previous test may be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report instead of the Precompliance plan. Results from a previous test of process vents with variable emission stream characteristics will be acceptable in place of values estimated using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section if the test data show a greater than 20 percent discrepancy between the test value and the estimated value, and the results of the engineering assessment shall be included in the Notification of Compliance Status report. For other process vents with variable emission stream characteristics, engineering assessments based on the results of a previous test must be submitted in the Precompliance plan. For engineering assessments based on new tests, the owner or operator must comply with the test notification requirements in § 63.1368(m), and the results of the engineering assessment may be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report rather than the Precompliance plan.
