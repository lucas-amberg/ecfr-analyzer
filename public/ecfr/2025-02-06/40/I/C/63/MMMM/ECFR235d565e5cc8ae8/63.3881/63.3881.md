# § 63.3881   Am I subject to this subpart?

(a) Miscellaneous metal parts and products include, but are not limited to, metal components of the following types of products as well as the products themselves: motor vehicle parts and accessories, bicycles and sporting goods, recreational vehicles, extruded aluminum structural components, railroad cars, heavy duty trucks, medical equipment, lawn and garden equipment, electronic equipment, magnet wire, steel drums, industrial machinery, metal pipes, and numerous other industrial, household, and consumer products. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the source category to which this subpart applies is the surface coating of any miscellaneous metal parts or products, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and it includes the subcategories listed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section. 


(1) Surface coating is the application of coating to a substrate using, for example, spray guns or dip tanks. When application of coating to a substrate occurs, then surface coating also includes associated activities, such as surface preparation, cleaning, mixing, and storage. However, these activities do not comprise surface coating if they are not directly related to the application of the coating. Coating application with handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers, touch-up markers, marking pens, or the application of paper film or plastic film which may be pre-coated with an adhesive by the manufacturer are not coating operations for the purposes of this subpart. 


(2) The general use coating subcategory includes all surface coating operations that are not high performance, magnet wire, rubber-to-metal, or extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operations. 


(3) The high performance coating subcategory includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of high performance architectural coating or high temperature coating in § 63.3981. 


(4) The magnet wire coating subcategory includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of magnet wire coatings in § 63.3981. 


(5) The rubber-to-metal coatings subcategory includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of rubber-to-metal coatings in § 63.3981. 


(6) The extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings subcategory includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings in § 63.3981. 


(b) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a new, reconstructed, or existing affected source, as defined in § 63.3882, that uses 946 liters (250 gallons (gal)) per year, or more, of coatings that contain hazardous air pollutants (HAP) in the surface coating of miscellaneous metal parts and products defined in paragraph (a) of this section; and that is a major source, is located at a major source, or is part of a major source of emissions of HAP. A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg (25 tons) or more per year. You do not need to include coatings that meet the definition of non-HAP coating contained in § 63.3981 in determining whether you use 946 liters (250 gal) per year, or more, of coatings in the surface coating of miscellaneous metal parts and products. 


(c) This subpart does not apply to surface coating or a coating operation that meets any of the criteria of paragraphs (c)(1) through (17) of this section. 


(1) A coating operation conducted at a facility where the facility uses only coatings, thinners and other additives, and cleaning materials that contain no organic HAP, as determined according to § 63.3941(a). 


(2) Surface coating operations that occur at research or laboratory facilities, or is part of janitorial, building, and facility maintenance operations, or that occur at hobby shops that are operated for noncommercial purposes. 


(3) Coatings used in volumes of less than 189 liters (50 gal) per year, provided that the total volume of coatings exempt under this paragraph does not exceed 946 liters (250 gal) per year at the facility. 


(4) The surface coating of metal parts and products performed on-site at installations owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the United States (including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of any such State) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the surface coating of military munitions manufactured by or for the Armed Forces of the United States (including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of any such State). 


(5) Surface coating where plastic is extruded onto metal wire or cable or metal parts or products to form a coating. 


(6) Surface coating of metal components of wood furniture that meet the applicability criteria for wood furniture manufacturing (subpart JJ of this part). 


(7) Surface coating of metal components of large appliances that meet the applicability criteria for large appliance surface coating (subpart NNNN of this part). 


(8) Surface coating of metal components of metal furniture that meet the applicability criteria for metal furniture surface coating (subpart RRRR of this part). 


(9) Surface coating of metal components of wood building products that meet the applicability criteria for wood building products surface coating (subpart QQQQ of this part). 


(10) Surface coating of metal components of aerospace vehicles that meet the applicability criteria for aerospace manufacturing and rework (40 CFR part 63, subpart GG). 


(11) Surface coating of metal parts intended for use in an aerospace vehicle or component using specialty coatings as defined in appendix A to subpart GG of this part. 


(12) Surface coating of metal components of ships that meet the applicability criteria for shipbuilding and ship repair (subpart II of this part). 


(13) Surface coating of metal using a web coating process that meets the applicability criteria for paper and other web coating (subpart JJJJ of this part). 


(14) Surface coating of metal using a coil coating process that meets the applicability criteria for metal coil coating (subpart SSSS of this part). 


(15) Surface coating of boats or metal parts of boats (including, but not limited to, the use of assembly adhesives) where the facility meets the applicability criteria for boat manufacturing facilities (subpart VVVV of this part), except where the surface coating of the boat is a metal coating operation performed on personal watercraft or parts of personal watercraft. This subpart does apply to metal coating operations performed on personal watercraft and parts of personal watercraft. 


(16) Surface coating of assembled on-road vehicles that meet the applicability criteria for the assembled on-road vehicle subcategory in plastic parts and products surface coating (40 CFR part 63, subpart PPPP). 


(17) Surface coating of metal components of automobiles and light-duty trucks that meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3082(b) for the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) at a facility that meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3081(b).


(d) If your facility meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3081(b) of the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII), and you perform surface coating of metal parts or products that meets both the applicability criteria in § 63.3082(c) and the applicability criteria of the Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products (40 CFR part 63, subpart MMMM), then for the surface coating of any or all of your metal parts or products that meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3082(c), you may choose to comply with the requirements of subpart IIII of this part in lieu of complying with the Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products NESHAP. Surface coating operations on metal parts or products (e.g., parts for motorcycles or lawnmowers) not intended for use in automobiles, light-duty trucks, or other motor vehicles as defined in § 63.3176 cannot be made part of your affected source under subpart IIII of this part. 


(e) If you own or operate an affected source that meets the applicability criteria of this subpart and at the same facility you also perform surface coating that meets the applicability criteria of any other final surface coating NESHAP in this part you may choose to comply as specified in paragraph (e)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. 


(1) You may have each surface coating operation that meets the applicability criteria of a separate NESHAP comply with that NESHAP separately. 


(2) You may comply with the emission limitation representing the predominant surface coating activity at your facility, as determined according to paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. However, you may not establish high performance, rubber-to-metal, or extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operations as the predominant activity. You must not consider any surface coating activity that is subject to the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) in determining the predominant surface coating activity at your facility. 


(i) If a surface coating operation accounts for 90 percent or more of the surface coating activity at your facility (that is, the predominant activity), then compliance with the emission limitations of the predominant activity for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with these and other applicable surface coating NESHAP. In determining predominant activity, you must include coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP and constitute more than 1 percent of total coating activities at your facility. Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of coating activities need not be included in the determination of predominant activity but must be included in the compliance calculation. 


(ii) You must use liters (gal) of solids used as a measure of relative surface coating activity over a representative period of operation. You may estimate the relative volume of coating solids used from parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content (*e.g.,* design specifications for the parts or products coated and the number of items produced). The determination of predominant activity must accurately reflect current and projected coating operations and must be verifiable through appropriate documentation. The use of parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content must be approved by the Administrator. You may use data for any reasonable time period of at least 1 year in determining the relative amount of coating activity, as long as they represent the way the source will continue to operate in the future and are approved by the Administrator. You must determine the predominant activity at your facility and submit the results of that determination with the initial notification required by § 63.3910(b). You must also determine predominant activity annually and include the determination in the next semi-annual compliance report required by § 63.3920(a). 


(3) You may comply with a facility-specific emission limit calculated from the relative amount of coating activity that is subject to each emission limit. If you elect to comply using the facility-specific emission limit alternative, then compliance with the facility-specific emission limit and the emission limitations in this subpart for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with this and other applicable surface coating NESHAP. The procedures for calculating the facility-specific emission limit are specified in § 63.3890. In calculating a facility-specific emission limit, you must include coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP and constitute more than 1 percent of total coating activities at your facility. You must not consider any surface coating activity that is subject to the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) in determining a facility-specific emission limit for your facility. Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of total coating activities need not be included in the calculation of the facility-specific emission limit but must be included in the compliance calculations.
