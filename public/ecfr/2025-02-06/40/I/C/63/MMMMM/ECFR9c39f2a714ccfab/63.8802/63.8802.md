# ยง 63.8802   What methods must I use to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitation for loop slitter adhesive use?

(a) *Determine the HAP content for each material used.* To determine the HAP content for each material used in your foam fabrication operations, you must use one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. If you use the option in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, you are subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.


(1) *Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).* You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when determining HAP content by Method 311.




(i) Include in the HAP total each HAP in Table 8 of this subpart that is measured at 0.1 percent by weight or more and any other HAP that is measured at 1.0 percent by weight or more. Express the weight fraction of each HAP you measure as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).




(ii) Calculate the total HAP content in the test material by adding up the individual HAP contents and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).


(2) *Alternative method.* You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in ยง 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.


(3) *Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.* You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section to determine the mass fraction of HAP according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. This information may include, but is not limited to, a material safety data sheet (MSDS), a certified product data sheet (CPDS), or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet.










(i) Include in the HAP total each HAP in Table 8 of this subpart that is present at 0.1 percent by weight or more and any other HAP that is present at 1.0 percent by weight or more.




(ii) If the HAP content is provided by the material supplier or manufacturer as a range, then you must use the upper limit of the range for determining compliance.


(4) *Verification of supplier or manufacturer information.* Although you are not required to perform testing to verify the information obtained according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Administrator may require a separate measurement of the total HAP content using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. If this measurement exceeds the total HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you must use the measured HAP content to determine compliance.


(b) [Reserved]
