# § 63.8794   What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?

(a) For each loop slitter adhesive use affected source, you must be in compliance with the requirements in this subpart at all times.








(b) For each flame lamination affected source, you must be in compliance with the requirements in this subpart at all times.


(c) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.


(d) For flame lamination affected sources in § 63.8786 using a control device to comply with the emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the process and emissions control equipment during the period between the compliance date specified for your flame lamination affected source in § 63.8786 and the date upon which continuous compliance monitoring systems required by § 63.8810(c) have been installed and verified and any applicable operating limits have been set.




(e) [Reserved]


(f) For each monitoring system required by § 63.8810(c) for flame lamination sources, you must develop and submit for approval a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.




(1) Installation of the continuous monitoring system (CMS) sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (*e.g.,* on or downstream of the last control device);


(2) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction system; and


(3) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (*e.g.,* calibrations).


(g) In your site-specific monitoring plan, you must also address the ongoing procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of §§ 63.8(c)(1), (3), (4)(ii), (7), and (8), and 63.8804;


(2) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(d); and


(3) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
