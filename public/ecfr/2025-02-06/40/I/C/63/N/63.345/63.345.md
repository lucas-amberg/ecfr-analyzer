# ยง 63.345   Provisions for new and reconstructed sources.

(a) This section identifies the preconstruction review requirements for new and reconstructed affected sources that are subject to, or become subject to, this subpart.


(b) *New or reconstructed affected sources.* The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source is subject to ยง 63.5(a), (b)(1), (b)(5), (b)(6), and (f)(1), as well as the provisions of this paragraph.


(1) After January 25, 1995, whether or not an approved permit program is effective in the State in which an affected source is (or would be) located, no person may construct a new affected source or reconstruct an affected source subject to this subpart, or reconstruct a source such that it becomes an affected source subject to this subpart, without submitting a notification of construction or reconstruction to the Administrator. The notification shall contain the information identified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section, as appropriate.


(2) The notification of construction or reconstruction required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall include:


(i) The owner or operator's name, title, and address;


(ii) The address (i.e., physical location) or proposed address of the affected source if different from the owner's or operator's;


(iii) A notification of intention to construct a new affected source or make any physical or operational changes to an affected source that may meet or has been determined to meet the criteria for a reconstruction as defined in ยง 63.2;


(iv) An identification of subpart N of this part as the basis for the notification;


(v) The expected commencement and completion dates of the construction or reconstruction;


(vi) The anticipated date of (initial) startup of the affected source;


(vii) The type of process operation to be performed (hard or decorative chromium electroplating, or chromium anodizing);


(viii) A description of the air pollution control technique to be used to control emissions from the affected source, such as preliminary design drawings and design capacity if an add-on air pollution control device is used; and


(ix) An estimate of emissions from the source based on engineering calculations and vendor information on control device efficiency, expressed in units consistent with the emission limits of this subpart. Calculations of emission estimates should be in sufficient detail to permit assessment of the validity of the calculations.


(3) If a reconstruction is to occur, the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall include the following in addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section:


(i) A brief description of the affected source and the components to be replaced;


(ii) A brief description of the present and proposed emission control technique, including the information required by paragraphs (b)(2) (viii) and (ix) of this section;


(iii) An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of constructing a comparable entirely new source;


(iv) The estimated life of the affected source after the replacements; and


(v) A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the source may have in complying with relevant standards or other requirements after the proposed replacements. The discussion shall be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the technical or economic limitations affect the source's ability to comply with the relevant standard and how they do so.


(vi) If in the notification of reconstruction, the owner or operator designates the affected source as a reconstructed source and declares that there are no economic or technical limitations to prevent the source from complying with all relevant standards or requirements, the owner or operator need not submit the information required in paragraphs (b)(3) (iii) through (v) of this section.


(4) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source that submits a notification in accordance with paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section is not subject to approval by the Administrator. Construction or reconstruction is subject only to notification and can begin upon submission of a complete notification.


(5) *Submittal timeframes.* After January 25, 1995, whether or not an approved permit program is effective in the State in which an affected source is (or would be) located, an owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source shall submit the notification of construction or reconstruction required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section according to the following schedule:


(i) If construction or reconstruction commences after January 25, 1995, the notification shall be submitted as soon as practicable before the construction or reconstruction is planned to commence.


(ii) If the construction or reconstruction had commenced and initial startup had not occurred before January 25, 1995, the notification shall be submitted as soon as practicable before startup but no later than 60 days after January 25, 1995.
