(f) *Reports of performance test results.* (1) If the State in which the source is located has not been delegated the authority to implement the rule, the owner or operator of an affected source shall report to the Administrator the results of any performance test conducted as required by § 63.7 or § 63.343(b). If the State has been delegated the authority, the owner or operator of an affected source should report performance test results to the appropriate authority.


(2) Reports of performance test results shall be submitted no later than 90 days following the completion of the performance test, and shall be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required by paragraph (e) of this section.


(3)(i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (defined in § 63.2) as required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, required by this subpart to the EPA's WebFIRE database by using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) that is accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (*www.epa.gov/cdx*). Performance test data must be submitted in the file format generated through use of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see *http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html*). Only data collected using test methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement for submitting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph. At the discretion of the delegated authority, you must also submit these reports, including the confidential business information, to the delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority. For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator shall submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.


(g) *Ongoing compliance status reports for major sources.* (1) The owner or operator of an affected source that is located at a major source site shall submit a summary report to the Administrator to document the ongoing compliance status of the affected source. The report shall contain the information identified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, and shall be submitted semiannually except when:


(i) The Administrator determines on a case-by-case basis that more frequent reporting is necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source; or


(ii) The monitoring data collected by the owner or operator of the affected source in accordance with § 63.343(c) show that the emission limit has been exceeded, in which case quarterly reports shall be submitted. Once an owner or operator of an affected source reports an exceedance, ongoing compliance status reports shall be submitted quarterly until a request to reduce reporting frequency under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is approved.


(2) *Request to reduce frequency of ongoing compliance status reports.* (i) An owner or operator who is required to submit ongoing compliance status reports on a quarterly (or more frequent basis) may reduce the frequency of reporting to semiannual if all of the following conditions are met:


(A) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting periods), the ongoing compliance status reports demonstrate that the affected source is in compliance with the relevant emission limit;


(B) The owner or operator continues to comply with all applicable recordkeeping and monitoring requirements of subpart A of this part and this subpart; and


(C) The Administrator does not object to a reduced reporting frequency for the affected source, as provided in paragraphs (g)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section.


(ii) The frequency of submitting ongoing compliance status reports may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change, and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced reporting frequency, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, or the recordkeeping period since the source's compliance date, whichever is shorter. Records subject to review may include performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with emission limitations and work practice standards. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce reporting frequency, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.


(iii) As soon as the monitoring data required by § 63.343(c) show that the source is not in compliance with the relevant emission limit, the frequency of reporting shall revert to quarterly, and the owner shall state this exceedance in the ongoing compliance status report for the next reporting period. After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant emission limit for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the reporting frequency as allowed by paragraph (g)(2) of this section.


(3) *Contents of ongoing compliance status reports.* The owner or operator of an affected source for which compliance monitoring is required in accordance with § 63.343(c) shall prepare a summary report to document the ongoing compliance status of the source. The report must contain the following information:


(i) The company name and address of the affected source;


(ii) An identification of the operating parameter that is monitored for compliance determination, as required by § 63.343(c);


(iii) The relevant emission limitation for the affected source, and the operating parameter value, or range of values, that correspond to compliance with this emission limitation as specified in the notification of compliance status required by paragraph (e) of this section;


(iv) The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;


(v) A description of the type of process performed in the affected source;


(vi) The total operating time of the affected source during the reporting period;


(vii) If the affected source is a hard chromium electroplating tank and the owner or operator is limiting the maximum cumulative rectifier capacity in accordance with § 63.342(c)(2), the actual cumulative rectifier capacity expended during the reporting period, on a month-by-month basis;


(viii) A summary of operating parameter values, including the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period as indicated by those values, the total duration of excess emissions expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period into those that are due to process upsets, control equipment malfunctions, other known causes, and unknown causes;


(ix) A certification by a responsible official, as defined in § 63.2, that the work practice standards in § 63.342(f) were followed in accordance with the operation and maintenance plan for the source;


(x) If the operation and maintenance plan required by § 63.342(f)(3) was not followed, an explanation of the reasons for not following the provisions, an assessment of whether any excess emission and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred, and a copy of the report(s) required by § 63.342(f)(3)(iv) documenting that the operation and maintenance plan was not followed;


(xi) A description of any changes in monitoring, processes, or controls since the last reporting period;


(xii) The number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction which occurred during the reporting period and which caused or may have caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. The report must also include a description of actions taken by an owner or operator during a malfunction of an affected source to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.342(a)(1), including actions taken to correct a malfunction.


(xiii) The name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report; and


(xiv) The date of the report.


(4) When more than one monitoring device is used to comply with the continuous compliance monitoring required by § 63.343(c), the owner or operator shall report the results as required for each monitoring device. However, when one monitoring device is used as a backup for the primary monitoring device, the owner or operator shall only report the results from the monitoring device used to meet the monitoring requirements of this subpart. If both devices are used to meet these requirements, then the owner or operator shall report the results from each monitoring device for the relevant compliance period.


(h) *Ongoing compliance status reports for area sources.* The requirements of this paragraph do not alleviate affected area sources from complying with the requirements of State or Federal operating permit programs under 40 CFR part 71.


(1) The owner or operator of an affected source that is located at an area source site shall prepare a summary report to document the ongoing compliance status of the affected source. The report shall contain the information identified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, shall be completed annually and retained on site, and made available to the Administrator upon request. The report shall be completed annually except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.


(2) *Reports of exceedances.* (i) If either of the following conditions is met, semiannual reports shall be prepared and submitted to the Administrator:


(A) The total duration of excess emissions (as indicated by the monitoring data collected by the owner or operator of the affected source in accordance with § 63.343(c)) is 1 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period; or


(B) The total duration of malfunctions of the add-on air pollution control device and monitoring equipment is 5 percent or greater of the total operating time.


(ii) Once an owner or operator of an affected source reports an exceedance as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, ongoing compliance status reports shall be submitted semiannually until a request to reduce reporting frequency under paragraph (h)(3) of this section is approved.


(iii) The Administrator may determine on a case-by-case basis that the summary report shall be completed more frequently and submitted, or that the annual report shall be submitted instead of being retained on site, if these measures are necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source.


(3) *Request to reduce frequency of ongoing compliance status reports.* (i) An owner or operator who is required to submit ongoing compliance status reports on a semiannual (or more frequent) basis, or is required to submit its annual report instead of retaining it on site, may reduce the frequency of reporting to annual and/or be allowed to maintain the annual report onsite if all of the following conditions are met:


(A) For 1 full year (e.g., 2 semiannual or 4 quarterly reporting periods), the ongoing compliance status reports demonstrate that the affected source is in compliance with the relevant emission limit;


(B) The owner or operator continues to comply with all applicable recordkeeping and monitoring requirements of subpart A of this part and this subpart; and


(C) The Administrator does not object to a reduced reporting frequency for the affected source, as provided in paragraphs (h)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section.


(ii) The frequency of submitting ongoing compliance status reports may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change, and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced reporting frequency, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, or the recordkeeping period since the source's compliance date, whichever is shorter. Records subject to review may include performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with emission limitations and work practice standards. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgement about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce reporting frequency, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.


(iii) As soon as the monitoring data required by § 63.343(c) show that the source is not in compliance with the relevant emission limit, the frequency of reporting shall revert to semiannual, and the owner shall state this exceedance in the ongoing compliance status report for the next reporting period. After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant emission limit for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the reporting frequency as allowed by paragraph (h)(3) of this section.


(i) *Reports associated with trivalent chromium baths.* The requirements of this paragraph do not alleviate affected sources from complying with the requirements of State or Federal operating permit programs under title V. Owners or operators complying with the provisions of § 63.342(e) are not subject to paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, but must instead submit the following reports:


(1) Within 180 days after January 25, 1995, submit an initial notification that includes:


(i) The same information as is required by paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (v) of this section; and


(ii) A statement that a trivalent chromium process that incorporates a wetting agent will be used to comply with § 63.342(e); and


(iii) The list of bath components that comprise the trivalent chromium bath, with the wetting agent clearly identified; and
