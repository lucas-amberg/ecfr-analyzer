# § 63.881   Definitions.

Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in § 63.2, or in this section as follows:


*Bag leak detection system* means systems that include, but are not limited to, devices using triboelectric, light scattering, and other effects to monitor relative or absolute particulate matter emissions.


*Gas-fired glass-melting furnace* means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature using natural gas and other fuels, refined, and conditioned to produce molten glass. The unit includes foundations, superstructure and retaining walls, raw material charger systems, heat exchangers, exhaust system, refractory brick work, fuel supply and electrical boosting equipment, integral control systems and instrumentation, and appendages for conditioning and distributing molten glass to forming processes. The forming apparatus, including flow channels, is not considered part of the gas-fired glass-melting furnace. Cold-top electric glass-melting furnaces as defined in subpart NNN of this part are not gas-fired glass-melting furnaces.


*Glass pull rate* means the mass of molten glass that is produced by a single glass-melting furnace or that is used in the manufacture of wool fiberglass at a single manufacturing line in a specified time period.


*Incinerator* means an enclosed air pollution control device that uses controlled flame combustion to convert combustible materials to noncombustible gases. For the purposes of this subpart, the term “incinerator” means “regenerative thermal oxidizer”.


*Manufacturing line* means the manufacturing equipment for the production of wool fiberglass that consists of a forming section where molten glass is fiberized and a fiberglass mat is formed and which may include a curing section where binder resin in the mat is thermally set and a cooling section where the mat is cooled.


*New source* means any affected source the construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after April 15, 2013.


*Wool fiberglass* means insulation materials composed of glass fibers made from glass produced or melted at the same facility where the manufacturing line is located.


*Wool fiberglass manufacturing facility* means any facility manufacturing wool fiberglass.
