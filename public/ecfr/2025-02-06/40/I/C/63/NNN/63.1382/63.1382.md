(iii) The owner or operator must operate a glass-melting furnace, which uses no add-on controls and which is not a cold top electric furnace, such that the monitored parameter(s) is not outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.


(5)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when the average glass pull rate of any 4-hour block period for glass melting furnaces equipped with continuous glass pull rate monitors, or daily glass pull rate for glass melting furnaces not so equipped, exceeds the average glass pull rate established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384, by greater than 20 percent and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.


(ii) The owner or operator must implement a QIP consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64, subpart D when the glass pull rate exceeds, by more than 20 percent, the average glass pull rate established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.


(iii) The owner or operator must operate each glass-melting furnace such that the glass pull rate does not exceed, by more than 20 percent, the average glass pull rate established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period. 


(6) The owner or operator must operate each incinerator used to comply with the emission limits for rotary spin or flame attenuation lines specified in Table 2 to this subpart such that any 3-hour block average temperature in the firebox does not fall below the average established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384.


(7)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when the average pressure drop, liquid flow rate, or chemical feed rate for any 3-hour block period is outside the limits established during the performance tests as specified in § 63.1384 for each wet scrubbing control device and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.
