# § 63.4100   What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?

(a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations in this subpart as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. 


(1) Any coating operation(s) for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, as specified in § 63.4091(a) and (b), must be in compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 at all times. 


(2) Any coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, as specified in § 63.4091(c), must be in compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 and work practice standards in § 63.4093 at all times. Each controlled coating operation must be in compliance with the operating limits for emission capture systems and add-on control devices required by § 63.4092 at all times, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h). 


(b) Before September 12, 2019, you must always operate and maintain your affected source, including all air pollution control and monitoring equipment you use for purposes of complying with this subpart, according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(1)(i). On and after September 12, 2019, at all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source.


(c) If your affected source uses an emission capture system and add-on control device, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period between the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.4083 and the date when the initial emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests have been completed as specified in § 63.4160. This requirement does not apply to a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.4161(h) in lieu of conducting performance tests. 


(d) Before September 12, 2019, if your affected source uses an emission capture system and add-on control device, you must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(3). The plan must address the startup, shutdown, and corrective actions in the event of a malfunction of the emission capture system or the add-on control device. The plan must also address any coating operation equipment that may cause increased emissions or that would affect capture efficiency if the process equipment malfunctions, such as conveyors that move parts among enclosures. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is not required on and after September 12, 2019.
