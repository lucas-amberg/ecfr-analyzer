# § 63.4151   How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?

You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all of the coating operations in the affected source. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation(s) in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating operation(s) must meet the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 but not the operating limits or work practice standards in §§ 63.4092 and 63.4093, respectively, during the initial compliance period. You must meet all of the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 for the coating operation(s). When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option. 


(a) *Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material.* Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during the compliance period according to the requirements in § 63.4141(a). 


(b) *Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating.* Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating used during the compliance period according to the requirements in § 63.4141(b). 


(c) *Determine the density of each material.* Determine the density of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during the compliance period according to the requirements in § 63.4141(c). 


(d) *Determine the volume of each material used during the compliance period.* Determine the volume (liters) of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during the compliance period by measurement or usage records. 


(e) *Calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions during the compliance period.* The mass of organic HAP emissions is the combined mass of organic HAP contained in all coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used during the compliance period minus the organic HAP in certain waste materials. Calculate it using Equation 1 of this section. 


(1) Calculate the kg organic HAP in the coatings used during the compliance period, using Equation 1A of this section: 


(2) Calculate the kg of organic HAP in the thinners used during the compliance period, using Equation 1B of this section: 


(3) Calculate the kg organic HAP in the cleaning materials used during the compliance period, using Equation 1C of this section: 


(4) Determine the mass of organic HAP contained in waste materials sent to a TSDF. If you choose to account for the mass of organic HAP contained in waste materials sent or designated for shipment to a hazardous waste TSDF in the calculation of the mass of organic HAP emissions (Equation 1 of this section), then you must determine it according to paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (v) of this section. 


(i) You may include in the determination of organic HAP in waste materials only the waste materials that are generated by coating operations for which you use Equation 1 of this section and that will be treated or disposed of by a facility that is regulated as a TSDF under 40 CFR part 262, 264, 265, or 266. The TSDF may be either off-site or on-site. You may not include in the determination the organic HAP contained in wastewater. 


(ii) You must determine either the amount of waste materials sent to a TSDF during the compliance period or the amount collected and stored during the compliance period and designated for future transport to a TSDF. Do not include in your determination any waste materials sent to a TSDF during a compliance period if you have already included them in the amount collected and stored during that compliance period or a previous compliance period. 


(iii) Determine the total mass of organic HAP contained in the waste materials specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. 


(iv) You must document your methodology to determine the amount of waste materials and the total mass of organic HAP they contain, as required in § 63.4130(h). 


(v) To the extent that waste manifests include this information, they may be used as part of the documentation of the amount of waste materials and mass of organic HAP contained in them. 


(f) *Calculate the total volume of coating solids used during the compliance period.* Determine the total volume of coating solids used, liters, which is the combined volume of coating solids for all of the coatings used during the compliance period, using Equation 2 of this section. 


(g) Calculate the organic HAP emission rate, kg organic HAP per liter coating solids used, using Equation 3 of this section: 


(h) The organic HAP emission rate for the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.4130 and 63.4131. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.4110, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option and, if there were no deviations from the emission limitations, submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090.
