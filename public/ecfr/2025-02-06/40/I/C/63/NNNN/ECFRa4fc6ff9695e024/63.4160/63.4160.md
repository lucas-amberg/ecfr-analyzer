# § 63.4160   By what date must I conduct initial performance tests and other initial compliance demonstrations?

(a) *Existing affected sources.* For an existing affected source, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. 


(1) All emission capture systems, add-on control devices, and CPMS you use to demonstrate compliance must be installed and operating no later than the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.4083. Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h), you must conduct a performance test of each capture system and add-on control device according to the procedures in §§ 63.4164, 63.4165, and 63.4166, and establish the operating limits required by § 63.4092 no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.4083. For a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h), you must initiate the first material balance no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.4083.


(2) You must develop and begin implementing the work practice plan required by § 63.4093 no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.4083. 


(3) You must complete the compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.4161. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.4083 and ends on the last day of the first full month after the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next month. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to §§ 63.4164, 63.4165, and 63.4166; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to § 63.4161(h); calculations according to § 63.4161 and supporting documentation showing that, during the initial compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the emission limit in § 63.4090(a); the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by § 63.4168; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by § 63.4093. 


(b) *New and reconstructed affected sources.* For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) this section.


(1) All emission capture systems, add-on control devices, and CPMS you use to demonstrate compliance must be installed and operating no later than the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.4083. Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h), you must conduct a performance test of each capture system and add-on control device according to the procedures in §§ 63.4164, 63.4165, and 63.4166, and establish the operating limits required by § 63.4092 no later than 180 days after the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.4083. For a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h), you must initiate the first material balance no later than 180 days after the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.4083.


(2) You must develop and begin implementing the work practice plan required by § 63.4093 no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.4083. 


(3) You must complete the compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.4161. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.4083 and ends on the last day of the first full month after the compliance date, or the date you conduct the performance tests of the emission capture systems and add-on control devices, or initiate the first liquid-liquid material balance for a solvent recovery system; whichever is later. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to §§ 63.4164, 63.4165, and 63.4166; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to § 63.4161(h); calculations according to § 63.4161 and supporting documentation showing that, during the initial compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the emission limit in § 63.4090(b); the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by § 63.4168; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by § 63.4093. 


(4) You do not need to comply with the operating limits for the emission capture system and add-on control device required by § 63.4092 until after you have completed the performance tests specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Instead, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period between the compliance date and the performance test. You must begin complying with the operating limits for your affected source on the date you complete the performance tests specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This requirement does not apply to solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h).
