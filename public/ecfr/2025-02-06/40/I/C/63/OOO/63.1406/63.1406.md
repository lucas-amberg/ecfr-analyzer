# ยง 63.1406   Reactor batch process vent provisions.

(a) *Emission standards.* Owners or operators of reactor batch process vents located at new or existing affected sources shall comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate. As an alternative to complying with paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may comply with paragraph (b) of this section. 


(1) The owner or operator of a reactor batch process vent located at a new affected source shall control organic HAP emissions by complying with either paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. 


(i) Vent all emissions of organic HAP to a flare. 


(ii) Reduce organic HAP emissions for the batch cycle by 95 weight percent using a control device or control technology. 


(iii) Reduce organic HAP emissions from the collection of all reactor batch process vents within the affected source, as a whole, to 0.0045 kilogram of organic HAP per megagram of product or less for solvent-based resin production, or to 0.0004 kilogram of organic HAP per megagram of product or less for non-solvent-based resin production. 


(2) The owner or operator of a reactor batch process vent located at an existing affected source shall control organic HAP emissions by complying with either paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. 


(i) Vent all emissions of organic HAP to a flare. 


(ii) Reduce organic HAP emissions for the batch cycle by 83 weight percent using a control device or control technology. 


(iii) Reduce organic HAP emissions from the collection of all reactor batch process vents within the affected source, as a whole, to 0.0567 kilogram of organic HAP per megagram of product or less for solvent-based resin production, or to 0.0057 kilogram of organic HAP per megagram of product or less for non-solvent-based resin production. 


(b) *Alternative standard.* Vent all organic HAP emissions from a reactor batch process vent to a combustion control device achieving an outlet organic HAP concentration of 20 ppmv or less or to a non-combustion control device achieving an outlet organic HAP concentration of 50 ppmv or less. Any reactor batch process vents that are not vented to a control device meeting these conditions shall be controlled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(ii), or paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. 


(c) *Use of boiler or process heater.* If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii), or paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the reactor batch process vent shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device.
