# ยง 63.1407   Non-reactor batch process vent provisions.

(a) *Emission standards.* (1) Owners or operators of non-reactor batch process vents located at new or existing affected sources with 0.25 tons per year (0.23 megagrams per year) of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions or greater from the collection of non-reactor batch process vents within the affected source shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section, as appropriate. As an alternative to complying with paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section, an owner or operator may comply with paragraph (b) of this section. Owners or operators shall determine uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from the collection of non-reactor batch process vents within the affected source as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. If the owner or operator finds that uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from the collection of non-reactor batch process vents within the affected source are less than 0.25 tons per year (0.23 megagrams per year), non-reactor batch process vents are not subject to the control requirements of this section. Further, the owner or operator shall, when requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that organic HAP emissions for the collection of non-reactor batch process vents within the affected source are less than 0.25 tons per year (0.23 megagrams per year). 


(2) The owner or operator of a non-reactor batch process vent located at a new affected source shall: 


(i) Vent all emissions of organic HAP to a flare; or 


(ii) For the collection of non-reactor batch process vents within the affected source, reduce organic HAP emissions for the batch cycle by 76 weight percent using a control device or control technology. 


(3) The owner or operator of a non-reactor batch process vent located at an existing affected source shall: 


(i) Vent all emissions of organic HAP to a flare; or 


(ii) For the collection of non-reactor batch process vents within the affected source, reduce organic HAP emissions for the batch cycle by 62 weight percent using a control device or control technology. 


(b) *Alternative standard.* Comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. 


(1) *Control device outlet concentration.* Vent all organic HAP emissions from a non-reactor batch process vent to a combustion control device achieving an outlet organic HAP concentration of 20 ppmv or less or to a non-combustion control device achieving an outlet organic HAP concentration or 50 ppmv or less. Any reactor batch process vents that are not vented to a control device meeting these conditions shall be controlled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section. 


(2) *Mass emission limit.* Include the emissions from all non-reactor batch process vents in the compliance demonstration required for reactor batch process vents complying with the mass emission limits specified in ยง 63.1406(a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii), as appropriate. This compliance option may only be used when the owner or operator has elected to comply with the mass emission limit for reactor batch process vents. 


(c) *Use of boiler or process heater.* If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the reactor batch process vent shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device. 


(d) *Determining uncontrolled organic HAP emissions.* Owners or operators shall determine uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from the collection of non-reactor batch process vents within the affected source based on engineering assessment as described in ยง 63.1414(d)(6).
