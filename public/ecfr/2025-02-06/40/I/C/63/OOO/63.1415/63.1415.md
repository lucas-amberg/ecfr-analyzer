# § 63.1415   Monitoring requirements.

(a) *General requirements.* Each owner or operator of an emission point located at an affected source that uses a control device to comply with the requirements of this subpart and has one or more parameter monitoring level requirement specified under this subpart, shall install the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (b) of this section in order to demonstrate continued compliance with the provisions of this subpart. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately. 


(1) This monitoring equipment shall be in operation at all times when organic HAP emissions that are required to be controlled as part of complying with the emission limits specified in §§ 63.1404, 63.1405, 63.1406, 63.1407, and 63.1408 are vented to the control device. 


(2) For control devices controlling less than 1 ton per year of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, monitoring shall consist of a daily verification that the control device is operating properly. If the control device is used to control batch process vents alone or in combination with other emission points, the verification may be on a per batch cycle basis. This verification shall include, but not be limited to, a daily or per batch demonstration that the control device is working as designed. The procedure for this demonstration shall be submitted for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report, as required by § 63.1417(d)(10). 


(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable provisions of subpart A, F, or G of this part. 


(b) *Monitoring equipment.* The monitoring equipment specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section shall be installed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The parameters to be monitored are specified in Table 3 of this subpart. 


(1) Where a scrubber is used, the following monitoring equipment is required. 


(i) A pH monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder to monitor the pH of the scrubber effluent. 


(ii) A flow measurement device equipped with a continuous recorder shall be located at the scrubber influent for liquid flow. Gas stream flow shall be determined using one of the following procedures: 


(A) The owner or operator may determine gas stream flow using the design blower capacity with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop. 


(B) If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264 through 266 that required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/G) ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized to comply with this subpart if it is still representative. 


(C) The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream flow anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions other than malfunctions. The plan shall include a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas stream flow, and a description of the records that will be maintained to document the determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator shall maintain the plan as specified in § 63.1416(a). 


(2) Where an absorber is used, a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device are required, each equipped with a continuous recorder. 


(3) Where a condenser is used, a condenser exit temperature (product side) monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required. 


(4) Where a carbon adsorber is used, an integrating regeneration steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure monitoring device having an accuracy of ±10 percent of the flow rate, level, or pressure, or better, capable of recording the total regeneration steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure (gauge or absolute) for each regeneration cycle; and a carbon bed temperature monitoring device, capable of recording the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle are required. 


(5) Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required. 


(i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position before any substantial heat exchange occurs. 


(ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed. 


(6) Where a flare is used, a device (including but not limited to a thermocouple, ultra-violet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required. 


(7) Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts design heat input capacity is used, a temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder is required. Any boiler or process heater in which all vent streams are introduced with the primary fuel or are used as the primary fuel is exempt from this requirement. 


(8) As an alternate to paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder. Said organic monitoring device shall meet the requirements of Performance Specification 8 or 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and shall be installed, calibrated, and maintained according to § 63.6. 


(c) *Alternative monitoring parameters.* An owner or operator may request approval to monitor parameters other than those specified in Table 3 of this subpart. The request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in § 63.1417(j). Approval shall be requested if the owner or operator: 


(1) Uses a control device or control technology other than those included in paragraph (b) of this section; or 


(2) Uses one of the control devices included in paragraph (b) of this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those specified in Table 3 of this subpart. 


(d) *Monitoring of bypass lines.* Owners or operators using a vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from a control device or control technology used to comply with the provisions of this subpart shall comply with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. Equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph. 


(1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.1416(d)(3). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert emissions away from the control device or control technology and to the atmosphere; or 


(2) Secure the bypass line damper or valve in the non-diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the damper or valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and emissions are not diverted through the bypass line. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.1416(d)(3). 


(e) *Monitoring for the alternative standards.* For control devices that are used to comply with the provisions of § 63.1404(b), § 63.1405(c), § 63.1406(b), § 63.1407(b), or § 63.1408(b) the owner or operator shall conduct continuous monitoring of the outlet organic HAP concentration whenever emissions are vented to the control device. Continuous monitoring of outlet organic HAP concentration shall be accomplished using an FTIR instrument following Method PS-15 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. The owner or operator shall calculate a daily average outlet organic HAP concentration.
