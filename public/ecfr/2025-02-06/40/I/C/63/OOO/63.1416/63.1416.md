# § 63.1416   Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) *Data retention.* Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 


(1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, floppy disk, CD-ROM, optical disc, magnetic tape, or microfiche. 


(2) If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of § 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those reports. 


(b) *Malfunction records.* Records shall be kept as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures. For each failure record the date, time, and duration of each failure.


(2) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.


(3) Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1420(h)(4), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.


(c) *Monitoring records.* Owners or operators required to comply with § 63.1415 and, therefore, required to keep continuous records shall keep records as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section. 


(1) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data value or average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) average instead of all measured values. Owners or operators of batch process vents shall record each measured data value; if values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be recorded instead of all measured values. 


(2) Daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for each operating day as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, except as specified in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section. The option of conducting parameter monitoring for batch process vents on a batch cycle daily average basis or a block average basis is described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 


(i) The daily average value, batch cycle daily average, or block average shall be calculated as the average of all parameter values recorded during the operating day, or batch cycle, as appropriate, except as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. For batch process vents, only parameter values recorded during those batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that the owner or operator has selected to control in order to comply shall be used to calculate the average. The calculated average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the number of hours of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous for daily average values or batch cycle daily average values. The calculated average shall cover the entire period of the batch cycle for block average values. As specified in § 63.1413(a)(4)(i)(C)(*3*), the owner or operator shall provide the information needed to calculate batch cycle daily averages for operating days that include partial batch cycles. 


(ii) The operating day shall be the period the owner or operator specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status for purposes of determining daily average values or batch cycle daily average values of monitored parameters. The block shall be the entire period of the batch cycle, as specified by the owner or operator in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status for purposes of determining block average values of monitored parameters. 


(3) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day or block are above the minimum level or below the maximum level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and recording a daily average, or block average, for that operating day. For these operating days or blocks, the records required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall also be retained for 5 years. 


(4) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not be included in any average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process or control device or recovery device or control technology operation when monitors are not operating:


(i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; and


(ii) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.


(5) The owner or operator who has received approval to monitor different parameters, under § 63.1417(j) as allowed under § 63.1415(e), than those specified for storage vessels, continuous process vents, or batch process vents shall retain for a period of 5 years each record specified in their approved Alternative Monitoring Parameters request. 


(6) The owner or operator who has received approval to use alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions as specified in § 63.1417(k) shall retain for a period of 5 years each record specified in their approved Alternative Continuous Monitoring request.

The current description shall, at all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, superseded descriptions may be stored off-site. 


(2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a parameter with respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without any deviation as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value for any operating day when the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value is less than the maximum or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months if the parameter limit and the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance date were required and/or approved by the Administrator. 


(i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as specified in § 63.1417(f)(11). The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment. 


(ii) If, on any operating day or during any block after the owner or operator has ceased recording the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average values as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, there is a deviation as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value for each operating day and shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without a deviation as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section. 


(iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for the duration specified in paragraph (h) of this section. For any calendar week, if compliance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one value during a period of operation.


(iv) For purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, a deviation means that the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value.
