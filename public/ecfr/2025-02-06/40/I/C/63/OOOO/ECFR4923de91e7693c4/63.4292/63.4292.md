# § 63.4292   What operating limits must I meet?

(a) For any web coating/printing operation, slashing operation, or dyeing/finishing operation on which you use the compliant material option; web coating/printing operation or dyeing/finishing operation on which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option; or dyeing/finishing affected source on which you use the equivalent emission rate limit option, you are not required to meet any operating limits.


(b) For any controlled web coating/printing operation or dyeing/finishing operation on which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, or controlled web coating/printing operation on which you use the organic HAP overall control efficiency option or the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration option, except those web coating/printing operations for which you use a solvent recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.4341(e)(5) and those dyeing/finishing operations for which you use a solvent recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.4341(f)(5), you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart. These operating limits apply to the emission capture and control systems on the web coating/printing operation(s) and dyeing/finishing operations for which you use this option, and you must establish the operating limits during the performance test according to the procedures in § 63.4363. You must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.


(c) If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in Table 2 of this subpart, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).
