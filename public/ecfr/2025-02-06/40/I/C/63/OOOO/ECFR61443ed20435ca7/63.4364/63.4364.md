# § 63.4364   What are the requirements for CPMS installation, operation, and maintenance?

(a) *General.* If you are using a control device to comply with the emission standards in § 63.4290, you must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) and (e) of this section according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraph (b) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(5) through (7) of this section.


(1) Each CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four equally spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation to have a valid hour of data.


(2) You must have valid data from at least 90 percent of the hours during which the process operated.


(3) You must determine the hourly average of all recorded readings according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(i) To calculate a valid hourly value, you must have at least three of four equally spaced data values from that hour from a continuous monitoring system (CMS) that is not out-of-control.


(ii) Provided all of the readings recorded in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section clearly demonstrate continuous compliance with the standard that applies to you, then you are not required to determine the hourly average of all recorded readings.


(4) You must determine the rolling 3-hour average of all recorded readings for each operating period. To calculate the average for each 3-hour averaging period, you must have at least two of three of the hourly averages for that period using only average values that are based on valid data (*i.e.,* not from out-of-control periods).


(5) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check of the CPMS.


(6) At all times, you must maintain the monitoring system in accordance with § 63.4300(b) and in proper working order including, but not limited to, keeping readily available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.


(7) Before September 12, 2019, except for monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, or required quality assurance or control activities (including calibration checks or required zero and span adjustments), you must conduct all monitoring at all times that the unit is operating. On and after September 12, 2019, you must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times in accordance with § 63.4300(b). Data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities shall not be used for purposes of calculating the emissions concentrations and percent reductions specified in Table 1 to this subpart. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance of the control device and associated control system. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.


(8) Except for periods of required quality assurance or control activities, any averaging period during which the CPMS fails to operate and record data continuously as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or during which generated data cannot be included in calculating averages as specified in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, constitutes a deviation, and you must notify the Administrator in accordance with § 63.4311(a).


(b) *Capture system bypass line.* You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5) through (6) and (b)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.


(1) You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) *Flow control position indicator.* Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.


(ii) *Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures.* Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.


(iii) *Valve closure continuous monitoring.* Ensure that any bypass line valve is in the closed (non-diverting) position through monitoring of valve position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.


(iv) *Automatic shutdown system.* Use an automatic shutdown system in which the web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation is stopped when flow is diverted by the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere when the web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation is running. You must inspect the automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shutdown the web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation.


(2) If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open in the semiannual compliance reports required in § 63.4311.


(c) *Oxidizers.* If you are using an oxidizer to comply with the emission standards, you must comply with paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate temperature monitoring equipment according to the manufacturer's specifications. The calibration of the chart recorder, data logger, or temperature indicator must be verified every 3 months or the chart recorder, data logger, or temperature indicator must be replaced. A thermocouple is considered part of the temperature indicator for purposes of performing periodic calibration and verification checks.


(2) For an oxidizer other than a catalytic oxidizer, install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder. The device must have an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored in degrees Celsius, or ±1 °Celsius, whichever is greater. The thermocouple or temperature sensor must be installed in the combustion chamber at a location in the combustion zone.


(3) For a catalytic oxidizer, install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder. The device must be capable of monitoring temperature with an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored in degrees Celsius or ±1 degree Celsius, whichever is greater. The thermocouple or temperature sensor must be installed in the vent stream at the nearest feasible point to the inlet and outlet of the catalyst bed. Calculate the temperature rise across the catalyst.


(d) *Other types of control devices.* If you use a control device other than an oxidizer or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of an alternative monitoring method under § 63.8(f).


(e) *Capture system monitoring.* If you are complying with the emission standards in § 63.4290 through the use of a capture system and control device, you must develop a site-specific monitoring plan containing the information specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for these capture systems. You must monitor the capture system in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. You must make the monitoring plan available for inspection by the permitting authority upon request.


(1) The monitoring plan must:


(i) Identify the operating parameter to be monitored to ensure that the capture efficiency determined during the initial compliance test is maintained; and


(ii) Explain why this parameter is appropriate for demonstrating ongoing compliance; and


(iii) Identify the specific monitoring procedures.


(2) The monitoring plan must specify the operating parameter value or range of values that demonstrate compliance with the emission standards in § 63.4290. The specified operating parameter value or range of values must represent the conditions present when the capture system is being properly operated and maintained.


(3) You must conduct all capture system monitoring in accordance with the plan.


(4) Any deviation from the operating parameter value or range of values which are monitored according to the plan will be considered a deviation from the operating limit.


(5) You must review and update the capture system monitoring plan at least annually.
