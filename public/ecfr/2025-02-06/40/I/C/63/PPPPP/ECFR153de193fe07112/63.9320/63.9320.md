(c) The initial demonstration of compliance with the carbon monoxide (CO) or THC concentration limitation consists of either the first 4-hour rolling average CO or THC concentration recorded after completion of the CEMS performance evaluation if CEMS are installed or the average of the test run averages during the initial performance test. You must correct the CO or THC concentration at the outlet of the engine test cell/stand or the emission control device to a dry basis and to 15 percent O_2_ content according to Equation 1 of this section:


(d) The initial demonstration of compliance with the CO or THC percent reduction emission limitation consists of the first 4-hour rolling average percent reduction in CO or THC recorded after completion of the performance evaluation of the capture/control system and/or CEMS. You must complete the actions described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (2) of this section.


(1) Correct the CO or THC concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the emission control device to a dry basis and to 15 percent O_2_ content using Equation 1 of this section.


(2) Calculate the percent reduction in CO or THC using Equation 2 of this section:
