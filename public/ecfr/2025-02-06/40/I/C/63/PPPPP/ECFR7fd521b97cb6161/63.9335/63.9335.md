(a) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration drift checks and required zero and high-level adjustments of the monitoring system), you must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation at all times the engine test cell/stand is operating. 


(b) Do not use data recorded during monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities for meeting the requirements of this subpart, including data averages and calculations. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the performance of the emission control device or in assessing emissions from the new or reconstructed affected source.
