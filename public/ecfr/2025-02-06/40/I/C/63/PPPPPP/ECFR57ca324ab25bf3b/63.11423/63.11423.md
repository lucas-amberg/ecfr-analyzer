The determination of whether affected sources are similar must meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. If you decide to test representative affected sources, you must prepare and submit a testing plan as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.


(i) If you elect to test representative affected sources, the affected sources that are grouped together must be of the same process type (e.g., grid casting, paste mixing, three-process operations) and also have the same type of air pollution control device (e.g., fabric filters). You cannot group affected sources from different process types or with different air pollution control device types together for the purposes of this section.


(ii) The results of the performance test conducted for the affected source selected as representative of a group of similar affected sources will represent the results for each affected source within the group. In the performance test report, all affected sources in the group will need to be listed.

(C) A date of last test for each emission unit and a schedule indicating when you will conduct performance tests for each emission unit within the representative groups.


(iv) If you conduct subsequent performance tests on representative emission units, the unit with the oldest test must be tested first, and each subsequent performance test must be performed for a different unit until all units in the group have been tested. The order of testing for each subsequent test must proceed such that the unit in the group with the least recent performance test is the next unit to be tested.


(6) You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. You must make available to the Administrator in the test report, records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
