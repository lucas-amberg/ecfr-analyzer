*Existing IPCT* means any affected IPCT that is not a new IPCT.


*Industrial process cooling tower,* also written as “IPCT,” means any cooling tower that is used to remove heat that is produced as an input or output of a chemical or industrial process(es), as well as any cooling tower that cools industrial processes in combination with any heating, ventilation, or air conditioning system.


*Initial startup* means the initiation of recirculation water flow within the cooling tower.


*Major source* means any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit considering controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants.

*Owner or operator* means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises an IPCT.


*Potential to emit* means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the stationary source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally enforceable.


*Reconstruction* means the replacement of components of an affected or a previously unaffected IPCT to such an extent that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable new IPCT.


*Responsible official* means one of the following:
