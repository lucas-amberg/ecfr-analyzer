# § 63.1444   What emissions limitations, work practice standards, and design standards must I meet for my copper concentrate dryers, smelting vessels, slag cleaning vessels, copper converter departments, anode refining departments, process fugitive emissions from roofline vents, and bypass stacks?

(a) *Copper concentrate dryers.* For each copper concentrate dryer, you must comply with the emission limitation in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section that applies to you.


(1) For each existing copper concentrate dryer, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the dryer vent any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 50 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm) as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).


(2) For each new copper concentrate dryer, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the dryer vent any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).


(b) *Smelting vessels.* For each smelting vessel, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) For each smelting vessel, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(b). Process off-gas from a smelting vessel is generated when copper ore concentrates and fluxes are being smelted to form molten copper matte and slag layers.


(2) For each smelting vessel, you must control the process fugitive emissions released when tapping copper matte or slag from the smelting vessel according to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(i) At all times when copper matte or slag is tapped from the smelting vessel, you must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from the tapping port in use. The design and placement of this capture system must be such that the tapping port opening, launder, and receiving vessel (e.g., ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the confines or influence of the capture system's ventilation draft during those times when the copper matte or slag is flowing from the tapping port opening.


(ii) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the capture system used to comply with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).


(c) *Slag cleaning vessels.* For each slag cleaning vessel, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section that apply to you.


(1) For each slag cleaning vessel, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(b).


(2) As an alternative to complying with the emission limit for nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each existing slag cleaning vessel you may choose to comply with the emission limit for filterable particulate matter specified in this paragraph (c)(2). You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains filterable particulate matter in excess of 46 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).


(3) For each slag cleaning vessel, you must control process fugitive emissions released when tapping copper matte or slag from the slag cleaning vessel according to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(i) At all times when copper matte or slag is tapped from the slag cleaning vessel, you must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from the tapping port in use. The design and placement of this capture system must be such that the tapping port opening, launder, and receiving vessel (e.g., ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the confines or influence of the capture system's ventilation draft during those times when the copper matte or slag is flowing from the tapping port opening.


(ii) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the capture system used to comply with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).


(d) *Existing copper converter departments.* For each existing copper converter department, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section that apply to you.


(1) You must operate a capture system that collects the process off gas vented from each batch copper converter. At all times when one or more batch copper converters are blowing, you must operate the capture system according to the written operation and maintenance plan that has been prepared according to the requirements in § 63.1447(b).


(2) If your copper converter department uses Peirce-Smith converters, the capture system design must include use of a primary hood that covers the entire mouth of the converter vessel when the copper converter is positioned for blowing. Additional hoods (e.g., secondary hoods) or other capture devices must be included in the capture system design as needed to achieve the opacity limit in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The capture system design may use multiple intake and duct segments through which the ventilation rates are controlled independently of each other, and individual duct segments may be connected to separate control devices.


(3) If your copper converter department uses Hoboken converters, the capture system must collect all process off-gas vented during blowing through the side-flue intake on each converter vessel.


(4) You must operate the capture system such that any visible emissions exiting the roof monitors or roof exhaust fans on the building housing the copper converter department meet the opacity limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(i) The opacity of any visible emissions exiting the roof monitors or roof exhaust fans on the building housing the copper converter department must not exceed 4 percent as determined by a performance test conducted according to § 63.1450(c).


(ii) The opacity limit in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section applies only at those times when a performance test is conducted according to § 63.1450(c). The requirements for compliance with opacity and visible emission standards specified in § 63.6(h) do not apply to this opacity limit.


(5) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from any Peirce-Smith converter primary hood capture system or Hoboken converter side-flue intake capture system any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(b).

For each new copper converter department which will contain a copper converter other than a batch converter (such as a continuous converter), you must comply with the emission limitation and work practice standards in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from any combination of stacks or other vents any captured process off-gas that contains filterable particulate matter greater than a daily (24-hour) average of 0.031 pounds of particulate matter per ton of copper concentrate feed charged to the smelting vessel as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).


(2) You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from converting vessels and conveys the collected gas stream to a control device.

The design evacuation rate for the total system of all anode furnace secondary hoods shall be at least 150,000 cfm hourly average.


(q) *Bypass stack work practice standards.* When using the bypass stack for planned maintenance of control devices and processes, the work practice standard is applicable for the bypass stack for the duration of the planned maintenance. You must comply with work practice standards in paragraphs (q)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) In the case of planned control device or process maintenance, feed to the smelting vessel must cease; power to the electric furnace must be lowered, and a crust allowed to form on the surface of the slag; the operation of the converters must cease and the converters rolled out; and the operation of the anode vessels must cease.


(2) If the fan to the anode refining point source baghouse is functioning, then the residual process gases must be redirected to the control device. If the process gas from a device being maintenanced can be rerouted to a different control device instead of the bypass stack, it must be redirected to the control device. Control devices must be used until emissions are minimized.


(3) If there is a shutdown or emergency shutdown event, the control devices should continue to run until process emissions cease. If the control devices are shut down before the process emissions cease and the bypass stack is used to vent the process gas to the atmosphere, there will be a violation of the emission and work practice standards.
