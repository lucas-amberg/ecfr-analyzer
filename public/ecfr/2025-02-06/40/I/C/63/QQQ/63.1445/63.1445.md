# § 63.1445   What work practice standards must I meet for my fugitive dust sources?

(a) You must control particulate matter emissions from fugitive dust sources at your primary copper smelter by operating according to a written fugitive dust control plan that has been approved by the Administrator or approved authority under 40 CFR part 70 or 71. For the purpose of complying with this paragraph (a) you must submit a fugitive dust control plan which addresses the fugitive dust sources specified in paragraph (b) of this section and includes the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section on the schedule provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.


(b) Before November 12, 2024, your fugitive dust control plan must address each of the fugitive dust emission sources listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6), except paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii), of this section that are located at your primary copper smelter. On or after November 12, 2024, your fugitive dust control plan must address each of the fugitive dust emission sources listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section that are located at your primary copper smelter.


(1) On-site roadways used by trucks or other motor vehicles (e.g., front-end loaders) when transporting bulk quantities of fugitive dust materials. Paved roads and parking areas that are not used by these vehicles do not need to be included in the plan (e.g., employee and visitor parking lots).


(i) You must conduct routine cleaning of paved roads with a sweeper, vacuum or wet broom (in accordance with applicable recommendations by the manufacturer of the street sweeper, vacuum, or wet broom), with such cleaning to occur no less frequently than on a daily basis unless the roads have sufficient surface moisture such that fugitive dust is not generated.


(ii) Chemical dust suppressants will be applied not less frequently than once per month at slag haul roads and not less frequently than every 6 weeks on all other unpaved roads unless the roads have sufficient surface moisture such that fugitive dust is not generated.


(2) Unloading of fugitive dust materials from trucks or railcars.


(3) Outdoor piles used for storage of fugitive dust materials.


(4) Bedding areas used for blending copper concentrate and other feed constituents.


(5) Each transfer point in conveying systems used to transport fugitive dust materials. These points include, but are not limited to, transfer of material from one conveyor belt to another and transfer of material to a hopper or bin.


(6) Other site-specific sources of fugitive dust emissions that the Administrator or delegated authority under 40 CFR part 70 or 71 designate to be included in your fugitive dust control plan.


(7) The cargo compartment of all trucks or other motor vehicles (e.g., front-end loaders) when transporting bulk quantities of fugitive dust materials must be maintained to ensure:


(i) The floor, sides, and/or tailgate(s) are free of holes or other openings.


(ii) All loads of trucks containing copper concentrate arriving at the facility are covered with a tarp to prevent spills and fugitive emissions.


(iii) Trucks are loaded only to such a level as to prevent spillage over the side.


(iv) A speed limit of 15 mph is required.


(v) All dust producing material internally transferred or moved by truck at the facility is covered with a tarp to prevent spills and fugitive emissions.


(c) Your fugitive dust control plan must describe the control measures you use to control fugitive dust emissions from each source addressed in the plan, as applicable and appropriate for your site conditions. Examples of control measures include, but are not limited to, locating the source inside a building or other enclosure, installing and operating a local hood capture system over the source and venting the captured gas stream to a control device, placing material stockpiles below grade, installing wind screens or wind fences around the source, spraying water on the source as weather conditions require, applying appropriate dust suppression agents on the source, or combinations of these control measures.


(d) The requirement for you to operate according to a written fugitive dust control plan must be incorporated in your operating permit that is issued by the approved authority under 40 CFR part 70 or 71. A copy of your fugitive dust control plan must be sent to the approved authority under 40 CFR part 70 or 71 on or before the compliance date for your primary copper smelter, as specified in § 63.1443 or paragraph (b) of this section.


(e) For any element of the fugitive dust control plan that requires new construction at the facility, the owner or operator shall complete such construction, in accordance with the specifications and schedule set forth in the approved fugitive dust control plan.


(f) The fugitive dust control plan must be reviewed, updated (if necessary), and then submitted to the approved permitting authority under 40 CFR part 70 or 71 with each application for the title V operating permit renewal and with each permit application for the construction or modification of lead-bearing fugitive dust generating sources. On or after November 12, 2024, the owner or operator must submit a copy fugitive dust plan in PDF format to the EPA via Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), which can be accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (*https://cdx.epa.gov*) following the procedure specified in §§ 63.1455(e) and 63.9(k).
