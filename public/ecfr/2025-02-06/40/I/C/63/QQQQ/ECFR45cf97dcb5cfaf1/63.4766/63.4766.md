# § 63.4766   How do I determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency?

You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance test required by § 63.4760. You must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3), and each test run must last at least 1 hour.


(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Use Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.


(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, or 2F of appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60, or Method 2G of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.


(3) Use Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. You may also use as an alternative to Method 3B, the manual method for measuring the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide content of exhaust gas in ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus]” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).


(4) Use Method 4 of appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60 to determine stack gas moisture.


(5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.


(b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously, using Method 25 or 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60, and Method 320 or 326 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 63, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. The voluntary consensus standard ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010) (incorporated by reference in § 63.14) may be used as an alternative to using Method 320 if the conditions specified in § 63.4751(i)(4)(i) and (ii) are met. You must use the same method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.


(1) Use Method 25 of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be more than 50 parts per million (ppm) at the control device outlet.


(2) Use Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be 50 ppm or less at the control device outlet.


(3) Use Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is not an oxidizer.


(4) If Method 25A is used, and if formaldehyde is a major organic HAP component of the surface coating exhaust stream, use Method 320 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 or NCASI Method ISS/FP A105.01 (incorporated by reference in § 63.14) or ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010) (incorporated by reference in § 63.14) to determine formaldehyde concentration.


(5) In addition to Method 25 or 25A, use Method 326 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 if isocyanate is a major organic HAP component of the surface coating exhaust stream.


(c) If two or more add-on control devices are used for the same emission stream, then you must measure emissions at the outlet of each device. For example, if one add-on control device is a concentrator with an outlet for the high-volume, dilute stream that has been treated by the concentrator, and a second add-on control device is an oxidizer with an outlet for the low-volume, concentrated stream that is treated with the oxidizer, you must measure emissions at the outlet of the oxidizer and the high volume dilute stream outlet of the concentrator.


(d) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rates for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions. The mass emission rates for formaldehyde and individual isocyanate must be determined separately.


(e) For each test run, determine the add-on control device organic emissions destruction or removal efficiency, using Equation 2 of this section:


(f) Determine the emission destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on control device as the average of the efficiencies determined in the three test runs and calculated in Equation 2 of this section. Destruction and removal efficiency must be determined independently for formaldehyde and isocyanates.
