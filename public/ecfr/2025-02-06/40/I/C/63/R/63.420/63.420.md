(a) Prior to May 8, 2027, the affected source to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each bulk gasoline terminal, except those bulk gasoline terminals meeting either of the criteria listed in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. No later than May 8, 2027, the affected source to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each bulk gasoline terminal located at a major source as defined in § 63.2.


(1) Bulk gasoline terminals for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the result, E_T_, of the following equation is less than 1, and complies with requirements in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section:




(2) Bulk gasoline terminals for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the facility is not a major source, or is not located within a contiguous area and under common control of a facility that is a major source, as defined in § 63.2.


(b) Prior to May 8, 2027, the affected source to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each pipeline breakout station, except those pipeline breakout stations meeting either of the criteria listed in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. No later than May 8, 2027, the affected source to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each pipeline breakout station located at a major source as defined in § 63.2.


(1) Pipeline breakout stations for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the result, E_P_, of the following equation is less than 1, and complies with requirements in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section:



 


(2) Pipeline breakout stations for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the facility is not a major source, or is not located within a contiguous area and under common control of a facility that is a major source, as defined in § 63.2.


(c) Prior to May 8, 2027, a facility for which the results, E_T_ or E_P_, of the calculation in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section has been documented and is less than 1.0 but greater than or equal to 0.50, is exempt from the requirements of this subpart, except that the owner or operator shall:








(1) Operate the facility such that none of the facility parameters used to calculate results under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, and approved by the Administrator, is exceeded in any rolling 30-day period; and


(2) Maintain records and provide reports in accordance with the provisions of § 63.428(l)(4).


(d) Prior to May 8, 2027, a facility for which the results, E_T_ or E_P_, of the calculation in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section has been documented and is less than 0.50, is exempt from the requirements of this subpart, except that the owner or operator shall:












(1) Operate the facility such that none of the facility parameters used to calculate results under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section is exceeded in any rolling 30-day period; and


(2) Maintain records and provide reports in accordance with the provisions of § 63.428(l)(5).




(e) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section shall not be used to determine applicability to bulk gasoline terminals or pipeline breakout stations that are either:


(1) Located within a contiguous area and under common control with another bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station, or


(2) Located within a contiguous area and under common control with other sources not specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, that emit or have the potential to emit a hazardous air pollutant.


(f) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of any paragraphs in this section including, but not limited to, the parameters and assumptions used in the applicable equation in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, shall demonstrate compliance with those paragraphs.


(g) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of this subpart that is also subject to applicable provisions of part 60, subpart Kb, XX, or XXa, of this chapter shall comply only with the provisions in each subpart that contain the most stringent control requirements for that facility.




(h) Each owner or operator of an affected source bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station is subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A—General Provisions, as indicated in Table 1.


(i) A bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station with a Standard Industrial Classification code 2911 located within a contiguous area and under common control with a refinery complying with §§ 63.646, 63.648, 63.649, 63.650, and 63.660 is not subject to the standards in this subpart, except as specified in § 63.650.


(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the December 14, 1995, compliance date for existing facilities in §§ 63.424(e) and 63.428(a), (l)(4)(i), and (l)(5)(i) is stayed from December 8, 1995, to March 7, 1996.


(k) Each owner or operator of an affected source bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station must comply with the standards in this part at all times. At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
