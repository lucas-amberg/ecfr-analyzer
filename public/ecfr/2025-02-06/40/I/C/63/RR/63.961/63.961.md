# ยง 63.961   Definitions.

All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.


*Closure device* means a cap, cover, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening to the individual drain system. Closure devices include devices that are detachable (e.g., a plug or manhole cover), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).


*Hard-piping* means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed in accordance with relevant standards (e.g., ANSI B31-3) and good engineering practices.


*Individual drain system* means a stationary system used to convey regulated-material to a waste management unit or to discharge or disposal. The term includes hard-piping, all drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes (e.g., manholes, sumps, and lift stations) conveying regulated-material. For the purpose of this subpart, an individual drain system is not a drain and collection system that is designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall runoff (e.g., stormwater sewer system) and is segregated from all other individual drain systems.


*Junction box* means a sump, manhole, or access point to a sewer line or a lift station.


*Regulated-material* means the wastewater streams, residuals, and any other materials specified by the referencing subpart to be managed in accordance with the standards under this subpart.


*Sewer line* means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other conduit used to convey regulated-material to a downstream waste management unit. Sewer lines include pipes, grates, and trenches.


*Waste management unit* means the equipment, structure, or device used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of regulated-material. Examples of waste management units include: wastewater tanks, surface impoundments, individual drain systems, and biological wastewater treatment units. Examples of equipment that may be waste management units include containers, air flotation units, oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units.


*Water seal* means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of trap filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain liquid levels adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a liquid barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The liquid level of the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a drain in order to be considered a water seal.
