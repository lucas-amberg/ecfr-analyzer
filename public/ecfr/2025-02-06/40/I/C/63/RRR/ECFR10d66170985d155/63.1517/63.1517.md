# § 63.1517   Records.

(a) As required by § 63.10(b), the owner or operator shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by the general provisions and this subpart. 


(1) The owner or operator must retain each record for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. The most recent 2 years of records must be retained at the facility. The remaining 3 years of records may be retained off site. 


(2) The owner or operator may retain records on microfilm, computer disks, magnetic tape, or microfiche; and 


(3) The owner or operator may report required information on paper or on a labeled computer disk using commonly available and EPA-compatible computer software. 


(b) In addition to the general records required by § 63.10(b), the owner or operator of a new or existing affected source (including an emission unit in a secondary aluminum processing unit) must maintain records of: 


(1) For each affected source and emission unit with emissions controlled by a fabric filter or a lime-injected fabric filter: 


(i) If a bag leak detection system is used, the number of total operating hours for the affected source or emission unit during each 6-month reporting period, records of each alarm, the time of the alarm, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm and the corrective action(s) taken. 


(ii) If a continuous opacity monitoring system is used, records of opacity measurement data, including records where the average opacity of any 6-minute period exceeds 5 percent, with a brief explanation of the cause of the emissions, the time the emissions occurred, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and the corrective action taken.

(3) For each scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln and group 1 furnace, subject to D/F and HCl emission standards with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter, records of 15-minute block average inlet temperatures for each lime-injected fabric filter, including any period when the 3-hour block average temperature exceeds the compliant operating parameter value +14 °C (+ 25 °F), with a brief explanation of the cause of the excursion and the corrective action taken. 


(4) For each affected source and emission unit with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter: 


(i) Records of inspections at least once every 8-hour period verifying that lime is present in the feeder hopper or silo and flowing, including any inspection where blockage is found, with a brief explanation of the cause of the blockage and the corrective action taken, and records of inspections at least once every 4-hour period for the subsequent 3 days. If flow monitors, pressure drop sensors or load cells are used to verify that lime is present in the hopper and flowing, records of all monitor or sensor output including any event where blockage was found, with a brief explanation of the cause of the blockage and the corrective action taken; 


(ii) If lime feeder setting is monitored, records of daily and monthly inspections of feeder setting, including records of any deviation of the feeder setting from the setting used in the performance test, with a brief explanation of the cause of the deviation and the corrective action taken. If a lime feeder has been repaired or replaced, this action must be documented along with records of the new feeder calibration and the feed mechanism set points necessary to maintain the lb/hr feed rate operating limit. These records must be maintained on site and available upon request.


(iii) If lime addition rate for a noncontinuous lime injection system is monitored pursuant to the approved alternative monitoring requirements in § 63.1510(v), records of the time and mass of each lime addition during each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test and calculations of the average lime addition rate (lb/ton of feed/charge). 


(5) For each group 1 furnace (with or without add-on air pollution control devices) or in-line fluxer, records of 15-minute block average weights of gaseous or liquid reactive flux injection, total reactive flux injection rate and calculations (including records of the identity, composition, and weight of each addition of gaseous, liquid or solid reactive flux), including records of any period the rate exceeds the compliant operating parameter value and corrective action taken. 


(6) For each continuous monitoring system, records required by § 63.10(c). 


(7) For each affected source and emission unit subject to an emission standard in kg/Mg (lb/ton) of feed/charge, records of feed/charge (or throughput) weights for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test. 


(8) Approved site-specific monitoring plan for a group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices with records documenting conformance with the plan. 


(9) Records of all charge materials for each thermal chip dryer, dross-only furnace, and group 1 melting/holding furnaces without air pollution control devices processing only clean charge. 


(10) Operating logs for each group 1 sidewell furnace with add-on air pollution control devices documenting conformance with operating standards for maintaining the level of molten metal above the top of the passage between the sidewell and hearth during reactive flux injection and for adding reactive flux only to the sidewell or a furnace hearth equipped with a control device for PM, HCl, and D/F emissions. 


(11) For each in-line fluxer for which the owner or operator has certified that no reactive flux was used:


(i) Operating logs which establish that no source of reactive flux was present at the in-line fluxer;


(ii) Labels required pursuant to § 63.1506(b) which establish that no reactive flux may be used at the in-line fluxer; or


(iii) Operating logs which document each flux gas, agent, or material used during each operating cycle.


(12) Records of all charge materials and fluxing materials or agents for a group 2 furnace. 


(13) Records of monthly inspections for proper unit labeling for each affected source and emission unit subject to labeling requirements. 


(14) Records of annual inspections of emission capture/collection and closed vent systems or, if the alternative to the annual flow rate measurements is used, records of differential pressure; fan RPM or fan motor amperage; static pressure measurements; or duct centerline velocity using a hotwire anemometer, ultrasonic flow meter, cross-duct pressure differential sensor, venturi pressure differential monitoring or orifice plate equipped with an associated thermocouple, as appropriate.

(ii) OM&M plan; and


(iii) Site-specific secondary aluminum processing unit emission plan (if applicable). 


(17) For each secondary aluminum processing unit, records of total charge weight, or if the owner or operator chooses to comply on the basis of aluminum production, total aluminum produced for each 24-hour period and calculations of 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emissions.


(18) For any failure to meet an applicable standard, the owner or operator must maintain the following records;


(i) Records of the emission unit ID, monitor ID, pollutant or parameter monitored, beginning date and time of the event, end date and time of the event, cause of the deviation or exceedance and corrective action taken.


(ii) Records of actions taken during periods of malfunction to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1506(a)(5), including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation.


(19) For each period of startup or shutdown for which the owner or operator chooses to demonstrate compliance for an affected source, the owner or operator must comply with (b)(19)(i) or (ii) of this section.


(i) To demonstrate compliance based on a feed/charge rate of zero, a flux rate of zero and the use of electricity, propane or natural gas as the sole sources of heating or the lack of heating, the owner or operator must submit a semiannual report in accordance with § 63.1516(b)(2)(vii) or maintain the following records:


(A) The date and time of each startup and shutdown;


(B) The quantities of feed/charge and flux introduced during each startup and shutdown; and
