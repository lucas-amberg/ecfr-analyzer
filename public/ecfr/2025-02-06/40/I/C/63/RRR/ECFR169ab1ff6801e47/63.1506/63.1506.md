(5) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.


(b) *Labeling.* The owner or operator must provide and maintain easily visible labels posted at each group 1 furnace, group 2 furnace, in-line fluxer and scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln that identifies the applicable emission limits and means of compliance, including:
