Test data must establish the highest level of PM, HCl, and D/F (and HF for uncontrolled group 1 furnaces) that will be emitted from the furnace. Subject to approval of the OM&M plan, the highest levels may be determined by conducting performance tests and monitoring operating parameters in accordance with § 63.1511(b)(1).


(2) Each site-specific monitoring plan must document each work practice, equipment/design practice, pollution prevention practice, or other measure used to meet the applicable emission standards. 


(3) Each site-specific monitoring plan must include provisions for unit labeling as required in paragraph (c) of this section, feed/charge weight measurement (or production weight measurement) as required in paragraph (e) of this section and flux weight measurement as required in paragraph (j) of this section. 


(4) Each site-specific monitoring plan for a melting/holding furnace subject to the clean charge emission standard in § 63.1505(i)(3) must include these requirements: 


(i) The owner or operator must record the type of feed/ charge (*e.g.*, ingot, thermally dried chips, dried scrap, etc.) for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test; and


(ii) The owner or operator must submit a certification of compliance with the applicable operational standard for clean charge materials in § 63.1506(n)(3) for each 6-month reporting period. Each certification must contain the information in § 63.1516(b)(2)(iv). 


(5) If a continuous emission monitoring system is included in a site-specific monitoring plan, the plan must include provisions for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system to provide quality-assured measurements in accordance with all applicable requirements of the general provisions in subpart A of this part. 


(6) If a continuous opacity monitoring system is included in a site-specific monitoring plan, the plan must include provisions for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system to provide quality-assured measurements in accordance with all applicable requirements of this subpart. 


(7) If a site-specific monitoring plan includes a scrap inspection program for monitoring the scrap contaminant level of furnace feed/charge materials, the plan must include provisions for the demonstration and implementation of the program in accordance with all applicable requirements in paragraph (p) of this section. 


(8) If a site-specific monitoring plan includes a calculation method for monitoring the scrap contaminant level of furnace feed/charge materials, the plan must include provisions for the demonstration and implementation of the program in accordance with all applicable requirements in paragraph (q) of this section. 


(p) *Scrap inspection program for group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices.* A scrap inspection program must include: 


(1) A proven method for collecting representative samples and measuring the oil and coatings content of scrap samples; 


(2) A scrap inspector training program; 


(3) An established correlation between visual inspection and physical measurement of oil and coatings content of scrap samples; 


(4) Periodic physical measurements of oil and coatings content of randomly-selected scrap samples and comparison with visual inspection results; 


(5) A system for assuring that only acceptable scrap is charged to an affected group 1 furnace; and 


(6) Recordkeeping requirements to document conformance with plan requirements. 


(q) *Monitoring of scrap contamination level by calculation method for group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices.* The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace dedicated to processing a distinct type of furnace feed/charge composed of scrap with a uniform composition (such as rejected product from a manufacturing process for which the coating-to-scrap ratio can be documented) may include a program in the site-specific monitoring plan for determining, monitoring, and certifying the scrap contaminant level using a calculation method rather than a scrap inspection program. A scrap contaminant monitoring program using a calculation method must include: 


(1) Procedures for the characterization and documentation of the contaminant level of the scrap prior to the performance test. 


(2) Limitations on the furnace feed/charge to scrap of the same composition as that used in the performance test. If the performance test was conducted with a mixture of scrap and clean charge, limitations on the proportion of scrap in the furnace feed/charge to no greater than the proportion used during the performance test. 


(3) Operating, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements to ensure that no scrap with a contaminant level higher than that used in the performance test is charged to the furnace. 


(r) *Group 2 furnace.* These requirements apply to the owner or operator of a new or existing group 2 furnace. The owner or operator must: 


(1) Record a description of the materials charged to each furnace, including any nonreactive, non-HAP-containing/non-HAP-generating fluxing materials or agents. 


(2) Submit a certification of compliance with the applicable operational standard for charge materials in § 63.1506(o) for each 6-month reporting period. Each certification must contain the information in § 63.1516(b)(2)(v). 


(s) *Site-specific requirements for secondary aluminum processing units.* (1) An owner or operator of a secondary aluminum processing unit at a facility must include, within the OM&M plan prepared in accordance with § 63.1510(b), the following information: 


(i) The identification of each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit; 


(ii) The specific control technology or pollution prevention measure to be used for each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit and the date of its installation or application; 


(iii) The emission limit calculated for each secondary aluminum processing unit and performance test results with supporting calculations demonstrating initial compliance with each applicable emission limit; 


(iv) Information and data demonstrating compliance for each emission unit with all applicable design, equipment, work practice or operational standards of this subpart; and


(v) The monitoring requirements applicable to each emission unit in a secondary aluminum processing unit and the monitoring procedures for daily calculation of the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average using the procedure in § 63.1510(t). 


(2) The SAPU compliance procedures within the OM&M plan may not contain any of the following provisions: 


(i) Any averaging among emissions of differing pollutants; 


(ii) The inclusion of any affected sources other than emission units in a secondary aluminum processing unit; 


(iii) The inclusion of any emission unit while it is shutdown; or


(iv) The inclusion of any periods of startup or shutdown in emission calculations.


(3) To revise the SAPU compliance provisions within the OM&M plan prior to the end of the permit term, the owner or operator must submit a request to the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources containing the information required by paragraph (s)(1) of this section and obtain approval of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources prior to implementing any revisions.


(t) *Secondary aluminum processing unit*. Except as provided in paragraph (u) of this section, the owner or operator must calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emissions of PM, HCl, and D/F (and HF for uncontrolled group 1 furnaces) for each secondary aluminum processing unit on a daily basis. To calculate the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average, the owner or operator must:


(1) Calculate and record the total weight of material charged to each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit for each 24-hour day of operation using the feed/charge weight information required in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or operator chooses to comply on the basis of weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, rather than weight of material charged to the emission unit, all performance test emissions results and all calculations must be conducted on the aluminum production weight basis. 


(2) Multiply the total feed/charge weight to the emission unit, or the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, for each emission unit for the 24-hour period by the emission rate (in lb/ton of feed/charge) for that emission unit (as determined during the performance test) to provide emissions for each emission unit for the 24-hour period, in pounds. 


(i) Where no performance test has been conducted, for a particular emission unit, because the owner of operator has, with the approval of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, chosen to determine the emission rate of an emission unit by testing a representative unit, in accordance with § 63.1511(f), the owner or operator shall use the emission rate determined from the representative unit in the SAPU emission rate calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4).


(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (t)(2)(iii) of this section, if the owner or operator has not conducted performance tests for HCl (and HF for an uncontrolled group 1 furnace) or for HCl for an in-line fluxer, in accordance with the provisions of § 63.1512(d)(3), (e)(3), or (h)(2), the calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4) to determine SAPU-wide HCl and HF emissions shall be made under the assumption that all chlorine contained in reactive flux added to the emission unit is emitted as HCl and all fluorine contained in reactive flux added to the emission unit is emitted as HF.


(iii) Prior to the date by which the initial performance test for HF emissions from uncontrolled group 1 furnaces is conducted, or is required to be conducted, the calculation required in § 63.1505(k) to determine the SAPU-wide HF emission limit and the calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4) to determine the SAPU-wide HF emission rate must exclude HF emissions from untested uncontrolled group 1 furnaces and feed/charge processed in untested uncontrolled group 1 furnaces.


(3) Divide the total emissions for each SAPU for the 24-hour period by the total material charged to the SAPU, or the weight of aluminum produced by the SAPU over the 24-hour period to provide the daily emission rate for the SAPU. 


(4) Compute the 24-hour daily emission rate using Equation 4:


(5) Calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each pollutant each day by summing the daily emission rates for each pollutant over the 3 most recent consecutive days and dividing by 3. The SAPU is in compliance with an applicable emission limit if the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each pollutant is no greater than the applicable SAPU emission limit determined in accordance with § 63.1505(k)(1)-(3).


(u) *Secondary aluminum processing unit compliance by individual emission unit demonstration.* As an alternative to the procedures of paragraph (t) of this section, an owner or operator may demonstrate, through performance tests, that each individual emission unit within the secondary aluminum production unit is in compliance with the applicable emission limits for the emission unit. 


(v) *Alternative monitoring method for lime addition.* The owner or operator of a lime-coated fabric filter that employs intermittent or noncontinuous lime addition may apply to the Administrator for approval of an alternative method for monitoring the lime addition schedule and rate based on monitoring the weight of lime added per ton of feed/charge for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test. An alternative monitoring method will not be approved unless the owner or operator provides assurance through data and information that the affected source will meet the relevant emission standards on a continuous basis. 


(w) *Alternative monitoring methods.* If an owner or operator wishes to use an alternative monitoring method to demonstrate compliance with any emission standard in this subpart, other than those alternative monitoring methods which may be authorized pursuant to § 63.1510(j)(5) and § 63.1510(v), the owner or operator may submit an application to the Administrator. Any such application will be processed according to the criteria and procedures set forth in paragraphs (w)(1) through (6) of this section. 


(1) The Administrator will not approve averaging periods other than those specified in this section. 


(2) The owner or operator must continue to use the original monitoring requirement until necessary data are submitted and approval is received to use another monitoring procedure. 


(3) The owner or operator shall submit the application for approval of alternate monitoring methods no later than the notification of the performance test. The application must contain the information specified in paragraphs (w)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section: 


(i) Data or information justifying the request, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the required approach; 


(ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring requirements, including the operating parameters to be monitored, the monitoring approach and technique, and how the limit is to be calculated; and 


(iii) Data and information documenting that the alternative monitoring requirement(s) would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard(s). 


(4) The Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard(s). Before disapproving any alternate monitoring application, the Administrator will provide: 


(i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended disapproval is based; and 


(ii) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional supporting information before final action is taken on the application. This notice will specify how much additional time is allowed for the owner or operator to provide additional supporting information. 


(5) The owner or operator is responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither submittal of an application nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves the owner or operator of the responsibility to comply with any provisions of this subpart. 


(6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case basis, that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.
