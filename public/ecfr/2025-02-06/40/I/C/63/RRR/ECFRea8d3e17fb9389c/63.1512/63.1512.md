# § 63.1512   Performance test/compliance demonstration requirements and procedures.

(a) *Aluminum scrap shredder*. The owner or operator must conduct performance tests to measure PM emissions at the outlet of the control system. If visible emission observation is the selected monitoring option, the owner or operator must record visible emission observations from each exhaust stack for all consecutive 6-minute periods during the PM emission test according to the requirements of Method 9 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. If emissions observations by ASTM Method D7520-13 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is the selected monitoring option, the owner or operator must record opacity observations from each exhaust stack for all consecutive 6-minute periods during the PM emission test.


(b) *Thermal chip dryer.* The owner or operator must conduct a performance test to measure THC and D/F emissions at the outlet of the control device while the unit processes only unpainted aluminum chips. 


(c) *Scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln.* The owner or operator must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of THC, D/F, HCl, and PM at the outlet of the control device. 


(1) If the scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln is subject to the alternative emission limits in § 63.1505(e), the average afterburner operating temperature in each 3-hour block period must be maintained at or above 760 °C (1400 °F) for the test. 


(2) The owner or operator of a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln subject to the alternative limits in § 63.1505(e) must submit a written certification in the notification of compliance status report containing the information required by § 63.1515(b)(7). 


(d) *Group 1 furnace with add-on air pollution control devices.* (1) The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace that processes scrap other than clean charge materials with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of PM and D/F at the outlet of the control device and emissions of HCl at the outlet (for the emission limit) or the inlet and the outlet (for the percent reduction standard). 


(2) The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace that processes only clean charge materials with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of PM at the outlet of the control device and emissions of HCl at the outlet (for the emission limit) or the inlet and the outlet (for the percent reduction standard). 


(3) The owner or operator may choose to determine the rate of reactive flux addition to the group 1 furnace and assume, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the SAPU emission limit, that all reactive flux added to the group 1 furnace is emitted. Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission test for HCl. 


(4) The owner or operator of a sidewell group 1 furnace that conducts reactive fluxing (except for cover flux) in the hearth, or that conducts reactive fluxing in the sidewell at times when the level of molten metal falls below the top of the passage between the sidewell and the hearth, must conduct the performance tests required by paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, to measure emissions from both the sidewell and the hearth. 


(e) *Group 1 furnace (including melting holding furnaces) without add-on air pollution control devices.* In the site-specific monitoring plan required by § 63.1510(o), the owner or operator of a group 1 furnace (including a melting/holding furnaces) without add-on air pollution control devices must include data and information demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission limits. 


(1) If the group 1 furnace processes other than clean charge material, the owner or operator must conduct emission tests to measure emissions of PM, HCl, HF, and D/F at the furnace exhaust outlet.


(2) If the group 1 furnace processes only clean charge, the owner or operator must conduct emission tests to simultaneously measure emissions of PM, HCl and HF. A D/F test is not required. Each test must be conducted while the group 1 furnace (including a melting/holding furnace) processes only clean charge.


(3) The owner or operator may choose to determine the rate of reactive flux addition to the group 1 furnace and assume, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the SAPU emission limit, that all chlorine and fluorine contained in reactive flux added to the group 1 furnace is emitted as HCl and HF. Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission test for HCl or HF.


(4) When testing an existing uncontrolled furnace, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements of either paragraphs (e)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section at the next required performance test required by § 63.1511(e).


(i) Install hooding that meets ACGIH Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), or


(ii) At least 180 days prior to testing petition the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, that such hoods are impractical under the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section and propose testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions during the performance test according to the paragraph (e)(7) of this section, or


(iii) Assume an 80-percent capture efficiency for the furnace exhaust (i.e., multiply emissions measured at the furnace exhaust outlet by 1.25). If the source fails to demonstrate compliance using the 80-percent capture efficiency assumption, the owner or operator must re-test with a hood that meets the ACGIH Guidelines within 180 days, or petition the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, within 180 days that such hoods are impractical under the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section and propose testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions during the performance test according to paragraph (e)(7) of this section.


(iv) The 80-percent capture efficiency assumption is not applicable in the event of testing conducted under an approved petition submitted pursuant to paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section.


(v) Round top furnaces constructed before February 14, 2012, and reconstructed round top furnaces are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (e)(4)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. Round top furnaces must be operated to minimize unmeasured emissions according to paragraph (e)(7) of this section.


(5) When testing a new uncontrolled furnace, other than a new round top furnace, constructed after February 14, 2012, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section at the next required performance test required by § 63.1511(e). When testing a new round top furnace constructed after February 14, 2012, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements of either paragraphs (e)(5)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section at the next required performance test required by § 63.1511(e).


(i) Install hooding that meets ACGIH Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), or


(ii) At least 180 days prior to testing petition the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, that such hoods are impractical under the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section and propose testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions during the performance test according to the paragraph (e)(7) of this section, or


(iii) Assume an 80-percent capture efficiency for the furnace exhaust (*i.e.,* multiply emissions measured at the furnace exhaust outlet by 1.25). If the source fails to demonstrate compliance using the 80-percent capture efficiency assumption, the owner or operator must re-test with a hood that meets the ACGIH Guidelines within 180 days, or petition the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, within 180 days that such hoods are impractical under the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section and propose testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions during the performance test according to paragraph (e)(7) of this section.


(iv) The 80-percent capture efficiency assumption is not applicable in the event of testing conducted under an approved petition submitted pursuant to paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) or (iii) of this section.


(6) The installation of hooding that meets ACGIH Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is considered impractical if any of the following conditions exist:


(i) Building or equipment obstructions (for example, wall, ceiling, roof, structural beams, utilities, overhead crane or other obstructions) are present such that the temporary hood cannot be located consistent with acceptable hood design and installation practices;


(ii) Space limitations or work area constraints exist such that the temporary hood cannot be supported or located to prevent interference with normal furnace operations or avoid unsafe working conditions for the furnace operator; or


(iii) Other obstructions and limitations subject to agreement of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources.


(7) Testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions may include, but are not limited to the following:


(i) Installing a hood that does not entirely meet ACGIH guidelines;


(ii) Using the building as an enclosure, and measuring emissions exhausted from the building if there are no other furnaces or other significant sources in the building of the pollutants to be measured;


(iii) Installing temporary baffles on those sides or top of furnace opening if it is practical to do so where they will not interfere with material handling or with the furnace door opening and closing;


(iv) Minimizing the time the furnace doors are open or the top is off;


(v) Delaying gaseous reactive fluxing until charging doors are closed and, for round top furnaces, until the top is on;


(vi) Agitating or stirring molten metal as soon as practicable after salt flux addition and closing doors as soon as possible after solid fluxing operations, including mixing and dross removal;


(vii) Keeping building doors and other openings closed to the greatest extent possible to minimize drafts that would divert emissions from being drawn into the furnace;


(viii) Maintaining burners on low-fire or pilot operation while the doors are open or the top is off;


(ix) Use of fans or other device to direct flow into a furnace when door is open; or


(x) Removing the furnace cover one time in order to add a smaller but representative charge and then replacing the cover.


(f) *Sweat furnace.* Except as provided in § 63.1505(f)(1), the owner or operator must measure emissions of D/F from each sweat furnace at the outlet of the control device. 


(g) *Dross-only furnace.* The owner or operator must conduct a performance test to measure emissions of PM from each dross-only furnace at the outlet of each control device while the unit processes only dross and salt flux as the sole feedstock.


(h) *In-line fluxer.* (1) The owner or operator of an in-line fluxer that uses reactive flux materials must conduct a performance test to measure emissions of HCl and PM or otherwise demonstrate compliance in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. If the in-line fluxer is equipped with an add-on control device, the emissions must be measured at the outlet of the control device. 


(2) The owner or operator may choose to limit the rate at which reactive flux is added to an in-line fluxer and assume, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the SAPU emission limit, that all chlorine in the reactive flux added to the in-line fluxer is emitted as HCl. Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission test for HCl. If the owner or operator of any in-line flux box that has no ventilation ductwork manifolded to any outlet or emission control device chooses to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits for HCl by limiting use of reactive flux and assuming that all chlorine in the flux is emitted as HCl, compliance with the HCl limit shall also constitute compliance with the emission limit for PM and no separate emission test for PM is required. In this case, the owner or operator of the unvented in-line flux box must use the maximum permissible PM emission rate for the in-line flux boxes when determining the total emissions for any SAPU which includes the flux box.


(i) *Rotary dross cooler.* The owner or operator must conduct a performance test to measure PM emissions at the outlet of the control device. 


(j) *Secondary aluminum processing unit*. The owner or operator must conduct performance tests as described in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section. The results of the performance tests are used to establish emission rates in lb/ton of feed/charge for PM, HCl and HF and µg TEQ/Mg of feed/charge for D/F emissions from each emission unit. These emission rates are used for compliance monitoring in the calculation of the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emission rates using the equation in § 63.1510(t). A performance test is required for:


(1) Each group 1 furnace processing only clean charge to measure emissions of PM and either: 


(i) Emissions of HF and HCl (for determining the emission limit); or


(ii) The mass flow rate of HCl at the inlet to and outlet from the control device (for the percent reduction standard). 


(2) Each group 1 furnace that processes scrap other than clean charge to measure emissions of PM and D/F and either: 


(i) Emissions of HF and HCl (for determining the emission limit); or


(ii) The mass flow rate of HCl at the inlet to and outlet from the control device (for the percent reduction standard). 


(3) Each in-line fluxer to measure emissions of PM and HCl. 


(k) *Feed/charge weight measurement.* During the emission test(s) conducted to determine compliance with emission limits in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) format, the owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit, subject to an emission limit in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) of feed/charge format, must measure (or otherwise determine) and record the total weight of feed/charge to the affected source or emission unit for each of the three test runs and calculate and record the total weight. An owner or operator that chooses to demonstrate compliance on the basis of the aluminum production weight must measure the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit or affected source instead of the feed/charge weight. 


(l) *Continuous opacity monitoring system.* The owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit using a continuous opacity monitoring system must conduct a performance evaluation to demonstrate compliance with Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60. Following the performance evaluation, the owner or operator must measure and record the opacity of emissions from each exhaust stack for all consecutive 6-minute periods during the PM emission test. 


(m) *Afterburner.* These requirements apply to the owner or operator of an affected source using an afterburner to comply with the requirements of this subpart. 


(1) Prior to the initial performance test, the owner or operator must conduct a performance evaluation for the temperature monitoring device according to the requirements of § 63.8. 


(2) The owner or operator must use these procedures to establish an operating parameter value or range for the afterburner operating temperature. 


(i) Continuously measure and record the operating temperature of each afterburner every 15 minutes during the THC and D/F performance tests; 


(ii) Determine and record the 15-minute block average temperatures for the three test runs; and 


(iii) Determine and record the 3-hour block average temperature measurements for the 3 test runs. 


(n) *Inlet gas temperature.* The owner or operator of a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln or a group 1 furnace using a lime-injected fabric filter must use these procedures to establish an operating parameter value or range for the inlet gas temperature. 


(1) Continuously measure and record the temperature at the inlet to the lime-injected fabric filter every 15 minutes during the HCl and D/F performance tests; 


(2) Determine and record the 15-minute block average temperatures for the 3 test runs; and 


(3) Determine and record the 3-hour block average of the recorded temperature measurements for the 3 test runs. 


(o) *Flux injection rate*. The owner or operator must use these procedures to establish an operating parameter value or range for the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate and, for uncontrolled furnaces, the total reactive fluorine flux injection rate.


(1) Continuously measure and record the weight of gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected for each 15 minute period during the HCl, HF and D/F tests, determine and record the 15-minute block average weights, and calculate and record the total weight of the gaseous or liquid reactive flux for the 3 test runs;


(2) Record the identity, composition, and total weight of each addition of solid reactive flux for the 3 test runs; 


(3) Determine the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate and, for uncontrolled furnaces, the total reactive fluorine flux injection rate by adding the recorded measurement of the total weight of chlorine and, for uncontrolled furnaces, fluorine in the gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected and the total weight of chlorine and, for uncontrolled furnaces, fluorine in the solid reactive flux using Equation 5:


(4) Divide the weight of total chlorine or fluorine usage (W_t_) for the 3 test runs by the recorded measurement of the total weight of feed for the 3 test runs; and


(5) If a solid reactive flux other than magnesium chloride or potassium fluoride is used, the owner or operator must derive the appropriate proportion factor subject to approval by the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources.


(p) *Lime injection.* The owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit using a lime-injected fabric filter system must use these procedures during the HCl and D/F tests to establish an operating parameter value for the feeder setting for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test. 


(1) For continuous lime injection systems, ensure that lime in the feed hopper or silo is free-flowing at all times; and 


(2) Record the feeder setting and lime injection rate for the 3 test runs. If the feed rate setting and lime injection rates vary between the runs, determine and record the average feed rate and lime injection rate from the 3 runs.


(q) *Bag leak detection system.* The owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit using a bag leak detection system must submit the information described in § 63.1515(b)(6) as part of the notification of compliance status report to document conformance with the specifications and requirements in § 63.1510(f). 


(r) *Labeling.* The owner or operator of each scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln, group 1 furnace, group 2 furnace and in-line fluxer must submit the information described in § 63.1515(b)(3) as part of the notification of compliance status report to document conformance with the operational standard in § 63.1506(b). 


(s) *Capture/collection system.* The owner or operator of a new or existing affected source or emission unit with an add-on control device must submit the information described in § 63.1515(b)(2) as part of the notification of compliance status report to document conformance with the operational standard in § 63.1506(c).
