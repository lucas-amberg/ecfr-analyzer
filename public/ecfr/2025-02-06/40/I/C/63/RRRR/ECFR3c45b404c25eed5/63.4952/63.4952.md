# § 63.4952   How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?

(a) Following the initial compliance period, you must complete a compliance demonstration according to the requirements in § 63.4951(h) for each subsequent compliance period. Each month following the initial compliance period described in § 63.4950 is a compliance period.


(b) If the organic HAP emission rate for any compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, this is a deviation from the emission limitations for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in §§ 63.4910(c)(6) and 63.4920(a)(6).


(c) As part of each semiannual compliance report required by § 63.4920, you must identify the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations, you must submit an affirmative statement that the coating operation or group of coating operations was in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890.


(d) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.4930 and 63.4931.
