# § 63.4942   How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?

(a) Following the initial compliance period, you must complete a compliance demonstration according to the requirements in § 63.4941(e) for each subsequent compliance period. Each month following the initial compliance period described in § 63.4940 is a compliance period. 


(b) If you choose to comply with the emission limitations by using the compliant material option, the use of any coating, thinner, or cleaning material that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section is a deviation from the emission limitations that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.4910(c)(6) and 63.4920(a)(5). 


(c) As part of each semiannual compliance report required by § 63.4920, you must identify the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you used the compliant material option. If there were no deviations from the emission limits in § 63.4890, submit an affirmative statement that the coating operation or group of coating operations was in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because you used no coating for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, and you used no thinner or cleaning material that contained organic HAP. 


(d) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.4930 and 63.4931.
