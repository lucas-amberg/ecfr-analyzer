(d) For each dry ESP subject to the operating limits in § 63.9590(b)(3), you must follow the monitoring requirements in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.


(1) If the operating limit you choose to monitor is the 6-minute average opacity of emissions in accordance with § 63.9590(b)(3)(i), you must install, operate, and maintain a COMS according to the requirements in § 63.9632(f) and monitor the 6-minute average opacity of emissions exiting each control device stack according to the requirements in § 63.9633.


(2) If the operating limit you choose to monitor is average secondary voltage and average secondary current for each dry ESP field in accordance with § 63.9590(b)(3)(ii), you must install, operate, and maintain a CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.9632(b) through (e) and monitor the daily average secondary voltage and daily average secondary current according to the requirements in § 63.9633.




(e) For each wet ESP subject to the operating limits in § 63.9590(b)(4), you must install, operate, and maintain a CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.9632(b) through (e) and monitor the daily average secondary voltage, daily average stack outlet temperature, and daily average water flow rate according to the requirements in § 63.9633.




(f) For each wet scrubber and wet ESP subject to the operating limits in § 63.9590(b)(5), you must install, operate, and maintain a CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.9632(g) and monitor the daily average scrubber water flow rate and pH of the scrubber water effluent.






(g) For each ACI system subject to the operating limits in § 63.9590(b)(6), you must install, operate, and maintain a CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.9632(h) and (i) and monitor the daily average activated carbon injection rate and carrier gas flow rate.

(i) If you use any air pollution control device other than a baghouse, wet scrubber, dry ESP, wet ESP, DSI, or ACI, you must submit a site-specific monitoring plan that includes the information in paragraphs (i)(1) through (4) of this section. The monitoring plan is subject to approval by the Administrator. You must maintain a current copy of the monitoring plan onsite, and it must be available for inspection upon request. You must keep the plan for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the requirements of this subpart.


(1) A description of the device.


(2) Test results collected in accordance with § 63.9621 verifying the performance of the device for reducing emissions of particulate matter, mercury, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride to the atmosphere to the levels required by this subpart.

(4) Appropriate operating parameters that will be monitored to maintain continuous compliance with the applicable emission limitation(s).


(j) If you elect to comply with the mercury limit in table 2 to this subpart using emissions averaging in accordance with an implementation plan approved under the provisions in § 63.9623(d) or you elect to adjust the activated carbon injection rate based on the taconite pellet production rate in accordance with the procedures in § 63.9634(n), you must determine and record the mass of taconite pellets produced each month by each furnace included in the emissions averaging group. The weight of taconite pellets produced must be determined by measurement using weigh hoppers, belt weigh feeders, or weighed quantities in shipments, or calculated using the bulk density and volume measurements.


(k) If you elect to demonstrate compliance with the mercury emissions limits in table 2 to this subpart using a CEMS to measure mercury emissions, you must comply with the requirements in (k)(1) through (5).


(1) Notify the Administrator one month before starting use of the CEMS and notify the Administrator 180-days before ceasing use of the CEMS.


(2) Each CEMS must be installed, certified, calibrated, and maintained according to the requirements of performance specifications 6 and 12A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and quality assurance procedure 6 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.


(3) Operate the mercury CEMS in accordance with performance specification 12A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. The duration of the performance test must be 30 operating days. For each day in which the unit operates, you must obtain hourly mercury concentration data, and stack gas volumetric flow rate data.

(5) Collect CEMS hourly averages for all operating hours on a 30-day rolling average basis. The one-hour arithmetic averages, expressed in units of lb/LT, must be used to calculate 30-day rolling average emissions to determine compliance with the applicable emission limit in table 2 to this subpart.
