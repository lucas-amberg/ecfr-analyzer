(3) Any process using secondary or non-wood fibers.


(b) The affected source to which the existing sourceprovisions of this subpart apply is as follows:


(1) For the processes specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the affected source is the total of all HAP emission points in the pulping and bleaching systems; or


(2) For the processes specified in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, the affected source is the total of all HAP emission points in the bleaching system.


(c) The new source provisions of this subpart apply to the total of all HAP emission points at new or existing sources as follows:


(1) Each affected source defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that commences construction or reconstruction after December 17, 1993;


(2) Each pulping system or bleaching system for the processes specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that commences construction or reconstruction after December 17, 1993;


(3) Each additional pulping or bleaching line at the processes specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that commences construction after December 17, 1993;


(4) Each affected source defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section that commences construction or reconstruction after March 8, 1996; or


(5) Each additional bleaching line at the processes specified in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, that commences construction after March 8, 1996.


(d) Each existing source shall achieve compliance no later than April 16, 2001, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.


(1) Each kraft pulping system shall achieve compliance with the pulping system provisions of § 63.443 for the equipment listed in § 63.443(a)(1)(ii) through (a)(1)(v) as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than April 17, 2006 and the owners and operators shall establish dates, update dates, and report the dates for the milestones specified in § 63.455(b).


(2) Each dissolving-grade bleaching system at either kraft or sulfite pulping mills shall achieve compliance with the bleach plant provisions of § 63.445 of this subpart as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than 3 years after the promulgation of the revised effluent limitation guidelines and standards under 40 CFR 430.14 through 430.17 and 40 CFR 430.44 through 430.47.


(3) Each bleaching system complying with the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program for Effluent Limitation Guidelines in 40 CFR 430.24, shall comply with the requirements specified in either paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(3)(ii) of this section for the effluent limitation guidelines and standards in 40 CFR 430.24.


(i) Comply with the bleach plant provisions of § 63.445 of this subpart as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than April 16, 2001.


(ii) Comply with paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A), (d)(3)(ii)(B), and (d)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.


(A) The owner or operator of a bleaching system shall comply with the bleach plant provisions of § 63.445 of this subpart as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than April 15, 2004.


(B) The owner or operator of a bleaching system shall comply with the requirements specified in either paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B)(*1*) or (d)(3)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section.


(*1*) Not increase the application rate of chlorine or hypochlorite in kilograms (kg) of bleaching agent per megagram of ODP, in the bleaching system above the average daily rates used over the three months prior to June 15, 1998 until the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section are met and record application rates as specified in § 63.454(c).


(*2*) Comply with enforceable effluent limitations guidelines for 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin and adsorbable organic halides at least as stringent as the baseline BAT levels set out in 40 CFR 430.24(a)(1) as expeditiously as possible, but in no event later than April 16, 2001.


(C) Owners and operators shall establish dates, update dates, and report the dates for the milestones specified in § 63.455(b).


(e) Each new source, specified as the total of all HAP emission points for the sources specified in paragraph (c) of this section, shall achieve compliance upon start-up or June 15, 1998, whichever is later, as provided in § 63.6(b) of subpart A of this part.


(f) Each owner or operator of an affected source with affected process equipment shared by more than one type of pulping process, shall comply with the applicable requirement in this subpart that achieves the maximum degree of reduction in HAP emissions.


(g) Each owner or operator of an affected source specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section must comply with the requirements of subpart A—General Provisions of this part, as indicated in table 1 to this subpart.
