(iii) Where data is collected from an automated continuous parameter monitoring system, the owner or operator may calculate and retain block hourly average values from each 15-minute block average period or from at least one measured value per minute if measured more frequently than once per minute, and discard all but the most recent three valid hours of continuous (15-minute or shorter) records, if the hourly averages do not exclude periods of CPMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CPMS records the measured data and calculates the hourly averages through the use of a computerized data acquisition system.


(iv) A record as required by an alternative approved under a referencing subpart.


(2) *Excluded data.* Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section shall not be included in any average computed to determine compliance with an emission limit in a referencing subpart.

(3) *Records of daily averages.* In addition to the records specified in paragraph (a), owners or operators shall keep records as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section and submit reports as specified in § 63.999(c), unless an alternative recordkeeping system has been requested and approved under a referencing subpart.


(i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, daily average values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated from data meeting the specifications of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for each operating day and retained for 5 years.


(A) The daily average shall be calculated as the average of all values for a monitored parameter recorded during the operating day. The average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the period of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous (e.g., for transfer racks the average shall cover periods of loading). If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the daily average instead of all measured values.


(B) The operating day shall be the period defined in the operating permit or in the Notification of Compliance Status. It may be from midnight to midnight or another daily period.


(ii) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are within the range established in the Notification of Compliance Status or in the operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were within the range and retain this record for 5 years rather than calculating and recording a daily average for that operating day. In such cases, the owner or operator may not discard the recorded values as allowed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.


(4) [Reserved]


(5) *Alternative recordkeeping.* For any parameter with respect to any item of equipment associated with a process vent or transfer rack (except low throughput transfer loading racks), the owner or operator may implement the recordkeeping requirements in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section as alternatives to the recordkeeping provisions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator shall retain each record required by paragraphs (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section as provided in a referencing subpart.


(i) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average value, and is not required to retain more frequently monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section are met. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status as specified in § 63.999(b)(5) or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements of this paragraph, as specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(iv).


(A) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.


(B) The monitoring system generates a running average of the monitoring values, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B)(*1*) through (*3*) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.


(*1*) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits;


(*2*) The running average is based on at least six one-hour average values; and


(*3*) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.


(C) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.


(D) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.


(E) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(E)(*1*) through (*3*) of this section. The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.


(*1*) Upon initial installation.


(*2*) Annually after initial installation.


(*3*) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system that might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.


(F) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(F)(*1*) through (*4*) of this section.


(*1*) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.


(*2*) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) through (E) of this section. The description shall identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage; log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description. The description, and the most recent superseded description, shall be retained as provided in the subpart that references this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(F)(*1*) of this section.


(*3*) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.


(*4*) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (b)(5)(i)(F)(*2*) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current, but not less than 5 years from the date of its creation. The current description shall be retained on-site at all times or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded description at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded description shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after being superseded. Thereafter, the superseded description may be stored off-site.


(ii) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that unit of equipment, for any operating day when the daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring were required and/or approved by the Administrator.


(A) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report, as specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(i). The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.


(B) If there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily averages as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average value for each operating day, and shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report, as specified in § 63.999(c). The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.


(C) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section for the duration specified in a referencing subpart. For any week, if compliance with paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.


(6)(i) For the purposes of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.


(A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a) and maintains the records specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(B) An excused excursion, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii), does not count toward the number of excursions for the purposes of this subpart.


(ii) One excused excursion for each control device or recovery device for each semiannual period is allowed. If a source has developed a startup, shutdown and malfunction plan, and a monitored parameter is outside its established range or monitoring data are not collected during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a)) or during periods of nonoperation of the process unit or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which monitoring applies), then the excursion is not a violation and, in cases where continuous monitoring is required, the excursion does not count as the excused excursion for determining compliance.


(c) *Nonflare control and recovery device regulated source monitoring records*—(1) *Monitoring system records.* For process vents and high throughput transfer racks, the owner or operator subject to this subpart shall keep the records specified in this paragraph, as well as records specified elsewhere in this subpart.

(D) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction of CPMS used to comply with this subpart during which excess emissions (as defined in a referencing subpart) occur.


(E) For each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions as defined in a referencing subpart occur, records whether the procedures specified in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. These records may take the form of a “checklist,” or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.


(F) Records documenting each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction event.


(G) Records of CPMS start-up, shutdown, and malfunction event that specify that there were no excess emissions during the event, as applicable.

(ii) For each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions occur, records that the procedures specified in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing control device emissions to a backup control device (e.g., the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a “checklist,” or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.


(4) *Equipment leak records.* The owner or operator shall maintain records of the information specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section for closed vent systems and control devices if specified by the equipment leak provisions in a referencing subpart.
