# § 63.5160   What performance tests must I complete?

(a) If you use a control device to comply with the requirements of § 63.5120, you are not required to conduct a performance test to demonstrate compliance if one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section are met: 


(1) The control device is equipped with continuous emission monitors for determining total organic volatile matter concentration, and capture efficiency has been determined in accordance with the requirements of this subpart; and the continuous emission monitors are used to demonstrate continuous compliance in accordance with § 63.5150(a)(2); or 


(2) You have received a waiver of performance testing under § 63.7(h); or 


(3) The control device is a solvent recovery system and you choose to comply by means of a monthly liquid-liquid material balance. 


(b) *Organic HAP content.* You must determine the organic HAP weight fraction of each coating material applied by following one of the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section: 


(1) *Method 311.* You may test the material in accordance with Method 311 of appendix A of this part. The Method 311 determination may be performed by the manufacturer of the material and the results provided to you. The organic HAP content must be calculated according to the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. 


(i) Count only those organic HAP in Table 3 to this subpart that are measured to be present at greater than or equal to 0.1 weight percent and greater than or equal to 1.0 weight percent for other organic HAP compounds.


(ii) Express the weight fraction of each organic HAP you count according to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.3791). 


(iii) Calculate the total weight fraction of organic HAP in the tested material by summing the counted individual organic HAP weight fractions and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763). 


(2) *Method 24 in appendix A-7 of part 60.* For coatings, you may determine the total volatile matter content as weight fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use it as a substitute for organic HAP, using Method 24 in appendix A-7 of part 60. As an alternative to using Method 24, you may use ASTM D2369-10 (2015), “Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). The determination of total volatile matter content using a method specified in this paragraph (b)(2) or as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be performed by the manufacturer of the coating and the results provided to you.


(3) *Alternative method.* You may use an alternative test method for determining the organic HAP weight fraction once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval. 


(4) *Formulation data.* You may use formulation data provided that the information represents each organic HAP in Table 3 to this subpart that is present at a level equal to or greater than 0.1 percent and equal to or greater than 1.0 percent for other organic HAP compounds in any raw material used, weighted by the mass fraction of each raw material used in the material. Formulation data may be provided to you by the manufacturer of the coating material. In the event of any inconsistency between test data obtained with the test methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section and formulation data, the test data will govern.


(c) *Solids content and density.* You must determine the solids content and the density of each coating material applied. You may determine the volume solids content using ASTM D2697-03(2014) Standard Test Method for Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) or ASTM D6093-97 (2016) Standard Test Method for Percent Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings Using a Helium Gas Pycnometer (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), or an EPA approved alternative method. You must determine the density of each coating using ASTM D1475-13 “Standard Test Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) or ASTM D2111-10 (2015) “Standard Test Methods for Specific Gravity and Density of Halogenated Organic Solvents and Their Admixtures” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). The solids determination using ASTM D2697-03(2014) or ASTM D6093-97 (2016) and the density determination using ASTM D1475-13 or ASTM 2111-10 (2015) may be performed by the manufacturer of the material and the results provided to you. Alternatively, you may rely on formulation data provided by material providers to determine the volume solids. In the event of any inconsistency between test data obtained with the ASTM test methods specified in this section and formulation data, the test data will govern.


(d) *Control device destruction or removal efficiency.* If you are using an add-on control device, such as an oxidizer, to comply with the standard in § 63.5120, you must conduct performance tests according to Table 1 to § 63.5160 to establish the destruction or removal efficiency of the control device or the outlet HAP concentration achieved by the oxidizer, according to the methods and procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. During performance tests, you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.5121 according to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(1) Performance tests conducted to determine the destruction or removal efficiency of the control device must be performed such that control device inlet and outlet testing is conducted simultaneously. To determine the outlet organic HAP concentration achieved by the oxidizer, only oxidizer outlet testing must be conducted. The data must be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (ix).


(i) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is used for sample and velocity traverses to determine sampling locations. 


(ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is used to determine gas volumetric flow rate. 


(iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, used for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. You may also use as an alternative to Method 3B, the manual method for measuring the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide content of exhaust gas, ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). 


(iv) Method 4 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is used to determine stack gas moisture. 


(v) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run, as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this section. 


(vi) Method 25 or 25A in appendix A-7 of part 60 is used to determine total gaseous non-methane organic matter concentration. You may use Method 18 in appendix A-6 of part 60 to subtract methane emissions from measured total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon. Use the same test method for both the inlet and outlet measurements, which must be conducted simultaneously. You must submit notification of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with notification of the performance test required under § 63.7 (b). You must use Method 25A if any of the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section apply to the control device.


(A) The control device is not an oxidizer. 


(B) The control device is an oxidizer, but an exhaust gas volatile organic matter concentration of 50 ppmv or less is required to comply with the standards in § 63.5120; or 


(C) The control device is an oxidizer, but the volatile organic matter concentration at the inlet to the control system and the required level of control are such that they result in exhaust gas volatile organic matter concentrations of 50 ppmv or less; or 


(D) The control device is an oxidizer, but because of the high efficiency of the control device, the anticipated volatile organic matter concentration at the control device exhaust is 50 ppmv or less, regardless of inlet concentration. 


(vii) Each performance test must consist of three separate runs, except as provided by § 63.7(e)(3); each run must be conducted for at least 1 hour under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating under normal operating conditions. For the purpose of determining volatile organic matter concentrations and mass flow rates, the average of the results of all runs will apply. If you are demonstrating compliance with the outlet organic HAP concentration limit in § 63.5120(a)(3), only the average outlet volatile organic matter concentration must be determined.


(viii) If you are determining the control device destruction or removal efficiency, for each run, determine the volatile organic matter mass flow rates using Equation 1 of this section: 


(ix) For each run, determine the control device destruction or removal efficiency, DRE, using Equation 2 of this section: 


(x) The control device destruction or removal efficiency is determined as the average of the efficiencies determined in the three test runs and calculated in Equation 2 of this section. 


(2) You must record such process information as may be necessary to determine the conditions in existence at the time of the performance test. Before August 24, 2020, operations during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction will not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test. On and after August 24, 2020, you must conduct the performance test under representative operating conditions for the coating operation. Operations during periods of start-up, shutdown, or nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.


(3) *Operating limits.* If you are using a capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance to comply with the requirements in § 63.5120, you must establish the applicable operating limits required by § 63.5121. These operating limits apply to each capture system and to each add-on emission control device that is not monitored by CEMS, and you must establish the operating limits during performance tests required by paragraph (d) of this section according to the requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) *Thermal oxidizer.* If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. 


(A) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.


(B) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer. 


(ii) *Catalytic oxidizer.* If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) or paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section. 


(A) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. 


(B) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. These are the minimum operating limits for your catalytic oxidizer. 


(C) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer. 


(D) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(D) *(1) through**(3)* of this section.


(*1*) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (*i.e.,* conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures. 


(*2*) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, 


(*3*) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to § 63.5160. 


(iii) *Other types of control devices.* If you use a control device other than an oxidizer or a solvent recovery system for which you choose to comply by means of a monthly liquid-liquid material balance, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f). 


(e) *Capture efficiency.* If you are required to determine capture efficiency to meet the requirements of § 63.5170(e)(2), (f)(1) and (2), (g)(2) through (4), or (i)(2) and (3), you must determine capture efficiency using the procedures in paragraph (e)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable.


(1) For an enclosure that meets the criteria for a PTE, you may assume it achieves 100 percent capture efficiency. You must confirm that your capture system is a PTE by demonstrating that it meets the requirements of section 6 of EPA Method 204 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M (or an EPA approved alternative method), and that all exhaust gases from the enclosure are delivered to a control device. 


(2) You may determine capture efficiency, CE, according to the protocols for testing with temporary total enclosures that are specified in Method 204A through F of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M. You may exclude never-controlled work stations from such capture efficiency determinations. 


(3) As an alternative to the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, if you are required to conduct a capture efficiency test, you may use any capture efficiency protocol and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the Data Quality Objective or the Lower Confidence Limit approach as described in appendix A to subpart KK of this part. You may exclude never-controlled work stations from such capture efficiency determinations.
