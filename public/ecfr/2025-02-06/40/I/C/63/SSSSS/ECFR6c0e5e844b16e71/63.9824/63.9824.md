# § 63.9824   What definitions apply to this subpart?

Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 40 CFR 63.2, the General Provisions of this part, and in this section as follows: 


*Additive* means a minor addition of a chemical, mineral, or metallic substance that is added to a refractory mixture to facilitate processing or impart specific properties to the final refractory product. 


*Add-on air pollution control device (APCD)* means equipment installed on a process vent that reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to the air. 


*Autoclave* means a vessel that is used to impregnate fired and/or unfired refractory shapes with pitch to form pitch-impregnated refractory products. Autoclaves also can be used as defumers following the impregnation process. 


*Bag leak detection system* means an instrument that is capable of monitoring particulate matter loadings in the exhaust of a fabric filter in order to detect bag failures. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light-scattering, light-transmittance, or other effects to monitor relative PM loadings. 


*Basket* means the metal container used to hold refractory shapes for pitch impregnation during the shape preheating, impregnation, defuming, and, if applicable, coking processes. 


*Batch process* means a process in which a set of refractory shapes is acted upon as a single unit according to a predetermined schedule, during which none of the refractory shapes being processed are added or removed. A batch process does not operate continuously. 


*Binder* means a substance added to a granular material to give it workability and green or dry strength. 


*Catalytic oxidizer* means an add-on air pollution control device that is designed specifically to destroy organic compounds in a process exhaust gas stream by catalytic incineration. A catalytic oxidizer includes a bed of catalyst media through which the process exhaust stream passes to promote combustion and incineration at a lower temperature than would be possible without the catalyst. 


*Chromium refractory product* means a refractory product that contains at least 1 percent chromium by weight. 


*Clay refractory product* means a refractory product that contains at least 10 percent uncalcined clay by weight prior to firing in a kiln. In this definition, the term “clay” means any of the following six classifications of clay defined by the U.S. Geologic Survey: ball clay, bentonite, common clay and shale, fire clay, fuller's earth, and kaolin. 


*Coking oven* means a thermal process unit that operates at a peak temperature typically between 540° and 870 °C (1000° and 1600 °F) and is used to drive off the volatile constituents of pitch-impregnated refractory shapes under a reducing or oxygen-deprived atmosphere. 


*Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS)* means the total equipment that is used to measure and record temperature, pressure, liquid flow rate, gas flow rate, or pH on a continuous basis in one or more locations. “Total equipment” includes the sensor, mechanical components, electronic components, data acquisition system, data recording system, electrical wiring, and other components of a CPMS. 


*Continuous process* means a process that operates continuously. In a continuous process unit, the materials or shapes that are processed are either continuously charged (fed) to and discharged from the process unit, or are charged and discharged at regular time intervals without the process unit being shut down. Continuous thermal process units, such as tunnel kilns, generally include temperature zones that are maintained at relatively constant temperature and through which the materials or shapes being processed are conveyed continuously or at regular time intervals. 


*Curing oven* means a thermal process unit that operates at a peak temperature typically between 90° and 340 °C (200° and 650 °F) and is used to activate a thermosetting resin, pitch, or other binder in refractory shapes. Curing ovens also perform the same function as shape dryers in removing the free moisture from refractory shapes. 


*Defumer* means a process unit that is used for holding pitch-impregnated refractory shapes as the shapes defume or cool immediately following the impregnation process. This definition includes autoclaves that are opened and exhausted to the atmosphere following an impregnation cycle and used for holding pitch-impregnated refractory shapes while the shapes defume or cool. 


*Deviation* means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source: 


(1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart including, but not limited to, any emission limitation (emission limit, operating limit, or work practice standard); 


(2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or 


(3) Fails to meet any emission limitation (emission limit, operating limit, or work practice standard) in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.

*Dry lime scrubber/fabric filter (DLS/FF)* means an add-on air pollution control device that includes continuous injection of humidified hydrated lime or other sorbent into a reaction chamber followed by a fabric filter. These systems may include recirculation of some of the sorbent. 


*Dry limestone adsorber (DLA)* means an air pollution control device that includes a limestone storage bin, a reaction chamber that is essentially a packed-tower filled with limestone, and may or may not include a peeling drum that mechanically scrapes reacted limestone to regenerate the stone for reuse. 


*Emission limitation* means any restriction on the emissions a process unit may discharge. 


*Fabric filter* means an add-on air pollution control device used to capture particulate matter by filtering a process exhaust stream through a filter or filter media; a fabric filter is also known as a baghouse.

*HAP* means any hazardous air pollutant that appears in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act. 


*Kiln* means a thermal process unit that operates at a peak temperature greater than 820 °C (1500 °F) and is used for firing or sintering refractory, ceramic, or other shapes. 


*Kiln furniture* means any refractory shape that is used to hold, support, or position ceramic or refractory products in a kiln during the firing process. 


*Maximum organic HAP processing rate* means the combination of process and refractory product formulation that has the greatest potential to emit organic HAP. The maximum organic HAP processing rate is a function of the organic HAP processing rate, process operating temperature, and other process operating parameters that affect emissions of organic HAP. (See also the definition of *organic HAP processing rate.*) 


*Organic HAP processing rate* means the rate at which the mass of organic HAP materials contained in refractory shapes are processed in an affected thermal process unit. The organic HAP processing rate is a function of the amount of organic HAP contained in the resins, binders, and additives used in a refractory mix; the amounts of those resins, binders, and additives in the refractory mix; and the rate at which the refractory shapes formed from the refractory mix are processed in an affected thermal process unit. For continuous process units, the organic HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per unit of time (e.g., pounds per hour). For batch process units, the organic HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per unit mass of refractory shapes processed during the batch process cycle (e.g., pounds per ton). 


*Particulate matter (PM)* means, for the purposes of this subpart, emissions of particulate matter that serve as a measure of total particulate emissions as measured by EPA Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3.


*Peak emissions period* means the period of consecutive hourly mass emissions of the applicable pollutant that is greater than any other period of consecutive hourly mass emissions for the same pollutant over the course of a specified batch process cycle, as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition. The peak emissions period is a function of the rate at which the temperature of the refractory shapes is increased, the mass and loading configuration of the shapes in the process unit, the constituents of the refractory mix, and the type of pollutants emitted. 


(1) The 3-hour peak THC emissions period is the period of 3 consecutive hours over which the sum of the hourly THC mass emissions rates is greater than the sum of the hourly THC mass emissions rates for any other period of 3 consecutive hours during the same batch process cycle.
