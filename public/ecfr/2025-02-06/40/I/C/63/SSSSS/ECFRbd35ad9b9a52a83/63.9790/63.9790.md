# ยง 63.9790   What are my options for meeting the emission limits?

To meet the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, you must use one or both of the options listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 


(a) *Emissions control system.* Use an emissions capture and collection system and an add-on air pollution control device (APCD) and demonstrate that the resulting emissions or emissions reductions meet the applicable emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, and demonstrate that the capture and collection system and APCD meet the applicable operating limits in Table 2 to this subpart. 


(b) *Process changes.* Use raw materials that have little or no potential to emit HAP during the refractory products manufacturing process or implement manufacturing process changes and demonstrate that the resulting emissions or emissions reductions meet the applicable emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart without an add-on APCD.
