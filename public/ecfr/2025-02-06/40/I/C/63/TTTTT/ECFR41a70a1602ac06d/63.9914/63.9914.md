# ยง 63.9914   What test methods and other procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance with chlorine and hydrochloric acid emission limits?

(a) You must conduct each performance test that applies to your affected source according to the requirements in ยง 63.7(e)(1).


(b) To determine compliance with the applicable emission limits for chlorine and hydrochloric acid in Table 1 to this subpart, you must follow the test methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Determine the concentration of chlorine and hydrochloric acid according to the following test methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60:


(i) Method 1 to select sampling port locations and the number of traverse points. Sampling ports must be located at the outlet of the control device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.


(ii) Method 2, 2F, or 2G to determine the volumetric flow of the stack gas.


(iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas.


(iv) Method 4 to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.


(v) Method 26 or 26A, as applicable, to determine the concentration of hydrochloric acid and chlorine.


(2) Collect a minimum sample of 60 dscf during each test run for chlorine and hydrochloric acid. Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test.


(c) Compute the mass emissions rate (lbs/hr) for each test run using Equation 1 of this section:
