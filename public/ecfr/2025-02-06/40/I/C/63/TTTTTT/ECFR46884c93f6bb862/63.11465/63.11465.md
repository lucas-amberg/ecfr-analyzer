(a) You must route the emissions from each existing affected source through a fabric filter or baghouse that achieves a particulate matter (PM) control efficiency of at least 99.0 percent or an outlet PM concentration limit of 0.034 grams per dry standard cubic meter (g/dscm)(0.015 grains per dry standard cubic feet (gr/dscf)).


(b) You must route the emissions from each new affected source through a fabric filter or baghouse that achieves a PM control efficiency of at least 99.5 percent or an outlet PM concentration limit of 0.023 g/dscm (0.010 gr/dscf).
