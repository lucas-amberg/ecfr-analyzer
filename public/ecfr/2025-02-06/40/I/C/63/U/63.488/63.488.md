# § 63.488   Methods and procedures for batch front-end process vent group determination.

(a) *General requirements.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of batch front-end process vents at affected sources shall determine the group status of each batch front-end process vent in accordance with the provisions of this section. This determination may be based on either organic HAP or TOC emissions.


(1) The procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) shall be followed to determine the group status of each batch front-end process vent. This determination shall be made in accordance with either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section. 


(i) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch front-end process vent based on the expected mix of products. For each product, emission characteristics of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for that product, shall be used in the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section. 


(ii) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch front-end process vent based on annualized production of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation. The annualized production of the highest-HAP recipe shall be based exclusively on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe of all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation for a 12 month period. The production level used may be the actual production rate. It is not necessary to assume a maximum production rate (i.e., 8,760 hours per year at maximum design production). 


(iii) The single highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe of the product with the highest total mass of HAP charged to the reactor during the production of a single batch of product. 


(2) The annual uncontrolled organic HAP or TOC emissions and annual average batch vent flow rate shall be determined at the exit from the batch unit operation. For the purposes of these determinations, the primary condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or distillation column, the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a stripper operated in batch mode, and the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a distillation operation operated in batch mode shall be considered part of the batch unit operation. All other devices that recover or oxidize organic HAP or TOC vapors shall be considered control devices as defined in § 63.482.


(3) The owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent complying with the flare provisions in § 63.487(a)(1) or § 63.487(b)(1) or routing the batch front-end process vent to a control device to comply with the requirements in § 63.487(a)(2) or § 63.487(b)(2) is not required to perform the batch front-end process vent group determination described in this section, but shall comply with all requirements applicable to Group 1 batch front-end process vents.


(b) *Determination of annual emissions.* The owner or operator shall calculate annual uncontrolled TOC or organic HAP emissions for each batch front-end process vent using the methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section. To estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, owners or operators may use either the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, or direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Engineering assessment may also be used to estimate emissions from a batch emission episode, but only under the conditions described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. In using the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, individual component vapor pressure and molecular weight may be obtained from standard references. Methods to determine individual HAP partial pressures in multicomponent systems are described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section. Other variables in the emissions estimation equations may be obtained through direct measurement, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, through engineering assessment, as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, by process knowledge, or by any other appropriate means. Assumptions used in determining these variables must be documented. Once emissions for the batch emission episode have been determined using either the emissions estimation equations, direct measurement, or engineering assessment, emissions from a batch cycle shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, and annual emissions from the batch front-end process vent shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(8) of this section. 


(1) TOC or organic HAP emissions from the purging of an empty vessel shall be calculated using Equation 1. This equation does not take into account evaporation of any residual liquid in the vessel. 


(2) TOC or organic HAP emissions from the purging of a filled vessel shall be calculated using Equation 2. 


(3) Emissions from vapor displacement due to transfer of material into or out of a vessel shall be calculated using Equation 3. 


(4) Emissions caused by the heating of a vessel shall be calculated using the procedures in either paragraph (b)(4)(i), (b)(4)(ii), or (b)(4)(iii) of this section, as appropriate.


(i) If the final temperature to which the vessel contents is heated is lower than 50 K below the boiling point of the HAP in the vessel, then emissions shall be calculated using the equations in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) through (b)(4)(i)(D) of this section. 


(A) Emissions caused by heating of a vessel shall be calculated using Equation 4. The assumptions made for this calculation are atmospheric pressure of 760 mm Hg and the displaced gas is always saturated with VOC vapor in equilibrium with the liquid mixture. 


(B) The moles of gas displaced, Δη, is calculated using equation 5.


(C) The initial and final pressure of the noncondensible gas in the vessel shall be calculated using equation 6.


(D) The weighted average molecular weight of TOC or organic HAP in the displaced gas, MW_WAVG_, shall be calculated using equation 7:


(ii) If the vessel contents are heated to a temperature greater than 50 K below the boiling point, then emissions from the heating of a vessel shall be calculated as the sum of the emissions calculated in accordance with paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) and (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.


(A) For the interval from the initial temperature to the temperature 50 K below the boiling point, emissions shall be calculated using Equation 4, where T_2_ is the temperature 50 K below the boiling point.


(B) For the interval from the temperature 50 K below the boiling point to the final temperature, emissions shall be calculated as the summation of emissions for each 5 K increment, where the emissions for each increment shall be calculated using Equation 4.


(*1*) If the final temperature of the heatup is at or lower than 5 K below the boiling point, the final temperature for the last increment shall be the final temperature for the heatup, even if the last increment is less than 5 K. 


(*2*) If the final temperature of the heatup is higher than 5 K below the boiling point, the final temperature for the last increment shall be the temperature 5 K below the boiling point, even if the last increment is less than 5 K.


(*3*) If the vessel contents are heated to the boiling point and the vessel is not operating with a condenser, the final temperature for the final increment shall be the temperature 5 K below the boiling point, even if the last increment is less than 5 K.


(iii) If the vessel is operating with a condenser, and the vessel contents are heated to the boiling point, the primary condenser is considered part of the process, as described in § 63.488(a)(2). Emissions shall be calculated as the sum of Equation 4, which calculates emissions due to heating the vessel contents to the temperature of the gas exiting the condenser, and Equation 3, which calculates emissions due to the displacement of the remaining saturated noncondensible gas in the vessel. The final temperature in Equation 4 shall be set equal to the exit gas temperature of the condenser. Equation 3 shall be used as written below in Equation 3a, using free space volume, and T_2_ is set equal to the condenser exit gas temperature.


(5) The owner or operator may estimate annual emissions for a batch emission episode by direct measurement. If direct measurement is used, the owner or operator shall either perform a test for the duration of a representative batch emission episode or perform a test during only those periods of the batch emission episode for which the emission rate for the entire episode can be determined or for which the emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used provided the results are still relevant to the current batch front-end process vent conditions. Performance tests shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(iii) of this section. The procedures in either paragraph (b)(5)(iv) or (b)(5)(v) of this section shall be used to calculate the emissions per batch emission episode. 


(i) Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring device is a pitot tube. No traverse is necessary when Method 2A or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is used to determine gas stream volumetric flow rate. 


(ii) Annual average batch vent flow rate shall be determined as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. 




(iii) Method 18 or Method 25A of appendices A-6 and A-7 to 40 CFR part 60, respectively, must be used to determine the concentration of TOC or organic HAP, as appropriate. ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) may also be used in lieu of Method 18, if the target compounds are all known and are all listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 as measurable; ASTM D6420-18 must not be used for methane and ethane; and ASTM D6420-18 may not be used as a total VOC method. The use of Method 25A must conform with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.


(A) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 must be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions. 


(iv) If an integrated sample is taken over the entire batch emission episode to determine average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions shall be calculated using Equation 8.


(v) If grab samples are taken to determine the average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions shall be calculated according to paragraphs (b)(5)(v)(A) and (b)(5)(v)(B) of this section. 


(A) For each measurement point, the emission rate shall be calculated using Equation 9.


(B) The emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equation 10. 


(6) Engineering assessment may be used to estimate emissions from a batch emission episode, if the criteria in paragraph (b)(6)(i) are met. Data or other information used to demonstrate that the criteria in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section have been met shall be reported as specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section. Paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section defines engineering assessment, for the purposes of estimating emissions from a batch emissions episode. All data, assumptions, and procedures used in an engineering assessment shall be documented. 


(i) If the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A), (B), or (C) are met for a specific batch emission episode, the owner or operator may use engineering assessment, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, to estimate emissions from that batch emission episode, and the owner or operator is not required to use the emissions estimation equations described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section to estimate emissions from that batch emission episode. 


(A) Previous test data, where the measurement of organic HAP or TOC emissions was an outcome of the test, show a greater than 20 percent discrepancy between the test value and the value estimated using the applicable equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. Paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section describe test data that will be acceptable under this paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A). 


(*1*) Test data for the batch emission episode obtained during production of the product for which the demonstration is being made. 


(*2*) Test data obtained for a batch emission episode from another process train, where the test data were obtained during production of the product for which the demonstration is being made. Test data from another process train may be used only if the owner or operator can demonstrate that the data are representative of the batch emission episode for which the demonstration is being made, taking into account the nature, size, operating conditions, production rate, and sequence of process steps (e.g., reaction, distillation, etc.) of the equipment in the other process train. 


(B) Previous test data obtained during the production of the product for which the demonstration is being made, for the batch emission episode with the highest organic HAP emissions on a mass basis, show a greater than 20 percent discrepancy between the test value and the value estimated using the applicable equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. If the criteria in this paragraph (b)(6)(i)(B) are met, then engineering assessment may be used for all batch emission episodes associated with that batch cycle for that batch unit operation. 


(C) The owner or operator has requested approval to use engineering assessment to estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode. The request to use engineering assessment to estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode shall contain sufficient information and data to demonstrate to the Administrator that engineering assessment is an accurate means of estimating emissions for that particular batch emissions episode.
