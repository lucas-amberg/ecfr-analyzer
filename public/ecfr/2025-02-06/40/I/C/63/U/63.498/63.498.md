(4) The residual organic HAP content, adjusted for the control or recovery device emission reduction, determined in accordance with § 63.496(c)(1).


(5) Each owner or operator using a control or recovery device shall keep the following records readily accessible:


(i) Continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 63.497(a) or specified by the Administrator in accordance with § 63.497(b). For flares, the records specified in § 63.508, if applicable, and table 3 to subpart G of this part shall be maintained in place of continuous records.


(ii) Records of the daily average value of each continuously monitored parameter for each operating day, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(D) through (d)(5)(ii)(F) of this section.


(A) The daily average shall be calculated as the average of all values for a monitored parameter recorded during the operating day, except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. The average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the number of hours of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous.


(B) Monitoring data recorded during periods of monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments, shall not be included in computing the hourly or daily averages. In addition, monitoring data recorded during periods of non-operation of the EPPU (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of organic HAP emissions, shall not be included in computing the hourly or daily averages. Records shall be kept of the times and durations of all such periods and any other periods of process or control device operation when monitors are not operating.


(C) The operating day shall be the period defined in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status in § 63.506(e)(5) or (8). It may be from midnight to midnight or another 24-hour period.


(D) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are below the maximum, or above the minimum, level established in the Notification of Compliance Status in § 63.506(e)(5) or in the operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were below the maximum or above the minimum level, rather than calculating and recording a daily average for that operating day.


(E) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(F) of this section, for flares, records of the times and duration of all periods during which the pilot flame is absent, shall be kept rather than daily averages. The records specified in this paragraph are not required during periods when emissions are not routed to the flare.


(F) For each affected source as described in § 63.480, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.481(n), paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(E) of this section no longer applies and instead the owner or operator of the affected source must keep the records specified in § 63.108(m) of subpart F of this part and § 63.508.


(iii) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section, hourly records of whether the flow indicator specified under § 63.497(d)(1) was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator is not operating.


(iv) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section, where a seal mechanism is used to comply with § 63.497(d)(2), hourly records of flow are not required.


(A) For compliance with § 63.497(d)(2), the owner or operator shall record whether the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done, and shall record instances when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line damper or valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.


(B) [Reserved]


(v) For each flow event from a bypass line subject to the requirements in § 63.127(d) of subpart G of this part for each affected source as described in § 63.480, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.481(n), the owner or operator must also maintain records sufficient to determine whether or not the detected flow included flow requiring control. For each flow event from a bypass line requiring control that is released either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements in this subpart, the owner or operator must include an estimate of the volume of gas, the concentration of organic HAP in the gas and the resulting emissions of organic HAP that bypassed the control device using process knowledge and engineering estimates.




(e) If the back-end process operation is subject to an organic HAP emission limitation in § 63.494(a)(4), the records specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) The applicable organic HAP emission limitation determined in accordance with § 63.494(a)(4)(i) through (iv).


(2) The organic HAP emissions from all back-end process operations for each month, along with documentation of all calculations and other information used in the engineering assessment to estimate these emissions.


(3) The mass of elastomer product produced each month.


(4) The total mass of organic HAP emitted for each 12-month period divided by the total mass of elastomer produced during the 12-month period, determined in accordance with § 63.495(g)(5).


(f) Owners and operators subject to § 63.494(a)(7), must keep the records specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section in addition to those records specified elsewhere in this section.


(1) For back-end process vents in chloroprene service, include all uncontrolled, undiluted chloroprene concentration measurements, and the calculations used to determine the total uncontrolled chloroprene mass emission rate for the sum of all vent gas streams.


(2) The owner or operator must keep records of all periods during which operating values are outside of the applicable operating limits specified in § 63.510(b)(4) through (6) when regulated material is being routed to the non-flare control device. The record must specify the operating parameter, the applicable limit, and the highest (for maximum operating limits) or lowest (for minimum operating limits) value recorded during the period.
