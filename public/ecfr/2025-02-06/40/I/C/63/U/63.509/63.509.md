# § 63.509   Procedures for determining whether process vents, storage vessels, or wastewater are in chloroprene service.

This section applies beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.481(o). To determine if process vents, storage vessels, or wastewater in a process at affected sources producing neoprene are in chloroprene service, as defined in § 63.482, owners and operators must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, as applicable.


(a) For each continuous front-end process vent, each batch front-end process vent, and each back-end process vent in a process at affected sources producing neoprene, owners and operators must measure the flow rate and concentration of chloroprene of each process vent as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Measurements must be made prior to any dilution of the vent streams.


(2) Measurements may be made on the combined vent streams at an elastomer product process unit or for each separate vent stream.


(3) The sampling site shall be after the last recovery device (if any recovery devices are present) but prior to the inlet of any control device that is present and prior to release to the atmosphere. Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, must be used for the selection of the sampling sites. For vents smaller than 0.10 meter in diameter, sample at one point at the center of the duct.


(4) The gas volumetric flow rate must be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendices A-1 and A-2 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate.


(5) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the concentration of chloroprene must be determined using Method 18 of appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 or Method 320 of appendix A to this part.


(6) You may elect to use ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020) (incorporated by reference, § 63.14) in lieu of Method 320 of appendix A to this part as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. To comply with this paragraph, Annexes Al through A8 to ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020) are mandatory; the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte using Equation A5.5 of ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020) Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique); and in order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, the %R must be 70% ≥ R ≤ 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, then the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (*i.e.,* the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the following equation:


(b) For storage vessels in a process at affected sources producing neoprene, owners and operators must determine the concentration of chloroprene of the fluid stored in the storage vessels by complying with the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.


(1) The owner or operator must measure concentration of chloroprene of the fluid stored in the storage vessel using Method 624.1 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 136 or preparation by Method SW-846-5030B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and analysis by Method SW-846-8260D (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). If owners and operators collect a sample from a pressure vessel, then the owner or operator must maintain the sample under pressure both during and following sampling.


(2) Unless specified by the Administrator, the owner or operator may calculate the concentration of chloroprene of the fluid stored in the storage vessels if information specific to the fluid stored is available. Information specific to the fluid stored includes concentration data from safety data sheets.


(c) For wastewater in a process at affected sources producing neoprene, owners and operators must measure concentration of chloroprene of the fluid stored in the storage vessel using Method 624.1 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 136, or preparation by Method SW-846-5030B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and analysis by Method SW-846-8260D (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). If owners and operators collect a sample from a pressure vessel, then the owner or operator must maintain the sample under pressure both during and following sampling.
