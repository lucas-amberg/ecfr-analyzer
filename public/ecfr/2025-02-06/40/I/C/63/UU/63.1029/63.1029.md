# § 63.1029   Pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid service; pressure relief devices in liquid service; and instrumentation systems standards.

(a) *Compliance schedule.* The owner or operator shall comply with this section no later than the compliance dates specified in the referencing subpart.


(b) *Leak detection*—(1) *Monitoring method.* Unless otherwise specified in § 63.1021(b), § 63.1036, or § 63.1037, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. Pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid service; pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid service; and instrumentation systems shall be monitored within 5 calendar days by the method specified in § 63.1023(b) and, as applicable, § 63.1023(c), if evidence of a potential leak to the atmosphere is found by visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method, unless the potential leak is repaired as required in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) *Instrument reading that defines a leak.* If an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per million or greater for agitators, 5,000 parts per million or greater for pumps handling polymerizing monomers, 2,000 parts per million or greater for pumps in food and medical service, or 2,000 parts per million or greater for all other pumps (including pumps in food/medical service), or 500 parts per million or greater for valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, and pressure relief devices is measured pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a leak is detected and shall be repaired pursuant to § 63.1024, as applicable.


(c) *Leak repair.* For equipment identified in paragraph (b) of this section that is not monitored by the method specified in § 63.1023(b) and, as applicable, § 63.1023(c), repaired shall mean that the visual, audible, olfactory, or other indications of a leak to the atmosphere have been eliminated; that no bubbles are observed at potential leak sites during a leak check using soap solution; or that the system will hold a test pressure.
