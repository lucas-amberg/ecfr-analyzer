# § 63.1564   What are my requirements for metal HAP emissions from catalytic cracking units?

(a) *What emission limitations and work practice standards must I meet?* You must: 


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, meet each emission limitation in table 1 of this subpart that applies to you. If your catalytic cracking unit is subject to the NSPS for PM in § 60.102 of this chapter or is subject to § 60.102a(b)(1) of this chapter, you must meet the emission limitations for NSPS units. If your catalytic cracking unit is not subject to the NSPS for PM, you can choose from the six options in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section:


(i) You can elect to comply with the NSPS for PM in § 60.102 of this chapter (Option 1a);


(ii) You can elect to comply with the NSPS for PM coke burn-off emission limit in § 60.102a(b)(1) of this chapter (Option 1b);


(iii) You can elect to comply with the NSPS for PM concentration limit in § 60.102a(b)(1) of this chapter (Option 1c);


(iv) You can elect to comply with the PM per coke burn-off emission limit (Option 2);


(v) You can elect to comply with the Nickel (Ni) lb/hr emission limit (Option 3); or


(vi) You can elect to comply with the Ni per coke burn-off emission limit (Option 4).


(2) Comply with each operating limit in Table 2 of this subpart that applies to you. When a specific control device may be monitored using more than one continuous parameter monitoring system, you may select the parameter with which you will comply. You must provide notice to the Administrator (or other designated authority) if you elect to change the monitoring option.


(3) Prepare an operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan according to the requirements in § 63.1574(f) and operate at all times according to the procedures in the plan. 


(4) The emission limitations and operating limits for metal HAP emissions from catalytic cracking units required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply during periods of planned maintenance preapproved by the applicable permitting authority according to the requirements in § 63.1575(j).


(5) On or before the date specified in § 63.1563(d), you must comply with one of the two options in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section during periods of startup, shutdown and hot standby:


(i) You can elect to comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, except catalytic cracking units controlled using a wet scrubber must maintain only the liquid to gas ratio operating limit (the pressure drop operating limit does not apply); or


(ii) You can elect to maintain the inlet velocity to the primary internal cyclones of the catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator at or above 20 feet per second.


(b) *How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standard?* You must: 


(1) Install, operate, and maintain a continuous monitoring system(s) according to the requirements in § 63.1572 and Table 3 of this subpart. 


(2) Conduct a performance test for each catalytic cracking unit according to the requirements in § 63.1571 and under the conditions specified in Table 4 of this subpart.


(3) Establish each site-specific operating limit in Table 2 of this subpart that applies to you according to the procedures in Table 4 of this subpart. 


(4) Use the procedures in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section to determine initial compliance with the emission limitations. 


(i) If you elect Option 1b or Option 2 in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iv) of this section, compute the PM emission rate (lb/1,000 lb of coke burn-off) for each run using Equations 1, 2, and 3 (if applicable) of this section and the site-specific opacity limit, if applicable, using Equation 4 of this section as follows:


(ii) If you elect Option 1c in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the PM concentration emission limit, determine the average PM concentration from the initial performance test used to certify your PM CEMS.


(iii) If you elect Option 3 in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, the Ni lb/hr emission limit, compute your Ni emission rate using Equation 5 of this section and your site-specific Ni operating limit (if you use a continuous opacity monitoring system) using Equations 6 and 7 of this section as follows:




(iv) If you elect Option 4 in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, the Ni per coke burn-off emission limit, compute your Ni emission rate using Equations 1 and 8 of this section and your site-specific Ni operating limit (if you use a continuous opacity monitoring system) using Equations 9 and 10 of this section as follows:


(5) Demonstrate initial compliance with each emission limitation that applies to you according to Table 5 of this subpart. 


(6) Demonstrate initial compliance with the work practice standard in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by submitting your operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan to your permitting authority as part of your Notification of Compliance Status. 


(7) Submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing the results of the initial compliance demonstration according to the requirements in § 63.1574. 


(c) *How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standards?* You must: 


(1) Demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limitation in Tables 1 and 2 of this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified in Tables 6 and 7 of this subpart. 


(2) Demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standard in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by maintaining records to document conformance with the procedures in your operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan. 


(3) If you use a continuous opacity monitoring system and elect to comply with Option 3 in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, determine continuous compliance with your site-specific Ni operating limit by using Equation 11 of this section as follows:




(4) If you use a continuous opacity monitoring system and elect to comply with Option 4 in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, determine continuous compliance with your site-specific Ni operating limit by using Equation 12 of this section as follows:




(5) If you elect to comply with the alternative limit in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section during periods of startup, shutdown and hot standby, demonstrate continuous compliance on or before the date specified in § 63.1563(d) by:


(i) Collecting the volumetric flow rate from the catalyst regenerator (in acfm) and determining the average flow rate for each hour. For events lasting less than one hour, determine the average flow rate during the event.


(ii) Determining the cumulative cross-sectional area of the primary internal cyclone inlets in square feet (ft
2) using design drawings of the primary (first-stage) internal cyclones to determine the inlet cross-sectional area of each primary internal cyclone and summing the cross-sectional areas for all primary internal cyclones in the catalyst regenerator or, if primary cyclones. If all primary internal cyclones are identical, you may alternatively determine the inlet cross-sectional area of one primary internal cyclone using design drawings and multiply that area by the total number of primary internal cyclones in the catalyst regenerator.


(iii) Calculating the inlet velocity to the primary internal cyclones in feet per second (ft/sec) by dividing the average volumetric flow rate (acfm) by the cumulative cross-sectional area of the primary internal cyclone inlets (ft
2) and by 60 seconds/minute (for unit conversion).


(iv) Maintaining the inlet velocity to the primary internal cyclones at or above 20 feet per second for each hour during the startup, shutdown, or hot standby event or, for events lasting less than 1 hour, for the duration of the event.
