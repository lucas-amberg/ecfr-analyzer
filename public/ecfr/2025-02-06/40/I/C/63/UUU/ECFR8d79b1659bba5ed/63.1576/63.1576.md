(a) You must keep the records specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. 


(1) A copy of each notification and report that you submitted to comply with this subpart, including all documentation supporting any initial notification or Notification of Compliance Status that you submitted, according to the requirements in § 63.10(b)(2)(xiv). 


(2) The records specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) Record the date, time, and duration of each startup and/or shutdown period for which the facility elected to comply with the alternative standards in § 63.1564(a)(5)(ii) or § 63.1565(a)(5)(ii) or § 63.1568(a)(4)(ii) or (iii).


(ii) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures. For each failure record the date, time and duration of each failure.


(iii) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the volume of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.


(iv) Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1570(c) and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.


(3) Records of performance tests, performance evaluations, and opacity and visible emission observations as required in § 63.10(b)(2)(viii). 


(b) For each continuous emission monitoring system and continuous opacity monitoring system, you must keep the records required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. 


(1) Records described in § 63.10(b)(2)(vi) through (xi). 


(2) Monitoring data for continuous opacity monitoring systems during a performance evaluation as required in § 63.6(h)(7)(i) and (ii). 


(3) The performance evaluation plan as described in § 63.8(d)(2) for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If the performance evaluation plan is revised, you must keep previous (*i.e.,* superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. The program of corrective action should be included in the plan required under § 63.8(d)(2).


(4) Requests for alternatives to the relative accuracy test for continuous emission monitoring systems as required in § 63.8(f)(6)(i). 


(5) Records of the date and time that each deviation started and stopped.


(c) You must keep the records in § 63.6(h) for visible emission observations. 


(d) You must keep records required by Tables 6, 7, 13, and 14 of this subpart (for catalytic cracking units); Tables 20, 21, 27 and 28 of this subpart (for catalytic reforming units); Tables 34 and 35 of this subpart (for sulfur recovery units); and Table 39 of this subpart (for bypass lines) to show continuous compliance with each emission limitation that applies to you. 


(e) You must keep a current copy of your operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan onsite and available for inspection. You also must keep records to show continuous compliance with the procedures in your operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan. 


(f) You also must keep the records of any changes that affect emission control system performance including, but not limited to, the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone for a boiler or process heater. 


(g) Your records must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review according to § 63.10(b)(1). 


(h) As specified in § 63.10(b)(1), you must keep each record for 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. 


(i) You must keep each record on site for at least 2 years after the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record, according to § 63.10(b)(1). You can keep the records offsite for the remaining 3 years.
