(c) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to research and development facilities, as defined in section 112(b)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), regardless of whether the facilities are located at the same plant site as an operation subject to the provisions of this subpart. 


(d) For cellulose ether operations, the applicability provisions in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section apply. 


(1) The applicability provisions in §§ 63.100(a) through (f) and 63.160 apply if you are complying with the equipment leak provisions of subpart H of this part.
