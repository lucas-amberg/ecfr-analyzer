# Appendix B to Subpart UUUUU of Part 63—-HCl and HF Monitoring Provisions


These monitoring provisions apply to the measurement of HCl and/or HF emissions from electric utility steam generating units, using CEMS. The CEMS must be capable of measuring HCl and/or HF in the appropriate units of the applicable emissions standard (e.g., lb/MMBtu, lb/MWh, or lb/GWh).


2.1 *Monitoring System Installation Requirements.* Install HCl and/or HF CEMS and any additional monitoring systems needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the applicable emissions limit in accordance with § 63.10010(a) and either Performance Specification 15 (PS 15) of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter for extractive Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) continuous emissions monitoring systems or Performance Specification 18 (PS 18) of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter for HCl CEMS.


2.2 *Primary and Backup Monitoring Systems.* The provisions pertaining to primary and redundant backup monitoring systems in section 2.2 of appendix A to this subpart apply to HCl and HF CEMS and any additional monitoring systems needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the applicable emissions limit.


2.3 *Monitoring System Equipment, Supplies, Definitions, and General Operation.*

The following provisions apply:


2.3.1 PS 15, Sections 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 10.0 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter; or


2.3.2 PS 18, Sections 3.0, 6.0, and 11.0 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.


The initial certification procedures for the HCl or HF CEMS used to provide data under this subpart are as follows:


3.1 If you choose to follow PS 15 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, then your HCl and/or HF CEMS must be certified according to PS 15 using the procedures for gas auditing and comparison to a reference method (RM) as specified in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 below.


3.1.1 You must conduct a gas audit of the HCl and/or HF CEMS as described in section 9.1 of Performance Specification 15, with the exceptions listed in sections 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.2 below.


3.1.1.1 The audit sample gas does not have to be obtained from the Administrator; however, it must be (1) from a secondary source of certified gases (*i.e.*, independent of any calibration gas used for the daily calibration assessments) and (2) directly traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or VSL Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL) reference materials through an unbroken chain of comparisons. If audit gas traceable to NIST or VSL reference materials is not available, you may use a gas with a concentration certified to a specified uncertainty by the gas manufacturer.


3.1.1.2 Analyze the results of the gas audit using the calculations in section 12.1 of Performance Specification 15. The calculated correction factor (CF) from Eq. 6 of Performance Specification 15 must be between 0.85 and 1.15. You do not have to test the bias for statistical significance.


3.1.2 You must perform a relative accuracy test audit or RATA according to section 11.1.1.4 of Performance Specification 15 and the requirements below. Perform the RATA of the HCl or HF CEMS at normal load. Acceptable HCl/HF reference methods (RM) are Methods 26 and 26A in appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter, Method 320 in Appendix A to this part, or ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010) “Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Compounds by Extractive Direct Interface Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), each applied based on the criteria set forth in Table 5 of this subpart.


3.1.2.1 When ASTM D6348-03 is used as the RM, the following conditions must be met:


3.1.2.1.1 The test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM D6348-03, Sections A1 through A8 are mandatory;


3.1.2.1.2 In ASTM D6348-03 Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (see Equation A5.5);


3.1.2.1.3 For the ASTM D6348-03 test data to be acceptable for a target analyte, %R must be 70% ≤R ≤130%; and 


3.1.2.1.4 The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report and all field measurements corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound using the following equation:


3.1.2.2 The relative accuracy (RA) of the HCl or HF CEMS must be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the RM test data in units of ppm on the same moisture basis. Alternatively, if the mean RM value is less than 1.0 ppm, the RA results are acceptable if the absolute value of the difference between the mean RM and CEMS values does not exceed 0.20 ppm.


3.2 If you choose to follow PS 18 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, then your HCl CEMS must be certified according to PS 18, sections 7.0, 8.0, 11.0, 12.0, and 13.0.


3.3 Any additional stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring system(s) needed to express pollutant concentrations in units of the applicable emissions limit must be certified according to part 75 of this chapter.


Whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change to a certified CEMS that may significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately measure or record pollutant or diluent gas concentrations, stack gas flow rates, or stack gas moisture content, the owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring system. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling system or the unit operation that may significantly change the concentration or flow profile, the owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring system. The same tests performed for the initial certification of the monitoring system shall be repeated for recertification, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. Examples of changes that require recertification include: Replacement of a gas analyzer; complete monitoring system replacement, and changing the location or orientation of the sampling probe.


On-going QA test requirements for HCl and HF CEMS must be implemented as follows:


5.1 If you choose to follow Performance Specification 15 (PS 15) of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, then the quality assurance/quality control procedures of PS 15 shall apply as set forth in sections 5.1.1 through 5.1.3 and 5.4.2 of this appendix.


5.1.1 On a daily basis, you must assess the calibration error of the HCl or HF CEMS using either a calibration transfer standard as specified in Performance Specification 15 Section 10.1 which references Section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol or a HCl and/or HF calibration gas at a concentration no greater than two times the level corresponding to the applicable emission limit. A calibration transfer standard is a substitute calibration compound chosen to ensure that the FTIR is performing well at the wavelength regions used for analysis of the target analytes. The measured concentration of the calibration transfer standard or HCl and/or HF calibration gas results must agree within ±5 percent of the reference gas value after correction for differences in pressure.


5.1.2 On a quarterly basis, you must conduct a gas audit of the HCl and/or HF CEMS as described in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. For the purposes of this appendix, “quarterly” means once every “QA operating quarter” (as defined in section 3.1.20 of appendix A to this subpart). You have the option to use HCl gas in lieu of HF gas for conducting this audit on an HF CEMS. To the extent practicable, perform consecutive quarterly gas audits at least 30 days apart. The initial quarterly audit is due in the first QA operating quarter following the calendar quarter in which certification testing of the CEMS is successfully completed. Up to three consecutive exemptions from the quarterly audit requirement are allowed for “non-QA operating quarters” (*i.e.,* calendar quarters in which there are less than 168 unit or stack operating hours). However, no more than four consecutive calendar quarters may elapse without performing a gas audit, except as otherwise provided in section 5.4.2.2.1 of this appendix.


5.1.3 You must perform an annual relative accuracy test audit or RATA of the HCl or HF CEMS as described in section 3.1.2 of this appendix. Perform the RATA at normal load. For the purposes of this appendix, “annual” means once every four “QA operating quarters” (as defined in section 3.1.20 of appendix A to this subpart). The first annual RATA is due within four QA operating quarters following the calendar quarter in which the initial certification testing of the HCl or HF CEMS is successfully completed. The provisions in section 5.1.2.4 of appendix A to this subpart pertaining to RATA deadline extensions also apply.


5.2 If you choose to follow Performance Specification PS 18 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, then the quality assurance/quality control procedures in Procedure 6 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter shall apply. The quarterly and annual QA tests required under Procedure 6 shall be performed, respectively, at the frequencies specified in sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 of this appendix.


5.3 Stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems must meet the applicable on-going QA test requirements of part 75 of this chapter.


5.3.1 *Out-of-Control Periods.* A HCl or HF CEMS that is used to provide data under this appendix is considered to be out-of-control, and data from the CEMS may not be reported as quality-assured, when any acceptance criteria for a required QA test is not met. The HCl or HF CEMS is also considered to be out-of-control when a required QA test is not performed on schedule or within an allotted grace period. To end an out-of-control period, the QA test that was either failed or not done on time must be performed and passed. Out-of-control periods are counted as hours of monitoring system downtime.


5.3.2 *Grace Periods.* For the purposes of this appendix, a “grace period” is defined as a specified number of unit or stack operating hours after the deadline for a required quality-assurance test of a continuous monitor has passed, in which the test may be performed and passed without loss of data.


5.3.2.1 For the flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems described in section 5.2 of this appendix, a 168 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available for quarterly linearity checks, and a 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available for RATAs, as provided, respectively, in sections 2.2.4 and 2.3.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.


5.3.2.2 For the purposes of this appendix, if the deadline for a required gas audit or RATA of a HCl or HF CEMS cannot be met due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner or operator:


5.3.2.2.1 A 168 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available in which to perform the gas audit; or


5.3.2.2.2 A 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available in which to perform the RATA.


5.3.2.3 If a required QA test is performed during a grace period, the deadline for the next test shall be determined as follows:


5.3.2.3.1 For a gas audit or RATA of the monitoring systems described in section 5.1 of this appendix, determine the deadline for the next gas audit or RATA (as applicable) in accordance with section 2.2.4(b) or 2.3.3(d) of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; treat a gas audit in the same manner as a linearity check.


5.3.2.3.2 For the gas audit of a HCl or HF CEMS, the grace period test only satisfies the audit requirement for the calendar quarter in which the test was originally due. If the calendar quarter in which the grace period audit is performed is a QA operating quarter, an additional gas audit is required for that quarter.


5.3.2.3.3 For the RATA of a HCl or HF CEMS, the next RATA is due within three QA operating quarters after the calendar quarter in which the grace period test is performed.


5.3.3 *Conditional Data Validation* For recertification and diagnostic testing of the monitoring systems that are used to provide data under this appendix, and for the required QA tests when non-redundant backup monitoring systems or temporary like-kind replacement analyzers are brought into service, the conditional data validation provisions in §§ 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter may be used to avoid or minimize data loss. The allotted window of time to complete calibration tests and RATAs shall be as specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter; the allotted window of time to complete a gas audit shall be the same as for a linearity check (*i.e.,* 168 unit or stack operating hours).


5.4 *Data Validation.*

5.4.1 *Out-of-Control Periods.* An HCl or HF CEMS that is used to provide data under this appendix is considered to be out-of-control, and data from the CEMS may not be reported as quality-assured, when any acceptance criteria for a required QA test is not met. The HCl or HF CEMS is also considered to be out-of-control when a required QA test is not performed on schedule or within an allotted grace period. To end an out-of-control period, the QA test that was either failed or not done on time must be performed and passed. Out-of-control periods are counted as hours of monitoring system downtime.


5.4.2 *Grace Periods.* For the purposes of this appendix, a “grace period” is defined as a specified number of unit or stack operating hours after the deadline for a required quality-assurance test of a continuous monitor has passed, in which the test may be performed and passed without loss of data.


5.4.2.1 For the monitoring systems described in section 5.3 of this appendix, a 168 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available for quarterly linearity checks, and a 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available for RATAs, as provided, respectively, in sections 2.2.4 and 2.3.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.


5.4.2.2 For the purposes of this appendix, if the deadline for a required gas audit/data accuracy assessment or RATA of an HCl CEMS cannot be met due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner or operator:


5.4.2.2.1 A 168 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available in which to perform the gas audit or other quarterly data accuracy assessment; or


5.4.2.2.2 A 720 unit or stack operating hour grace period is available in which to perform the RATA.


5.4.2.3 If a required QA test is performed during a grace period, the deadline for the next test shall be determined as follows:


5.4.2.3.1 For a gas audit or RATA of the monitoring systems described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this appendix, determine the deadline for the next gas audit or RATA (as applicable) in accordance with section 2.2.4(b) or 2.3.3(d) of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; treat a gas audit in the same manner as a linearity check.


5.4.2.3.2 For the gas audit or other quarterly data accuracy assessment of an HCl or HF CEMS, the grace period test only satisfies the audit requirement for the calendar quarter in which the test was originally due. If the calendar quarter in which the grace period audit is performed is a QA operating quarter, an additional gas audit/data accuracy assessment is required for that quarter.


5.4.2.3.3 For the RATA of an HCl or HF CEMS, the next RATA is due within three QA operating quarters after the calendar quarter in which the grace period test is performed.


5.4.3 *Conditional Data Validation.* For recertification and diagnostic testing of the monitoring systems that are used to provide data under this appendix, the conditional data validation provisions in § 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (ix) of this chapter may be used to avoid or minimize data loss. The allotted window of time to complete calibration tests and RATAs shall be as specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter; the allotted window of time to complete a quarterly gas audit or data accuracy assessment shall be the same as for a linearity check (*i.e.,* 168 unit or stack operating hours).


For the purposes of this appendix, the owner or operator of an affected unit shall not substitute for missing data from HCl or HF CEMS. Any process operating hour for which quality-assured HCl or HF concentration data are not obtained is counted as an hour of monitoring system downtime.


Bias adjustment of hourly emissions data from a HCl or HF CEMS is not required.


The owner or operator shall develop and implement a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program for the HCl and/or HF CEMS that are used to provide data under this subpart. At a minimum, the program shall include a written plan that describes in detail (or that refers to separate documents containing) complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for the most important QA/QC activities. Electronic storage of the QA/QC plan is permissible, provided that the information can be made available in hard copy to auditors and inspectors. The QA/QC program requirements for the other monitoring systems described in section 5.3 of this appendix are specified in section 1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.


8.1 *General Requirements for HCl and HF CEMS.*

8.1.1 *Preventive Maintenance.* Keep a written record of procedures needed to maintain the HCl and/or HF CEMS in proper operating condition and a schedule for those procedures. This shall, at a minimum, include procedures specified by the manufacturers of the equipment and, if applicable, additional or alternate procedures developed for the equipment.


8.1.2 *Recordkeeping and Reporting.* Keep a written record describing procedures that will be used to implement the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this appendix.


8.1.3 *Maintenance Records.* Keep a record of all testing, maintenance, or repair activities performed on any HCl or HF CEMS in a location and format suitable for inspection. A maintenance log may be used for this purpose. The following records should be maintained: Date, time, and description of any testing, adjustment, repair, replacement, or preventive maintenance action performed on any monitoring system and records of any corrective actions associated with a monitor outage period. Additionally, any adjustment that may significantly affect a system's ability to accurately measure emissions data must be recorded and a written explanation of the procedures used to make the adjustment(s) shall be kept.


8.2 *Specific Requirements for HCl and HF CEMS.* The following requirements are specific to HCl and HF CEMS:


8.2.1 Keep a written record of the procedures used for each type of QA test required for each HCl and HF CEMS. Explain how the results of each type of QA test are calculated and evaluated.


8.2.2 Explain how each component of the HCl and/or HF CEMS will be adjusted to provide correct responses to calibration gases after routine maintenance, repairs, or corrective actions.


9.1 Design and operate the HCl and/or HF CEMS to complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.


9.2 Reduce the HCl and/or HF concentration data to hourly averages in accordance with § 60.13(h)(2) of this chapter.


9.3 Convert each hourly average HCl or HF concentration to an HCl or HF emission rate expressed in units of the applicable emissions limit.


9.3.1 For heat input-based emission rates, select an appropriate emission rate equation from among Equations 19-1 through 19-9 in EPA Method 19 in Appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter, to calculate the HCl or HF emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Multiply the HCl concentration value (ppm) by 9.43 × 10_−8_ to convert it to lb/scf, for use in the applicable Method 19 equation. For HF, the conversion constant from ppm to lb/scf is 5.18 × 10_−8_. The appropriate diluent cap value from section 6.2.1.2 of Appendix A to this subpart may be used to calculate the HCl or HF emission rate (lb/MMBtu) during startup or shutdown hours.


9.3.2 For gross output-based emission rates, first calculate the HCl or HF mass emission rate (lb/h), using an equation that has the general form of Equation A-2 or A-3 in appendix A to this subpart (as applicable), replacing the value of K with 9.43 × 10_−8_ lb/scf-ppm (for HCl) or 5.18 × 10_−8_ (for HF) and defining C_h_ as the hourly average HCl or HF concentration in ppm. Then, divide the result by the hourly gross output (megawatts) to convert it to units of lb/MWh. If the gross output is zero during a startup or shutdown hour, use the default gross output (as defined in § 63.10042) to calculate the HCl or HF emission rate. The default gross output is not considered to be a substitute data value.


9.4 Use Equation A-5 in appendix A of this subpart to calculate the required 30-boiler operating day rolling average HCl or HF emission rates. Report each 30-boiler operating day rolling average to the same precision as the standard (*i.e.,* with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place), expressed in scientific notation. The term E_ho_ in Equation A-5 must be in the units of the applicable emissions limit.


10.1 For each HCl or HF CEMS installed at an affected source, and for any other monitoring system(s) needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the applicable emissions limit, the owner or operator must maintain a file of all measurements, data, reports, and other information required by this appendix in a form suitable for inspection, for 5 years from the date of each record, in accordance with § 63.10033. The file shall contain the information in paragraphs 10.1.1 through 10.1.8 of this section.


10.1.1 *Monitoring Plan Records.* For each affected unit or group of units monitored at a common stack, the owner or operator shall prepare and maintain a monitoring plan for the HCl and/or HF CEMS and any other monitoring system(s) (*i.e,* flow rate, diluent gas, or moisture systems) needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the applicable emission standard. The monitoring plan shall contain essential information on the continuous monitoring systems and shall explain how the data derived from these systems ensure that all HCl or HF emissions from the unit or stack are monitored and reported.


10.1.1.1 *Updates.* Whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change in a certified continuous HCl or HF monitoring system that is used to provide data under this subpart (including a change in the automated data acquisition and handling system or the flue gas handling system) which affects information reported in the monitoring plan (e.g., a change to a serial number for a component of a monitoring system), the owner or operator shall update the monitoring plan.


10.1.1.2 *Contents of the Monitoring Plan.* For HCl and/or HF CEMS, the monitoring plan shall contain the applicable electronic and hard copy information in sections 10.1.1.2.1 and 10.1.1.2.2 of this appendix. For stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems, the monitoring plan shall include the electronic and hard copy information required for those systems under § 75.53 (g) of this chapter. The electronic monitoring plan shall be evaluated using the ECMPS Client Tool.


10.1.1.2.1 *Electronic.* Record the unit or stack ID number(s); monitoring location(s); the HCl or HF monitoring methodology used (*i.e.,* CEMS); HCl or HF monitoring system information, including, but not limited to: unique system and component ID numbers; the make, model, and serial number of the monitoring equipment; the sample acquisition method; formulas used to calculate emissions; monitor span and range information (if applicable).


10.1.1.2.2 *Hard Copy.* Keep records of the following: schematics and/or blueprints showing the location of the monitoring system(s) and test ports; data flow diagrams; test protocols; monitor span and range calculations (if applicable); miscellaneous technical justifications.


10.1.2 *Operating Parameter Records.* For the purposes of this appendix, the owner or operator shall record the following information for each operating hour of each affected unit or group of units utilizing a common stack, to the extent that these data are needed to convert pollutant concentration data to the units of the emission standard. For non-operating hours, record only the items in paragraphs 10.1.2.1 and 10.1.2.2 of this section. If there is heat input to the unit(s), but no electrical load, record only the items in paragraphs 10.1.2.1, 10.1.2.2, and (if applicable) 10.1.2.4 of this section.


10.1.2.1 The date and hour;


10.1.2.2 The unit or stack operating time (rounded up to the nearest fraction of an hour (in equal increments that can range from one hundredth to one quarter of an hour, at the option of the owner or operator);


10.1.2.3 The hourly gross unit load (rounded to nearest MWge); and


10.1.2.4 If applicable, the F-factor used to calculate the heat input-based pollutant emission rate.

10.1.3.3 The pollutant concentration, for each hour in which a quality-assured value is obtained. For HCl and HF, record the data in parts per million (ppm), with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation. Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged.


10.1.3.4 A special code, indicating whether or not a quality-assured HCl or HF concentration value is obtained for the hour. This code may be entered manually when a temporary like-kind replacement HCl or HF analyzer is used for reporting; and


10.1.3.5 Monitor data availability, as a percentage of unit or stack operating hours, calculated according to § 75.32 of this chapter.


10.1.4 *Stack Gas Volumetric Flow Rate Records.*

10.1.4.1 Hourly measurements of stack gas volumetric flow rate during unit operation are required to demonstrate compliance with electrical output-based HCl or HF emissions limits (*i.e.,* lb/MWh or lb/GWh).


10.1.4.2 Use a flow rate monitor that meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter to record the required data. You must keep hourly flow rate records, as specified in § 75.57(c)(2) of this chapter.


10.1.5 *Records of Stack Gas Moisture Content.*

10.1.5.1 Correction of hourly pollutant concentration data for moisture is sometimes required when converting concentrations to the units of the applicable Hg emissions limit. In particular, these corrections are required:


10.1.5.1.1 To calculate electrical output-based pollutant emission rates, when using a CEMS that measures pollutant concentrations on a dry basis; and


10.1.5.1.2 To calculate heat input-based pollutant emission rates, when using certain equations from EPA Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter.


10.1.5.2 If hourly moisture corrections are required, either use a fuel-specific default moisture percentage for coal-fired units from § 75.11(b)(1) of this chapter, an Administrator approved default moisture value for non-coal-fired units (as per paragraph 63.10010(d) of this subpart), or a certified moisture monitoring system that meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, to record the required data. If you elect to use a moisture monitoring system, you must keep hourly records of the stack gas moisture content, as specified in § 75.57(c)(3) of this chapter.


10.1.6 *Records of Diluent Gas (CO*_2_*or O*_2_*) Concentration.*

10.1.6.1 To assess compliance with a heat input-based HCl or HF emission rate limit in units of lb/MMBtu, hourly measurements of CO_2_ or O_2_ concentration are required to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the standard.


10.1.6.2 If hourly measurements of diluent gas concentration are needed, you must use a certified CO_2_ or O_2_ monitor that meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter to record the required data. For all diluent gas monitors, you must keep hourly CO_2_ or O_2_ concentration records, as specified in § 75.57(g) of this chapter.


10.1.7 *HCl and HF Emission Rate Records.* For applicable HCl and HF emission limits in units of lb/MMBtu, lb/MWh, or lb/GWh, record the following information for each affected unit or common stack:


10.1.7.1 The date and hour;


10.1.7.2 The hourly HCl and/or HF emissions rate (lb/MMBtu, or lb/MWh, as applicable), for each hour in which valid values of HCl or HF concentration and all other required parameters (stack gas volumetric flow rate, diluent gas concentration, electrical load, and moisture data, as applicable) are obtained for the hour. Round off the emission rate to the same precision as the standard (*i.e.,* with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation). Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged;


10.1.7.3 An identification code for the formula used to derive the hourly HCl or HF emission rate from HCl or HF concentration, flow rate, electrical load, diluent gas concentration, and moisture data (as applicable); and


10.1.7.4 A code indicating that the HCl or HF emission rate was not calculated for the hour, if valid data for HCl or HF concentration and/or any of the other necessary parameters are not obtained for the hour. For the purposes of this appendix, the substitute data values required under part 75 of this chapter for diluent gas concentration, stack gas flow rate and moisture content are not considered to be valid data.


10.1.7.5 If applicable, a code to indicate that the default electrical load (as defined in § 63.10042) was used to calculate the HCl or HF emission rate.


10.1.7.6 If applicable, a code to indicate that the diluent cap (as defined in § 63.10042) was used to calculate the HCl or HF emission rate.


10.1.8 *Certification and Quality Assurance Test Records.* For the HCl and/or HF CEMS used to provide data under this subpart at each affected unit (or group of units monitored at a common stack), record the following information for all required certification, recertification, diagnostic, and quality-assurance tests:


10.1.8.1 *HCl and HF CEMS.*

10.1.8.1.1 For each required 7-day and daily calibration drift test or daily calibration error test (including daily calibration transfer standard tests) of the HCl or HF CEMS, record the test date(s) and time(s), reference gas value(s), monitor response(s), and calculated calibration drift or calibration error value(s). If you use the dynamic spiking option for the mid-level calibration drift check under PS-18, you must also record the measured concentration of the native HCl in the flue gas before and after the spike and the spiked gas dilution factor. When using an IP-CEMS under PS-18, you must also record the measured concentrations of the native HCl before and after introduction of each reference gas, the path lengths of the calibration cell and the stack optical path, the stack and calibration cell temperatures, the instrument line strength factor, and the calculated equivalent concentration of reference gas.


10.1.8.1.2 For the required gas audits of an FTIR HCl or HF CEMS that is following PS 15, record the date and time of each spiked and unspiked sample, the audit gas reference values and uncertainties. Keep records of all calculations and data analyses required under sections 9.1 and 12.1 of Performance Specification 15, and the results of those calculations and analyses.

11.1.1 Notifications, in accordance with paragraph 11.2 of this section;


11.1.2 Monitoring plan reporting, in accordance with paragraph 11.3 of this section;

11.3.1 For an EGU that begins reporting hourly HCl and/or HF concentrations with a previously-certified CEMS, submit the monitoring plan information in section 10.1.1.2 of this appendix prior to or concurrent with the first required quarterly emissions report. For a new EGU, or for an EGU switching to continuous monitoring of HCl and/or HF emissions after having implemented another allowable compliance option under this subpart, submit the information in section 10.1.1.2 of this appendix at least 21 days prior to the start of initial certification testing of the CEMS. Also submit the monitoring plan information in section 75.53(g) pertaining to any required flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems within the applicable time frame specified in this section, if the required records are not already in place.


11.3.2 Update the monitoring plan when required, as provided in paragraph 10.1.1.1 of this appendix. An electronic monitoring plan information update must be submitted either prior to or concurrent with the quarterly report for the calendar quarter in which the update is required.


11.3.3 All electronic monitoring plan submittals and updates shall be made to the Administrator using the ECMPS Client Tool. Hard copy portions of the monitoring plan shall be kept on record according to section 10.1 of this appendix.


11.4 *Certification, Recertification, and Quality-Assurance Test Reporting Requirements.* Except for daily QA tests (*i.e.,* calibrations and flow monitor interference checks), which are included in each electronic quarterly emissions report, use the ECMPS Client Tool to submit the results of all required certification, recertification, quality-assurance, and diagnostic tests of the monitoring systems required under this appendix electronically. Submit the test results either prior to or concurrent with the relevant quarterly electronic emissions report. However, for RATAs of the HCl monitor, if this is not possible, you have up to 60 days after the test completion date to submit the test results; in this case, you may claim provisional status for the emissions data affected by the test, starting from the date and hour in which the test was completed and continuing until the date and hour in which the test results are submitted. If the test is successful, the status of the data in that time period changes from provisional to quality-assured, and no further action is required. However, if the test is unsuccessful, the provisional data must be invalidated and resubmission of the affected emission report(s) is required.
