# Appendix C to Subpart UUUUU of Part 63—PM Monitoring Provisions






1.1 *Applicability.* These monitoring provisions apply to the continuous measurement of filterable PM emissions from affected EGUs under this subpart. A PM CEMS is used together with other CMS and (as applicable) parametric measurement devices to quantify PM emissions in units of the applicable standard (*i.e.,* lb/MMBtu or lb/MWh).


1.2 *Initial Certification and Recertification Procedures.* You, as the owner or operator of an affected EGU that uses a PM CEMS to demonstrate compliance with a filterable PM emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart must certify and, if applicable, recertify the CEMS according to Performance Specification 11 (PS-11) in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. Beginning on July 6, 2027, when determining if your PM CEMS meets the acceptance criteria in PS-11, the value of 0.015 lb/MMBtu is to be used in place of the applicable emission standard, or emission limit, in the calculations.






1.3 *Quality Assurance and Quality Control Requirements.* You must meet the applicable quality assurance requirements of Procedure 2 in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter. Beginning on July 6, 2027, when determining if your PM CEMS meets the acceptance criteria in Procedure 2, the value of 0.015 lb/MMBtu is to be used in place of the applicable emission standard, or emission limit, in the calculations.


1.4 *Missing Data Procedures.* You must not substitute data for missing data from the PM CEMS. Any process operating hour for which quality-assured PM concentration data are not obtained is counted as an hour of monitoring system downtime.


1.5 *Adjustments for Flow System Bias.* When the PM emission rate is reported on a gross output basis, you must not adjust the data recorded by a stack gas flow rate monitor for bias, which may otherwise be required under section 75.24 of this chapter.


2.1 *Monitoring System Installation Requirements.* Flue gases from the affected EGUs under this subpart vent to the atmosphere through a variety of exhaust configurations including single stacks, common stack configurations, and multiple stack configurations. For each of these configurations, 40 CFR 63.10010(a) specifies the appropriate location(s) at which to install CMS. These CMS installation provisions apply to the PM CEMS and to the other CMS and parametric monitoring devices that provide data for the PM emissions calculations in section 6 of this appendix.


2.2 *Primary and Backup Monitoring Systems.* In the electronic monitoring plan described in section 7 of this appendix, you must create and designate a primary monitoring system for PM and for each additional parameter (*i.e.,* stack gas flow rate, CO_2_ or O_2_ concentration, stack gas moisture content, as applicable). The primary system must be used to report hourly PM concentration values when the system is able to provide quality-assured data, *i.e.,* when the system is “in control.” However, to increase data availability in the event of a primary monitoring system outage, you may install, operate, maintain, and calibrate a redundant backup monitoring system. A redundant backup system is one that is permanently installed at the unit or stack location and is kept on “hot standby” in case the primary monitoring system is unable to provide quality-assured data. You must represent each redundant backup system as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. You must certify each redundant backup monitoring system according to the applicable provisions in section 4 of this appendix. In addition, each redundant monitoring system must meet the applicable on-going QA requirements in section 5 of this appendix.


The following definitions, equipment specifications, procedures, and performance criteria are applicable


3.1 *Definitions.* All definitions specified in section 3 of PS-11 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter and section 3 of Procedure 2 in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter are applicable to the measurement of filterable PM emissions from electric utility steam generating units under this subpart. In addition, the following definitions apply:


3.1.1 *Stack operating hour* means a clock hour during which flue gases flow through a particular stack or duct (either for the entire hour or for part of the hour) while the associated unit(s) are combusting fuel.


3.1.2 *Unit operating hour* means a clock hour during which a unit combusts any fuel, either for part of the hour or for the entire hour.


3.2 *Continuous Monitoring Methods.*

3.2.1 Installation and Measurement Location. You must install the PM CEMS according to 40 CFR 63.10010 and Section 2.4 of PS-11.


3.2.2 Units of Measure. For the purposes of this subpart, you shall report hourly PM concentrations in units of measure that correspond to your PM CEMS correlation curve (*e.g.,* mg/acm, mg/acm @ 160 °C, mg/wscm, mg/dscm).


3.2.3 Other Necessary Data Collection. To convert hourly PM concentrations to the units of the applicable emissions standard (*i.e.,* lb/MMBtu or lb/MWh), you must collect additional data as described in sections 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2 of this appendix. You must install, certify, operate, maintain, and quality-assure any stack gas flow rate, CO_2,_ O_2_, or moisture monitoring systems needed for this purpose according to sections 4 and 5 of this appendix. The calculation methods for the emission limits described in sections 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2 of this appendix are presented in section 6 of this appendix.


3.2.3.1 Heat Input-Based Emission Limits. To demonstrate compliance with a heat input-based PM emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart, you must provide the hourly stack gas CO_2_ or O_2_ concentration, along with a fuel-specific F_c_ factor or dry-basis F-factor and (if applicable) the stack gas moisture content, in order to convert measured PM concentrations values to the units of the standard.


3.2.3.2 Gross Output-Based Emission Limits. To demonstrate compliance with a gross output-based PM emission limit in Table 1 or Table 2 to this subpart, you must provide the hourly gross output in megawatts, along with data from a certified stack gas flow rate monitor and (if applicable) the stack gas moisture content, in order to convert measured PM concentrations values to units of the standard.






4.1 *Certification Requirements.* You must certify your PM CEMS and the other CMS used to determine compliance with the applicable emissions standard before the PM CEMS can be used to provide data under this subpart. However, if you have developed and are using a correlation curve, you may continue to use that curve, provided it continues to meet the acceptance criteria in PS-11 and Procedure 2 as discussed below. Redundant backup monitoring systems (if used) are subject to the same certification requirements as the primary systems.








4.1.1 PM CEMS. You must certify your PM CEMS according to PS-11 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. A PM CEMS that has been installed and certified according to PS-11 as a result of another state or federal regulatory requirement or consent decree prior to the effective date of this subpart shall be considered certified for this subpart if you can demonstrate that your PM CEMS meets the acceptance criteria in PS-11 and Procedure 2 in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter.




4.1.1.1 Beginning on July 6, 2027, when determining if your PM CEMS meets the acceptance criteria in PS-11 and Procedure 2 the value of 0.015 lb/MMBtu is to be used in place of the applicable emission standard, or emission limit, in the calculations.




4.1.2 Flow Rate, Diluent Gas, and Moisture Monitoring Systems. You must certify the continuous monitoring systems that are needed to convert PM concentrations to units of the standard or (if applicable) to convert the measured PM concentrations from wet basis to dry basis or vice-versa (*i.e.,* stack gas flow rate, diluent gas (CO_2_ or O_2_) concentration, or moisture monitoring systems), in accordance with the applicable provisions in section 75.20 of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.


4.1.3 Other Parametric Measurement Devices. Any temperature or pressure measurement devices that are used to convert hourly PM concentrations to standard conditions must be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to the manufacturers' instructions.








4.2 *Recertification.*

4.2.1 You must recertify your PM CEMS if it is either: moved to a different stack or duct; moved to a new location within the same stack or duct; modified or repaired in such a way that the existing correlation is altered or impacted; or replaced.


4.2.2 The flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems that are used to convert PM concentration to units of the emission standard are subject to the recertification provisions in section 75.20(b) of this chapter.


4.2.3 Beginning on July 6, 2027 you must use the value of 0.015 lb/MMBtu in place of the applicable emission standard, or emission limit, in the calculations when determining if your PM CEMS meets the acceptance criteria in PS-11 and Procedure 2.




4.3 *Development of a New or Revised Correlation Curve.* You must develop a new or revised correlation curve if:


4.3.1 An RCA is failed and the new or revised correlation is developed according to section 10.6 in Procedure 2 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter; or


4.3.2 The events described in paragraph (1) or (2) in section 8.8 of PS-11 occur.


5.1 *PM CEMS.*

5.1.1 Required QA Tests. Following initial certification, you must conduct periodic QA testing of each primary and (if applicable) redundant backup PM CEMS. The required QA tests and the criteria that must be met are found in Procedure 2 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter (Procedure 2). Except as otherwise provided in section 5.1.2 of this appendix, the QA tests shall be done at the frequency specified in Procedure 2.




5.1.2 RRA and RCA Test Frequencies.


5.1.2.1 The test frequency for RRAs of the PM CEMS shall be annual, *i.e.,* once every 4 calendar quarters. The RRA must either be performed within the fourth calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which the previous RRA was completed or in a grace period (see section 5.1.3, below). When a required annual RRA is done within a grace period, the deadline for the next RRA is 4 calendar quarters after the quarter in which the RRA was originally due, rather than the calendar quarter in which the grace period test is completed.


5.1.2.2 The test frequency for RCAs of the PM CEMS shall be triennial, *i.e.,* once every 12 calendar quarters. If a required RCA is not completed within 12 calendar quarters after the calendar quarter in which the previous RCA was completed, it must be performed in a grace period immediately following the twelfth calendar quarter (see section 5.1.3, below). When an RCA is done in a grace period, the deadline for the next RCA shall be 12 calendar quarters after the calendar quarter in which the RCA was originally due, rather than the calendar quarter in which the grace period test is completed.


5.1.2.3 Successive quarterly audits (*i.e.,* ACAs and, if applicable, sample volume audits (SVAs)) shall be conducted at least 60 days apart.


5.1.3 Grace Period. A grace period is available, immediately following the end of the calendar quarter in which an RRA or RCA of the PM CEMS is due. The length of the grace period shall be the lesser of 720 EGU (or stack) operating hours or 1 calendar quarter.




5.1.4 RCA and RRA Acceptability. The results of your RRA or RCA are considered acceptable provided that the criteria in section 10.4(5) of Procedure 2 in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter are met for an RCA or section 10.4(6) of Procedure 2 in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter are met for an RRA. However, beginning on July 6, 2027 a value of 0.015 lb/MMBtu is to be used in place of the applicable emission standard, or emission limit, when determining whether the RCA and RRA are acceptable.






5.1.5 Data Validation. Your PM CEMS is considered to be out-of-control, and you may not report data from it as quality-assured, when, for a required certification, recertification, or QA test, the applicable acceptance criterion (either in PS-11 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter or Procedure 2 in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter) is not met. Further, data from your PM CEMS are considered out-of-control, and may not be used for reporting, when a required QA test is not performed on schedule or within an allotted grace period. When an out-of-control period occurs, you must perform the appropriate follow-up actions. For an out-of-control period triggered by a failed QA test, you must perform and pass the same type of test in order to end the out-of-control period. For a QA test that is not performed on time, data from the PM CEMS remain out-of-control until the required test has been performed and passed. You must count all out-of-control data periods of the PM CEMS as hours of monitoring system downtime.


5.2 *Stack Gas Flow Rate, Diluent Gas, and Moisture Monitoring Systems.* The on-going QA test requirements and data validation criteria for the primary and (if applicable) redundant backup stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems are specified in appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.


5.3 *QA/QC Program Requirements.* You must develop and implement a QA/QC program for the PM CEMS and the other equipment that is used to provide data under this subpart. You may store your QA/QC plan electronically, provided that the information can be made available expeditiously in hard copy to auditors and inspectors.


5.3.1 General Requirements.

For the equipment required to convert readings from the PM CEMS to standard conditions (*e.g.,* devices to measure temperature and pressure), you must keep a written record of the calibrations and/or other procedures used to ensure that the devices provide accurate data.


5.3.5 You may store your QA/QC plan electronically, provided that you can make the information available expeditiously in hard copy to auditors or inspectors.




6.1 *Data Reduction and Validation.*

6.1.1 You must reduce the data from PM CEMS to hourly averages, in accordance with 40 CFR 60.13(h)(2) of this chapter.


6.1.2 You must reduce all CEMS data from stack gas flow rate, CO_2_, O_2_, and moisture monitoring systems to hourly averages according to 40 CFR 75.10(d)(1) of this chapter.


6.1.3 You must reduce all other data from devices used to convert readings from the PM CEMS to standard conditions to hourly averages according to 40 CFR 60.13(h)(2) or 40 CFR 75.10(d)(1) of this chapter. This includes, but is not limited to, data from devices used to measure temperature and pressure, or, for cogeneration units that calculate gross output based on steam characteristics, devices to measure steam flow rate, steam pressure, and steam temperature.


6.1.4 Do not calculate the PM emission rate for any unit or stack operating hour in which valid data are not obtained for PM concentration or for any parameter used in the PM emission rate calculations (*i.e.,* gross output, stack gas flow rate, stack temperature, stack pressure, stack gas moisture content, or diluent gas concentration, as applicable).


6.1.5 For the purposes of this appendix, part 75 substitute data values for stack gas flow rate, CO_2_ concentration, O_2_ concentration, and moisture content are not considered to be valid data.


6.1.6 Operating hours in which PM concentration is missing or invalid are hours of monitoring system downtime. The use of substitute data for PM concentration is not allowed.


6.1.7 You must exclude all data obtained during a boiler startup or shutdown operating hour (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042) from the determination of the 30-boiler operating day rolling average PM emission rates.


6.2 *Calculation of PM Emission Rates.* Unless your PM CEMS is correlated to provide PM concentrations at standard conditions, you must use the calculation methods in sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.3 of this appendix to convert measured PM concentration values to units of the emission limit (lb/MMBtu or lb/MWh, as applicable).


6.2.1 PM concentrations must be at standard conditions in order to convert them to units of the emissions limit. If your PM CEMS measures PM concentrations at standard conditions, proceed to section 6.2.2 or 6.2.3, below (as applicable). However, if your PM CEMS measures PM concentrations in units of mg/acm or mg/acm at a specified temperature (*e.g.,* 160 °C), you must first use one of the following equations to convert the hourly PM concentration values from actual to standard conditions:


or


6.2.2.2 You must use the appropriate carbon-based or dry-basis F-factor in the emission rate equation that you have selected. You may either use an F-factor from Table 19-2 of EPA test Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter or from section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter.


6.2.2.3 If the hourly average O_2_ concentration is above 14.0% O_2_ (19.0% for an IGCC) or the hourly average CO_2_ concentration is below 5.0% CO_2_ (1.0% for an IGCC), you may calculate the PM emission rate using the applicable diluent cap value (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042 and specified in 40 CFR 63.10007(f)(1)), provided that the diluent gas monitor is operating and recording quality-assured data).


6.2.2.4 If your selected EPA test Method 19 equation requires a correction for the stack gas moisture content, you may either use quality-assured hourly data from a certified part 75 moisture monitoring system, a fuel-specific default moisture value from 40 CFR 75.11(b) of this chapter, or a site-specific default moisture value approved by the Administrator under section 75.66 of this chapter.


6.2.3 Gross Output-Based PM Emission Rates. For each unit or stack operating hour, if C_std_ is measured on a wet basis, you must use Equation C-3 to calculate the gross output-based PM emission rate (if applicable). Use Equation C-4 if C_std_ is measured on a dry basis:


or


6.2.4 You must calculate the 30-boiler operating day rolling average PM emission rates according to 40 CFR 63.10021(b).


7.1 *Recordkeeping Provisions.* For the PM CEMS and the other necessary CMS and parameter measurement devices installed at each affected unit or common stack, you must maintain a file of all measurements, data, reports, and other information required by this appendix in a form suitable for inspection, for 5 years from the date of each record, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10033. The file shall contain the applicable information in sections 7.1.1 through 7.1.11 of this appendix.


7.1.1 Monitoring Plan Records. For each EGU or group of EGUs monitored at a common stack, you must prepare and maintain a monitoring plan for the PM CEMS and the other CMS(s) needed to convert PM concentrations to units of the applicable emission standard.


7.1.1.1 Updates. If you make a replacement, modification, or change in a certified CEMS that is used to provide data under this appendix (including a change in the automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS)) or if you make a change to the flue gas handling system and that replacement, modification, or change affects information reported in the monitoring plan (*e.g.,* a change to a serial number for a component of a monitoring system), you shall update the monitoring plan.


7.1.1.2 Contents of the Monitoring Plan. For the PM CEMS, your monitoring plan shall contain the applicable information in sections 7.1.1.2.1 and 7.1.1.2.2 of this appendix. For required stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems, your monitoring plan shall include the applicable information required for those systems under 40 CFR 75.53 (g) and (h) of this chapter.


7.1.1.2.1 Electronic. Your electronic monitoring plan records must include the following information: Unit or stack ID number(s); unit information (type of unit, maximum rated heat input, fuel type(s), emission controls); monitoring location(s); the monitoring methodologies used; monitoring system information, including (as applicable): Unique system and component ID numbers; the make, model, and serial number of the monitoring equipment; the sample acquisition method; formulas used to calculate emissions; operating range and load information; monitor span and range information; units of measure of your PM concentrations (see section 3.2.2); and appropriate default values. Your electronic monitoring plan shall be evaluated and submitted using the ECMPS Client Tool provided by the Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) in EPA's Office of Atmospheric Programs.


7.1.1.2.2 Hard Copy. You must keep records of the following items: Schematics and/or blueprints showing the location of the PM monitoring system(s) and test ports; data flow diagrams; test protocols; and miscellaneous technical justifications. The hard copy portion of the monitoring plan must also explain how the PM concentrations are measured and how they are converted to the units of the applicable emissions limit. The equation(s) used for the conversions must be documented. Electronic storage of the hard copy portion of the monitoring plan is permitted.


7.1.2 Operating Parameter Records. You must record the following information for each operating hour of each EGU and also for each group of EGUs utilizing a monitored common stack, to the extent that these data are needed to convert PM concentration data to the units of the emission standard. For non-operating hours, you must record only the items in sections 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2 of this appendix. If you elect to or are required to comply with a gross output-based PM standard, for any hour in which there is gross output greater than zero, you must record the items in sections 7.1.2.1 through 7.1.2.3 and (if applicable) 7.1.2.5 of this appendix; however, if there is heat input to the unit(s) but no gross output (*e.g.,* at unit startup), you must record the items in sections 7.1.2.1, 7.1.2.2, and, if applicable, section 7.1.2.5 of this appendix. If you elect to comply with a heat input-based PM standard, you must record only the items in sections 7.1.2.1, 7.1.2.2, 7.1.2.4, and, if applicable, section 7.1.2.5 of this appendix.

7.1.3.3 The hourly PM concentration, in units of measure that correspond to your PM CEMS correlation curve, for each operating hour in which a quality-assured value is obtained. Record all PM concentrations with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation. Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged.


7.1.3.4 A special code, indicating whether or not a quality-assured PM concentration is obtained for the hour; and


7.1.3.5 Monitor data availability for PM concentration, as a percentage of unit or stack operating hours calculated in the manner established for SO_2_, CO_2_, O_2_ or moisture monitoring systems according to 40 CFR 75.32 of this chapter.


7.1.4 Stack Gas Volumetric Flow Rate Records.


7.1.4.1 When a gross output-based PM emissions limit must be met, in units of lb/MWh, you must obtain hourly measurements of stack gas volumetric flow rate during EGU operation, in order to convert PM concentrations to units of the standard.


7.1.4.2 When hourly measurements of stack gas flow rate are needed, you must keep hourly records of the flow rates and related information, as specified in 40 CFR 75.57(c)(2) of this chapter.


7.1.5 Records of Diluent Gas (CO_2_ or O_2_) Concentration.

7.1.6.1.1 If you use a continuous moisture monitoring system, you must keep hourly records of the stack gas moisture content and related information, as specified in 40 CFR 75.57(c)(3) of this chapter.


7.1.6.1.2 If you use a fuel-specific default moisture value, you must represent it in the electronic monitoring plan required under section 7.1.1.2.1 of this appendix.


7.1.7 PM Emission Rate Records. For applicable PM emission limits in units of lb/MMBtu or lb/MWh, you must record the following information for each affected EGU or common stack:


7.1.7.1 The date and hour;


7.1.7.2 The hourly PM emissions rate (lb/MMBtu or lb/MWh, as applicable), calculated according to section 6.2.2 or 6.2.3 of this appendix, rounded to the same precision as the standard (*i.e.,* with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation), expressed in scientific notation. Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged. You must calculate the PM emission rate only when valid values of PM concentration and all other required parameters required to convert PM concentration to the units of the standard are obtained for the hour;


7.1.7.3 An identification code for the formula used to derive the hourly PM emission rate from measurements of the PM concentration and other necessary parameters (*i.e.,* Equation C-3 or C-4 in section 6.2.3 of this appendix or the applicable EPA test Method 19 equation);


7.1.7.4 If applicable, indicate that the diluent cap has been used to calculate the PM emission rate; and


7.1.7.5 If applicable, indicate that the default electrical load (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042) has been used to calculate the hourly PM emission rate.


7.1.7.6 Indicate that the PM emission rate was not calculated for the hour, if valid data are not obtained for PM concentration and/or any of the other parameters in the PM emission rate equation. For the purposes of this appendix, substitute data values for stack gas flow rate, CO_2_ concentration, O_2_ concentration, and moisture content reported under part 75 of this chapter are not considered to be valid data. However, when the gross output (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042) is reported for an operating hour with zero output, the default electrical load value is treated as quality-assured data.


7.1.8 Other Parametric Data. If your PM CEMS measures PM concentrations at actual conditions, you must keep records of the temperatures and pressures used in Equation C-1 or C-2 to convert the measured hourly PM concentrations to standard conditions.


7.1.9 Certification, Recertification, and Quality Assurance Test Records. For any PM CEMS used to provide data under this subpart, you must record the following certification, recertification, and quality assurance information:

For the correlation tests, you must indicate which model is used (*i.e.,* linear, logarithmic, exponential, polynomial, or power) and record the correlation equation. For the RRAs and RCAs, the reference method readings and PM CEMS responses must be reported in the same units of measure as the PM CEMS correlation;


7.1.9.6 The cycle time and sample delay time for PM CEMS that operate in batch sampling mode; and

7.1.10 For stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems, you must keep records of all certification, recertification, diagnostic, and on-going quality-assurance tests of these systems, as specified in 40 CFR 75.59(a) of this chapter.


7.1.11 For each temperature measurement device (*e.g.,* resistance temperature detector or thermocouple) and pressure measurement device used to convert measured PM concentrations to standard conditions according to Equation C-1 or C-2, you must keep records of all calibrations and other checks performed to ensure that accurate data are obtained.


7.2 *Reporting Requirements.*

7.2.1 General Reporting Provisions. You must comply with the following requirements for reporting PM emissions from each affected EGU (or group of EGUs monitored at a common stack) under this subpart:


7.2.1.1 Notifications, in accordance with section 7.2.2 of this appendix;


7.2.1.2 Monitoring plan reporting, in accordance with section 7.2.3 of this appendix;


7.2.1.3 Certification, recertification, and quality assurance test submittals, in accordance with section 7.2.4 of this appendix; and


7.2.1.4 Electronic quarterly emissions report submittals, in accordance with section 7.2.5 of this appendix.


7.2.2 Notifications. You must provide notifications for each affected unit (or group of units monitored at a common stack) under this subpart in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10030.


7.2.3 Monitoring Plan Reporting. For each affected unit (or group of units monitored at a common stack) under this subpart using PM CEMS to measure PM emissions, you must make electronic and hard copy monitoring plan submittals as follows:


7.2.3.1 For an EGU that begins reporting hourly PM concentrations on January 1, 2024, with a previously certified PM CEMS, submit the monitoring plan information in section 7.1.1.2 of this appendix prior to or concurrent with the first required quarterly emissions report. For a new EGU, or for an EGU switching to continuous monitoring of PM emissions after having implemented another allowable compliance option under this subpart, submit the information in section 7.1.1.2 of this appendix at least 21 days prior to the start of initial certification testing of the PM CEMS. Also submit the monitoring plan information in 40 CFR 75.53(g) pertaining to any required flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems within the applicable time frame specified in this section, if the required records are not already in place.


7.2.3.2 Whenever an update of the monitoring plan is required, as provided in section 7.1.1.1 of this appendix, you must submit the updated information either prior to or concurrent with the relevant quarterly electronic emissions report.


7.2.3.3 All electronic monitoring plan submittals and updates shall be made to the Administrator using the ECMPS Client Tool. Hard copy portions of the monitoring plan shall be submitted to the appropriate delegated authority.


7.2.4 Certification, Recertification, and Quality-Assurance Test Reporting. Except for daily quality assurance tests of the required monitoring systems (*i.e.,* calibration error or drift tests, sample volume checks, system optics checks, and flow monitor interference checks), you must submit the results of all required certification, recertification, and quality-assurance tests described in sections 7.1.9.1 through 7.1.9.6 and 7.1.10 of this appendix electronically (except for test results previously submitted, *e.g.,* under the Acid Rain Program), using the ECMPS Client Tool. Submit the results of the quality assurance test (*i.e.,* RCA or RRA) or, if applicable, a new PM CEMS correlation test, either prior to or concurrent with the relevant quarterly electronic emissions report. If this is not possible, you have up to 60 days after the test completion date to submit the test results; in this case, you may claim provisional status for the emissions data affected by the quality assurance test or correlation, starting from the date and hour in which the test was completed and continuing until the date and hour in which the test results are submitted. For an RRA or RCA, if the applicable audit specifications are met, the status of the emissions data in the relevant time period changes from provisional to quality-assured, and no further action is required. For a successful correlation test, apply the correlation equation retrospectively to the raw data to change the provisional status of the data to quality-assured, and resubmit the affected emissions report(s). However, if the applicable performance specifications are not met, the provisional data must be invalidated, and resubmission of the affected quarterly emission report(s) is required. For a failed RRA or RCA, you must take corrective actions and proceed according to the applicable requirements found in sections 10.5 through 10.7 of Procedure 2 until a successful quality assurance test report is submitted. If a correlation test is unsuccessful, you may not report quality-assured data from the PM CEMS until the results of a subsequent correlation test show that the specifications in section 13.0 of PS 11 are met.


7.2.5 Quarterly Reports.


7.2.5.1 For each affected EGU (or group of EGUs monitored at a common stack), the owner or operator must use the ECMPS Client Tool to submit electronic quarterly emissions reports to the Administrator, in an XML format specified by the Administrator, starting with a report for the later of:


7.2.5.1.1 The first calendar quarter of 2024; or


7.2.5.1.2 The calendar quarter in which the initial PM CEMS correlation test is completed.


7.2.5.2 You must submit the electronic reports within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, except for EGUs that have been placed in long-term cold storage (as defined in section 72.2 of this chapter).


7.2.5.3 Each of your electronic quarterly reports shall include the following information:


7.2.5.3.1 The date of report generation;


7.2.5.3.2 Facility identification information;


7.2.5.3.3 The information in sections 7.1.2 through 7.1.7 of this appendix that is applicable to your PM emission measurement methodology; and


7.2.5.3.4 The results of all daily quality assurance assessments, *i.e.,* calibration drift checks and (if applicable) sample volume checks of the PM CEMS, calibration error tests of the other continuous monitoring systems that are used to convert PM concentration to units of the standard, and (if applicable) flow monitor interference checks.


7.2.5.4 Compliance Certification. Based on a reasonable inquiry of those persons with primary responsibility for ensuring that all PM emissions from the affected unit(s) under this subpart have been correctly and fully monitored, the owner or operator must submit a compliance certification in support of each electronic quarterly emissions monitoring report. The compliance certification shall include a statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature, certifying that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the report is true, accurate, and complete.
