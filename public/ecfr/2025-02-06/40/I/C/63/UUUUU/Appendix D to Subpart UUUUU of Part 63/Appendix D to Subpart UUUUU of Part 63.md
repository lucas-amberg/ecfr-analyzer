# Appendix D to Subpart UUUUU of Part 63â€”PM CPMS Monitoring Provisions




On or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for compliance demonstrations with the applicable filterable PM emissions limits, unless it is for an IGCC unit.




1.1 *Applicability.* These monitoring provisions apply to the continuous monitoring of the output from a PM CPMS, for the purpose of assessing continuous compliance with an applicable emissions limit in Table 1 or Table 2 to this subpart.


1.2 *Summary of the Method.* The output from an instrument capable of continuously measuring PM concentration is continuously recorded, either in milliamps, PM concentration, or other units of measure. An operating limit for the PM CPMS is established initially, based on data recorded by the monitoring system during a performance stack test. The performance test is repeated annually, and the operating limit is reassessed. In-between successive performance tests, the output from the PM CPMS serves as an indicator of continuous compliance with the applicable emissions limit.




2.1 *System Design and Performance Criteria.* The PM CPMS must meet the design and performance criteria specified in 40 CFR 63.10010(h)(1)(i) through (iii) and 40 CFR 63.10023(b)(2)(iii) and (iv). In addition, an automated DAHS is required to record the output from the PM CPMS and to generate the quarterly electronic data reports required under section 3.2.4 of this appendix.


2.2 *Installation Requirements.* Install the PM CPMS at an appropriate location in the stack or duct, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10010(a).


2.3 *Determination of Operating Limits.*

2.3.1 In accordance with 40 CFR 63.10007(a)(3), 40 CFR 63.10011(b), 40 CFR 63.10023(a), and Table 6 to this subpart, you must determine an initial site-specific operating limit for your PM CPMS, using data recorded by the monitoring system during a performance stack test that demonstrates compliance with one of the following emissions limits in Table 1 or Table 2 to this subpart: Filterable PM; total non-Hg HAP metals; total HAP metals including Hg (liquid oil-fired units, only); individual non-Hg HAP metals; or individual HAP metals including Hg (liquid oil-fired units, only).


2.3.2 In accordance with 40 CFR 63.10005(d)(2)(i), you must perform the initial stack test no later than the applicable date in 40 CFR 63.9984(f), and according to 40 CFR 63.10005(d)(2)(iii) and 63.10006(a), the performance test must be repeated annually to document compliance with the emissions limit and to reassess the operating limit.


2.3.3 Calculate the operating limits according to 40 CFR 63.10023(b)(1) for existing units, and 40 CFR 63.10023(b)(2) for new units.


2.4 *Data Reduction and Compliance Assessment.*

2.4.1 Reduce the output from the PM CPMS to hourly averages, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.8(g)(2) and (5).


2.4.2 To determine continuous compliance with the operating limit, you must calculate 30-boiler operating day rolling average values of the output from the PM CPMS, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10010(h)(3) through (6), 40 CFR 63.10021(c), and Table 7 to this subpart.


2.4.3 In accordance with 40 CFR 63.10005(d)(2)(ii), 40 CFR 63.10022(a)(2), and Table 4 to this subpart, the 30-boiler operating day rolling average PM CPMS output must be maintained at or below the operating limit. However, if exceedances of the operating limit should occur, you must follow the applicable procedures in 40 CFR 63.10021(c)(1) and (2).


3.1 *Recordkeeping Provisions.* You must keep the applicable records required under 40 CFR 63.10032(b) and (c) for your PM CPMS. In addition, you must maintain a file of all measurements, data, reports, and other information required by this appendix in a form suitable for inspection, for 5 years from the date of each record, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10033.


3.1.1 Monitoring Plan Records.


3.1.1.1 You must develop and maintain a site-specific monitoring plan for your PM CPMS, in accordance with 63.10000(d).


3.1.1.2 In addition to the site-specific monitoring plan required under 40 CFR 63.10000(d), you must use the ECMPS Client Tool to prepare and maintain an electronic monitoring plan for your PM CPMS.


3.1.1.2.1 Contents of the Electronic Monitoring Plan. The electronic monitoring plan records must include the unit or stack ID number(s), monitoring location(s), the monitoring methodology used (*i.e.,* PM CPMS), the current operating limit of the PM CPMS (including the units of measure), unique system and component ID numbers, the make, model, and serial number of the PM CPMS, the analytical principle of the monitoring system, and monitor span and range information.


3.1.1.2.2 Electronic Monitoring Plan Updates. If you replace or make a change to a PM CPMS that is used to provide data under this subpart (including a change in the automated DAHS) and the replacement or change affects information reported in the electronic monitoring plan (*e.g.,* changes to the make, model and serial number when a PM CPMS is replaced), you must update the monitoring plan.


3.1.2 Operating Parameter Records. You must record the following information for each operating hour of each affected unit and for each group of units utilizing a common stack. For non-operating hours, record only the items in sections 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.2 of this appendix.
