14.2 Each RATA of your Hg, HCl, HF, or SO_2_ CEMS or each RATA of your Hg sorbent trap monitoring system; and


14.3 Each correlation test, RRA and each RCA of your PM CEMS.


15.0 You must report the applicable data elements for each test described in section 14 of this appendix in an XML format prescribed by the Administrator.


15.1 For each stack test completed during a particular calendar quarter and contained in the quarterly compliance report, you must submit along with the quarterly compliance report, the data elements in sections 17 and 18 of this appendix (which are common to all tests) and the applicable data elements in sections 19 through 31 of this appendix associated with the reference method(s) used.


15.2 For each RATA, PM CEMS correlation, RRA, or RCA, when you use the ECMPS Client Tool to report the test results as required under appendix A, B, or C to this subpart or, for SO_2_ RATAs under part 75 of this chapter, you must submit along with the test results, the data elements in sections 17 and 18 of this appendix and, for each test run, the data elements in sections 19 through 30 of this appendix that are associated with the reference method(s) used.


15.3 For each stack test, RATA, PM CEMS correlation, RRA, and RCA, you must also provide the information described in section 31 of this appendix as a PDF file, either along with the quarterly compliance report (for stack tests) or together with the test results reported under appendix A, B, or C to this subpart or part 75 of this chapter (for RATAs, RRAs, RCAs, or PM CEMS correlations).


16.0 *Applicable Reference Methods.* One or more of the following EPA reference methods is needed for the tests described in sections 14.1 through 14.3 of this appendix: Method 1, 2, 3A, 4, 5, 5D, 6C, 26, 26A, 29, and/or 30B.


16.1 Application of EPA test Methods 1 and 2. If you use periodic stack testing to comply with an *output-based* emissions limit, you must determine the stack gas flow rate during each performance test run in which EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26, 26A, 29, or 30B is used, in order to convert the measured pollutant concentration to units of the standard. For EPA test Methods 5, 5D, 26A and 29, which require isokinetic sampling, the delta-P readings made with the pitot tube and manometer at the EPA test Method 1 traverse points, taken together with measurements of stack gas temperature, pressure, diluent gas concentration (from a separate EPA test Method 3A or 3B test) and moisture, provide the necessary data for the EPA test Method 2 flow rate calculations. Note that even if you elect to comply with a *heat input-based* standard, when EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26A, or 29 is used, you must still use EPA test Method 2 to determine the average stack gas velocity (v_s_), which is needed for the percent isokinetic calculation. The EPA test Methods 26 and 30B do not require isokinetic sampling; therefore, when either of these methods is used, if the stack gas flow rate is needed to comply with the applicable *output-based* emissions limit, you must make a separate EPA test Method 2 determination during each test run.


16.2 Application of EPA test Method 3A. If you elect to perform periodic stack testing to comply with a *heat input-based* emissions limit, a separate measurement of the diluent gas (CO_2_ or O_2_) concentration is required for each test run in which EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26, 26A, 29, or 30B is used, in order to convert the measured pollutant concentration to units of the standard. The EPA test Method 3A is the preferred CO_2_ or O_2_ test method, although EPA test Method 3B may be used instead. Diluent gas measurements are also needed for stack gas molecular weight determinations when using EPA test Method 2.


16.3 Application of EPA test Method 4. For performance stack tests, depending on which equation is used to convert pollutant concentration to units of the standard, measurement of the stack gas moisture content, using EPA test Method 4, may also be required for each test run. The EPA test Method 4 moisture data are also needed for the EPA test Method 2 calculations (to determine the molecular weight of the gas) and for the RATA of an Hg CEMS that measures on a wet basis, when EPA test Method 30B is used. Other applications that require EPA test Method 4 moisture determinations include: RATAs of an SO_2_ monitor, when the reference method and CEMS data are measured on a different moisture basis (wet or dry); conversion of wet-basis pollutant concentrations to the units of a *heat input-based* emissions limit when certain EPA test Method 19 equations are used (*e.g.,* Eq. 19-3, 19-4, or 19-8); and stack gas molecular weight determinations. When EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26A, or 29 is used for the performance test, the EPA test Method 4 moisture determination may be made by using the water collected in the impingers together with data from the dry gas meter; alternatively, a separate EPA test Method 4 determination may be made. However, when EPA test Method 26 or 30B is used, EPA test Method 4 must be performed separately.


16.4 Applications of EPA test Methods 5 and 5D. The EPA test Method 5 (or, if applicable 5D) must be used for the following applications: To demonstrate compliance with a filterable PM emissions limit; for PM tests used to set operating limits for PM CPMS; and for the initial correlations, RRAs and RCAs of a PM CEMS.


16.5 Applications of EPA test Method 6C. If you elect to monitor SO_2_ emissions from your coal-fired EGU as a surrogate for HCl, the SO_2_ CEMS must be installed, certified, operated, and maintained according to 40 CFR part 75. Part 75 allows the use of EPA test Methods 6, 6A, 6B, and 6C for the required RATAs of the SO_2_ monitor. However, in practice, only instrumental EPA test Method 6C is used.


16.6 Applications of EPA test Methods 26 and 26A. The EPA test Method 26A may be used for quarterly HCl or HF stack testing, or for the RATA of an HCl or HF CEMS. The EPA test Method 26 may be used for quarterly HCl or HF stack testing; however, for the RATAs of an HCl monitor that is following PS 18 and Procedure 6 in appendices B and F to part 60 of this chapter, EPA test Method 26 may only be used if approved upon request.


16.7 Applications of EPA test Method 29. The EPA test Method 29 may be used for periodic performance stack tests to determine compliance with individual or total HAP metals emissions limits. For coal-fired EGUs, the total HAP emissions limits exclude Hg.


16.8 Applications of EPA test Method 30B. The EPA test Method 30B is used for 30- (or 90-) boiler operating day Hg LEE tests and RATAs of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems, and it may be used for quarterly Hg stack testing (oil-fired EGUs, only).


17.0 *Facility and Test Company Information.* In accordance with 40 CFR 63.7(e)(3), a test is defined as three or more runs of one or more EPA Reference Method(s) conducted to measure the amount of a specific regulated pollutant, pollutants, or surrogates being emitted from a particular EGU (or group of EGUs that share a common stack), and to satisfy requirements of this subpart. On or after January 1, 2024, you must report the data elements in sections 17 and 18, each time that you complete a required performance stack test, RATA, PM CEMS correlation, RRA, or RCA at the affected EGU(s), using EPA test Method 5, 5B, 5D, 6C, 26, 26A, 29, or 30B. You must also report the applicable data elements in sections 19 through 25 of this appendix for each test. If any separate, corresponding EPA test Method 2, 3A, or 4 test is conducted in order to convert a pollutant concentration to the units of the applicable emission standard given in Table 1 or Table 2 of this subpart or to convert pollutant concentration from wet to dry basis (or vice-versa), you must also report the applicable data elements in sections 26 through 31 of this appendix.


The applicable data elements in sections 17 through 31 of this appendix must be submitted separately, in XML format, along with the quarterly Compliance Report (for stack tests) or along with the electronic test results submitted to the ECMPS Client Tool (for CMS performance evaluations). The Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) or an equivalent schema can be utilized to create this XML file. *Note:* Ideally, for all of the tests completed at a given facility in a particular calendar quarter, the applicable data elements in sections 17 through 31 of this appendix should be submitted together in one XML file. However, as shown in Table 8 to this subpart, the timelines for submitting stack test results and CMS performance evaluations are not identical. Therefore, for calendar quarters in which both types of tests are completed, it may not be possible to submit the applicable data elements for all of those tests in a single XML file; separate submittals may be necessary to meet the applicable reporting deadlines.
