# § 63.10020   How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?

(a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and the site-specific monitoring plan required by § 63.10000(d).


(b) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times that the affected EGU is operating, except for required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities, including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments, and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan. You are required to affect monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.


(c) You may not use data recorded during EGU startup or shutdown in calculations used to report emissions, except as otherwise provided in §§ 63.10000(c)(1)(vi)(B) and 63.10005(a)(2)(iii). In addition, data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions or monitoring system out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or monitoring system out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities may not be used in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all of the quality-assured data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.


(d) Periods of monitoring system malfunctions or monitoring system out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or monitoring system out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities excluding zero and span checks must be reported as time the monitor was inoperative (downtime) under 63.10(c). Failure to collect required quality-assured data during monitoring system malfunctions, monitoring system out-of-control periods, or repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or monitoring system out-of-control periods is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.


(e) Additional requirements during startup periods or shutdown periods if you choose to rely on paragraph (2) of the definition of “startup” in § 63.10042 for your EGU (only allowed before January 2, 2025).




(1) During each period of startup, you must record for each EGU:


(i) The date and time that clean fuels being combusted for the purpose of startup begins;


(ii) The quantity and heat input of clean fuel for each hour of startup;


(iii) The gross output for each hour of startup;


(iv) The date and time that non-clean fuel combustion begins; and


(v) The date and time that clean fuels being combusted for the purpose of startup ends.


(2) During each period of shutdown, you must record for each EGU:


(i) The date and time that clean fuels being combusted for the purpose of shutdown begins;


(ii) The quantity and heat input of clean fuel for each hour of shutdown;


(iii) The gross output for each hour of shutdown;


(iv) The date and time that non-clean fuel combustion ends; and


(v) The date and time that clean fuels being combusted for the purpose of shutdown ends.


(3) For PM or non-mercury HAP metals work practice monitoring during startup periods, you must monitor and collect data according to this section and the site-specific monitoring plan required by § 63.10010(l).


(i) Except for an EGU that uses PM CEMS or PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the PM emissions limit, or that has LEE status for filterable PM or total non-Hg HAP metals for non- liquid oil-fired EGUs (or HAP metals emissions for liquid oil-fired EGUs), or individual non-mercury metals CMS (except that unless it is for an IGCC unit, on or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for compliance demonstrations with the applicable filterable PM emissions limits, and you may not purse or continue to use the LEE option for filterable PM, total non-Hg HAP metals, or individual non-Hg HAP metals), you must:




(A) Record temperature and combustion air flow or calculated flow as determined from combustion equations of post-combustion (exhaust) gas, as well as amperage of forced draft fan(s), upstream of the filterable PM control devices during each hour of startup.


(B) Record temperature and flow of exhaust gas, as well as amperage of any induced draft fan(s), downstream of the filterable PM control devices during each hour of startup.


(C) For an EGU with an electrostatic precipitator, record the number of fields in service, as well as each field's secondary voltage and secondary current during each hour of startup.


(D) For an EGU with a fabric filter, record the number of compartments in service, as well as the differential pressure across the baghouse during each hour of startup.


(E) For an EGU with a wet scrubber needed for filterable PM control, record the scrubber liquid to flue gas ratio and the pressure drop across the scrubber during each hour of startup.


(ii) [Reserved]
