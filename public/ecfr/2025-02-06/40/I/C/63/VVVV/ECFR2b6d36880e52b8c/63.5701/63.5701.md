# § 63.5701   What are my options for complying with the open molding emission limit?

You must use one or more of the options listed in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section to meet the emission limit in § 63.5698 for the resins and gel coats used in open molding operations at your facility.


(a) *Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) model point value averaging (emissions averaging) option.* (1) Demonstrate that emissions from the open molding resin and gel coat operations that you average meet the emission limit in § 63.5698 using the procedures described in § 63.5710. Compliance with this option is based on a 12-month rolling average.


(2) Those operations and materials not included in the emissions average must comply with either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.


(b) *Compliant materials option.* Demonstrate compliance by using resins and gel coats that meet the organic HAP content requirements in Table 2 to this subpart. Compliance with this option is based on a 12-month rolling average.


(c) *Add-on control option.* Use an enclosure and add-on control device, and demonstrate that the resulting emissions meet the emission limit in § 63.5698. Compliance with this option is based on control device performance testing and control device monitoring.
