# § 63.5704   What are the general requirements for complying with the open molding emission limit?

(a) *Emissions averaging option.* For those open molding operations and materials complying using the emissions averaging option, you must demonstrate compliance by performing the steps in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Use the methods specified in § 63.5758 to determine the organic HAP content of resins and gel coats.


(2) Complete the calculations described in § 63.5710 to show that the organic HAP emissions do not exceed the limit specified in § 63.5698.


(3) Keep records as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section for each resin and gel coat.


(i) Hazardous air pollutant content.


(ii) Amount of material used per month.


(iii) Application method used for production resin and tooling resin. This record is not required if all production resins and tooling resins are applied with nonatomized technology.


(iv) Calculations performed to demonstrate compliance based on MACT model point values, as described in § 63.5710.


(4) Prepare and submit the implementation plan described in § 63.5707 to the Administrator and keep it up to date.


(5) Submit semiannual compliance reports to the Administrator as specified in § 63.5764.


(b) *Compliant materials option.* For each open molding operation complying using the compliant materials option, you must demonstrate compliance by performing the steps in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Use the methods specified in § 63.5758 to determine the organic HAP content of resins and gel coats.


(2) Complete the calculations described in § 63.5713 to show that the weighted-average organic HAP content does not exceed the limit specified in Table 2 to this subpart.


(3) Keep records as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section for each resin and gel coat.


(i) Hazardous air pollutant content.


(ii) Application method for production resin and tooling resin. This record is not required if all production resins and tooling resins are applied with nonatomized technology.


(iii) Amount of material used per month. This record is not required for an operation if all materials used for that operation comply with the organic HAP content requirements.


(iv) Calculations performed, if required, to demonstrate compliance based on weighted-average organic HAP content as described in § 63.5713.


(4) Submit semiannual compliance reports to the Administrator as specified in § 63.5764.


(c) *Add-on control option.* If you are using an add-on control device, you must demonstrate compliance by performing the steps in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Conduct a performance test of the control device as specified in §§ 63.5719 and 63.5722 to demonstrate initial compliance.


(2) Use the performance test results to determine control device parameters to monitor after the performance test as specified in § 63.5725.


(3) Comply with the operating limits specified in § 63.5715 and the control device and emission capture system monitoring requirements specified in § 63.5725 to demonstrate continuous compliance.


(4) Keep the records specified in § 63.5767.


(5) Submit to the Administrator the notifications and reports specified in §§ 63.5761 and 63.5764.
