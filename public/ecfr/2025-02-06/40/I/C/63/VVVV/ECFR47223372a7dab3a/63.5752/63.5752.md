# ยง 63.5752   How do I calculate the organic HAP content of aluminum recreational boat surface coatings?

(a) Use equation 1 of this section to calculate the weighted-average HAP content for all aluminum surface coatings used in the past 12 months.


(b) Compliance is based on a 12-month rolling average. If the weighted-average organic HAP content does not exceed 1.22 kilograms of organic HAP per liter of coating solids, then you are in compliance with the emission limit specified in ยง 63.5743(a)(2).
