# ยง 63.5770   In what form and for how long must I keep my records?

(a) Your records must be readily available and in a form so they can be easily inspected and reviewed.


(b) You must keep each record for 5 years following the date that each record is generated.


(c) You must keep each record on site for at least 2 years after the date that each record is generated. You can keep the records offsite for the remaining 3 years.


(d) You can keep the records on paper or an alternative media, such as microfilm, computer, computer disks, magnetic tapes, or on microfiche.


(e) Any records required to be maintained by this part that are submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.
