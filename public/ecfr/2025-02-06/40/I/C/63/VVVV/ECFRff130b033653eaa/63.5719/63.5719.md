# ยง 63.5719   How do I conduct a performance test?

(a) You must capture the emissions using a permanent enclosure (such as a spray booth or similar containment device) and direct the captured emissions to the add-on control device.


(b) You must measure emissions as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.


(1) If the enclosure vented to the control device is a permanent total enclosure as defined in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51, then you may measure emissions only at the outlet of the control device.


(2) If the permanent enclosure vented to the control device is not a total enclosure, you must build a temporary total enclosure, as defined in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51, around the permanent enclosure. You must then simultaneously measure emissions from the control device outlet and the emissions from the temporary total enclosure outlet. You determine compliance from the combined emissions from the control device outlet and the temporary total enclosure outlet.


(c) You must conduct the control device performance test using the emission measurement methods specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Use either Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select the sampling sites.


(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.


(3) Use Method 18 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to measure organic HAP emissions or use Method 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to measure total gaseous organic emissions as a surrogate for total organic HAP emissions. If you use Method 25A, you must assume that all gaseous organic emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions. If you use Method 18 and the number of organic HAP in the exhaust stream exceeds five, you must take into account the use of multiple chromatographic columns and analytical techniques to get an accurate measure of at least 90 percent of the total organic HAP mass emissions. Do not use Method 18 to measure organic HAP emissions from a combustion device; use instead Method 25A and assume that all gaseous organic mass emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions.


(4) You may use American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6420-99 (available for purchase from at least one of the following addresses: 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959; or University Microfilms International, 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.) in lieu of Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, under the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) If the target compound(s) is listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 and the target concentration is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 parts per million by volume.


(ii) If the target compound(s) is not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, but is potentially detected by mass spectrometry, an additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in Section 10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99, must be followed, met, documented, and submitted with the performance test report even if you do not use a moisture condenser or the compound is not considered soluble.


(iii) If a minimum of one sample/analysis cycle is completed at least every 15 minutes.


(d) The control device performance test must consist of three runs and each run must last at least 1 hour. The production conditions during the test runs must represent normal production conditions with respect to the types of parts being made and material application methods. The production conditions during the test must also represent maximum potential emissions with respect to the organic HAP content of the materials being applied and the material application rates.


(e) During the test, you must also monitor and record separately the amounts of production resin, tooling resin, pigmented gel coat, clear gel coat, and tooling gel coat applied inside the enclosure that is vented to the control device.
