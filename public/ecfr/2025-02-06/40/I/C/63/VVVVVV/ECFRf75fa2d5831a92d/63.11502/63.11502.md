*Affirmative defense* means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.


*Ancillary activities* means boilers, incinerators, and process heaters not used to comply with the emission standards in §§ 63.11495 through 63.11500, chillers and other refrigeration systems, and other equipment and activities that are not directly involved (i.e., they operate within a closed system and materials are not combined with process fluids) in the processing of raw materials or the manufacturing of a product or intermediates used in the production of the product.


*Batch process vent* means a vent from a CMPU or vents from multiple CMPUs within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Batch process vents include vents from batch operations and vents with intermittent flow from continuous operations that are not combined with any stream that originated as a continuous gas stream from the same continuousprocess. Examples of batch process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. The following are not batch process vents for the purposes of this subpart:


(1) Continuous process vents;


(2) Bottoms receivers;


(3) Surge control vessels;


(4) Gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s);


(5) A gas stream routed to other processes for reaction or other use in another process (i.e., for chemical value as a product, isolated intermediate, byproduct, or coproduct, or for heat value).


(6) Vents on storage tanks or wastewater systems;


(7) Drums, pails, and totes; and


(8) Emission streams from emission episodes that are undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP are not part of any batch process vent. The HAP concentration may be determined using any of the following: process knowledge, an engineering assessment, or test data.

If the dryer, extruder, die plate, or solid-state reactor is followed by an operation that is designed and operated to remove HAP solvent or residual monomer from the solid, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in the process. If the dried solid is diluted or mixed with a HAP-based solvent, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in the process.

*In organic HAP service* means that a process vessel or piece of equipment either contains or contacts a feedstock, byproduct, or product that contains an organic HAP, excluding any organic HAP used in manual cleaning activities.

The period of startup ends upon completion of the transient, non-equilibrium step at the time operating conditions reach steady state for operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, composition, feed rate, and production rate. Periods of startup described by SOP manuals at the affected source may be used to determine the period of startup.
