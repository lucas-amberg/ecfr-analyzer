The provisions of this subpart apply to all existing, new, and reconstructed manufacturers of basic liquid epoxy resins (BLR) and manufacturers of wet strength resins (WSR) that are located at a plant site that is a major source, as defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act. Research and development facilities, as defined in ยง 63.522, are exempt from the provisions of this subpart. The affected source is also defined in ยง 63.522. If a change occurs to an existing source that does not constitute reconstruction then the additions have to meet the existing source requirements of the MACT standards. Any reconstruction of an existing source, or construction of a new source, must meet the new source standard. Affected sources are also subject to certain requirements of subpart A of this part, as specified in Table 1 of this subpart.
