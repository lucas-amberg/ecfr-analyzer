Sources using add-on controls may also use continuous emissions monitors to demonstrate continuous compliance as an alternative to control parameter monitoring.


(2) Compliance with organic HAP emissions limits is demonstrated by maintaining an organic HAP emissions factor value less than or equal to the appropriate organic HAP emissions limit listed in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart, on a 12-month rolling average, and/or by including in each compliance report a statement that individual resins and gel coats, as applied, meet the appropriate organic HAP emissions limits, as discussed in § 63.5895(d).


(3) Compliance with organic HAP content limits in Table 7 to this subpart is demonstrated by maintaining an average organic HAP content value less than or equal to the appropriate organic HAP contents listed in Table 7 to this subpart, on a 12-month rolling average, and/or by including in each compliance report a statement that resins and gel coats individually meet the appropriate organic HAP content limits in Table 7 to this subpart, as discussed in § 63.5895(d).


(4) Compliance with the work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart is demonstrated by performing the work practice required for your operation.


(b) You must report each deviation from each standard in § 63.5805 that applies to you. The deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.5910.
