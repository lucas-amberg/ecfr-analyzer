# § 63.5910   What reports must I submit and when?

(a) You must submit each report in Table 14 to this subpart that applies to you.


(b) Unless the Administrator has approved a different schedule for submission of reports under § 63.10(a), you must submit each report by the date specified in Table 14 to this subpart and according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) The first compliance report must cover the period beginning on the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.5800 and ending on June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the first calendar half after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.5800.


(2) The first compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date follows the end of the first calendar half after the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.5800.


(3) Each subsequent compliance report must cover the semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31.


(4) Each subsequent compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.


(5) For each affected source that is subject to permitting requirements pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 71, and if the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to § 70.6 (a)(3)(iii)(A) or § 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of according to the dates in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(c) The compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section:


(1) Company name and address.


(2) Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the content of the report.


(3) Date of the report and beginning and ending dates of the reporting period.


(4) [Reserved]


(5) If there are no deviations from any organic HAP emissions limitations (emissions limit and operating limit) that apply to you, and there are no deviations from the requirements for work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart, a statement that there were no deviations from the organic HAP emissions limitations or work practice standards during the reporting period.


(6) If there were no periods during which the continuous monitoring system (CMS), including a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) and an operating parameter monitoring system were out of control, as specified in § 63.8(c)(7), a statement that there were no periods during which the CMS was out of control during the reporting period.


(d) For each deviation from an organic HAP emissions limitation or operating limit and for each deviation from the requirements for work practice standards that occurs at an affected source where you are not using a CMS to comply with the organic HAP emissions limitations or work practice standards in this subpart, the compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section and in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) The total operating time of each affected source during the reporting period.


(2) Information on the number, duration, and cause of deviations (including unknown cause, if applicable), as applicable, and the corrective action taken.


(e) For each deviation from an organic HAP emissions limitation (*i.e.,* emissions limit and operating limit) occurring at an affected source where you are using a CMS to comply with the organic HAP emissions limitation in this subpart, you must include the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section and in paragraphs (e)(1) through (6) of this section.


(1) The date and time that each malfunction started and stopped.


(2) The date and time that each CMS was inoperative, except for zero (low-level) and high-level checks.


(3) The date, time, and duration that each CMS was out of control, including the information in § 63.8(c)(8).


(4) The date and time that each deviation started and stopped.


(5) A summary of the total duration of the deviation during the reporting period and the total duration as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period.


(6) A breakdown of the total duration of the deviations during the reporting period into those that are due to control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes.


(f) You must report if you have exceeded the 100 tpy organic HAP emissions threshold if that exceedance would make your facility subject to § 63.5805(a)(1) or (d). Include with this report any request for an exemption under § 63.5805(e). If you receive an exemption under § 63.5805(e) and subsequently exceed the 100 tpy organic HAP emissions threshold, you must report this exceedance as required in § 63.5805(f).


(g) Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 71 must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by § 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or § 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a compliance report pursuant to Table 14 to this subpart along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by § 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or § 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the compliance report includes all required information concerning deviations from any organic HAP emissions limitation (including any operating limit) or work practice requirement in this subpart, submission of the compliance report shall be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.


(h) Submit compliance reports based on the requirements in §§ 63.5910 and 63.5912 and table 14 to this subpart, and not based on the requirements in § 63.999.


(i) Where multiple compliance options are available, you must state in your next compliance report if you have changed compliance options since your last compliance report.
