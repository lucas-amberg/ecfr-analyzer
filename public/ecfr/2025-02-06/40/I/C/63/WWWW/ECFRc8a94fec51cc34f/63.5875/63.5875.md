# ยง 63.5875   How do I determine the capture efficiency of the enclosure on my wet-out area and the capture efficiency of my oven(s) for continuous lamination/casting operations?

(a) The capture efficiency of a wet-out area enclosure is assumed to be 100 percent if it meets the design and operation requirements for a permanent total enclosure (PTE) specified in EPA Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51. If a PTE does not exist, then a temporary total enclosure must be constructed and verified using EPA Method 204, and capture efficiency testing must be determined using EPA Methods 204B through E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51. 


(b) The capture efficiency of an oven is to be considered 100 percent, provided the oven is operated under negative pressure.
