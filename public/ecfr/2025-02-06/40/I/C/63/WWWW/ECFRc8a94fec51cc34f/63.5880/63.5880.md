# ยง 63.5880   How do I determine how much neat resin plus is applied to the line and how much neat gel coat plus is applied to the line for continuous lamination/casting operations?

Use the following procedures to determine how much neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus is applied to the line each year. 


(a) Track formula usage by end product/thickness combinations. 


(b) Use in-house records to show usage. This may be either from automated systems or manual records. 


(c) Record daily the usage of each formula/end product combination on each line. This is to be recorded at the end of each run (*i.e.,* when a changeover in formula or product is made) and at the end of each shift. 


(d) Sum the amounts from the daily records to calculate annual usage of each formula/end product combination by line.
