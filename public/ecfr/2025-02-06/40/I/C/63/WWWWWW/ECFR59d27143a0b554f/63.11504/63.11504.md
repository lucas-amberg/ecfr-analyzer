(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a plating and polishing facility that is an area source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions and meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) A plating and polishing facility is a plant site that is engaged in one or more of the processes listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section.


(i) Electroplating other than chromium electroplating (i.e., non-chromium electroplating).

(iii) Other non-electrolytic metal coating processes, such as chromate conversion coating, nickel acetate sealing, sodium dichromate sealing, and manganese phosphate coating; and thermal spraying.


(iv) Dry mechanical polishing of finished metals and formed products after plating or thermal spraying.


(v) Electroforming.


(vi) Electropolishing.


(2) A plating or polishing facility is an area source of HAP emissions, where an area source is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that does not have the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (10 tons per year (tpy)) or more and any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more.


(3) Your plating and polishing facility uses or has emissions of compounds of one or more plating and polishing metal HAP, which means any compound of any of the following metals: cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel, as defined in § 63.11511, “What definitions apply to this subpart?” With the exception of lead, plating and polishing metal HAP also include any of these metals in the elemental form.
