# § 63.1084   What heat exchange systems are exempt from the requirements of this subpart?

Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, your heat exchange system is exempt from the requirements in §§ 63.1085 and 63.1086 if it meets any one of the criteria in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.


(a) Your heat exchange system operates with the minimum pressure on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the process side.


(b) Your heat exchange system contains an intervening cooling fluid, containing less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening fluid must serve to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid and must not be sent through a cooling tower or discharged. For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for maintenance purposes.


(c) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with an allowable discharge limit of 1 part per million by volume (ppmv) or less above influent concentration, or 10 percent or less above influent concentration, whichever is greater.


(d) Your once-through heat exchange system is subject to a NPDES permit that meets all of the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) The permit requires monitoring of a parameter or condition to detect a leak of process fluids to cooling water.


(2) The permit specifies the normal range of the parameter or condition.


(3) The permit requires monthly or more frequent monitoring for the parameters selected as leak indicators.


(4) The permit requires you to report and correct leaks to the cooling water when the parameter or condition exceeds the normal range.


(e) Your recirculating or once-through heat exchange system cools process fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart.


(f) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), your heat exchange system is no longer exempt from the requirements in §§ 63.1085 and 63.1086 if it meets the criteria in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section; instead, your heat exchange system is exempt from the requirements in §§ 63.1085 and 63.1086 if it meets any one of the criteria in paragraph (a), (b), or (e) of this section.
