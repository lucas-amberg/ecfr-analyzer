# ยง 63.1092   What are the major differences between the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, and the waste requirements for ethylene production sources?

The major differences between the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, and the requirements for ethylene production sources are listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. 


(a) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to all ethylene production sources that are part of a major source. The requirements do not include a provision to exempt sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) from control requirements. 


(b) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to continuous butadiene waste streams which do not contain benzene quantities that would make them subject to the management and treatment requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF. 


(c) The requirements for ethylene production sources do not include the compliance options at 40 CFR 61.342(c)(3)(ii), (d) and (e) for sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 Mg/yr. 


(d) If you transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements in ยง 63.1096 rather than 40 CFR 61.342(f).
