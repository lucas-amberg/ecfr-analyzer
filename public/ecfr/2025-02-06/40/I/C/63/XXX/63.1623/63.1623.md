# § 63.1623   What are the emissions standards for new, reconstructed and existing facilities?

(a) *Electric arc furnaces*. You must install, operate and maintain an effective capture system that collects the emissions from each electric arc furnace operation and conveys the collected emissions to a control device for the removal of the pollutants specified in the emissions standards specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) *Particulate matter emissions*. (i) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing particulate matter in excess of 4.0 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm) into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace.


(ii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing particulate matter in excess of 25 mg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace.


(2) *Mercury emissions*. (i) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 13 micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (µg/dscm) into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace when producing ferromanganese.


(ii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 130 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace when producing ferromanganese.


(iii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 4 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace when producing silicomanganese.


(iv) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 12 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace when producing silicomanganese.


(3) *Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions*. (i) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in excess of 12,000 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace when producing ferromanganese.


(ii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in excess of 12,000 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace when producing ferromanganese.


(iii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in excess of 72 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace when producing silicomanganese.


(iv) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in excess of 130 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace when producing silicomanganese.


(4) *Hydrochloric acid emissions*. (i) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing hydrochloric acid emissions in excess of 180 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace.


(ii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing hydrochloric acid emissions in excess of 1,100 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace.


(5) *Formaldehyde emissions*. You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing formaldehyde emissions in excess of 201 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any new, reconstructed or existing electric arc furnace.


(b) *Process fugitive emissions*. (1) You must install, operate and maintain a capture system that is designed to collect 95 percent or more of the emissions from process fugitive emissions sources and convey the collected emissions to a control device that is demonstrated to meet the applicable emission limit specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (c) of this section.


(2) The determination of the overall capture must be demonstrated as required by § 63.1624(a).


(3) Unless you meet the criteria of paragragh (b)(3)(iii) of this section, you must not cause the emissions exiting from a shop building to exceed an average of 8 percent opacity over a furnace or MOR process cycle.


(i) This 8 percent opacity requirement is determined by averaging the individual opacity readings observed during the furnace or MOR process cycle.


(ii) An individual opacity reading shall be determined as the average of 24 consecutive images recorded at 15-second intervals with the opacity values from each individual digital image rounded to the nearest 5 percent.


(iii) If the average opacity from the shop building is greater than 8 percent opacity during an observed furnace or MOR process cycle, the opacity of two more additional furnace or MOR process cycles must be observed within 7 days and the average of the individual opacity readings during the three observation periods must be less than 8 percent opacity.


(iv) At no time during operation may the average of any two consecutive individual opacity readings be greater than 20 percent opacity.


(c) *Local ventilation emissions.* If you operate local ventilation to capture tapping, casting, or ladle treatment emissions and direct them to a control device other than one associated with the electric arc furnace, you must not discharge into the atmosphere any captured emissions containing particulate matter in excess of 4.0 mg/dscm.


(d) *MOR process.* You must not discharge into the atmosphere from any new, reconstructed or existing MOR process exhaust gases containing particulate matter in excess of 3.9 mg/dscm.


(e) *Crushing and screening equipment.* You must not discharge into the atmosphere from any new, reconstructed, or existing piece of equipment associated with crushing and screening exhaust gases containing particulate matter in excess of 13 mg/dscm.


(f) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records and inspection of the source.
