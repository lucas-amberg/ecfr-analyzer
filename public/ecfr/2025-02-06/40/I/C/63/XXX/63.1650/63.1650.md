(1) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input of 22 MW or less when producing ferromanganese.


(2) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input greater than 22 MW when producing ferromanganese.


(3) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input greater than 25 MW when producing silicomanganese.


(4) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input of 25 MW or less when producing silicomanganese.


(5) Semi-sealed submerged arc furnaces when producing ferromanganese.


(6) Metal oxygen refining (MOR) process.


(7) Crushing and screening operations.


(8) Fugitive dust sources.


(c) A new affected source is one for which construction or reconstruction commenced after August 4, 1998.


(d) Table 1 to this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to owners and operators of ferroalloy production facilities subject to this subpart.


(e) *Compliance dates.* (1) [Reserved]


(2) Each owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source that commences construction or reconstruction after August 4, 1998 and before November 23, 2011, must comply with the requirements of this subpart by May 20, 1999 or upon startup of operations, whichever is later.
