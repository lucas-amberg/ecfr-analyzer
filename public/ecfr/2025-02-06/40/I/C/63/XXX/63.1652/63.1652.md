# § 63.1652   Emission standards.

(a) *New and reconstructed submerged arc furnaces.* No owner or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed submerged arc furnace exhaust gases (including primary and tapping) containing particulate matter in excess of one of the following:


(1) 0.23 kilograms per hour per megawatt (kg/hr/MW) (0.51 pounds per hour per megawatt [lb/hr/MW]), or


(2) 35 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm) (0.015 grains per dry standard cubic foot [gr/dscf]).


(b) *Existing open submerged arc furnaces.* No owner or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing open submerged arc furnace exhaust gases (including primary and tapping) containing particulate matter in excess of one of the following:


(1) 9.8 kilograms per hour (kg/hr) (21.7 pounds per hour (lb/hr)) when producing ferromanganese in an open furnace operating at a furnace power input of 22 MW or less; or


(2) 13.5 kg/hr (29.8 lb/hr) when producing ferromanganese in an open furnace operating at a furnace power input greater than 22 MW; or


(3) 16.3 kg/hr (35.9 lb/hr) when producing silicomanganese in an open furnace operating at a furnace power input greater than 25 MW; or


(4) 12.3 kg/hr (27.2 lb/hr) when producing silicomanganese in an open furnace operating at a furnace power input of 25 MW or less. 


(c) *Existing semi-sealed submerged arc furnaces.* No owner or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing semi-sealed submerged arc furnace exhaust gases (including primary, tapping, and vent stacks) containing particulate matter in excess of 11.2 kg/hr (24.7 lb/hr) when producing ferromanganese.


(d) *MOR process.* No owner or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any new, reconstructed, or existing MOR process exhaust gases containing particulate matter in excess of 69 mg/dscm (0.03 gr/dscf).


(e) *Crushing and screening equipment*—(1) *New and reconstructed equipment.* No owner or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed piece of equipment associated with crushing and screening exhaust gases containing particulate matter in excess of 50 mg/dscm (0.022 gr/dscf).


(2) *Existing equipment.* No owner or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing piece of equipment associated with crushing and screening exhaust gases containing particulate matter in excess of 69 (mg/dscm) (0.03 gr/dscf).


(f) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records and inspection of the source.
