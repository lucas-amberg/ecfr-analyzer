# ยง 63.5985   What are my alternatives for meeting the emission limits for tire production affected sources?

You must use one of the compliance alternatives in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section to meet either of the emission limits in ยง 63.5984. 


(a) *Purchase alternative.* Use only cements and solvents that, as purchased, contain no more HAP than allowed by the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, option 1 (HAP constituent option). 


(b) *Monthly average alternative, without using an add-on control device.* Use cements and solvents in such a way that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, option 1 or option 2. 


(c) *Monthly average alternative, using an add-on control device.* Use a control device to reduce HAP emissions so that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, option 1 or option 2.
