# ยง 63.5989   What are my alternatives for meeting the emission limitations for puncture sealant application affected sources?

You must use one of the compliance alternatives in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to meet the emission limitations in ยง 63.5988. 


(a) *Overall control efficiency alternative.* Use an emissions capture system and control device and demonstrate that the application booth emissions meet the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 1a or 1b, and the control device and capture system meet the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart. 


(b) *Permanent total enclosure and control device efficiency alternative.* Use a permanent total enclosure that satisfies the Method 204 criteria in 40 CFR part 51, appendix M. Demonstrate that the control device meets the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 1a or 1b. You must also show that the control device and capture system meet the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart. 


(c) *Monthly average alternative, without using an add-on control device.* Use puncture sealants in such a way that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2. 


(d) *Monthly average alternative, using an add-on control device.* Use a control device to reduce HAP emissions so that monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2.
