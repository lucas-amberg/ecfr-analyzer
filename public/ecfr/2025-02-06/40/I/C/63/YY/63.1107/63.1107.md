# § 63.1107   Equipment leaks.

(a) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in organic HAP service is presumed to be in organic HAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in organic HAP service, it must be determined that the percent organic HAP content can be reasonably expected not to exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment for the ethylene production affected sources, the following methods shall be used for equipment: For equipment in gas and vapor service, as that term is defined in Subpart UU of this part, shall use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; for equipment in liquid service, as that term is defined in Subpart UU of this part, shall use a combination of Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, SW-846-8260B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14); and SW-846-8270D (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), as appropriate.


(b) An owner or operator may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section to determine that the percent organic HAP content does not exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.


(c) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in organic HAP service, the determination can be revised after following the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in organic HAP service.


(d) Samples used in determining the percent organic HAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.


(e) *Requirements for pressure relief devices.* For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator of an acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected source or polycarbonate production affected source must also comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.


(1) *Operating requirements.* Except during a pressure release event, operate each pressure relief device in organic HAP gas or vapor service with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A.


(2) *Pressure release requirements.* For pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service, the owner or operator must comply with either paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section following a pressure release, as applicable.


(i) If the pressure relief device does not consist of or include a rupture disk, conduct instrument monitoring, as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure relief device returns to organic HAP service following a pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, except as provided in § 63.171 or § 63.1024(d), as applicable.


(ii) If the pressure relief device consists of or includes a rupture disk, install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release, except as provided in § 63.171 or § 63.1024(d), as applicable.


(3) *Pressure release management.* Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, emissions of organic HAP to the atmosphere from pressure relief devices in organic HAP service are prohibited, and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.


(i) The owner or operator must equip each pressure relief device in organic HAP service with a device(s) or parameter monitoring system that is capable of:

(v) Balanced bellows pressure relief devices where the primary release valve is routed through a closed vent system to a control device or back into the process, a fuel gas system, or drain system.


(6) *Root cause analysis and corrective action analysis.* A root cause analysis and corrective action analysis must be completed as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days after a release event. Special circumstances affecting the number of root cause analyses and/or corrective action analyses are provided in paragraphs (h)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.




(i) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single emergency event that causes two or more pressure relief devices that are installed on the same equipment to release.


(ii) Prior to June 3, 2024, you may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single emergency event that causes two or more pressure relief devices to release, regardless of the equipment served, if the root cause is reasonably expected to be a *force majeure* event, as defined in § 63.1103(e)(2).


(iii) Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, if more than one pressure relief device has a release during the same time period, an initial root cause analysis must be conducted separately for each pressure relief device that had a release. If the initial root cause analysis indicates that the release events have the same root cause(s), the initial separate root cause analyses may be recorded as a single root cause analysis and a single corrective action analysis may be conducted.


(7) *Corrective action implementation.* Each owner or operator required to conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action analysis as specified in paragraphs (h)(3)(iii) and (6) of this section, must implement the corrective action(s) identified in the corrective action analysis in accordance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (h)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) All corrective action(s) must be implemented within 45 days of the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required or as soon thereafter as practicable. If an owner or operator concludes that no corrective action should be implemented, the owner or operator must record and explain the basis for that conclusion no later than 45 days following the event.


(ii) For corrective actions that cannot be fully implemented within 45 days following the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required, the owner or operator must develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable.


(iii) No later than 45 days following the event for which a root cause and corrective action analyses were required, the owner or operator must record the corrective action(s) completed to date, and, for action(s) not already completed, a schedule for implementation, including proposed commencement and completion dates.


(8) *Flowing pilot-operated pressure relief devices.* For ethylene production affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before October 9, 2019, owners or operators are prohibited from installing a flowing pilot-operated pressure relief device or replacing any pressure relief device with a flowing pilot-operated pressure relief device after July 6, 2023. For ethylene production affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after October 9, 2019, owners or operators are prohibited from installing and operating flowing pilot-operated pressure relief devices. For purpose of compliance with this paragraph, a flowing pilot-operated pressure relief device means the type of pilot-operated pressure relief device where the pilot discharge vent continuously releases emissions to the atmosphere when the pressure relief device is actuated.
