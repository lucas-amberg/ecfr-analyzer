# ยง 63.6095   When do I have to comply with this subpart?

(a) *Affected sources.* (1) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix oil-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame oil-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart on or before March 5, 2004, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than March 5, 2004.


(2) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix oil-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame oil-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart after March 5, 2004, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.


(3) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart on or before March 9, 2022, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than March 9, 2022.


(4) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart after March 9, 2022, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.


(b) *Area sources that become major sources.* If your new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP, it must be in compliance with any applicable requirements of this subpart when it becomes a major source. 


(c) You must meet the notification requirements in ยง 63.6145 according to the schedule in ยง 63.6145 and in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.
