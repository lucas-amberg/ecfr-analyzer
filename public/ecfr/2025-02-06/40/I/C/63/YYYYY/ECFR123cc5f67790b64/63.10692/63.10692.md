# § 63.10692   What definitions apply to this subpart?

Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in § 63.2, and in this section as follows:


*Argon-oxygen decarburization (AOD) vessel* means any closed-bottom, refractory-lined converter vessel with submerged tuyeres through which gaseous mixtures containing argon and oxygen or nitrogen may be blown into molten steel for further refining.


*Capture system* means the equipment (including ducts, hoods, fans, dampers, etc.) used to capture or transport emissions generated by an electric arc furnace or argon-oxygen decarburization vessel to the air pollution control device.


*Chlorinated plastics* means solid polymeric materials that contain chlorine in the polymer chain, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and PVC copolymers.


*Control device* means the air pollution control equipment used to remove particulate matter from the effluent gas stream generated by an electric arc furnace or argon-oxygen decarburization vessel.


*Deviation* means any instance where an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:


(1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or work practice standard;


(2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or


(3) Fails to meet any emissions limitation in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.


*Electric arc furnace (EAF)* means a furnace that produces molten steel and heats the charge materials with electric arcs from carbon electrodes. An electric arc furnace consists of the furnace shell, roof, and the transformer.


*Electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking facility* means a steel plant that produces carbon, alloy, or specialty steels using an EAF. This definition excludes EAF steelmaking facilities at steel foundries and EAF facilities used to produce nonferrous metals.


*Free organic liquids* means material that fails the paint filter test by EPA Method 9095B, (revision 2, dated November 1994) (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) after accounting for water using a moisture determination test by ASTM Method D2216-05 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14). If, after conducting a moisture determination test, if any portion of the material passes through and drops from the filter within the 5-minute test period, the material contains *free organic liquids.*

*Leaded steel* means steel that must meet a minimum specification for lead content (typically 0.25 percent or more) and for which lead is a necessary alloy for that grade of steel.


*Mercury switch* means each mercury-containing capsule or switch assembly that is part of a convenience light switch mechanism installed in a vehicle.


*Motor vehicle* means an automotive vehicle not operated on rails and usually operated with rubber tires for use on highways.


*Motor vehicle scrap* means vehicle or automobile bodies, including automobile body hulks, that have been processed through a shredder. *Motor vehicle scrap* does not include automobile manufacturing bundles, or miscellaneous vehicle parts, such as wheels, bumpers or other components that do not contain mercury switches.


*Nonferrous metals* means any pure metal other than iron or any metal alloy for which an element other than iron is its major constituent by percent in weight.


*Scrap provider* means the person (including a broker) who contracts directly with a steel mill to provide scrap that contains motor vehicle scrap. Scrap processors such as shredder operators or vehicle dismantlers that do not sell scrap directly to a steel mill are not *scrap providers.*

*Specialty steel* means low carbon and high alloy steel other than stainless steel that is processed in an argon-oxygen decarburization vessel.


*Stainless steel* means low carbon steel that contains at least 10.5 percent chromium.
