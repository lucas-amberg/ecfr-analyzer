# ยง 63.6600   What emission limitations and operating limitations must I meet if I own or operate a stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions?

Compliance with the numerical emission limitations established in this subpart is based on the results of testing the average of three 1-hour runs using the testing requirements and procedures in ยง 63.6620 and Table 4 to this subpart.


(a) If you own or operate an existing, new, or reconstructed spark ignition 4SRB stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the emission limitations in Table 1a to this subpart and the operating limitations in Table 1b to this subpart which apply to you.


(b) If you own or operate a new or reconstructed 2SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at major source of HAP emissions, a new or reconstructed 4SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at major source of HAP emissions, or a new or reconstructed CI stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the emission limitations in Table 2a to this subpart and the operating limitations in Table 2b to this subpart which apply to you.


(c) If you own or operate any of the following stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you do not need to comply with the emission limitations in Tables 1a, 2a, 2c, and 2d to this subpart or operating limitations in Tables 1b and 2b to this subpart: an existing 2SLB stationary RICE; an existing 4SLB stationary RICE; a stationary RICE that combusts landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis; an emergency stationary RICE; or a limited use stationary RICE.


(d) If you own or operate an existing non-emergency stationary CI RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the emission limitations in Table 2c to this subpart and the operating limitations in Table 2b to this subpart which apply to you.
