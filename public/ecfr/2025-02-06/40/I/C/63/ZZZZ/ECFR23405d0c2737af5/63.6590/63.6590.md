# § 63.6590   What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

This subpart applies to each affected source.


(a) *Affected source.* An affected source is any existing, new, or reconstructed stationary RICE located at a major or area source of HAP emissions, excluding stationary RICE being tested at a stationary RICE test cell/stand.


(1) *Existing stationary RICE.*

(i) For stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake horsepower (HP) located at a major source of HAP emissions, a stationary RICE is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the stationary RICE before December 19, 2002.


(ii) For stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, a stationary RICE is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the stationary RICE before June 12, 2006.


(iii) For stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions, a stationary RICE is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the stationary RICE before June 12, 2006.


(iv) A change in ownership of an existing stationary RICE does not make that stationary RICE a new or reconstructed stationary RICE.


(2) *New stationary RICE.* (i) A stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions is new if you commenced construction of the stationary RICE on or after December 19, 2002.


(ii) A stationary RICE with a site rating of equal to or less than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions is new if you commenced construction of the stationary RICE on or after June 12, 2006.


(iii) A stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions is new if you commenced construction of the stationary RICE on or after June 12, 2006.


(3) *Reconstructed stationary RICE.* (i) A stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions is reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2 and reconstruction is commenced on or after December 19, 2002.


(ii) A stationary RICE with a site rating of equal to or less than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions is reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2 and reconstruction is commenced on or after June 12, 2006.


(iii) A stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions is reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2 and reconstruction is commenced on or after June 12, 2006.


(b) *Stationary RICE subject to limited requirements.* (1) An affected source which meets either of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (ii) of this section does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part except for the initial notification requirements of § 63.6645(f).


(i) The stationary RICE is a new or reconstructed emergency stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.








(ii) The stationary RICE is a new or reconstructed limited use stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.


(2) A new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions which combusts landfill or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis must meet the initial notification requirements of § 63.6645(f) and the requirements of §§ 63.6625(c), 63.6650(g), and 63.6655(c). These stationary RICE do not have to meet the emission limitations and operating limitations of this subpart.


(3) The following stationary RICE do not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part, including initial notification requirements:


(i) Existing spark ignition 2 stroke lean burn (2SLB) stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;


(ii) Existing spark ignition 4 stroke lean burn (4SLB) stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;


(iii) Existing emergency stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.








(iv) Existing limited use stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;


(v) Existing stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions that combusts landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis;


(c) *Stationary RICE subject to Regulations under 40 CFR Part 60.* An affected source that meets any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section must meet the requirements of this part by meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 60 subpart IIII, for compression ignition engines or 40 CFR part 60 subpart JJJJ, for spark ignition engines. No further requirements apply for such engines under this part.


(1) A new or reconstructed stationary RICE located at an area source;


(2) A new or reconstructed 2SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;


(3) A new or reconstructed 4SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of less than 250 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;


(4) A new or reconstructed spark ignition 4 stroke rich burn (4SRB) stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;


(5) A new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions which combusts landfill or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis;


(6) A new or reconstructed emergency or limited use stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;


(7) A new or reconstructed compression ignition (CI) stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.
