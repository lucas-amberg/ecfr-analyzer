# ยง 63.6595   When do I have to comply with this subpart?

(a) *Affected sources.* (1) If you have an existing stationary RICE, excluding existing non-emergency CI stationary RICE, with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations, operating limitations and other requirements no later than June 15, 2007. If you have an existing non-emergency CI stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, an existing stationary CI RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, or an existing stationary CI RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations, operating limitations, and other requirements no later than May 3, 2013. If you have an existing stationary SI RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, or an existing stationary SI RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations, operating limitations, and other requirements no later than October 19, 2013.


(2) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions before August 16, 2004, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than August 16, 2004.


(3) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions after August 16, 2004, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.


(4) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions before January 18, 2008, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than January 18, 2008.


(5) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions after January 18, 2008, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.


(6) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions before January 18, 2008, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than January 18, 2008.


(7) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions after January 18, 2008, you must comply with the applicable emission limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.


(b) *Area sources that become major sources.* If you have an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP, the compliance dates in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section apply to you.


(1) Any stationary RICE for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the date when your area source becomes a major source of HAP must be in compliance with this subpart upon startup of your affected source.


(2) Any stationary RICE for which construction or reconstruction is commenced before your area source becomes a major source of HAP must be in compliance with the provisions of this subpart that are applicable to RICE located at major sources within 3 years after your area source becomes a major source of HAP.


(c) If you own or operate an affected source, you must meet the applicable notification requirements in ยง 63.6645 and in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.
