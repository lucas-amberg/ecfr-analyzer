# ยง 63.6635   How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?

(a) If you must comply with emission and operating limitations, you must monitor and collect data according to this section.


(b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, required performance evaluations, and required quality assurance or control activities, you must monitor continuously at all times that the stationary RICE is operating. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.


(c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels. You must, however, use all the valid data collected during all other periods.
