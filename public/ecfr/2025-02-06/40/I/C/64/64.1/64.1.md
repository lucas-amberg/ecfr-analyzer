# § 64.1   Definitions.

The following definitions apply to this part. Except as specifically provided in this section, terms used in this part retain the meaning accorded them under the applicable provisions of the Act.


*Act* means the Clean Air Act, as amended by Pub. L. 101-549, 42 U.S.C. 7401, *et seq.*

*Applicable requirement* shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70 of this chapter.


*Capture system* means the equipment (including but not limited to hoods, ducts, fans, and booths) used to contain, capture and transport a pollutant to a control device.


*Continuous compliance determination method* means a method, specified by the applicable standard or an applicable permit condition, which:


(1) Is used to determine compliance with an emission limitation or standard on a continuous basis, consistent with the averaging period established for the emission limitation or standard; and


(2) Provides data either in units of the standard or correlated directly with the compliance limit.


*Control device* means equipment, other than inherent process equipment, that is used to destroy or remove air pollutant(s) prior to discharge to the atmosphere. The types of equipment that may commonly be used as control devices include, but are not limited to, fabric filters, mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, inertial separators, afterburners, thermal or catalytic incinerators, adsorption devices (such as carbon beds), condensers, scrubbers (such as wet collection and gas absorption devices), selective catalytic or non-catalytic reduction systems, flue gas recirculation systems, spray dryers, spray towers, mist eliminators, acid plants, sulfur recovery plants, injection systems (such as water, steam, ammonia, sorbent or limestone injection), and combustion devices independent of the particular process being conducted at an emissions unit (e.g., the destruction of emissions achieved by venting process emission streams to flares, boilers or process heaters). For purposes of this part, a control device does not include passive control measures that act to prevent pollutants from forming, such as the use of seals, lids, or roofs to prevent the release of pollutants, use of low-polluting fuel or feedstocks, or the use of combustion or other process design features or characteristics. If an applicable requirement establishes that particular equipment which otherwise meets this definition of a control device does not constitute a control device as applied to a particular pollutant-specific emissions unit, then that definition shall be binding for purposes of this part.


*Data* means the results of any type of monitoring or method, including the results of instrumental or non-instrumental monitoring, emission calculations, manual sampling procedures, recordkeeping procedures, or any other form of information collection procedure used in connection with any type of monitoring or method.


*Emission limitation or standard* means any applicable requirement that constitutes an emission limitation, emission standard, standard of performance or means of emission limitation as defined under the Act. An emission limitation or standard may be expressed in terms of the pollutant, expressed either as a specific quantity, rate or concentration of emissions (e.g., pounds of SO_2_ per hour, pounds of SO_2_ per million British thermal units of fuel input, kilograms of VOC per liter of applied coating solids, or parts per million by volume of SO_2_) or as the relationship of uncontrolled to controlled emissions (e.g., percentage capture and destruction efficiency of VOC or percentage reduction of SO_2_). An emission limitation or standard may also be expressed either as a work practice, process or control device parameter, or other form of specific design, equipment, operational, or operation and maintenance requirement. For purposes of this part, an emission limitation or standard shall not include general operation requirements that an owner or operator may be required to meet, such as requirements to obtain a permit, to operate and maintain sources in accordance with good air pollution control practices, to develop and maintain a malfunction abatement plan, to keep records, submit reports, or conduct monitoring.


*Emissions unit* shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70 of this chapter.


*Exceedance* shall mean a condition that is detected by monitoring that provides data in terms of an emission limitation or standard and that indicates that emissions (or opacity) are greater than the applicable emission limitation or standard (or less than the applicable standard in the case of a percent reduction requirement) consistent with any averaging period specified for averaging the results of the monitoring.


*Excursion* shall mean a departure from an indicator range established for monitoring under this part, consistent with any averaging period specified for averaging the results of the monitoring.


*Inherent process equipment* means equipment that is necessary for the proper or safe functioning of the process, or material recovery equipment that the owner or operator documents is installed and operated primarily for purposes other than compliance with air pollution regulations. Equipment that must be operated at an efficiency higher than that achieved during normal process operations in order to comply with the applicable emission limitation or standard is not inherent process equipment. For the purposes of this part, inherent process equipment is not considered a control device.


*Major source* shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70 or 71 of this chapter.


*Monitoring* means any form of collecting data on a routine basis to determine or otherwise assess compliance with emission limitations or standards. Recordkeeping may be considered monitoring where such records are used to determine or assess compliance with an emission limitation or standard (such as records of raw material content and usage, or records documenting compliance with work practice requirements). The conduct of compliance method tests, such as the procedures in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, on a routine periodic basis may be considered monitoring (or as a supplement to other monitoring), provided that requirements to conduct such tests on a one-time basis or at such times as a regulatory authority may require on a non-regular basis are not considered monitoring requirements for purposes of this paragraph. Monitoring may include one or more than one of the following data collection techniques, where appropriate for a particular circumstance:


(1) Continuous emission or opacity monitoring systems.


(2) Continuous process, capture system, control device or other relevant parameter monitoring systems or procedures, including a predictive emission monitoring system.


(3) Emission estimation and calculation procedures (e.g., mass balance or stoichiometric calculations).


(4) Maintenance and analysis of records of fuel or raw materials usage.


(5) Recording results of a program or protocol to conduct specific operation and maintenance procedures.


(6) Verification of emissions, process parameters, capture system parameters, or control device parameters using portable or in situ measurement devices.


(7) Visible emission observations.


(8) Any other form of measuring, recording, or verifying on a routine basis emissions, process parameters, capture system parameters, control device parameters or other factors relevant to assessing compliance with emission limitations or standards.


*Owner or operator* means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises a stationary source subject to this part.


*Part 70 or 71 permit* shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, provided that it shall also refer to a permit issued, renewed, amended, revised, or modified under any federal permit program promulgated under title V of the Act.


*Part 70 or 71 permit application* shall mean an application (including any supplement to a previously submitted application) that is submitted by the owner or operator in order to obtain a part 70 or 71 permit.


*Permitting authority* shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70 or 71 of this chapter.


*Pollutant-specific emissions unit* means an emissions unit considered separately with respect to each regulated air pollutant.


*Potential to emit* shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, provided that it shall be applied with respect to an “emissions unit” as defined under this part in addition to a “stationary source” as provided under part 70 or 71 of this chapter.


*Predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS)* means a system that uses process and other parameters as inputs to a computer program or other data reduction system to produce values in terms of the applicable emission limitation or standard.


*Regulated air pollutant* shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70 or 71 of this chapter.
