# § 64.4   Submittal requirements.

(a) The owner or operator shall submit to the permitting authority monitoring that satisfies the design requirements in § 64.3. The submission shall include the following information:


(1) The indicators to be monitored to satisfy §§ 64.3(a)(1)-(2);


(2) The ranges or designated conditions for such indicators, or the process by which such indicator ranges or designated conditions shall be established;


(3) The performance criteria for the monitoring to satisfy § 64.3(b); and


(4) If applicable, the indicator ranges and performance criteria for a CEMS, COMS or PEMS pursuant to § 64.3(d).


(b) As part of the information submitted, the owner or operator shall submit a justification for the proposed elements of the monitoring. If the performance specifications proposed to satisfy § 64.3(b)(2) or (3) include differences from manufacturer recommendations, the owner or operator shall explain the reasons for the differences between the requirements proposed by the owner or operator and the manufacturer's recommendations or requirements. The owner or operator also shall submit any data supporting the justification, and may refer to generally available sources of information used to support the justification (such as generally available air pollution engineering manuals, or EPA or permitting authority publications on appropriate monitoring for various types of control devices or capture systems). To justify the appropriateness of the monitoring elements proposed, the owner or operator may rely in part on existing applicable requirements that establish the monitoring for the applicable pollutant-specific emissions unit or a similar unit. If an owner or operator relies on presumptively acceptable monitoring, no further justification for the appropriateness of that monitoring should be necessary other than an explanation of the applicability of such monitoring to the unit in question, unless data or information is brought forward to rebut the assumption. Presumptively acceptable monitoring includes:


(1) Presumptively acceptable or required monitoring approaches, established by the permitting authority in a rule that constitutes part of the applicable implementation plan required pursuant to title I of the Act, that are designed to achieve compliance with this part for particular pollutant-specific emissions units;


(2) Continuous emission, opacity or predictive emission monitoring systems that satisfy applicable monitoring requirements and performance specifications as specified in § 64.3(d);


(3) Excepted or alternative monitoring methods allowed or approved pursuant to part 75 of this chapter;


(4) Monitoring included for standards exempt from this part pursuant to § 64.2(b)(1)(i) or (vi) to the extent such monitoring is applicable to the performance of the control device (and associated capture system) for the pollutant-specific emissions unit; and


(5) Presumptively acceptable monitoring identified in guidance by EPA. Such guidance will address the requirements under §§ 64.4(a), (b), and (c) to the extent practicable.


(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit control device (and process and capture system, if applicable) operating parameter data obtained during the conduct of the applicable compliance or performance test conducted under conditions specified by the applicable rule. If the applicable rule does not specify testing conditions or only partially specifies test conditions, the performance test generally shall be conducted under conditions representative of maximum emissions potential under anticipated operating conditions at the pollutant-specific emissions unit. Such data may be supplemented, if desired, by engineering assessments and manufacturer's recommendations to justify the indicator ranges (or, if applicable, the procedures for establishing such indicator ranges). Emission testing is not required to be conducted over the entire indicator range or range of potential emissions.


(2) The owner or operator must document that no changes to the pollutant-specific emissions unit, including the control device and capture system, have taken place that could result in a significant change in the control system performance or the selected ranges or designated conditions for the indicators to be monitored since the performance or compliance tests were conducted.


(d) If existing data from unit-specific compliance or performance testing specified in paragraph (c) of this section are not available, the owner or operator:


(1) Shall submit a test plan and schedule for obtaining such data in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; or


(2) May submit indicator ranges (or procedures for establishing indicator ranges) that rely on engineering assessments and other data, provided that the owner or operator demonstrates that factors specific to the type of monitoring, control device, or pollutant-specific emissions unit make compliance or performance testing unnecessary to establish indicator ranges at levels that satisfy the criteria in § 64.3(a).


(e) If the monitoring submitted by the owner or operator requires installation, testing, or other necessary activities prior to use of the monitoring for purposes of this part, the owner or operator shall include an implementation plan and schedule for installing, testing and performing any other appropriate activities prior to use of the monitoring. The implementation plan and schedule shall provide for use of the monitoring as expeditiously as practicable after approval of the monitoring in the part 70 or 71 permit pursuant to § 64.6, but in no case shall the schedule for completing installation and beginning operation of the monitoring exceed 180 days after approval of the permit.


(f) If a control device is common to more than one pollutant-specific emissions unit, the owner or operator may submit monitoring for the control device and identify the pollutant-specific emissions units affected and any process or associated capture device conditions that must be maintained or monitored in accordance with § 64.3(a) rather than submit separate monitoring for each pollutant-specific emissions unit.


(g) If a single pollutant-specific emissions unit is controlled by more than one control device similar in design and operation, the owner or operator may submit monitoring that applies to all the control devices and identify the control devices affected and any process or associated capture device conditions that must be maintained or monitored in accordance with § 64.3(a) rather than submit a separate description of monitoring for each control device.
