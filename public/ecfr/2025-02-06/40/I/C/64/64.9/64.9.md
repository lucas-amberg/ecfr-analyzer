# § 64.9   Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(a) *General reporting requirements.* (1) On and after the date specified in § 64.7(a) by which the owner or operator must use monitoring that meets the requirements of this part, the owner or operator shall submit monitoring reports to the permitting authority in accordance with § 70.6(a)(3)(iii) of this chapter.


(2) A report for monitoring under this part shall include, at a minimum, the information required under § 70.6(a)(3)(iii) of this chapter and the following information, as applicable:


(i) Summary information on the number, duration and cause (including unknown cause, if applicable) of excursions or exceedances, as applicable, and the corrective actions taken;


(ii) Summary information on the number, duration and cause (including unknown cause, if applicable) for monitor downtime incidents (other than downtime associated with zero and span or other daily calibration checks, if applicable); and


(iii) A description of the actions taken to implement a QIP during the reporting period as specified in § 64.8. Upon completion of a QIP, the owner or operator shall include in the next summary report documentation that the implementation of the plan has been completed and reduced the likelihood of similar levels of excursions or exceedances occurring.


(b) *General recordkeeping requirements.* (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 70.6(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter. The owner or operator shall maintain records of monitoring data, monitor performance data, corrective actions taken, any written quality improvement plan required pursuant to § 64.8 and any activities undertaken to implement a quality improvement plan, and other supporting information required to be maintained under this part (such as data used to document the adequacy of monitoring, or records of monitoring maintenance or corrective actions).


(2) Instead of paper records, the owner or operator may maintain records on alternative media, such as microfilm, computer files, magnetic tape disks, or microfiche, provided that the use of such alternative media allows for expeditious inspection and review, and does not conflict with other applicable recordkeeping requirements.
