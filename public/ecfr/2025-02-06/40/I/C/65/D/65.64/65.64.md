# § 65.64   Group determination procedures.

(a) *General.* The provisions of this section provide calculation and measurement methods for parameters that are used to determine group status. 


(b)(1) *Sampling site.* For purposes of determining TOC or HAP concentration, process vent volumetric flow rate, heating value, or TRE index value as specified under paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (h) of this section, the sampling site shall be located after the last recovery device (if any recovery devices are present) but prior to the inlet of any control device that is present, and prior to release to the atmosphere. 


(2) *Sampling site when a halogen reduction device is used prior to a combustion device.* An owner or operator using a scrubber or other halogen reduction device to reduce the process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilogram per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to a combustion control device in compliance with § 65.63(b)(2) shall determine the halogen atom mass emission rate prior to the combustor and after the scrubber or other halogen reduction device according to the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section. 


(3) *Sampling site selection method.* Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site. No traverse site selection method is needed for process vents smaller than 0.10 meter (4 inches) in nominal inside diameter. 


(c) *TOC or HAP concentration.* The TOC or HAP concentrations used for TRE index value calculations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be determined based on paragraph (c)(1) or (i) of this section, or any other method or data that have been validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. For concentrations needed for comparison with the appropriate concentration in table 1 of this subpart, TOC or HAP concentration shall be determined based on paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2), or (i) of this section or any other method or data that have been validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. The owner or operator shall record the TOC or HAP concentration as specified in § 65.66(c). 


(1) *Method 18.* The procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration using Method 18 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. 


(i) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run. 


(ii) The concentration of either TOC (minus methane and ethane) or organic HAP emissions shall be calculated using the following two procedures, as applicable. 


(A) The TOC concentration (C_TOC_) is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for each run using Equation 64-1 of this section: 


(B) The total organic HAP concentration (C_HAP_) shall be computed according to the equation in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section except that only the organic HAP species shall be summed. 


(2) *Method 25A.* The following procedures shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration using Method 25A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60: 


(i) Method 25A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used only if a single organic compound of regulated material is greater than 50 percent of total organic HAP or TOC, by volume, in the process vent. 


(ii) The process vent composition may be determined by either process knowledge, test data collected using an appropriate EPA method, or a method or data validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current process vent conditions.

(v) Use of Method 25A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale. 


(vi) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the concentration of TOC including methane and ethane measured by Method 25A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 is below one-half the appropriate value in table 1 to this subpart to be considered a Group 2B vent with an organic HAP or TOC concentration below the appropriate value in table 1 to this subpart. 


(d) *Volumetric flow rate.* The process vent volumetric flow rate (Q_S_) in standard cubic meters per minute at 20 °C (68 °F) shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section and shall be recorded as specified in § 65.66(b): 


(1) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate. If the process vent tested passes through a final steam jet ejector and is not condensed, the stream volumetric flow shall be corrected to 2.3 percent moisture; or 


(2) The engineering assessment procedures in paragraph (i) of this section can be used for determining volumetric flow rates. 


(e) *Heating value.* The net heating value shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section or by using the engineering assessment procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. 


(1) The net heating value of the process vent shall be calculated using Equation 64-2 of this section:

(g) *Halogenated vent determination.* In order to determine whether a process vent is halogenated, the mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in organic compounds shall be calculated according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. A process vent is considered halogenated if the mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in the organic compounds is equal to or greater than 0.45 kilogram per hour (0.99 pound per hour). 


(1) The process vent concentration of each organic compound containing halogen atoms (parts per million by volume, by compound) shall be determined based on one of the following procedures: 


(i) Process knowledge that no halogen or hydrogen halides are present in the process vent; or 


(ii) Applicable engineering assessment as discussed in paragraph (i)(3) of this section; or

Select the lowest TRE index value. 


(ii) *TRE calculations: Part 63 regulated sources.* Use the equation and parameters in table 3 to this subpart and calculate the TRE index value using equations 34, 35, and 36 for process vents at existing sources; or equations 38, 39, and 40 for process vents at new sources. Select the lowest TRE index value.

Engineering assessments shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (i)(1) through (4) of this section. If process vent flow rate or process vent organic HAP or TOC concentration is being determined for comparison with the 0.011 scmm (0.40 standard cubic foot) flow rate or the applicable concentration value in table 1 to this subpart, engineering assessment may be used to determine the flow rate or concentration for the representative operating condition expected to yield the highest flow rate or concentration.

(2) If the TRE index value calculated using such engineering assessment and the TRE index value equation in paragraph (h) of this section is less than or equal to 4.0, then the owner or operator is required either to perform the measurements specified in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section for group determination or to consider the process vent a Group 1 process vent and comply with the requirement (or standard) specified in § 65.63(a) and, if applicable, § 65.63(b). 


(3) Engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the examples specified in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
