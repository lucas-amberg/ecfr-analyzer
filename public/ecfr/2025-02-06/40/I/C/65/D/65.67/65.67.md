(b) *Process change.* (1) Whenever a process change, as described in § 65.63(f), is made that causes a Group 2A or 2B process vent to become a Group 1 process vent or a Group 2B process vent to become a Group 2A process vent, the owner or operator shall either submit a report within 60 days after the performance test or group determination or submit a report included as part of the next periodic report. The report shall include the following information: 


(i) A description of the process change; 


(ii) The results of the recalculation of the flow rate, organic HAP or TOC concentration, and/or TRE index value required under § 65.63(f) and recorded under § 65.66(d); and 


(iii) A statement that the owner or operator will comply with the provisions of § 65.63 by the schedules specified in § 65.63(f)(4) through (6). 


(2) For process vents that become Group 1 process vents after a process change requiring a performance test to be conducted for the control device being used as specified in subpart G of this part, the owner or operator shall specify that the performance test has become necessary due to a process change. This specification shall be made in the notification to the Administrator of the intent to conduct a performance test as provided in § 65.164(b)(1). 


(3) Whenever a process change as described in § 65.63(f) is made that changes the group status of a process vent from Group 1 to Group 2A, or from Group 1 to Group 2B, or from Group 2A to Group 2B, the owner or operator shall include a statement in the next periodic report after the process change that a process change has been made and the new group status of the process vents. 


(4) The owner or operator is not required to submit a report of a process change if one of the following conditions is met: 


(i) The change does not meet the definition of a process change in § 65.63(f); or 


(ii) For a Group 2B process vent, the vent stream flow rate is recalculated according to § 65.63(f) and the recalculated value is less than 0.011 standard cubic meter per minute (0.40 standard cubic foot per minute); or 


(iii) For a Group 2B process vent, the organic HAP or TOC concentration of the vent stream is recalculated according to § 65.63(f), and the recalculated value is less than the applicable value in table 1 to this subpart; or 


(iv) For a Group 2B process vent, the TRE index value is recalculated according to § 65.63(f) and the recalculated value is greater than 4.0. 


(c) *Parameters for Group 2A without a recovery device.* An owner or operator of a Group 2A process vent maintaining a TRE index value greater than 1.0 without using a recovery device shall report the information specified in the approved plan under § 65.63(d).
