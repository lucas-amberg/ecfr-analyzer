(a) The provisions of this subpart and of subpart A of this part apply to control of regulated material emissions from transfer racks where a referencing subpart references the use of this subpart for such emissions control. 


(b) If a physical or process change is made that causes a transfer rack to fall outside the criteria in the referencing subpart that required the transfer rack to control emission of regulated material, the owner or operator may elect to comply with the provisions for transfer racks not subject to control contained in the referencing subpart instead of the provisions of this subpart.
