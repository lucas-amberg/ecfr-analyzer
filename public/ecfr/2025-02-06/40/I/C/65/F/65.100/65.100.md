(d) *Lines and equipment not containing process fluids.* Lines and equipment not containing process fluids are not subject to the provisions of this subpart. Utilities and other nonprocess lines, such as heating and cooling systems that do not combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not considered to be part of a process unit.
