# § 65.102   Alternative means of emission limitation.

(a) *Performance standard exemption.* The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to the performance standards of § 65.111(b) for pressure relief devices or § 65.112(f) for compressors operating under the alternative compressor standard. 


(b) *Requests by owners or operators.* An owner or operator may request a determination of alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of §§ 65.106 through 65.115 as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If the Administrator makes a determination that a means of emission limitation is a permissible alternative, the owner or operator shall either comply with the alternative or comply with the requirements of §§ 65.106 through 65.115. 


(c) *Requests by manufacturers of equipment.* (1) Manufacturers of equipment used to control equipment leaks of a regulated material may apply to the Administrator for approval of an alternative means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of the regulated material equivalent to the reduction achieved by the equipment, design, and operational requirements of this subpart. 


(2) The Administrator will grant permission according to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. 


(d) *Permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation.* Permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation shall be governed by the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) through (4) of this section. 


(1) Where the standard is an equipment, design, or operational requirement, the following requirements apply: 


(i) Each owner or operator applying for permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation shall be responsible for collecting and verifying emission performance test data for an alternative means of emission limitation. 


(ii) The Administrator will compare test data for the means of emission limitation to test data for the equipment, design, and operational requirements. 


(iii) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve at least the same emission reduction as the equipment, design, and operational requirements of this subpart. 


(2) Where the standard is a work practice, the following requirements apply: 


(i) Each owner or operator applying for permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation shall be responsible for collecting and verifying test data for the alternative. 


(ii) The owner or operator shall demonstrate the emission reduction achieved by the required work practice and the proposed alternative means of emission limitation. 


(iii) The Administrator will compare the demonstrated emission reduction for the alternative means of emission limitation to the demonstrated emission reduction for the required work practices and will consider the commitment in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. 


(iv) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the same or greater emission reduction as the required work practices of this subpart. 


(3) An owner or operator may offer a unique approach to demonstrate the alternative means of emission limitation. 


(4) If in the judgment of the Administrator an alternative means of emission limitation will be approved, the Administrator will publish a notice of the determination in the _Federal Register_ using the procedures pursuant to § 65.8(a).
