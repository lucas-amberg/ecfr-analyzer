# § 65.160   Performance test and TRE index value determination records.

(a) *Availability of performance tests records.* Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests performed pursuant to § 65.148(b), § 65.149(b), § 65.150(b), § 65.151(b), § 65.152(b), § 65.154(b), or § 65.155(b). 


(b) *Nonflare control device and halogen reduction device performance test records.* Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of the data specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable, measured during each performance test performed pursuant to § 65.148(b), § 65.149(b), § 65.150(b), § 65.151(b), § 65.152(b), § 65.154(b), or § 65.155(b), and also include that data in the Initial Compliance Status Report as specified in § 65.164(a). The same data specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable, shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a nonflare control device or the outlet concentration of TOC or regulated material is determined. 


(1) *Nonflare combustion device.* Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section seeks to demonstrate compliance with a percent reduction requirement or a parts per million by volume requirement using a nonflare combustion device, the following information shall be recorded: 


(i) For thermal incinerators, record the fire box temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the full period of the performance test. 


(ii) For catalytic incinerators, record the upstream and downstream temperatures and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the full period of the performance test. 


(iii) For an incinerator, record the percent reduction of regulated material or TOC achieved by the incinerator determined as specified in § 65.158(b)(4), as applicable, or the concentration of regulated material or TOC (parts per million by volume, by compound) determined as specified in § 65.158(b)(3) at the outlet of the incinerator. 


(iv) For a boiler or process heater, record a description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater. 


(v) For boilers or process heaters with a design heat input capacity less than 44 megawatts (150 British thermal units per hour) and where the vent stream is not introduced with or as the primary fuel, record the fire box temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the full period of the performance test. 


(vi) For a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 megawatts (150 British thermal units per hour) and where the vent stream is not introduced with or as the primary fuel, record the percent reduction of regulated material or TOC, or the concentration of regulated material or TOC (parts per million by volume, by compound) determined as specified in § 65.158(b)(3) at the outlet of the combustion device. 


(2) *Other nonflare control devices.* Where an owner or operator seeks to use an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber as a control device, the following information shall be recorded, as applicable: 


(i) Where an absorber is used as the control device, the exit specific gravity and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or 


(ii) Where a condenser is used as the control device, the average exit (product side) temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally; or 


(iii) Where a carbon adsorber is used as the control device, the total regeneration stream mass flow during each carbon-bed regeneration cycle during the period of the performance test measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test (full carbon-bed cycle), and temperature of the carbon-bed after each regeneration during the period of the performance test (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle or cycles); or 


(iv) As an alternative to paragraph (b)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the concentration level or reading indicated by the organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted; and 


(v) For an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber used as a control device, the percent reduction of regulated material or TOC achieved by the control device determined as specified in § 65.158(b)(4), or the concentration of regulated material or TOC (parts per million by volume, by compound) determined as specified in § 65.158(b)(3) at the outlet of the control device. 


(3) *Halogen reduction devices.* When using a scrubber following a combustion device to control a halogenated vent stream, record the following information: 


(i) The percent reduction or scrubber outlet mass emission rate of total hydrogen halides and halogens as specified in § 65.158(c); 


(ii) The pH of the scrubber effluent averaged over the time period of the performance test; and 


(iii) The scrubber liquid-to-gas ratio averaged over the time period of the performance test. 


(c) *Recovery device monitoring records during the TRE index value determination.* For Group 2A process vents, the following records, as applicable, shall be maintained and reported as specified in § 65.164(a)(3): 


(1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the exit specific gravity and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or 


(2) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally; or 


(3) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the total regeneration stream mass flow measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time during each carbon-bed regeneration cycle during the period of the TRE index value determination, and temperature of the carbon-bed after each regeneration during the period of the TRE index value determination (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle or cycles); or 


(4) As an alternative to paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, the concentration level or reading indicated by an organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted; and 


(5) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream as specified in § 65.64(h). 


(d) *Halogen concentration records.* Record the halogen concentration in the vent stream determined according to the procedures as specified in § 65.63(b) or § 65.83(b). Submit this record in the Initial Compliance Status Report, as specified in § 65.165(d). If the owner or operator designates the vent stream as halogenated, then this shall be recorded and reported in the Initial Compliance Status Report.
