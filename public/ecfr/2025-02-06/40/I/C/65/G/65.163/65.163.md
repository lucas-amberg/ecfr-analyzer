# § 65.163   Other records.

(a) *Closed vent system records.* For closed vent systems, the owner or operator shall record the following information, as applicable: 


(1) For each closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall keep a record of the information specified in either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. The information shall be reported as specified in § 65.166(b). 


(i) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator specified under § 65.143(a)(3)(i) was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator is not operating. 


(ii) Where a seal mechanism is used to comply with § 65.143(a)(3)(ii), hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, the owner or operator shall record that the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done and shall record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type lock has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has been broken. 


(2) For closed vent systems collecting regulated material from a storage vessel, transfer rack, or equipment leak, the owner or operator shall record the identification of all parts of the closed vent system that are designated as unsafe or difficult-to-inspect pursuant to § 65.143(b)(2) or (3), an explanation of why the equipment is unsafe or difficult-to-inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment as required by § 65.143(b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3)(ii). 


(3) For a closed vent system collecting regulated material from a storage vessel, transfer rack, or equipment leaks, when a leak is detected as specified in § 65.143(d)(1), the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section shall be recorded. The data shall be reported as specified in § 65.166(b)(1). 


(i) The instrument and the equipment identification number and the operator name, initials, or identification number. 


(ii) The date the leak was detected and the date of the first attempt to repair the leak. 


(iii) The date of successful repair of the leak. 


(iv) The maximum instrument reading measured by the procedures in § 65.143(c) after the leak is successfully repaired or determined to be nonrepairable. 


(v) “Repair delayed” and the reason for the delay if a leak is not repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak. The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure. 


(vi) Copies of the periodic reports if records are not maintained on a computerized database capable of generating summary reports from the records. 


(4) For each instrumental or visual inspection conducted in accordance with § 65.143(b)(1) for closed vent systems collecting regulated material from a storage vessel, transfer rack, or equipment leaks during which no leaks are detected, the owner or operator shall record that the inspection was performed, the date of the inspection, and a statement that no leaks were detected. 


(5) For instrument response factor criteria determinations performed pursuant to § 65.143(c)(1)(ii), the owner or operator shall maintain a record of an engineering assessment that identifies the representative composition of the process fluid. This assessment shall be based on knowledge of the compounds present in the process, similarity of response factors for the materials present, the range of compositions encountered during monitoring, or other information available to the owner or operator. 


(b) *Storage vessel and transfer rack records.* For storage vessels, an owner or operator shall keep readily accessible records of the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable. For low-throughput transfer racks, an owner or operator shall keep readily accessible records of the information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 


(1) A record of the measured values of the parameters monitored in accordance with § 65.145(c)(2) and report in the periodic report as specified in § 65.166(e), if applicable. 


(2) A record of the planned routine maintenance performed on the control system during which the control system does not meet the applicable specifications of § 65.143(a), § 65.145(a), or § 65.147(a), as applicable, due to the planned routine maintenance. Such a record shall include the information specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. This information shall be submitted in the periodic reports as specified in § 65.166(d)(1). 


(i) The first time of day and date the requirements of § 65.143(a), § 65.145(a), or § 65.147(a), as applicable, were not met at the beginning of the planned routine maintenance. 


(ii) The first time of day and date the requirements of § 65.143(a), § 65.145(a), or § 65.147(a), as applicable, were met at the conclusion of the planned routine maintenance. 


(iii) A description of the type of maintenance performed. 


(3) *Bypass records for storage vessel emissions routed to a process or fuel gas system.* An owner or operator who uses the bypass provisions of § 65.144(a)(2) shall keep in a readily accessible location the following records: 


(i) The reason it was necessary to bypass the process equipment or fuel gas system; 


(ii) The duration of the period when the process equipment or fuel gas system was bypassed; 


(iii) Documentation or certification of compliance with the applicable provisions of § 65.42(b)(6). 


(c) *Regulated source and control equipment startup, shutdown and malfunction records.* (1) Records of the occurrence and duration of each startup, shutdown, and malfunction of process equipment or of air pollution control equipment used to comply with this part during which excess emissions (as defined in § 65.3(a)(4)) occur. 


(2) For each startup, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions occur, records whether the procedures specified in the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and a description of actions taken to minimize emissions. For example, if a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing control device emissions to a backup control device (for example, the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a checklist or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.


(3) Records of startup, shutdown, and malfunction and continuous monitoring system calibration and maintenance are not required if they pertain solely to Group 2A process vents. 


(d) *Equipment leak records.* The owner or operator shall maintain records of the information specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section for closed vent systems and control devices subject to the provisions of subpart F of this part. The owner or operator shall meet the record retention requirements of § 65.4, except the records specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be kept as long as the equipment is in operation. 


(1) The following design specifications and performance demonstrations: 


(i) Detailed schematics, design specifications of the control device, and piping and instrumentation diagrams. 


(ii) The dates and descriptions of any changes in the design specifications. 


(iii) A description of the parameter or parameters monitored as required in § 65.146(c) to ensure that control devices are operated and maintained in conformance with their design, and an explanation of why that parameter (or parameters) was selected for the monitoring. 


(2) The following records of operation of closed vent systems and control devices: 


(i) Dates and durations when the closed vent systems and control devices required in § 65.115(b) are not operated as designed as indicated by the monitored parameters, including periods when a flare flame or at least one pilot flame is not present. 


(ii) Dates and durations during which the monitoring system or monitoring device is inoperative. 


(iii) Dates and durations of startups and shutdowns of control devices required in § 65.115(b). 


(e) *Records of monitored parameters outside of range.* The owner or operator shall record the occurrences and the cause of periods when the monitored parameters are outside of the parameter ranges documented in the Initial Compliance Status Report in accordance with § 65.165(b). This information shall be reported in the periodic report as specified in § 65.166(e).
