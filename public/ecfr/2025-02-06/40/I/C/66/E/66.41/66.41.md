# § 66.41   Decision on petitions.

(a) Within thirty days after receiving a petition filed under § 66.13, the Administrator shall notify the source owner or operator in writing that: 


(1) The petition demonstrates that the source owner or operator is entitled to part or all of the relief requested and that the notice of noncompliance is withdrawn or modified accordingly; 


(2) The petition does not contain sufficient information to demonstrate that the source owner or operator is entitled to part or all of the relief requested. The Administrator shall specify what deficiencies exist and request that the source owner or operator supplement his petition within thirty days of receipt of that request. If the petition is not supplemented adequately within this time, or, if supplemented adequately, still fails to demonstrate entitlement to relief, the Administrator shall grant a hearing under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Any supplemental material provided pursuant to the Administrator's request shall be evaluated as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section.


(3) A hearing is granted on the issue of whether the source is in violation of applicable legal requirements or is entitled to an exemption under § 66.31, § 66.32, § 66.33, or on both.
