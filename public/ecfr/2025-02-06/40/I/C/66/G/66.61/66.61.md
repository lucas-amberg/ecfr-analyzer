(b) Where the source owner has filed a petition pursuant to § 66.13(a)(2), the first installment consisting of payment of penalties for all quarters “missed” as well as for the upcoming quarter shall be paid on the date six months after a final administrative decision affirming the source owner or operator's liability. Installments shall be paid quarterly thereafter until compliance is achieved. Quarters shall be measured in increments of three calendar months from the date the first payment is due.
