# ยง 67.15   Revocation.

If the Administrator determines that a State with a program approved under ยง 67.13 is not administering the program in conformity with the requirements of the Act or ยง 67.11, or the delegation of authority, he shall provide the State written notice of that determination, setting forth his reasons. Copies of all supporting materials shall accompany the notice if requested, or shall be placed on file in the appropriate Regional Office and made available for inspection during normal business hours.

If he finds that neither of these conditions has been met, he shall withdraw the delegation of authority to the State.
