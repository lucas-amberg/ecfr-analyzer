(a) The Administrator may, on his own initiative, review any determination by a State or its agent that a source owner or operator is or is not in compliance with applicable legal requirements or is or is not entitled to an exemption, to determine whether that determination conforms to the requirements of the Act and part 66 (as modified by ยง 67.11). 


(b) The Administrator shall review any such determination upon receipt of a petition alleging that the State's determination does not conform to the requirements of the Act and part 66 (as modified by ยง 67.11). Such petition must be filed within 20 days of issuance of the State's decision.


(c) The Administrator shall give notice in writing to the State or local agent, to the owner or operator of the source, and to the petitioner of his intent to review the determination.

Unless otherwise provided, such notice shall not withdraw EPA's delegation of authority to the State or local agent over the particular facility in question.
