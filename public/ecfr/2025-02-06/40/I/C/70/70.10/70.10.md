# § 70.10   Federal oversight and sanctions.

(a) *Failure to submit an approvable program.* (1) If a State fails to submit a fully-approvable whole part 70 program, or a required revision thereto, in conformance with the provisions of § 70.4, or if an interim approval expires and the Administrator has not approved a whole part 70 program:


(i) At any time the Administrator may apply any one of the sanctions specified in section 179(b) of the Act; and


(ii) Eighteen months after the date required for submittal or the date of disapproval by the Administrator, the Administrator will apply such sanctions in the same manner and with the same conditions as are applicable in the case of a determination, disapproval, or finding under section 179(a) of the Act.


(2) If full approval of a whole part 70 program has not taken place within 2 years after the date required for such submission, the Administrator will promulgate, administer, and enforce a whole program or a partial program as appropriate for such State.


(b) *State failure to administer or enforce.* Any State program approved by the Administrator shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part and of any agreement between the State and the Administrator concerning operation of the program.


(1) Whenever the Administrator makes a determination that a permitting authority is not adequately administering or enforcing a part 70 program, or any portion thereof, the Administrator will notify the permitting authority of the determination and the reasons therefore. The Administrator will publish such notice in the _Federal Register._

(2) If, 90 days after issuing the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the permitting authority fails to take significant action to assure adequate administration and enforcement of the program, the Administrator may take one or more of the following actions:


(i) Withdraw approval of the program or portion thereof using procedures consistent with § 70.4(e) of this part;


(ii) Apply any of the sanctions specified in section 179(b) of the Act;


(iii) Promulgate, administer, or enforce a Federal program under title V of the Act.


(3) Whenever the Administrator has made the finding and issued the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator will apply the sanctions under section 179(b) of the Act 18 months after that notice. These sanctions will be applied in the same manner and subject to the same deadlines and other conditions as are applicable in the case of a determination, disapproval, or finding under section 179(a) of the Act.


(4) Whenever the Administrator has made the finding and issued the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator will, unless the State has corrected such deficiency within 18 months after the date of such finding, promulgate, administer, and enforce, a whole or partial program 2 years after the date of such finding.


(5) Nothing in this section shall limit the Administrator's authority to take any enforcement action against a source for violations of the Act or of a permit issued under rules adopted pursuant to this section in a State that has been delegated responsibility by EPA to implement a Federal program promulgated under title V of the Act.


(6) Where a whole State program consists of an aggregate of partial programs, and one or more partial programs fails to be fully approved or implemented, the Administrator may apply sanctions only in those areas for which the State failed to submit or implement an approvable program.


(c) *Criteria for withdrawal of State programs.* (1) The Administrator may, in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section, withdraw program approval in whole or in part whenever the approved program no longer complies with the requirements of this part, and the permitting authority fails to take corrective action. Such circumstances, in whole or in part, include any of the following:


(i) Where the permitting authority's legal authority no longer meets the requirements of this part, including the following:


(A) The permitting authority fails to promulgate or enact new authorities when necessary; or


(B) The State legislature or a court strikes down or limits State authorities to administer or enforce the State program.


(ii) Where the operation of the State program fails to comply with the requirements of this part, including the following:


(A) Failure to exercise control over activities required to be regulated under this part, including failure to issue permits;


(B) Repeated issuance of permits that do not conform to the requirements of this part;

(B) Failure to seek adequate enforcement penalties and fines and collect all assessed penalties and fines; or


(C) Failure to inspect and monitor activities subject to regulation.


(d) *Federal collection of fees.* If the Administrator determines that the fee provisions of a part 70 program do not meet the requirements of § 70.9 of this part, or if the Administrator makes a determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the permitting authority is not adequately administering or enforcing an approved fee program, the Administrator may, in addition to taking any other action authorized under title V of the Act, collect reasonable fees to cover the Administrator's costs of administering the provisions of the permitting program promulgated by the Administrator, without regard to the requirements of § 70.9 of this part.
