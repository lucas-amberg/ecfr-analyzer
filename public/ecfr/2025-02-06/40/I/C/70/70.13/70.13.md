# ยง 70.13   Documents that may be considered in reviewing petitions.

The information that the Administrator considers in making a determination whether to grant or deny a petition submitted under ยง 70.8(d) of this part on a proposed permit generally includes the petition itself, including attachments to the petition, and the administrative record for the proposed permit. For purposes of this paragraph, the administrative record for a particular proposed permit includes the draft and proposed permits; any permit applications that relate to the draft or proposed permits; the statement required by ยง 70.7(a)(5) (sometimes referred to as the `statement of basis'); any comments the permitting authority received during the public participation process on the draft permit; the permitting authority's written responses to comments, including responses to all significant comments raised during the public participation process on the draft permit; and all materials available to the permitting authority that are relevant to the permitting decision and that the permitting authority made available to the public according to ยง 70.7(h)(2) of this part. If a final permit is available during the agency's review of a petition on a proposed permit, that document may also be considered as part of making a determination whether to grant or deny the petition.
