# Appendix C to Part 72â€”Actual 1985 Yearly SO

The equation used to calculate the yearly SO_2_ emissions (SO2) is as follows:


If gas is the only fuel, gas emissions are defaulted to 0.


Each fuel type SO_2_ emissions is calculated on a yearly basis, using the equation:


For coal, the yearly fuel burned is in tons/yr and the AP-42 factor (which accounts for the ash retention of sulfur in coal), in lbs SO_2_ ton coal, is by coal type:


For oil, the yearly fuel burned is in gal/yr. If it is in bbl/yr, convert using 42 gal/bbl oil. The AP-42 factor (which accounts for the oil density), in lbs SO_2_/thousand gal oil, is by oil type:


For all fuel, the units conversion factor is 1 ton/2000 lbs.
