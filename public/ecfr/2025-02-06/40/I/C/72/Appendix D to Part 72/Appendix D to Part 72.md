# Appendix D to Part 72—Calculation of Potential Electric Output Capacity


The potential electrical output capacity is calculated from the maximum design heat input from the boiler by the following equation:


(1) Assume a boiler with a maximum design heat input capacity of 340 million Btu/hr.


(2) One-third of the maximum design heat input capacity is 113.3 mmBtu/hr. The one-third factor relates to the thermodynamic efficiency of the boiler.


(3) To express this in MWe, the standards conversion of 3413 Btu to 1 kw-hr is used: 113.3 × 10
6 Btu/hr × 1 kw-hr / 3413 Btu × 1 MWe / 1000 kw = 33.2 MWe
