# § 72.74   Federal issuance of Phase II permits.

(a)(1) The Administrator will be responsible for administering and enforcing Acid Rain permits for Phase II for any affected sources to the extent that a State permitting authority is not responsible, as of January 1, 1997 or such later date as the Administrator may establish, for administering and enforcing Acid Rain permits for such sources under § 72.73(a).


(2) After and to the extent the State permitting authority becomes responsible for administering and enforcing Acid Rain permits under § 72.73(a), the Administrator will suspend federal administration of Acid Rain permits for Phase II for sources and units to the extent that they are subject to the accepted State Acid Rain program, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(b)(1) The Administrator will administer and enforce Acid Rain permits effective in Phase II for sources and units during any period that the Administrator is administering and enforcing an operating permit program under part 71 of this chapter for the geographic area in which the sources and units are located.


(2) The Administrator will administer and enforce Acid Rain permits effective in Phase II for sources and units otherwise subject to a State Acid Rain program under § 72.73(a) if:


(i) The Administrator determines that the State permitting authority is not adequately administering or enforcing all or a portion of the State Acid Rain program, notifies the State permitting authority of such determination and the reasons therefore, and publishes such notice in the _Federal Register_;


(ii) The State permitting authority fails either to correct the deficiencies within a reasonable period (established by the Administrator in the notice under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) after issuance of the notice or to take significant action to assure adequate administration and enforcement of the program within a reasonable period (established by the Administrator in the notice) after issuance of the notice; and


(iii) The Administrator publishes in the _Federal Register_ a notice that he or she will administer and enforce Acid Rain permits effective in Phase II for sources and units subject to the State Acid Rain program or a portion of the program. The effective date of such notice shall be a reasonable period (established by the Administrator in the notice) after the issuance of the notice.


(3) When the Administrator administers and enforces Acid Rain permits under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the Administrator will administer and enforce each Acid Rain permit issued under the State Acid Rain program or portion of the program until, and except to the extent that, the permit is replaced by a permit issued under this section. After the later of the date for publication of a notice in the _Federal Register_ that the State operating permit program is currently approved by the Administrator or that the State Acid Rain program or portion of the program is currently accepted by the Administrator, the Administrator will suspend federal administration of Acid Rain permits effective in Phase II for sources and units to the extent that they are subject to the State Acid Rain program or portion of the program, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(4) After the State permitting authority becomes responsible for administering and enforcing Acid Rain permits effective in Phase II under § 72.73(a), the Administrator will continue to administer and enforce each Acid Rain permit issued under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (b)(2) of this section until, and except to the extent that, the permit is replaced by a permit issued under the State Acid Rain program. The State permitting authority may replace an Acid Rain permit issued under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (b)(2) of this section by issuing a permit under the State Acid Rain program by the expiration of the permit under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (b)(2) of this section. The Administrator may retain jurisdiction over the Acid Rain permits issued under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (b)(2) of this section for which the administrative or judicial review process is not complete and will address such retention of jurisdiction in a notice in the _Federal Register._

(c) *Permit Issuance Deadline.* (1)(i) On or before January 1, 1998, the Administrator will issue an Acid Rain permit for Phase II setting forth the Acid Rain Program sulfur dioxide requirements for each affected unit (other than opt-in sources) at a source not under the jurisdiction of a State permitting authority that is responsible, as of January 1, 1997 (or such later date as the Administrator may establish), under § 72.73(a) of this section for administering and enforcing Acid Rain permits with such requirements; *provided* that the designated representative for the source submitted a timely and complete Acid Rain permit application in accordance with § 72.21. The failure by the Administrator to issue a permit in accordance with this paragraph shall be grounds for the filing of an appeal under part 78 of this chapter.


(ii) Each Acid Rain permit issued in accordance with this section shall have a term of 5 years commencing on its effective date. Each Acid Rain permit issued in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall take effect by the later of January 1, 2000 or, where a permit governs a unit under § 72.6(a)(3), the deadline for monitor certification under part 75 of this chapter.


(2) *Nitrogen Oxides.* Not later than 6 months following submission by the designated representative of an Acid Rain permit application for nitrogen oxides, the Administrator will amend under § 72.83 the Acid Rain permit and add any NO_X_ early election plan that was approved under § 76.8 of this chapter and has not been terminated and reopen the Acid Rain permit for Phase II and add any other Acid Rain Program nitrogen oxides requirements for each affected source not under the jurisdiction of a State permitting authority that is responsible, as of January 1, 1997 (or such later date as the Administrator may establish), under § 72.73(a) for issuing Acid Rain permits with such requirements; *provided* that the designated representative for the source submitted a timely and complete Acid Rain permit application for nitrogen oxides in accordance with § 72.21.


(d) *Permit Issuance.* (1) The Administrator may utilize any or all of the provisions of subparts E and F of this part to administer Acid Rain permits as authorized under this section or may adopt by rulemaking portions of a State Acid Rain program in substitution of or in addition to provisions of subparts E and F of this part to administer such permits. The provisions of Acid Rain permits for Phase I or Phase II issued by the Administrator shall not be applicable requirements under part 70 of this chapter.


(2) The Administrator may delegate all or part of his or her responsibility, under this section, for administering and enforcing Phase II Acid Rain permits or opt-in permits to a State. Such delegation will be made consistent with the requirements of this part and the provisions governing delegation of a part 71 program under part 71 of this chapter.
