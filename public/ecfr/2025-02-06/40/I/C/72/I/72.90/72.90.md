# § 72.90   Annual compliance certification report.

(a) *Applicability and deadline.* For each calendar year during 1995 through 2005 in which a unit is subject to the Acid Rain emissions limitations, the designated representative of the source at which the unit is located shall submit to the Administrator, within 60 days after the end of the calendar year, an annual compliance certification report for the unit.


(b) *Contents of report.* The designated representative shall include in the annual compliance certification report under paragraph (a) of this section the following elements, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, concerning the unit and the calendar year covered by the report:


(1) Identification of the unit;


(2) For all Phase I units, the information in accordance with §§ 72.91(a) and 72.92(a) of this part;


(3) If the unit is governed by an approved Phase I extension plan, then the information in accordance with § 72.93 of this part;


(4) At the designated representative's option, the total number of allowances to be deducted for the year, using the formula in § 72.95 of this part, and the serial numbers of the allowances that are to be deducted;


(5) At the designated representative's option, for units that share a common stack and whose emissions of sulfur dioxide are not monitored separately or apportioned in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the percentage of the total number of allowances under paragraph (b)(4) of this section for all such units that is to be deducted from each unit's compliance subaccount; and


(6) The compliance certification under paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Annual compliance certification.* In the annual compliance certification report under paragraph (a) of this section, the designated representative shall certify, based on reasonable inquiry of those persons with primary responsibility for operating the source and the affected units at the source in compliance with the Acid Rain Program, whether each affected unit for which the compliance certification is submitted was operated during the calendar year covered by the report in compliance with the requirements of the Acid Rain Program applicable to the unit, including:


(1) Whether the unit was operated in compliance with the applicable Acid Rain emissions limitations, including whether the unit held allowances, as of the allowance transfer deadline, in its compliance subaccount (after accounting for any allowance deductions under § 73.34(c) of this chapter) not less than the unit's total sulfur dioxide emissions during the calendar year covered by the annual report;


(2) Whether the monitoring plan that governs the unit has been maintained to reflect the actual operation and monitoring of the unit and contains all information necessary to attribute monitored emissions to the unit;


(3) Whether all the emissions from the unit, or a group of units (including the unit) using a common stack, were monitored or accounted for through the missing data procedures and reported in the quarterly monitoring reports, including whether conditionally valid data, as defined in § 72.2, were reported in the quarterly report. If conditionally valid data were reported, the owner or operator shall indicate whether the status of all conditionally valid data has been resolved and all necessary quarterly report resubmissions have been made.


(4) Whether the facts that form the basis for certification of each monitor at the unit or a group of units (including the unit) using a common stack or for using an Acid Rain Program excepted monitoring method or approved alternative monitoring method, if any, has changed; and


(5) If a change is required to be reported under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, specify the nature of the change, the reason for the change, when the change occurred, and how the unit's compliance status was determined subsequent to the change, including what method was used to determine emissions when a change mandated the need for monitor recertification.
