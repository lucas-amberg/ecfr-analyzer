(B) “Until this notice of delegation is superseded by another notice of delegation under 40 CFR 73.33(g)(4), I agree to maintain an e-mail account and to notify the Administrator immediately of any change in my e-mail address unless all delegation of authority by me under 40 CFR 73.33(g) is eliminated.”


(4) A notice of delegation submitted under paragraph (g)(3) of this section shall be effective, with regard to the authorized account representative or alternate authorized account representative identified in such notice, upon receipt of such notice by the Administrator and until receipt by the Administrator of a superseding notice of delegation submitted by such authorized account representative or alternate authorized account representative, as appropriate.
