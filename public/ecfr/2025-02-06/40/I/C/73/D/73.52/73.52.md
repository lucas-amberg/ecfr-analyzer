(1) The transfer is correctly submitted under § 73.50;


(2) The transferor account includes each allowance identified by serial number in the transfer; and


(3) If the allowances identified by serial number specified pursuant to § 73.50(b)(1)(ii) are subject to the limitation on transfer imposed pursuant to § 72.44(h)(1)(i) of this chapter, § 74.42 of this chapter, or § 74.47(c) of this chapter, the transfer is in accordance with such limitation.
