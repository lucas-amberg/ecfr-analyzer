# § 73.85   Administrator review of the reserve program.

(a) *Administrator review of the Reserve and creation of a subaccount.* In the event that an allocation of allowances from the Reserve pursuant to a pending application would bring the total number of allowances allocated to a number greater than 240,000, the Administrator will review the distribution of all allowances allocated as follows:


(1) If at least 60,000 allowances have been allocated from the Reserve for *each* of


(i) Qualified energy conservation measures, and


(ii) Qualified renewable energy generation, allocations of allowances will continue pursuant to § 73.82, until no more allowances remain in the Reserve.


(2) If fewer than 60,000 allowances have been allocated for either qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy generation, the Administrator will establish a subaccount for the allocation of allowances for applications based on the category for which fewer than 60,000 allowances have been allocated. The subaccount will contain allowances equal to 60,000 less the number of allowances previously allocated for such category.


(b) *Allocation of allowances from the subaccount.* The Administrator will allocate allowances from the subaccount established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to approved and DOE certified applicants that fulfill the requirements of this subpart, including § 73.82 and § 73.83, on a “first-come, first-served basis”, pursuant to § 73.84(a), until the subaccount is depleted or closed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Closure of the subaccount.* Unless all allowances in the subaccount have been previously allocated, the Administrator will terminate the subaccount not later than February 1, 1998 and return any allowances remaining in the subaccount to the general account of the Reserve. After all Reserve allocations have been made to applicants with approved and DOE certified applications subject to § 73.84(f)(3), the Administrator will allocate any remaining allowances to any applicants that meet the requirements of this subpart, including § 73.82 and § 73.83, on a “first-come, first-served” basis, pursuant to § 73.84.
