# § 75.13   Specific provisions for monitoring CO

(a) *CO*_2_*continuous emission monitoring system.* If the owner or operator chooses to use the continuous emission monitoring method, then the owner or operator shall meet the general operating requirements in § 75.10 for a CO_2_ continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system for each affected unit. The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable provisions specified in §§ 75.11(a) through (e) or § 75.16, except that the phrase “CO_2_ continuous emission monitoring system” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ continuous emission monitoring system,” the phrase “CO_2_ concentration” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ concentration,” the term “maximum potential concentration of CO_2_” shall apply rather than “maximum potential concentration of SO_2_,” and the phrase “CO_2_ mass emissions” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ mass emissions.”


(b) *Determination of CO*_2_*emissions using appendix G to this part.* If the owner or operator chooses to use the appendix G method, then the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in appendix G to this part for estimating daily CO_2_ mass emissions based on the measured carbon content of the fuel and the amount of fuel combusted. For units with wet flue gas desulfurization systems or other add-on emissions controls generating CO_2_, the owner or operator shall use the procedures in appendix G to this part to estimate both combustion-related emissions based on the measured carbon content of the fuel and the amount of fuel combusted and sorbent-related emissions based on the amount of sorbent injected. The owner or operator shall calculate daily, quarterly, and annual CO_2_ mass emissions (in tons) in accordance with the procedures in appendix G to this part.


(c) *Determination of CO*_2_*mass emissions using an O*_2_*monitor according to appendix F to this part.* If the owner or operator chooses to use the appendix F method, then the owner or operator shall determine hourly CO_2_ concentration and mass emissions with a flow monitoring system; a continuous O_2_ concentration monitor; fuel F and F_c_ factors; and, where O_2_ concentration is measured on a dry basis (or where Equation F-14b in appendix F to this part is used to determine CO_2_ concentration), either, a continuous moisture monitoring system, as specified in § 75.11(b)(2), or a fuel-specific default moisture percentage (if applicable), as defined in § 75.11(b)(1); and by using the methods and procedures specified in appendix F to this part. For units using a common stack, multiple stack, or bypass stack, the owner or operator may use the provisions of § 75.16, except that the phrase “CO_2_ continuous emission monitoring system” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ continuous emission monitoring system,” the term “maximum potential concentration of CO_2_” shall apply rather than “maximum potential concentration of SO_2_,” and the phrase “CO_2_ mass emissions” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ mass emissions.”


(d) *Determination of CO*_2_*mass emissions from low mass emissions units.* The owner or operator of a unit that qualifies as a low mass emissions unit under § 75.19(a) and (b) shall comply with one of the following:


(1) Meet the general operating requirements in § 75.10 for a CO_2_ continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system;


(2) Meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section for use of the methods in appendix G or F to this part, respectively; or


(3) Use the low mass emissions excepted methodology in § 75.19(c) for estimating hourly CO_2_ mass emissions, if applicable under § 75.19(a) and (b). If this option is selected for CO_2_, the LME methodology must also be used for NO_X_ and SO_2_ when these parameters are required to be monitored by applicable program(s).
