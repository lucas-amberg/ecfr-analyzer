# § 75.24   Out-of-control periods and adjustment for system bias.

(a) If an out-of-control period occurs to a monitor or continuous emission monitoring system, the owner or operator shall take corrective action and repeat the tests applicable to the “out-of-control parameter” as described in appendix B of this part.


(1) For daily calibration error tests, an out-of-control period occurs when the calibration error of a pollutant concentration monitor exceeds the applicable specification in section 2.1.4 of appendix B to this part.


(2) For quarterly linearity checks, an out-of-control period occurs when the error in linearity at any of three gas concentrations (low, mid-range, and high) exceeds the applicable specification in appendix A to this part.


(3) For relative accuracy test audits, an out-of-control period occurs when the relative accuracy exceeds the applicable specification in appendix A to this part.


(b) When a monitor or continuous emission monitoring system is out-of-control, any data recorded by the monitor or monitoring system are not quality-assured and shall not be used in calculating monitor data availabilities pursuant to § 75.32 of this part.


(c) When a monitor or continuous emission monitoring system is out-of-control, the owner or operator shall take one of the following actions until the monitor or monitoring system has successfully met the relevant criteria in appendices A and B of this part as demonstrated by subsequent tests:


(1) Apply the procedures for missing data substitution to emissions from affected unit(s); or


(2) Use a certified backup monitoring system or a reference method for measuring and recording emissions from the affected unit(s); or


(3) Adjust the gas discharge paths from the affected unit(s) with emissions normally observed by the out-of-control monitor or monitoring system so that all exhaust gases are monitored by a certified monitor or monitoring system meeting the requirements of appendices A and B of this part.


(d) When the bias test indicates that an SO_2_ monitor, a flow monitor, a NO_X_-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, or a NO_X_ concentration monitoring system used to determine NO_X_ mass emissions, as defined in § 75.71(a)(2), is biased low (*i.e.,* the arithmetic mean of the differences between the reference method value and the monitor or monitoring system measurements in a relative accuracy test audit exceed the bias statistic in section 7 of appendix A to this part), the owner or operator shall adjust the monitor or continuous emission monitoring system to eliminate the cause of bias such that it passes the bias test or calculate and use the bias adjustment factor as specified in section 2.3.4 of appendix B to this part.


(e) The owner or operator shall determine if a continuous opacity monitoring system is out-of-control and shall take appropriate corrective actions according to the procedures specified for State Implementation Plans, pursuant to appendix M of part 51 of this chapter. The owner or operator shall comply with the monitor data availability requirements of the State. If the State has no monitor data availability requirements for continuous opacity monitoring systems, then the owner or operator shall comply with the monitor data availability requirements as stated in the data capture provisions of appendix M, part 51 of this chapter.
