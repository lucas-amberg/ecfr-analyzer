# ยง 75.33   Standard missing data procedures for SO

(a) Following initial certification of the required SO_2_, NO_X_, and flow rate monitoring system(s) at a particular unit or stack location (*i.e.*, the date and time at which quality-assured data begins to be recorded by CEMS(s) at that location) and upon completion of the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours (for SO_2_) or the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (for flow, NO_X_ emission rate, or NO_X_ concentration), the owner or operator shall provide substitute data required under this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and depicted in Table 1 (SO_2_) and Table 2 of this section (NO_X_, flow). The owner or operator may either implement the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section on a non-fuel-specific basis, or may, as described in paragraphs (b)(5), (b)(6), (c)(7) and (c)(8) of this section, provide fuel-specific substitute data values. Notwithstanding these requirements, if three years (26,280 clock hours) have elapsed since the date and hour of initial certification, and fewer than 720 (or 2,160, as applicable) quality-assured monitor operating hours have been recorded, the owner or operator shall begin using the missing data procedures of this section. The owner or operator of a unit shall substitute for missing data using quality-assured monitor operating hours of data from no earlier than three years (26,280 clock hours) prior to the date and time of the missing data period.


(b) *SO*_2_*concentration data.* For each hour of missing SO_2_ concentration data,


(1) If the monitor data availability is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:


(i) For a missing data period less than or equal to 24 hours, substitute the average of the hourly SO_2_ concentrations recorded by an SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.


(ii) For a missing data period greater than 24 hours, substitute the greater of:


(A) The 90th percentile hourly SO_2_ concentration recorded by an SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor during the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours; or


(B) The average of the hourly SO_2_ concentrations recorded by an SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.


(2) If the monitor data availability is at least 90.0 percent but less than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:


(i) For a missing data period of less than or equal to 8 hours, substitute the average of the hourly SO_2_ concentrations recorded by an SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.


(ii) For a missing data period of more than 8 hours, substitute the greater of:


(A) the 95th percentile hourly SO_2_ concentration recorded by an SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor during the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours; or


(B) The average of the hourly SO_2_ concentrations recorded by an SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.


(3) If the monitor data availability is at least 80.0 percent but less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute for that hour of the missing data period the maximum hourly SO_2_ concentration recorded by an SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor during the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours.


(4) If the monitor data availability is less than 80.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute for that hour of the missing data period the maximum potential SO_2_ concentration, as defined in section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part.


(5) For units that combust more than one type of fuel, the owner or operator may opt to implement the missing data routines in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section on a fuel-specific basis. If this option is selected, the owner or operator shall document this in the monitoring plan required under ยง 75.53. 


(6) Use the following guidelines to implement paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section on a fuel-specific basis: 


(i) Separate the historical, quality-assured SO_2_ concentration data according to the type of fuel combusted; 


(ii) For units that co-fire different types of fuel, either group the co-fired hours with the historical data for the fuel with the highest SO_2_ emission rate (e.g., if diesel oil and pipeline natural gas are co-fired, count co-fired hours as oil-burning hours), or separate the co-fired hours from the single-fuel hours; 


(iii) For the purposes of providing substitute data under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, determine a separate, fuel-specific maximum potential SO_2_ concentration (MPC) value for each type of fuel combusted in the unit, in a manner consistent with section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part. For fuel that qualifies as pipeline natural gas or natural gas (as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter), the owner or operator shall, for the purposes of determining the MPC, either determine the maximum total sulfur content and minimum gross calorific value (GCV) of the gas by fuel sampling and analysis or shall use a default total sulfur content of 0.05 percent by weight (dry basis) and a default GCV value of 950 Btu/scf. For co-firing, the MPC value shall be based on the fuel with the highest SO_2_ emission rate. The exact methodology used to determine each fuel-specific MPC value shall be documented in the monitoring plan for the unit or stack; and 


(iv) For missing data periods that require 720-hour (or, if applicable, 3-year) lookbacks, use historical data for the type of fuel combusted during each hour of the missing data period to determine the appropriate substitute data value for that hour. For co-fired missing data hours, if the historical data are separated into single-fuel and co-fired hours, use co-fired data to provide the substitute data values. Otherwise, use data for the fuel with the highest SO_2_ emission rate to provide substitute data values for co-fired missing data hours. 


(7) Table 1 summarizes the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.


(c) *Volumetric flow rate, NO*_X_*emission rate and NO*_X_*concentration data.* Use the procedures in this paragraph to provide substitute NO_X_ and flow rate data for all affected units for which load-based ranges have been defined in accordance with section 2 of appendix C to this part. For units that do not produce electrical or thermal output (*i.e.*, non-load-based units), use the procedures in this paragraph only to provide substitute data for volumetric flow rate, and only if operational bins have been defined for the unit, as described in section 3 of appendix C to this part. Otherwise, use the applicable missing data procedures in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section for non-load-based units. For each hour of missing volumetric flow rate data, NO_X_ emission rate data, or NO_X_ concentration data used to determine NO_X_ mass emissions:


(1) If the monitor data availability is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:


(i) For a missing data period less than or equal to 24 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the arithmetic average of the flow rates or NO_X_ emission rates or NO_X_ concentrations recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part.


(ii) For a missing data period greater than 24 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the greater of:


(A) The 90th percentile hourly flow rate or the 90th percentile NO_X_ emission rate or the 90th percentile NO_X_ concentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part; or


(B) The average of the recorded hourly flow rates, NO_X_ emission rates or NO_X_ concentrations recorded by a monitoring system for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.


(2) If the monitor data availability is at least 90.0 percent but less than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:


(i) For a missing data period of less than or equal to 8 hours, substitute, as applicable, the arithmetic average hourly flow rate or NO_X_ emission rate or NO_X_ concentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part.


(ii) For a missing data period greater than 8 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the greater of:


(A) The 95th percentile hourly flow rate or the 95th percentile NO_X_ emission rate or the 95th percentile NO_X_ concentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part; or


(B) The average of the hourly flow rates, NO_X_ emission rates or NO_X_ concentrations recorded by a monitoring system for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.


(3) If the monitor data availability is at least 80.0 percent but less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum hourly flow rate or the maximum hourly NO_X_ emission rate or the maximum hourly NO_X_ concentration recorded during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part.


(4) If the monitor data availability is less than 80.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum NO_X_ emission rate, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum potential NO_X_ concentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part. In addition, when non-load-based operational bins are used, the owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential flow rate for any hour in the missing data period in which essential operating or parametric data are unavailable and the operational bin cannot be determined. 


(5) This paragraph, (c)(5), does not apply to non-load-based, affected units using operational bins. Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate data, NO_X_ concentration data or NO_X_ emission rate data exist for the corresponding load range, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for each hour of missing data, the maximum hourly flow rate or the maximum hourly NO_X_ concentration or maximum hourly NO_X_ emission rate at the next higher level load range for which quality-assured data are available.


(6) Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate data, NO_X_ concentration data or NO_X_ emission rate data exist at either the corresponding load range (or a higher load range) or at the corresponding operational bin, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, either the maximum potential NO_X_ emission rate or the maximum potential NO_X_ concentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part or the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part.


(7) This paragraph (c)(7) does not apply to affected units using non-load-based operational bins. For units that combust more than one type of fuel, the owner or operator may opt to implement the missing data routines in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section on a fuel-specific basis. If this option is selected, the owner or operator shall document this in the monitoring plan required under ยง 75.53.


(8) This paragraph, (c)(8), does not apply to affected units using non-load-based operational bins. Use the following guidelines to implement paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section on a fuel-specific basis: 


(i) Separate the historical, quality-assured NO_X_ emission rate, NO_X_ concentration, or flow rate data according to the type of fuel combusted; 


(ii) For units that co-fire different types of fuel, either group the co-fired hours with the historical data for the fuel with the highest NO_X_ emission rate, NO_X_ concentration or flow rate, or separate the co-fired hours from the single-fuel hours; 


(iii) For the purposes of providing substitute data under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a separate, fuel-specific maximum potential concentration (MPC), maximum potential NO_X_ emission rate (MER), or maximum potential flow rate (MPF) value (as applicable) shall be determined for each type of fuel combusted in the unit, in a manner consistent with ยง 72.2 of this chapter and with section 2.1.2.1 or 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part. For co-firing, the MPC, MER or MPF value shall be based on the fuel with the highest emission rate or flow rate (as applicable). Furthermore, for a unit with add-on NO_X_ emission controls, a separate fuel-specific maximum controlled NO_X_ emission rate (MCR) or maximum expected NO_X_ concentration (MEC) value (as applicable) shall be determined for each type of fuel combusted in the unit. The exact methodology used to determine each fuel-specific MPC, MER, MEC, MCR or MPF value shall be documented in the monitoring plan for the unit or stack.


(iv) For missing data periods that require 2,160-hour (or, if applicable, 3-year) lookbacks, use historical data for the type of fuel combusted during each hour of the missing data period to determine the appropriate substitute data value for that hour. For co-fired missing data hours, if the historical data are separated into single-fuel and co-fired hours, use co-fired data to provide the substitute data values. Otherwise, use data for the fuel with the highest NO_X_ emission rate, NO_X_ concentration or flow rate (as applicable) to provide substitute data values for co-fired missing data hours. Tables 1 and 2 follow. 


(9) The load-based provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of this section are summarized in Table 2 of this section. The non-load-based provisions for volumetric flow rate, found in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4), and (c)(6) of this section, are presented in Table 4 of this section. 


(d) *Non-load-based* NO _X_ emission rate and NO_X_*concentration data.* Use the procedures in this paragraph to provide substitute NO_X_ data for affected units that do not produce electrical output (in megawatts) or thermal output (in klb/hr of steam). For each hour of missing NO_X_ emission rate data, or NO_X_ concentration data used to determine NO_X_ mass emissions: 


(1) If the monitor data availability is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures: 


(i) For a missing data period less than or equal to 24 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the arithmetic average of the NO_X_ emission rates or NO_X_ concentrations recorded by a monitoring system in a 2,160 hour lookback period. The lookback period may be comprised of either: 


(A) The previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours, or 


(B) The previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins, as defined in section 3 of appendix C to this part, are used. 


(ii) For a missing data period greater than 24 hours, substitute, for each missing hour, the 90th percentile NO_X_ emission rate or the 90th percentile NO_X_ concentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used). 


(2) If the monitor data availability is at least 90.0 percent but less than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures: 


(i) For a missing data period of less than or equal to eight hours, substitute, as applicable, the arithmetic average of the hourly NO_X_ emission rates or NO_X_ concentrations recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used). 


(ii) For a missing data period greater than eight hours, substitute, for each missing hour, the 95th percentile hourly flow rate or the 95th percentile NO_X_ emission rate or the 95th percentile NO_X_ concentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used). 


(3) If the monitor data availability is at least 80.0 percent but less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum hourly NO_X_ emission rate or the maximum hourly NO_X_ concentration recorded during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used). 


(4) If the monitor data availability is less than 80.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum NO_X_ emission rate, as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, or the maximum potential NO_X_ concentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part. In addition, when operational bins are used, the owner or operator shall substitute (as applicable) the maximum potential NO_X_ emission rate or the maximum potential NO_X_ concentration for any hour in the missing data period in which essential operating or parametric data are unavailable and the operational bin cannot be determined. 


(5) If operational bins are used and no prior quality-assured NO_X_ concentration data or NO_X_ emission rate data exist for the corresponding operational bin, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, either the maximum potential NO_X_ emission rate, as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, or the maximum potential NO_X_ concentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part.

(e) *Non-load-based volumetric flow rate data.* (1) If operational bins, as defined in section 3 of appendix C to this part, are used for a unit that does not produce electrical or thermal output, use the missing data procedures in paragraph (c) of this section to provide substitute volumetric flow rate data for the unit. 


(2) If operational bins are not used, modify the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section as follows: 


(i) In paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3), the words โprevious 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hoursโ shall apply rather than โprevious 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part;โ 


(ii) The last sentence in paragraph (c)(4) does not apply; 


(iii) Paragraphs (c)(5), (c)(7), and (c)(8) are not applicable; and
