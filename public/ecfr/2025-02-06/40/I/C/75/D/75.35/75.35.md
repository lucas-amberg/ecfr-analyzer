# § 75.35   Missing data procedures for CO

(a) The owner or operator of a unit with a CO_2_ continuous emission monitoring system for determining CO_2_ mass emissions in accordance with § 75.10 (or an O_2_ monitor that is used to determine CO_2_ concentration in accordance with appendix F to this part) shall substitute for missing CO_2_ pollutant concentration data using the procedures of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. 


(b) During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification at a particular unit or stack location (*i.e.*, the date and time at which quality-assured data begins to be recorded by a CEMS at that location), or (when implementing these procedures for a previously certified CO_2_ monitoring system) during the 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours preceding implementation of the standard missing data procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall provide substitute CO_2_ pollutant concentration data or substitute CO_2_ data for heat input determination, as applicable, according to the procedures in § 75.31(b). 


(c) [Reserved] 


(d) Upon completion of 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours using the initial missing data procedures of § 75.31(b), the owner or operator shall provide substitute data for CO_2_ concentration or substitute CO_2_ data for heat input determination, as applicable, in accordance with the procedures in § 75.33(b) except that the term “CO_2_ concentration” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ concentration,” the term “CO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor” or “CO_2_ diluent monitor” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor,” and the term “maximum potential CO_2_ concentration, as defined in section 2.1.3.1 of appendix A to this part” shall apply, rather than “maximum potential SO_2_ concentration.”
