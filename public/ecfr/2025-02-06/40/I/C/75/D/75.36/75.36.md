# § 75.36   Missing data procedures for heat input rate determinations.

(a) When hourly heat input rate is determined using a flow monitoring system and a diluent gas (O_2_ or CO_2_) monitor, substitute data must be provided to calculate the heat input whenever quality-assured data are unavailable from the flow monitor, the diluent gas monitor, or both. When flow rate data are unavailable, substitute flow rate data for the heat input rate calculation shall be provided according to § 75.31 or § 75.33, as applicable. When diluent gas data are unavailable, the owner or operator shall provide substitute O_2_ or CO_2_ data for the heat input rate calculations in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. 


(b) During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification at a particular unit or stack location (*i.e.,* the date and time at which quality-assured data begins to be recorded by a CEMS at that location), or (when implementing these procedures for a previously certified CO_2_ or O_2_ monitor) during the 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours preceding implementation of the standard missing data procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall provide substitute CO_2_ or O_2_ data, as applicable, for the calculation of heat input (under section 5.2 of appendix F to this part) according to § 75.31(b).


(c) [Reserved]


(d) Upon completion of 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours using the initial missing data procedures of § 75.31(b), the owner or operator shall provide substitute data for CO_2_ or O_2_ concentration to calculate heat input rate, as follows. Substitute CO_2_ data for heat input rate determinations shall be provided according to § 75.35(d). Substitute O_2_ data for the heat input rate determinations shall be provided in accordance with the procedures in § 75.33(b), except that the term “O_2_ concentration” shall apply rather than the term “SO_2_ concentration” and the term “O_2_ diluent monitor” shall apply rather than the term “SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor.” In addition, the term “substitute the lesser of” shall apply rather than “substitute the greater of;” the terms “minimum hourly O_2_ concentration” and “minimum potential O_2_ concentration, as determined under section 2.1.3.2 of appendix A to this part” shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms “maximum hourly SO_2_ concentration” and “maximum potential SO_2_ concentration, as determined under section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part;” and the terms “10th percentile” and “5th percentile” shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms “90th percentile” and “95th percentile” (see Table 1 of § 75.33).
