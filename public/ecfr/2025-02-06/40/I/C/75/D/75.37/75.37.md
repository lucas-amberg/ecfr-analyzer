# § 75.37   Missing data procedures for moisture.

(a) The owner or operator of a unit with a continuous moisture monitoring system shall substitute for missing moisture data using the procedures of this section. 


(b) Where no prior quality-assured moisture data exist, substitute the minimum potential moisture percentage, from section 2.1.5 of appendix A to this part, except when Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NO_X_ emission rate. If Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NO_X_ emission rate, substitute the maximum potential moisture percentage, as specified in section 2.1.6 of appendix A to this part.


(c) During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification at a particular unit or stack location (*i.e.*, the date and time at which quality-assured data begins to be recorded by a moisture monitoring system at that location), the owner or operator shall provide substitute data for moisture according to § 75.31(b).


(d) Upon completion of the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification, the owner or operator shall provide substitute data for moisture as follows:


(1) Unless Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NO_X_ emission rate, follow the missing data procedures in § 75.33(b), except that the term “moisture percentage” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ concentration;” the term “moisture monitoring system” shall apply rather than the term “SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor;” the term “substitute the lesser of” shall apply rather than “substitute the greater of;” the terms “minimum hourly moisture percentage” and “minimum potential moisture percentage, as determined under section 2.1.5 of appendix A to this part” shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms “maximum hourly SO_2_ concentration” and “maximum potential SO_2_ concentration, as determined under section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part;” and the terms “10th percentile” and “5th percentile” shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms “90th percentile” and “95th percentile” (see Table 1 of § 75.33).


(2) When Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NO_X_ emission rate:


(i) Provided that none of the following equations is used to determine SO_2_ emissions, CO_2_ emissions or heat input: Equation F-2, F-14b, F-16, F-17, or F-18 in appendix F to this part, or Equation 19-5 or 19-9 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, use the missing data procedures in § 75.33(b), except that the term “moisture percentage” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ concentration,” the term “moisture monitoring system” shall apply rather than “SO_2_ pollutant concentration monitor,” and the term “maximum potential moisture percentage, as defined in section 2.1.6 of appendix A to this part” shall apply, rather than “maximum potential SO_2_ concentration;” or


(ii) If any of the following equations is used to determine SO_2_ emissions, CO_2_ emissions or heat input: Equation F-2, F-14b, F-16, F-17, or F-18 in appendix F to this part, or Equation 19-5 or 19-9 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, the owner or operator shall petition the Administrator under § 75.66(l) for permission to use an alternative moisture missing data procedure.
