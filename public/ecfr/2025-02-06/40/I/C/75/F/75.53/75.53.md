(i) *Electronic.* (A) Parameter monitored;


(B) Type of fuel measured, maximum fuel flow rate, units of measure, and basis of maximum fuel flow rate (*i.e.*, upper range value or unit maximum) for each fuel flowmeter;


(C) Test method used to check the accuracy of each fuel flowmeter;


(D) Monitoring system identification code;


(E) The method used to demonstrate that the unit qualifies for monthly GCV sampling or for daily or annual fuel sampling for sulfur content, as applicable; and

(ii) *Hardcopy.* (A) A schematic diagram identifying the relationship between the unit, all fuel supply lines, the fuel flowmeter(s), and the stack(s). The schematic diagram must depict the installation location of each fuel flowmeter and the fuel sampling location(s). Comprehensive and/or separate schematic diagrams shall be used to describe groups of units using a common pipe;


(B) For units using the optional default SO_2_ emission rate for “pipeline natural gas” or “natural gas” in appendix D to this part, the information on the sulfur content of the gaseous fuel used to demonstrate compliance with either section 2.3.1.4 or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to this part;


(C) For units using the 720 hour test under 2.3.6 of Appendix D of this part to determine the required sulfur sampling requirements, report the procedures and results of the test; and


(D) For units using the 720 hour test under 2.3.5 of Appendix D of this part to determine the appropriate fuel GCV sampling frequency, report the procedures used and the results of the test.


(2) For each gas-fired peaking unit and oil-fired peaking unit for which the owner or operator uses the optional procedures in appendix E to this part for estimating NO_X_ emission rate, the designated representative shall include in the monitoring plan:


(i) *Electronic.* Unit operating and capacity factor information demonstrating that the unit qualifies as a peaking unit, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter for the current calendar year or ozone season, including: capacity factor data for three calendar years (or ozone seasons) as specified in the definition of peaking unit in § 72.2 of this chapter; the method of qualification used; and an indication of whether the data are actual or projected data. On and after April 27, 2011, provide the activation date and deactivation date (if applicable) for the peaking unit qualification information in this paragraph (h)(2)(i).


(ii) *Hardcopy.* (A) A protocol containing methods used to perform the baseline or periodic NO_X_ emission test; and


(B) Unit operating parameters related to NO_X_ formation by the unit.


(3) For each gas-fired unit and diesel-fired unit or unit with a wet flue gas pollution control system for which the designated representative claims an opacity monitoring exemption under § 75.14, the designated representative shall include in the hardcopy monitoring plan the information specified under § 75.14(b), (c), or (d), demonstrating that the unit qualifies for the exemption.


(4) For each unit using the low mass emissions excepted methodology under § 75.19 the designated representative shall include the following additional information in the monitoring plan that accompanies the initial certification application:


(i) *Electronic.* For each low mass emissions unit, report the results of the analysis performed to qualify as a low mass emissions unit under § 75.19(c). This report will include either the previous three years actual or projected emissions. The following items should be included:


(A) Current calendar year of application;


(B) Type of qualification;


(C) Years one, two, and three;


(D) Annual and/or ozone season measured, estimated or projected NO_X_ mass emissions for years one, two, and three;


(E) Annual measured, estimated or projected SO_2_ mass emissions (if applicable) for years one, two, and three; and


(F) Annual or ozone season operating hours for years one, two, and three.


(ii) *Hardcopy.* (A) A schematic diagram identifying the relationship between the unit, all fuel supply lines and tanks, any fuel flowmeter(s), and the stack(s). Comprehensive and/or separate schematic diagrams shall be used to describe groups of units using a common pipe;


(B) For units which use the long term fuel flow methodology under § 75.19(c)(3), the designated representative must provide a diagram of the fuel flow to each affected unit or group of units and describe in detail the procedures used to determine the long term fuel flow for a unit or group of units for each fuel combusted by the unit or group of units;


(C) A statement that the unit burns only gaseous fuel(s) and/or fuel oil and a list of the fuels that are burned or a statement that the unit is projected to burn only gaseous fuel(s) and/or fuel oil and a list of the fuels that are projected to be burned;


(D) A statement that the unit meets the applicability requirements in § 75.19(a) and (b); and


(E) Any unit historical actual, estimated and projected emissions data and calculated emissions data demonstrating that the affected unit qualifies as a low mass emissions unit under § 75.19(a) and 75.19(b).


(5) For qualification as a gas-fired unit, as defined in § 72.2 of this part, the designated representative shall include in the monitoring plan, in electronic format, the following: current calendar year, fuel usage data for three calendar years (or ozone seasons) as specified in the definition of gas-fired in § 72.2 of this chapter, the method of qualification used, and an indication of whether the data are actual or projected data. On and after April 27, 2011, provide the activation date and deactivation date (if applicable) for the gas-fired unit qualification information in this paragraph (h)(5).
