# § 76.1   Applicability.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the provisions apply to each coal-fired utility unit that is subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation or reduction requirement for SO_2_ under Phase I or Phase II pursuant to sections 404, 405, or 409 of the Act.


(b) The emission limitations for NO_X_ under this part apply to each affected coal-fired utility unit subject to section 404(d) or 409(b) of the Act on the date the unit is required to meet the Acid Rain emissions reduction requirement for SO_2_.


(c) The provisions of this part apply to each coal-fired substitution unit or compensating unit, designated and approved as a Phase I unit pursuant to § 72.41 or § 72.43 of this chapter as follows:


(1) A coal-fired substitution unit that is designated in a substitution plan that is approved and active as of January 1, 1995 shall be treated as a Phase I coal-fired utility unit for purposes of this part. In the event the designation of such unit as a substitution unit is terminated after December 31, 1995, pursuant to § 72.41 of this chapter and the unit is no longer required to meet Phase I SO_2_ emissions limitations, the provisions of this part (including those applicable in Phase I) will continue to apply.


(2) A coal-fired substitution unit that is designated in a substitution plan that is not approved or not active as of January 1, 1995, or a coal-fired compensating unit, shall be treated as a Phase II coal-fired utility unit for purposes of this part.


(d) The provisions of this part for Phase I units apply to each coal-fired transfer unit governed by a Phase I extension plan, approved pursuant to § 72.42 of this chapter, on January 1, 1997. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a coal-fired transfer unit shall be subject to the Acid Rain emissions limitations for nitrogen oxides beginning on January 1, 1996 if, for that year, a transfer unit is allocated fewer Phase I extension reserve allowances than the maximum amount that the designated representative could have requested in accordance with § 72.42(c)(5) of this chapter (as adjusted under § 72.42(d) of this chapter) unless the transfer unit is the last unit allocated Phase I extension reserve allowances under the plan.
