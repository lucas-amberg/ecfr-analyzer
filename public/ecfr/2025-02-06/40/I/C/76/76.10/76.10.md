(f) *Permitting authority's action*—(1) *Alternative emission limitation demonstration period.* (i) The permitting authority may approve an alternative emission limitation demonstration period and demonstration period plan, provided that the requirements of this section are met to the satisfaction of the permitting authority. The permitting authority shall disapprove a demonstration period if the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section were not met during the operating period.


(ii) If the demonstration period is approved, the permitting authority will include, as part of the demonstration period, the 4 month period prior to submission of the application in the demonstration period.


(iii) The alternative emission limitation demonstration period will authorize the unit to emit at a rate not greater than the interim alternative emission limitation during the demonstration period on or after January 1, 1996 for Phase I units and the applicable date established in § 76.6 or 76.7 for Phase II units, and until the date that the Administrator approves or denies a final alternative emission limitation.


(iv) After an alternative emission limitation demonstration period is approved, if the designated representative requests an extension of the demonstration period in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the permitting authority may extend the demonstration period by administrative amendment (under § 72.83 of this chapter) to the Acid Rain permit.


(v) The permitting authority shall deny the demonstration period if the designated representative cannot demonstrate that the unit met the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In such cases, the permitting authority shall require that the owner or operator operate the unit in compliance with the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 for the period preceding the submission of the application for an alternative emission limitation demonstration period, including the operating period, if such periods are after the date on which the unit is subject to the standard limit under § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7.


(2) *Alternative emission limitation.* (i) If the permitting authority determines that the requirements in this section are met, the permitting authority will approve an alternative emission limitation and issue or revise an Acid Rain permit to apply the approved limitation, in accordance with subparts F and G of part 72 of this chapter. The permit will authorize the unit to emit at a rate not greater than the approved alternative emission limitation, starting the date the permitting authority revises an Acid Rain permit to approve an alternative emission limitation.


(ii) If a permitting authority disapproves an alternative emission limitation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall operate the affected unit in compliance with the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 (unless the unit is participating in an approved averaging plan under § 76.11) beginning on the date the permitting authority revises an Acid Rain permit to disapprove an alternative emission limitation.


(3) *Alternative emission limitation renewal.* (i) If, upon review of a petition to renew an approved alternative emission limitation, the permitting authority determines that no changes have been made to the control technology, its operation, the operating conditions on which the alternative emission limitation was based, or the actual NO_X_ emission rate, the alternative emission limitation will be renewed.


(ii) If the permitting authority determines that changes have been made to the control technology, its operation, the fuel quality, or the operating conditions on which the alternative emission limitation was based, the designated representative shall submit, in order to renew the alternative emission limitation or to obtain a new alternative emission limitation, a petition for an alternative emission limitation demonstration period that meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section using a new demonstration period.


(g) *Special provisions*—(1) *Alternative emission limitation demonstration period*—(i) *Emission limitations.* (A) Each unit with an approved alternative emission limitation demonstration period shall comply with the interim emission limitation specified in the unit's permit beginning on the effective date of the demonstration period specified in the permit and, if a timely petition for a final alternative emission limitation is submitted, extending until the date on which the permitting authority issues or revises an Acid Rain permit to approve or disapprove an alternative emission limitation. If a timely petition is not submitted, then the unit shall comply with the standard emission limit under § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 beginning on the date the petition was required to be submitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(B) When the owner or operator identifies, during the demonstration period, boiler operating or NO_X_ emission control system modifications or upgrades that would produce further NO_X_ emission reductions, enabling the affected unit to comply with or bring its emission rate closer to the applicable emissions limitation under § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7, the designated representative may submit a request and the permitting authority may grant, by administrative amendment under § 72.83 of this chapter, an extension of the demonstration period for such period of time (not to exceed 12 months) as may be necessary to implement such modifications or upgrades.


(C) If the approved interim alternative emission limitation applies to a unit for part, but not all, of a calendar year, the unit shall determine compliance for the calendar year in accordance with the procedures in § 76.13(a).


(ii) *Operating requirements.* (A) A unit with an approved alternative emission limitation demonstration period shall be operated under load dispatch conditions consistent with the operating conditions upon which the design of the NO_X_ emission control system and performance guarantee were based, and in accordance with the demonstration period plan.


(B) A unit with an approved alternative emission limitation demonstration period shall install all NO_X_ emission control systems, make any operational modifications, and complete any upgrades and maintenance to equipment specified in the approved demonstration period plan for optimizing NO_X_ emission reduction performance.


(C) When the owner or operator identifies boiler or NO_X_ emission control system operating modifications that would produce higher NO_X_ emission reductions, enabling the affected unit to comply with, or bring its emission rate closer to, the applicable emission limitation under § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7, the designated representative shall submit an administrative amendment under § 72.83 of this chapter to revise the unit's Acid Rain permit and demonstration period plan to include such modifications.


(iii) *Testing requirements.* A unit with an approved alternative emission limitation demonstration period shall monitor in accordance with part 75 of this chapter and shall conduct all tests required under the approved demonstration period plan.


(2) *Final alternative emission limitation*—(i) *Emission limitations.* (A) Each unit with an approved alternative emission limitation shall comply with the alternative emission limitation specified in the unit's permit beginning on the date specified in the permit as issued or revised by the permitting authority to apply the final alternative emission limitation.


(B) If the approved interim or final alternative emission limitation applies to a unit for part, but not all, of a calendar year, the unit shall determine compliance for the calendar year in accordance with the procedures in § 76.13(a).
