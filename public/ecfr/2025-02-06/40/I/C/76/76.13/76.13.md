# § 76.13   Compliance and excess emissions.

Excess emissions of nitrogen oxides under § 77.6 of this chapter shall be calculated as follows:


(a) For a unit that is not in an approved averaging plan:


(1) Calculate EE_i_ for each portion of the calendar year that the unit is subject to a different NO_X_ emission limitation:


(2) If EE_i_ is a negative number for any portion of the calendar year, the EE value for that portion of the calendar year shall be equal to zero (e.g., if EE_i_ = −100, then EE_i_ = 0).


(3) Sum all EE_i_ values for the calendar year:


(b) For units participating in an approved averaging plan, when all the requirements under § 76.11(d)(1) are not met,
