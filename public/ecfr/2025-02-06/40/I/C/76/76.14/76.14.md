# § 76.14   Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.

(a) A petition for an alternative emission limitation demonstration period under § 76.10(d) shall include the following information:


(1) In accordance with § 76.10(d)(4), the following information:


(i) Documentation that the owner or operator solicited bids for a NO_X_ emission control system designed for application to the specific boiler and designed to achieve the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 on an annual average basis. This documentation must include a copy of all bid specifications.


(ii) A copy of the performance guarantee submitted by the vendor of the installed NO_X_ emission control system to the owner or operator showing that such system was designed to meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 on an annual average basis.


(iii) Documentation describing the operational and combustion conditions that are the basis of the performance guarantee.


(iv) Certification by the primary vendor of the NO_X_ emission control system that such equipment and associated auxiliary equipment was properly installed according to the modifications and procedures specified by the vendor.


(v) Certification by the designated representative that the owner(s) or operator installed technology that meets the requirements of § 76.10(a)(2).


(2) In accordance with § 76.10(d)(9), the following information:


(i) The operating conditions of the NO_X_ emission control system including load range, O_2_ range, coal volatile matter range, and, for tangentially fired boilers, distribution of combustion air within the NO_X_ emission control system;


(ii) Certification by the designated representative that the owner(s) or operator have achieved and are following the operating conditions, boiler modifications, and upgrades that formed the basis for the system design and performance guarantee;


(iii) Any planned equipment modifications and upgrades for the purpose of achieving the maximum NO_X_ reduction performance of the NO_X_ emission control system that were not included in the design specifications and performance guarantee, but that were achieved prior to submission of this application and are being followed;


(iv) A list of any modifications or replacements of equipment that are to be done prior to the completion of the demonstration period for the purpose of reducing emissions of NO_X_; and


(v) The parametric testing that will be conducted to determine the reason or reasons for the failure of the unit to achieve the applicable emission limitation and to verify the proper operation of the installed NO_X_ emission control system during the demonstration period. The tests shall include tests in § 76.15, which may be modified as follows:


(A) The owner or operator of the unit may add tests to those listed in § 76.15, if such additions provide data relevant to the failure of the installed NO_X_ emission control system to meet the applicable emissions limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7; or


(B) The owner or operator of the unit may remove tests listed in § 76.15 that are shown, to the satisfaction of the permitting authority, not to be relevant to NO_X_ emissions from the affected unit; and


(C) In the event the performance guarantee or the NO_X_ emission control system specifications require additional tests not listed in § 76.15, or specify operating conditions not verified by tests listed in § 76.15, the owner or operator of the unit shall include such additional tests.


(3) In accordance with § 76.10(d)(10), the following information for the operating period:


(i) The average NO_X_ emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) of the specific unit;


(ii) The highest hourly NO_X_ emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) of the specific unit;


(iii) Hourly NO_X_ emission rate (in lb/mmBtu), calculated in accordance with part 75 of this chapter;


(iv) Total heat input (in mmBtu) for the unit for each hour of operation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter; and


(v) Total integrated hourly gross unit load (in MWge).


(b) A petition for an alternative emission limitation shall include the following information in accordance with § 76.10(e)(6).


(1) Total heat input (in mmBtu) for the unit for each hour of operation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter;


(2) Hourly NO_X_ emission rate (in lb/mmBtu), calculated in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter; and


(3) Total integrated hourly gross unit load (MWge).


(c) *Reporting of the costs of low NO*_X_*burner technology applied to Group 1, Phase I boilers.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the designated representative of a Phase I unit with a Group 1 boiler that has installed or is installing any form of low NO_X_ burner technology shall submit to the Administrator a report containing the capital cost, operating cost, and baseline and post-retrofit emission data specified in appendix B to this part. If any of the required equipment, cost, and schedule information are not available (e.g., the retrofit project is still underway), the designated representative shall include in the report detailed cost estimates and other projected or estimated data in lieu of the information that is not available.


(2) The report under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not required with regard to the following types of Group 1, Phase I units:


(i) Units employing no new NO_X_ emission control system after November 15, 1990;


(ii) Units employing modifications to boiler operating parameters (e.g., burners out of service or fuel switching) without low NO_X_ burners or other emission reduction equipment for reducing NO_X_ emissions;


(iii) Units with wall-fired boilers employing only overfire air and units with tangentially fired boilers employing only separated overfire air; or


(iv) Units beginning installation of a new NO_X_ emission control system after August 11, 1995.


(3) The report under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator by:


(i) 120 days after completion of the low NO_X_ burner technology retrofit project; or


(ii) May 23, 1995, if the project was completed on or before January 23, 1995.
