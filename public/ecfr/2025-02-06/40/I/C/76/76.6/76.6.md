# § 76.6   NO

(a) Beginning January 1, 2000 or, for a unit subject to section 409(b) of the Act, the date on which the unit is required to meet Acid Rain emission reduction requirements for SO_2_, the owner or operator of a Group 2, coal-fired boiler with a cell burner boiler, cyclone boiler, a wet bottom boiler, or a vertically fired boiler shall not discharge, or allow to be discharged, emissions of NO_X_ to the atmosphere in excess of the following limits, except as provided in §§ 76.10 or 76.11:


(1) 0.68 lb/mmBtu of heat input on an annual average basis for cell burner boilers. The NO_X_ emission control technology on which the emission limitation is based is plug-in combustion controls or non-plug-in combustion controls. Except as provided in § 76.5(d), the owner or operator of a unit with a cell burner boiler that installs non-plug-in combustion controls shall comply with the emission limitation applicable to cell burner boilers. 


(2) 0.86 lb/mmBtu of heat input on an annual average basis for cyclone boilers with a Maximum Continuous Steam Flow at 100% of Load of greater than 1060, in thousands of lb/hr. The NO_X_ emission control technology on which the emission limitation is based is natural gas reburning or selective catalytic reduction.


(3) 0.84 lb/mmBtu of heat input on an annual average basis for wet bottom boilers, with a Maximum Continuous Steam Flow at 100% of Load of greater than 450, in thousands of lb/hr. The NO_X_ emission control technology on which the emission limitation is based is natural gas reburning or selective catalytic reduction.


(4) 0.80 lb/mmBtu of heat input on an annual average basis for vertically fired boilers. The NO_X_ emission control technology on which the emission limitation is based is combustion controls.


(b) The owner or operator shall determine the annual average NO_X_ emission rate, in lb/mmBtu, using the methods and procedures specified in part 75 of this chapter.
