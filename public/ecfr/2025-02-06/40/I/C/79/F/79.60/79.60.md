# § 79.60   Good laboratory practices (GLP) standards for inhalation exposure health effects testing.

(a) *General Provisions*—(1) *Scope.* (i) This section prescribes good laboratory practices (GLPs) for conducting inhalation exposure studies relating to motor vehicle emissions health effects testing under this part. These directions are intended to ensure the quality and integrity of health effects data submitted pursuant to registration regulations issued under sections 211(b) or 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7545).


(ii) This section applies to any study described by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section which any person conducts, initiates, or supports on or after May 27, 1994.


(iii) It is EPA's policy that all health effects data developed under sections 211(b) and (e) of CAA be in accordance with provisions of this section. If data are not developed in accordance with the provisions of this section, EPA may consider such data insufficient to evaluate the health effects of a motor vehicle's fuel or fuel additive emissions, unless the submitter provides additional information demonstrating that the data are reliable and adequate and EPA determines that the data are sufficient.
