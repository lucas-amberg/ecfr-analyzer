(c) *Reporting.* The biogas producer must submit reports to EPA under §§ 80.140 and 80.1451, as applicable.


(d) *Recordkeeping.* The biogas producer must create and maintain records under §§ 80.145 and 80.1454.


(e) *PTDs.* On each occasion when the biogas producer transfers title of any biogas, the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs under § 80.150.


(f) *Sampling, testing, and measurement.* (1) All sampling, testing, and measurements must be done in accordance with § 80.155.


(2)(i) A biogas producer must measure the volume of biogas, in Btu HHV, prior to converting biogas to any of the following:


(A) RNG.


(B) Treated biogas.


(C) Biointermediate.


(D) Biogas-derived renewable fuel.


(E) Process heat or energy under § 80.1426(f)(12) or (13).


(ii) Except for biogas produced from a mixed digester, a biogas producer must measure the volume of biogas, in Btu HHV, for each batch pathway prior to mixing with biogas produced under a different batch pathway or with non-qualifying gas.


(iii) For biogas produced from a mixed digester, a biogas producer must do all the following for each mixed digester:


(A) Measure the volume of biogas, in Btu HHV, prior to mixing with any other gas.


(B) Measure the daily mass of the cellulosic biogas feedstock, in pounds, added to the mixed digester.


(C) Collect a daily representative sample of each cellulosic biogas feedstock and test for total solids and volatile solids as specified in § 80.155(c).


(D) Measure and calculate the digester operating conditions as specified in § 80.155(d).


(iv) A biogas producer must measure each volume of gas containing biogas, in Btu HHV, that leaves the facility.


(g) *Foreign biogas producer requirements.* A foreign biogas producer must meet all the requirements that apply to a biogas producer under this part, as well as the additional requirements for foreign biogas producers specified in § 80.160.


(h) *Attest engagements.* The biogas producer must submit annual attest engagement reports to EPA under §§ 80.165 and 80.1464 using procedures specified in 40 CFR 1090.1800 and 1090.1805.


(i) *QAP.* Prior to the generation of Q-RINs for a biogas-derived renewable fuel, the biogas producer must meet all applicable requirements specified in § 80.170.


(j) *Batches.* (1) Except for biogas produced from a mixed digester, the batch volume of biogas is the volume of biogas measured under paragraph (f) of this section for a single batch pathway at a single facility for a calendar month, in Btu HHV.


(2) For biogas produced from a mixed digester, the batch volume of biogas must be calculated as follows:


(i) The batch volume of biogas produced under an approved pathway with a D code of 5 must be calculated as follows:


(ii) The batch volume of biogas produced under an approved pathway with a D code of 3 or 7 must be calculated as follows:


(iii) The biogas energy value for each cellulosic biogas feedstock must be calculated as follows:


(iv) Biogas producers must use one of the following cellulosic conversion factors, as applicable:


(A) Swine manure: 1,936 Btu HHV/lb.


(B) Bovine manure: 2,077 Btu HHV/lb.


(C) Chicken manure: 3,001 Btu HHV/lb.


(D) Municipal wastewater treatment sludge: 3,479 Btu HHV/lb.


(E) A cellulosic conversion factor accepted at registration under § 80.135(c)(10)(vi).


(v) Applicable operating conditions for the cellulosic converted fractions specified in paragraph (j)(2)(iv) of this section are the following:


(A) For the cellulosic converted fraction values specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section, the mixed digester must continuously operate above 95 degrees Fahrenheit with hydraulic and solids mean residence times greater than 20 days.


(B) For the cellulosic converted fraction value specified in paragraph (j)(2)(iv)(E) of this section, the mixed digester must operate according to the conditions accepted at registration under § 80.135(c)(10)(vi)(A)(*4*).


(3) The biogas producer must assign a number (the “batch number”) to each batch of biogas consisting of their EPA-issued company registration number, the EPA-issued facility registration number, the last two digits of the calendar year in which the batch was produced, and a unique number for the batch, beginning with the number one for the first batch produced each calendar year and each subsequent batch during the calendar year being assigned the next sequential number (*e.g.,* 4321-54321-23-000001, 4321-54321-23-000002, etc.).


(k) *Limitations.* (1) For each biogas production facility, the biogas producer must only supply biogas for only one of the following uses:


(i) Production of renewable CNG/LNG via a biogas closed distribution system.


(ii) As a biointermediate via a biogas closed distribution system.


(iii) Production of RNG.


(2) For each biogas production facility producing biogas for use as a biointermediate in a biogas closed distribution system, the biogas producer must only supply biogas or treated biogas to a single renewable fuel production facility.


(3) If the biogas producer operates a municipal wastewater treatment facility digester, the biogas producer must not introduce any feedstocks into that digester that do not contain at least 75% average adjusted cellulosic content.


(4) The transfer and batch segregation limits specified in § 80.1476(g) do not apply.
