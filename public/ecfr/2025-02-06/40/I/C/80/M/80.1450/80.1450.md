(*1*) A Risk Mitigation Plan (Plan) that demonstrates the growth of *Arundo donax* or *Pennisetum purpureum* will not pose a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel. The Plan must identify and incorporate best management practices (BMPs) into the production, management, transport, collection, monitoring, and processing of the feedstock. To the extent practicable, the Risk Mitigation Plan should utilize a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach to examine each phase of the pathway to identify spread reduction steps. BMPs should include the development of mitigation strategies and plans to minimize escape and other impacts (e.g., minimize soil disturbance), incorporate desirable traits (e.g., sterility or reduced seed production), develop and implement dispersal mitigation protocols prior to cultivation, develop multiple year eradication controls. Eradication controls should follow an approach of early detection and rapid response (EDRR) to unintended spread. EDRR efforts should demonstrate the likelihood that invasions will be halted while still localized and identify and employ cooperative networks, communication forums, and consultation processes with federal, state, and local agencies. The Risk Mitigation Plan must provide for the following:


(*i*) Monitoring and reporting data for a period prior to planting that is sufficient to establish a baseline, through crop production, and extending beyond crop production for a sufficient period after the field is no longer used for feedstock production to ensure no remnants of giant reed or napier grass survive or spread.


(*ii*) Monitoring must include the area encompassing the feedstock growing areas, the transportation corridor between the growing areas and the renewable fuel production facility, and the renewable fuel production facility, extending to the distance of potential propagation of the feedstock species, or further if necessary.


(*iii*) Monitoring must reflect the likelihood of spread specific to the feedstock.


(*iv*) A closure plan providing for the destruction and removal of feedstock from the growing area upon abandonment by the feedstock grower or end of production.


(*v*) A plan providing for an independent third party who will audit the monitoring and reporting conducted in accordance with the Plan on an annual basis, subject to approval of a different frequency by EPA.


(*2*) A letter from the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to the renewable fuel producer stating USDA's conclusions and the bases therefore regarding whether the *Arundo donax* or *Pennisetum purpureum* does or does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel as proposed by the producer. This letter shall also include USDA's recommendation of whether it is appropriate to require the use of a financial mechanism to ensure the availability of financial resources sufficient to cover reasonable potential remediation costs associated with the invasive spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas. In coordination with USDA, EPA shall identify for the producer the appropriate USDA office from which the letter should originate.


(*3*) Identification of all federal, state, regional, and local requirements related to invasive species that are applicable for the feedstock at the growing site and at all points between the growing site and the fuel production site.


(*4*) A copy of all state and local growing permits held by the feedstock grower.


(*5*) A communication plan for notifying EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, USDA, adjacent federal land management agencies, and any relevant state, tribal, regional, and local authorities as soon as possible after identification of the issue if the feedstock is detected outside planted area.


(*6*) A copy of the agreement between the feedstock grower and fuel producer establishing all rights and duties of the parties related to the Risk Mitigation Plan and any other activities and liability associated with the prevention of the spread of *Arundo donax* and/or *Pennisetum purpureum* outside of the intended planting area.


(*7*) A copy of the agreement between the fuel producer and an independent third party describing how the third party will audit the monitoring and reporting conducted in accordance with the Risk Mitigation Plan on an annual basis, subject to approval of a different timeframe by EPA.


(*8*) Information on the financial resources or other financial mechanism (such as a state-administered fund, bond, or certificate of deposit) that would be available to finance reasonable remediation activities associated with the potential spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas, and information on whether it is necessary to have any further such resources or mechanism. EPA may require a demonstration that there is an adequate financial mechanism (such as a state-administered fund, bond, or certificate of deposit) to ensure the availability of financial resources sufficient to cover reasonable potential remediation costs associated with the spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas.


(*9*) EPA may require additional information as appropriate.


(B) For a producer of renewable fuel made from *Arundo donax* or *Pennisetum purpureum* per § 80.1426(f)(14)(ii):


(*1*) Clear and compelling evidence, including information and supporting data, demonstrating that *Arundo donax* or *Pennisetum purpureum* does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel. Evidence must include data collected from similar environments (soils, temperatures, precipitation, USDA Hardiness Zones) as the proposed feedstock production project site and accepted by the scientific community. Such a demonstration should include consideration of the elements of a Risk Mitigation Plan set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(x)(A) of this section, fully disclose the potential invasiveness of the feedstock, provide a closure plan for the destruction and removal of feedstock from the growing area upon abandonment by the feedstock grower or end of production, and explain why a Risk Mitigation Plan is not needed to make the required determination.


(*2*) A letter from the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to the renewable fuel producer stating USDA's conclusions and the bases therefore regarding whether the *Arundo donax* or *Pennisetum purpureum* does or does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel as proposed by the producer or importer. In coordination with USDA, EPA shall identify for the producer the appropriate USDA office from which the letter should originate.
