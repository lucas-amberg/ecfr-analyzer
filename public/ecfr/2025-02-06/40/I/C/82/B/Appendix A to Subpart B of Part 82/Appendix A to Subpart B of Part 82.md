# Appendix A to Subpart B of Part 82—Standard for Recycle/Recover Equipment


Due to the CFC's damaging effect on the ozone layer, recycle of CFC-12 (R-12) used in mobile air-conditioning systems is required to reduce system venting during normal service operations. Establishing recycle specifications for R-12 will assure that system operation with recycled R-12 will provide the same level of performance as new refrigerant.


Extensive field testing with the EPA and the auto industry indicate that reuse of R-12 removed from mobile air-conditioning systems can be considered, if the refrigerant is cleaned to a specific standard. The purpose of this standard is to establish the specific minimum levels of R-12 purity required for recycled R-12 removed from mobile automotive air-conditioning systems.


This information applies to refrigerant used to service automobiles, light trucks, and other vehicles with similar CFC-12 systems. Systems used on mobile vehicles for refrigerated cargo that have hermetically sealed, rigid pipe are not covered in this document.


The refrigerant in this document shall have been directly removed from, and intended to be returned to, a mobile air-conditioning system. The contaminants in this recycled refrigerant 12 shall be limited to moisture, refrigerant oil, and noncondensable gases, which shall not exceed the following level:


3.1 *Moisture:* 15 ppm by weight.


3.2 *Refrigerant Oil:* 4000 ppm by weight.


3.3 *Noncondensable Gases (air):* 330 ppm by wright.


4.1 The equipment shall meet SAE J1990, which covers additional moisture, acid, and filter requirements.


4.2 The equipment shall have a label indicating that it is certified to meet this document.


Purity specification of recycled R-12 refrigerant supplied in containers from other recycle sources, for service of mobile air-conditioning systems, shall meet ARI Standard 700-88 (Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute).


This shall be done in accordance with SAE J1989.

During service of mobile air-conditioning systems, containment of the refrigerant is important. This procedure provides service guidelines for technicians when repairing vehicles and operating equipment defined in SAE J1990.


3. 1 Connect the recovery unit service hoses, which shall have shutoff valves within 12 in (30 cm) of the service ends, to the vehicle air-conditioning system service ports.


3.2 Operate the recovery equipment as covered by the equipment manufacturers recommended procedure.


3.2.1 Start the recovery process and remove the refrigerant from the vehicle AC system. Operate the recovery unit until the vehicle system has been reduced from a pressure to a vacuum. With the recovery unit shut off for at least 5 min, determine that there is no refrigerant remaining in the vehicle AC system. If the vehicle system has pressure, additional recovery operation is required to remove the remaining refrigerant. Repeat the operation until the vehicle AC system vacuum level remains stable for 2 min.


3.3 Close the valves in the service lines and then remove the service lines from the vehicle system. Proceed with the repair/service. If the recovery equipment has automatic closing valves, be sure they are properly operating.


4.1 Service hoses must have shutoff valves in the high, low, and center service hoses within 12 in (30 cm) of the service ends. Valves must be closed prior to hose removal from the air-conditioning system. This will reduce the volume of refrigerant contained in the service hose that would otherwise be vented to atmosphere.


4.2 During all service operations, the valves should be closed until connected to the vehicle air-conditioning system or the charging source to avoid introduction of air and to contain the refrigerant rather than vent open to atmosphere.


4.3 When the manifold gage set is disconnected from the air-conditioning system or when the center hose is moved to another device which cannot accept refrigerant pressure, the gage set hoses should first be attached to the reclaim equipment to recover the refrigerant from the hoses.


5.1 To determine if the recycled refrigerant container has excess noncondensable gases (air), the container must be stored at a temperature of 65 °F (18.3 °C) or above for a period of time, 12 h, protected from direct sun.


5.2 Install a calibrated pressure gage, with 1 psig divisions (0.07 kg), to the container and determine the container pressure.


5.3 With a calibrated thermometer, measure the air temperature within 4 in (10 cm) of the container surface.


5.4 Compare the observed container pressure and air temperature to determine if the container exceeds the pressure limits found on Table 1, e.g., air temperature 70 °F (21 °C) pressure must not exceed 80 psig (5.62 kg/cm 
2).


5.5 If the container pressure is less than the Table 1 values and has been recycled, limits of noncondensable gases (air) have not been exceeded and the refrigerant may be used.


5.6 If the pressure is greater than the range and the container contains recycled material, slowly vent from the top of the container a small amount of vapor into the recycle equipment until the pressure is less than the pressure shown on Table 1.


5.7 If the container still exceeds the pressure shown on Table 1, the entire contents of the container shall be recycled.


6.1 Recycled refrigerant should not be salvaged or stored in disposable refrigerant containers. This is the type of container in which virgin refrigerant is sold. Use only DOT CFR title 49 or UL approved storage containers for recycled refrigerant.


6.2 Any container of recycled refrigerant that has been stored or transferred must be checked prior to use as defined in section 5.


7.1 When external portable containers are used for transfer, the container must be evacuated at least 27 in of vacuum (75 mm Hg absolute pressure) prior to transfer of the recycled refrigerant. External portable containers must meet DOT and UL standards.


7.2 To prevent on-site overfilling when transferring to external containers, the safe filling level must be controlled by weight and must not exceed 60% of container gross weight rating.


8.1 Since all the refrigerant may not be removed from disposable refrigerant containers during normal system charging procedures, empty/near empty container contents should be reclaimed prior to disposal of the container. 


8.2 Attach the container to the recovery unit and remove the remaining refrigerant. When the container has been reduced from a pressure to a vacuum, the container valve can be closed. The container should be marked empty and is ready for disposal.
