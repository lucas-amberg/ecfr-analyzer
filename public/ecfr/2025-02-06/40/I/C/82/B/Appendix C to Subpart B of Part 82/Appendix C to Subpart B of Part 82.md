# Appendix C to Subpart B of Part 82—SAE J2788 Standard for Recovery/Recycle and Recovery/Recycle/Recharging Equipment for HFC-134

This Appendix establishes the specific minimum equipment requirements for the recovery/recycling of HFC-134a that has been directly removed from, and is intended for reuse in, mobile air-conditioning systems and recovery/recycling and system recharging of recycled, reclaimed or virgin HFC-134a. Establishing such specifications will ensure that system operation with recycled HFC-134a will provide the same level of performance and durability as new refrigerant.


The purpose of this SAE Standard is to establish the specific minimum equipment performance requirements for recovery and recycling of HFC-134a that has been directly removed from, and is intended for reuse in, mobile air-conditioning (A/C) systems. It also is intended to establish requirements for equipment used to recharge HFC-134a to an accuracy level that meets Section 9 of this document and SAE J2099. The requirements apply to the following types of service equipment and their specific applications.


a. Recovery/Recycling Equipment,


b. Recovery/Recycling—Refrigerant Charging,


c. Refrigerant Recharging Equipment Only.


1.1 Improved refrigerant recovery equipment is required to ensure adequate refrigerant recovery to reduce emissions and provide for accurate recharging of mobile air conditioning systems. Therefore, 12 months following the publication date of this standard, requirements in this standard supplements and supersedes, SAE J2210.


The following publications form a part of this specification to the extent specified herein. Unless otherwise indicated, the latest issue of SAE publications shall apply.

6.2 The equipment manufacturer must provide operating instructions, including proper attainment of vehicle system vacuum (i.e., when to stop the extraction process), filter/desiccant replacement, and purging of noncondensable gases (air). Also to be included are any other necessary maintenance procedures, source information for replacement parts and, repair and safety precautions.


6.2.1 The manual shall identify the proper maintaining of hose and seals to prevent the addition of excess air, due to leaks, during the recovery process, which would increase the NCG level in the recovered refrigerant.


6.3 The equipment must prominently display the manufacturer's name, address, the type of refrigerant it is designed to recycle, a service telephone number, and the part number for the replacement filter/drier.


The ability of the equipment to meet the refrigerant recovery and recharge specifications of this section shall be determined by the test procedures of Section 10.


7.1 The equipment must be capable of continuous operation in ambient temperatures of 10 °C (50 °F) to 49 °C (120 °F). Continuous is defined as completing recovery/recycle and recharge (if applicable) operations with no more than a brief reset period between vehicles, and shall not include time delays for allowing a system to outgas (which shall be part of the recovery period provided by this standard). Continuous may include time out for an air purge if necessary, although it is understood that extended equipment-off time is preferred to allow NCG and refrigerant separation in the supply tank for optimum results.


7.1.1 The equipment shall be capable of removing a minimum of 95.0% of the refrigerant from the test system in 30 minutes or less, without external heating, or use of any device (such as shields, reflectors, special lights, etc.) which could heat components of the system. The recovery procedures shall be based on 21 to 24 °C (70 to 75 °F) ambient temperature. The test system for qualifying shall be a 1.4 kg (3.0 lbs) capacity orifice tube/accumulator system in a 2005 Chevrolet Suburban with front and rear A/C, or the test option described in 10.5, and shall be determined by accurately weighing the recovery machine with the resolution and accuracy of within 3 g (.006 lb) in the range of the machine's weight. The laboratory shall maintain records of the vehicle, including its VIN (vehicle identification number).


7.1.2 However, the preceding shall not preclude a brief period of engine operation at fast idle (up to 15 minutes, up to 2000 rpm) to circulate refrigerant and oil, and provide some engine and warm-up of A/C refrigeration components. The laboratory shall monitor coolant temperature per the vehicle engine coolant temperature sensor, and coolant temperature shall not be allowed to exceed 105 °C (221 °F). The time required shall not be included in the total time of 30 minutes set forth in 7.1.1.


7.1.3 The refrigerant that is recovered, following oil separation, shall be measured and the quantity displayed, accurate to within ±30 g (1.0 oz). The equipment must include a provision for checking the accuracy, per the requirements of 9.1.


7.2 During recovery operation, the equipment shall provide overfill protection to assure that the liquid fill of the storage container (which may be integral or external) does not exceed 80% of the tank's rated volume at 21 °C per Department of Transportation (DOT) Standard, CFR Title 49, Section 173.304 and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.


7.3 Portable refillable tanks or containers used in conjunction with this equipment must be labeled “HFC-134a (R-134a),” meet applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) or Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Standards, and shall incorporate fittings per SAE J2197.


7.3.1 The cylinder valve shall comply with the standard for cylinder valves, UL 1769.


7.3.2 The pressure relief device shall comply with the Pressure Relief Device Standard Part 1—Cylinders for Compressed Gases, CGA Pamphlet S-1.1.


7.3.3 The tank assembly shall be marked to indicate the first retest date, which shall be 5 years after the date of manufacture. The marking shall indicate that retest must be performed every subsequent 5 years. SAE J2296 provides an inspection procedure. The marking shall be in letters at least 6 mm (
1/4 in) high.


7.3.4 ASME tanks as defined in UL-1963 may be used and are exempt from the retest requirements.


7.3.5 If the machine is designed for recharging, and the marketer permits use of a non-refillable refrigerant tank, the machine shall include a way to ensure refrigerant remaining in the tank (called the “heel”) to no more than 2% of tank rated capacity when the tank is indicated to be empty. This may be done by the machine marketer as follows:


• Specify a non-venting procedure, to minimize the amount of unused refrigerant remaining in the tank. The machine shall include any devices required for the procedure, other than ordinary service shop tools and supplies, and include in the operator's manual, any instructions.


• Provide an automatic or (with instructions in the operator's manual) semi-automatic non-venting procedure with the machine.


The laboratory shall test for the 2% capability. For testing purposes it may use a refillable tank, minimum 15 lb capacity (6.8 kg) containing a minimum of 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) refrigerant. The test is as follows:


a. Weigh the tank at the start of the test, on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams, to ensure it contains sufficient refrigerant.


b. Operate the machine to remove refrigerant from the tank, charging into a holding container until the tank is indicated to be empty. Continue with the marketer's recommended procedure for the 2% capability.


c. Weigh the tank, on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams.


d. Using the recovery compressor and/or a vacuum pump, draw the tank into a vacuum of 9 to 10 inches Mercury (225 to 250 mm Mercury). The tank must hold that vacuum with a decay of less than 10% in 10 minutes. If vacuum decays 10% or more, the procedure shall be repeated as necessary to ensure the tank is empty.


e. Weigh the tank on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams. The difference in weight from Steps 3 to 5 shall be within 2% of the weight of the amount of refrigerant that is the tanks rated capacity.


f. This test may be performed at the conclusion of testing in 10.4 or 10.5. If the machine passes or has passed all other testing in this standard, the marketer may make modifications in procedure and/or machine operation and retest once at a later date, within 90 days. If the machine fails the retest, the machine must be completely retested per this standard, or may be certified per the following alternative. The marketer of the machine may specify use of a non-refillable refrigerant tank that provides for recycling and/or disposal of the residual refrigerant, in either case in a manner that does not vent. Or the marketer may exclude use of a one-way container, in the machine's operating instructions.


7.4 All flexible hoses must comply with SAE J2196.


7.5 Service hoses must have shutoff devices located at the connection point to the system being serviced. Any hoses or lines connected to refrigerant containers on or in the machine also shall have shutoff devices at the connection points, so that the containers may be changed without loss of refrigerant. A tank that is a permanent installation is exempt from this requirement.


7.6 The equipment shall separate oil from the refrigerant, measure the amount accurate to 20 ml (0.7 oz.), so the technician has an accurate basis for adding oil to the system.


7.6.1 This statement shall be predominately identified in the equipment service manual.


This test procedure and its requirements are to be used to determine the ability of the recycling equipment to adequately recycle contaminated refrigerant.


8.1 The equipment shall be able to clean the contaminated refrigerant in § 8.3 to the purity level defined in SAE J2099.


8.2 The equipment shall be operated in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions.


8.3.1 The standard contaminated refrigerant shall consist of liquid HFC-134a with 1300 ppm (by weight) moisture (equivalent to saturation at 38 °C, 100 °F), 45000 ppm (by weight) HFC-134a compatible lubricant, and 1000 ppm (by weight) of noncondensable gases (air).


8.3.1.1 The HFC-134a compatible lubricant referred to in 8.3.1, shall be polyalkylene glycol (PAG), ISO 100 such as UCLN or PAG ISO 46-55, such as Idemitsu or equivalent, which shall contain no more than 1000 ppm by weight of moisture.


8.3.1.2 Although the test lubricant is a PAG, to conform to that used in the test vehicle system, the equipment manufacturer also shall ensure that it is compatible with polyol ester lubricant, such as ND 11 as used in electrically driven compressors in some hybrid vehicles.


8.4.1 The equipment must be preconditioned by processing 13.6 kg (30 lb) of the standard contaminated HFC-134a at an ambient of 21 to 24 °C (70 to 75 °F) before starting the test cycle. 1.13 kg (2.56 lb) samples are to be processed at 5 min intervals. The test fixture, depicted in Figure 1, shall be operated at 21 to 24 °C (70 to 75 °F).


8.4.2 Following the preconditioning procedure per 8.4.1, 18.2 kg (40 lb) of standard contaminated HFC-134a are to be processed by the equipment.


8.5.1 Samples of the standard contaminated refrigerant from 8.3.1 shall be processed as required in 8.6 and shall be analyzed after said processing as defined in 8.7, 8.8, and 8.9. Note exception for noncondensable gas determination in 8.9.4.


8.6.1 The HFC-134a is to be cleaned to the purity level, as defined in SAE J2099, with the equipment operating in a stable ambient of 10, 21, and 49 °C (50, 70 and 120 °F) while processing the samples as defined in 8.4.


8.7.1 The recycled liquid phase sample of HFC-134a shall be analyzed for moisture content via Karl Fischer coulometric titration, or an equivalent method. The Karl Fischer apparatus is an instrument for precise determination of small amounts of water dissolved in liquid and/or gas samples.


8.7.2 In conducting this test, a weighed sample of 30 to 130 g is vaporized directly into the Karl Fischer anolyte. A coulometric titration is conducted and the results are reported as parts per million moisture (weight).


8.8 Determination of Percent Lubricant 8.8.1 The amount of lubricant in the recycled HFC-134a sample shall be determined via gravimetric analysis. The methodology must account for the hygroscopicity of the lubricant.


8.8.2 Following venting of noncondensable gases in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions, the refrigerant container shall be shaken for 5 min prior to extracting samples for testing.


8.8.3 A weighed sample of 175 to 225 g of liquid HFC-134a is allowed to evaporate at room temperature. The percent lubricant is calculated from weights of the original sample and the residue remaining after evaporation.


8.9.1 The amount of noncondensable gases shall be determined by gas chromatography. A sample of vaporized refrigerant liquid shall be separated and analyzed by gas chromatography. A Porapak Q column at 130 °C (266 °F) and a hot wire detector may be used for the analysis.


8.9.2 This test shall be conducted on liquid phase samples of recycled refrigerant taken from a full container as defined in 7.2 within 30 min following the proper venting of noncondensable gases.


8.9.3 The liquid phase samples in 8.9.2 shall be vaporized completely prior to gas chromatographic analysis.


8.9.4 This test shall be conducted at 10 and 49 °C (50 and 120 °F) and may be performed in conjunction with the testing defined in 8.6. The equipment shall process at least 13.6 kg (30 lb) of standard contaminated refrigerant for this test.


8.9.5 The equipment shall be capable of charging refrigerant into systems with various lubrication types and shall deliver less than 1% by weight residual oil during system charge if the machine permits oil charging with refrigerant (due to residual oil in the service hoses and recovery unit refrigerant circuit from prior recovery, diagnostics and oil injection. This shall be determined during SAE J2099 testing.)


9.1 It is the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer to ensure that the vacuum removal performance leaves the system 98% free of NCGs before recharging, following recovery and recycle under the provisions of this document.


The equipment must be capable of both indicating and recharging the system to within 15 g (0.50 oz) of vehicle manufacturer's specifications. The laboratory shall test for this capability by choosing a charge amount that is within the range of the vehicle manufacturer's specifications. The equipment must indicate and charge the system with that chosen amount, within ±15 g (0.5 oz). 


9.2 If any other system is used for charge determination, such as a positive displacement pump, the equipment manufacturer shall provide a method and any needed device(s) to check accuracy that is/are appropriate for its method of operation, including any temperature-compensating trim if used.


10.1 Preliminary: Ambient (in shop) temperature shall be 21 to 24 °C (70 to 75 °F). Test vehicle shall be “overnight cold” (not run for at least eight hours).


10.2 The machine must have a self-contained provision for checking accuracy of the indicated amount of refrigerant recovered in liquid or vapor or mixture form(s) from a vehicle system and (if applicable) charged into a vehicle, and adjusting if necessary, to meet requirements of 9.1, 9.2. Therefore: If the machine uses a scale for that purpose, check the accuracy of that scale and make any adjustment if necessary. If an alternative method of measuring refrigerant is used, follow the equipment manufacturer's procedure for ensuring accuracy. Next, move the machine, such as by rolling it, along the floor, a minimum of 20 feet (6.1 meters) within 10 seconds. Follow with the test procedure in 10.3, then 10.4 or 10.5.


If desired, this test procedure may be preceded by engine/system operation for up to 15 minutes, up to 2000 rpm.


1. You must start with an empty system, using this method: (a) Operate machine to recover refrigerant, per equipment manufacturer's instructions. (b) Deep-vacuum system to a minimum of 710 mm (28 in) of mercury. (c) Monitor vacuum for decay, checking every 20 minutes. If decay exceeds 75 mm (3 in), deep vacuum the system again. When system holds 710 mm (28 in) 75 mm (3 in) of mercury vacuum for three hours, it is considered empty.


2. Place machine on a platform scale with the capacity to weigh the recovery/recycle/recharge machine, and with the resolution and accuracy of within ±3 g (.006 lb) in the range of the machine's weight. Weight should include the machine's service hoses draped over the machine, and with the machine's oil reservoir removed. If necessary to add oil to vehicle system as a result of a system operation preparatory to the recovery process, inject the needed quantity through the service valve at this time.


3. Record weight of machine in as weight A.


4. Reconnect service hoses to the test vehicle.


5. Follow the equipment manufacturer's specified procedure for charging the vehicle manufacturer's recommended amount of refrigerant into the system. Note: if this does not apply to the machine under test, *i.e.* a recovery/recycling only machine, the use of charging equipment that meets this standard and the platform scale shall be used to verify the accuracy of the charge.


6. Disconnect the service hoses from the test vehicle and drape them on the machine. Check and record the weight of the machine. Record this weight as weight B. The difference between weight A and weight B should be equal to the recommended charge that was installed per the machine's display, within 15 g (0.5 oz). If the difference is greater than 15 g (±3 g), the machine fails the charge accuracy test, and no other tests shall be performed at that time. The manufacturer must document changes made to improve accuracy and furnish them to the laboratory prior to a new test. Exception: If the maximum deviation is no more than a total of 20 g, the calibration of the scale or other measuring system may be rechecked and readjusted once, and the entire test repeated just once.


1. Following a successful system charge, the system and engine shall be run for 15 minutes at 2000 rpm to circulate oil and refrigerant, following which engine and system shall rest for eight hours. Then the laboratory may begin the recovery test. If the machine manufacturer specifies, operate the engine/system for up to 15 minutes, at up to 2000 rpm, then shut off engine/system.


2. If the machine has an automatic air purge, disable it. Check the weight of the machine with the platform scale (service hoses draped over machine, oil reservoir removed). Record the number as Weight C. Reinstall oil reservoir if it had been removed in the recovery procedure.


3. Start timer. Connect service hoses to system of test vehicle and perform recovery per the equipment manufacturer's instructions. The vehicle system service valves' cores must remain in the fittings for this procedure.


4. When recovery is completed, including from service hoses if that is part of the recommended procedure, disconnect hoses and drape over machine. Stop timer. The elapsed time shall be 30.0 minutes or less. If it is in excess of this time, the machine fails the test and no retest is allowed. The manufacturer must document changes made to the machine to improve its performance before a new test is allowed, and furnish them to the laboratory.


5. If the recovery is completed in no more than the 30.0 minutes, measure the oil level in the reservoir, remove the reservoir and then determine the amount of refrigerant recovered, as detailed in Nos. 6 and 7: As measured by the machine and also by noting the weight of the platform scale, which shall be recorded as Weight D.


6. The platform scale shall indicate that a minimum of 95% of the amount charged into the system has been recovered. If the platform scale indicates a lower percentage has been recovered, the machine fails the recovery test.


7. The machine display shall indicate that a minimum of 95.0% of the amount charged into the system has been recovered, within a tolerance of ±30 g (1 oz) when compared with the platform scale (Weight D minus Weight C). The 30 g (1 oz) tolerance may produce a machine display reading that is below the 95.0% recovery. If a greater difference between machine and platform scale occurs, the machine fails the recovery test.


If an equipment manufacturer chooses, as an alternative to the actual vehicle, it may certify to SAE J2788 with a laboratory fixture that is composed entirely of all the original equipment parts of a single model year for the 3.0 lb capacity front/rear A/C system in the 2005-07 Chevrolet Suburban. All parts must be those OE-specified for one model year system and no parts may be eliminated or bypassed from the chosen system, or reproduced by a non-OE source. No parts may be added and/or relocated from the OE position in the 2005-07 Suburban. No parts may be modified in any way that could affect system performance for testing under this standard, except adding refrigerant line bends and/or loops to make the system more compact. Reducing the total length of the lines, however, is not permitted. The fixture system shall be powered by an electric motor, run at a speed not to exceed 2000 rpm, and for this test option, no system warm-up or equivalent procedure may be used. The certifying laboratory shall maintain records of all parts purchased, including invoices and payments. The assembly of the parts shall, as an outside-the-vehicle package, duplicate the OE system and its routing, including bends, except for permitted additions of bends and/or loops in refrigerant lines. Aside from the absence of engine operation and the limitations posed by the standard and the use of the electric motor, the test shall otherwise be the same as the test on the Suburban, including test temperature.
