# Appendix E to Subpart B of Part 82—The Standard for Automotive Refrigerant Recycling Equipment Intended for Use With Both CFC-12 and HFC-134

SAE J2211, Recommended Service Procedure for the Containment of HFC-134a, as set forth under Appendix C of this subpart, and SAE J1989, Recommended Service Procedure for the Containment of CFC-12, as set forth under Appendix A of this subpart, also apply to this Appendix E of this subpart.


SAE J1770, issued December, 1995.


The purpose of this standard is to establish specific minimum equipment requirements for automotive refrigerant recycling equipment intended for use with both CFC-12 and HFC-134a in a common refrigerant circuit. Establishing such specifications will assure that this equipment does not cross contaminate refrigerant above specified limits when used under normal operating conditions.


The purpose of this standard is to establish the specific minimum equipment intended for use with both CFC-12 and HFC-134a in a common refrigerant circuit that has been directly removed from, and is intended for reuse in, mobile air-conditioning (A/C) systems. This standard does not apply to equipment used for CFC-12 and HFC-134a having a common enclosure with separate circuits for each refrigerant.

The instructions shall indicate that the correct sequence of operation be followed so that the equipment can properly remove contaminates to the acceptable level. Also to be included are any other necessary maintenance procedures, source information for replacement parts and repair, and safety precautions.


5.2 The equipment must prominently display the manufacturer's name, address, the type of refrigerant (CFC-12 and HFC-134a), a service telephone number, and the part number for the replacement filter/drier. Operation manuals must cover information for complete maintenance of the equipment to assure proper operation.


6.1 The equipment must comply with applicable federal, state, and local requirements on equipment related to handling CFC-12 and HFC-134a material. Safety precautions or notices related to the safe operation of the equipment shall be prominently displayed on the equipment and should also state “CAUTION—SHOULD BE OPERATED BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL”.

Some mixtures of air and HFC-134a have been shown to be combustible at elevated pressures (when contained in a pipe or tank). These mixtures may be potentially dangerous, causing injury or property damage. Additional health and safety information may be obtained from refrigerant and lubricant manufacturers.”


7.1 General


7.1.1 The equipment must be capable of ensuring recovery of the CFC-12 and HFC-134a from the system being serviced, by reducing the system to a minimum of 102 mm of mercury below atmospheric pressure (*i.e.,* vacuum).


7.1.2 The equipment must be compatible with leak detection material that may be present in the mobile A/C system.


7.2 Shut Off Device


7.2.1 To prevent overcharge, the equipment must be equipped to protect the tank used to store the recycled refrigerant with a shutoff device and a mechanical pressure relief valve.


7.3 Storage Tanks


7.3.1 Portable refillable tanks or containers shall be supplied with this equipment and must be labeled “HFC-134a” or “CFC-12” as appropriate, meet applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) or NRTL's Standards and be adaptable to existing refrigerant service and charging equipment.

7.5 Hoses and Connections


7.5.1 Separate inlet and outlet hoses with fittings and separate connections shall be provided for each refrigerant circuit.

7.5.3 Service hoses must have shutoff devices located within 30 cm of the connection point to the system being serviced.


7.6 Lubricant Separation


7.6.1 The equipment must be able to separate the lubricant from the removed refrigerant and accurately indicate the amount of lubricant removed during the process, in 30 mL (1 fl oz) units. Refrigerant dissolves in lubricant and, as a result, increases the volume of the recovered lubricant sample. This creates the illusion that more lubricant has been recovered that actually has been. The equipment lubricant measuring system must take into account such dissolved refrigerant removed from the A/C system being serviced to prevent overcharging the vehicle system with lubricant.


7.6.2 The equipment must be provided with some means, such as a lockout device, which will prevent initiation of the recovery operation after switching to the other refrigerant, if the lubricant has not been drained from the oil separator.


8.0 Equipment shall be tested in sequence as noted in sections 8.1, 8.2 and 9.2. The filter/drier may be replaced only as noted by section 4.6.2.


8.1 CFC-12 Recycling Cycle


8.1.1 The maximum operating pressure of the equipment shall be determined when recycling CFC-12 while conducting the following tests. This pressure is needed for the Seat Leakage Test, Section 4.2.


8.1.2 The equipment must be preconditioned with 13.6 kg of the standard contaminated CFC-12 (see section 8.1.2a) at an ambient of 21 °C before starting the test cycle. Sample amounts shall be 1.13 kg with sample amounts to be repeated every 5 minutes. The sample method fixture, defined in Figure 1 to Appendix A, shall be operated at 21 °C.

8.2 HFC-134a Recycling Cycle


8.2.1 The maximum operating pressure of the equipment shall be determined when recycling HFC-134a while conducting the following tests. This pressure is needed for the Seat Leakage Test, Section 4.2.


8.2.2 The equipment must be preconditioned by processing 13.6 kg of the standard contaminated HFC-134a (see section 8.2.2a) at an ambient of 21 °C before starting the test cycle. 1.13 kg samples are to be processed at 5 minute intervals. The text fixture shown in Figure 1 to Appendix A shall be operated at 21 °C.
