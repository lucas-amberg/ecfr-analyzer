# ยง 82.114   Compliance by manufacturers and importers with requirements for labeling of containers of controlled substances, or products containing controlled substances.

(a) *Compliance by manufacturers and importers with requirements for labeling of containers of controlled substances, or products containing controlled substances.* Each manufacturer of a product incorporating another product or container containing a controlled substance, to which ยง 82.102 (a)(1), or, (a)(2) or (b)(1) applies, that is purchased or obtained from another manufacturer or supplier, is required to pass through and incorporate the labeling information that accompanies such incorporated product in a warning statement accompanying the manufacturer's finished product. Each importer of a product, or container containing a controlled substance, to which ยง 82.102 (a)(1), (a)(2), or (b)(1) applies, including a component product or container incorporated into the product, that is purchased from a foreign manufacturer or supplier, is required to apply a label, or to ensure that a label has been properly applied, at the site of U.S. Customs clearance. 


(b) *Reliance on reasonable belief.* The manufacturer or importer of a product that incorporates another product container from another manufacturer or supplier may rely on the labeling information (or lack thereof) that it receives with the product, and is not required to independently investigate whether the requirements of this subpart are applicable to such purchased product or container, as long as the manufacturer reasonably believes that the supplier or foreign manufacturer is reliably and accurately complying with the requirements of this subpart. 


(c) *Contractual obligations.* A manufacturer's or importer's contractual relationship with its supplier under which the supplier is required to accurately label, consistent with the requirements of this subpart, any products containing a controlled substance or containers of a controlled substance that are supplied to the manufacturer or importer, is evidence of reasonable belief.
