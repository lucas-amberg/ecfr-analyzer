# Appendix B1 to Subpart F of Part 82—Performance of Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling and/or Reclaim Equipment


This appendix is based on the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute Standard 740-1993. 


1.1 *Purpose.* The purpose of this standard is to establish methods of testing for rating and evaluating the performance of refrigerant recovery, and/or recycling equipment, and general equipment requirements (herein referred to as “equipment”) for containment or purity levels, capacity, speed, and purge loss to minimize emission into the atmosphere of designated refrigerants.


1.1.1 This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, including manufacturers, refrigerant reclaimers, repackers, distributors, installers, servicemen, contractors and for consumers.


1.1.2 This standard is not intended to be used as a guide in defining maximum levels of contaminants in recycled or reclaimed refrigerants used in various applications.


1.2 *Review and Amendment.* This standard is subject to review and amendment as the technology advances.


2.1 *Scope.* This standard defines general equipment requirements and the test apparatus, test mixtures, sampling and analysis techniques that will be used to determine the performance of recovery and/or recycling equipment for various refrigerants including R11, R12, R13, R22, R113, R114, R123, R134a, R500, R502, and R503, as referenced in the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34-1992, “Number Designation of Refrigerants” (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers, Inc.).


3.1 *Recovered refrigerant.* Refrigerant that has been removed from a system for the purpose of storage, recycling, reclamation or transportation.


3.2 Recover. Reference 40 CFR 82.152. 


3.3 Recycle. Reference 40 CFR 82.152. 


3.4 Reclaim. Reference 40 CFR 82.152. 


3.5 *Standard Contaminated Refrigerant Sample.* A mixture of new and/or reclaimed refrigerant and specified quantities of identified contaminants which are representative of field obtained, used refrigerant samples and which constitute the mixture to be processed by the equipment under test.


3.6 *Push/Pull Method.* The push/pull refrigerant recovery method is defined as the process of transferring liquid refrigerant from a refrigeration system to a receiving vessel by lowering the pressure in the vessel and raising the pressure in the system, and by connecting a separate line between the system liquid port and the receiving vessel.


3.7 *Recycle Rate.* The amount of refrigerant processed (in pounds) divided by the time elapsed in the recycling mode in pounds per minute. For equipment which uses a separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate does not include the recovery rate (or elapsed time). For equipment which does not use a separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate is a maximum rate based solely on the higher of the liquid or vapor recovery rate, by which the rated contaminant levels can be achieved.


3.8 *Equipment Classification.*

3.8.1 *Self Contained Equipment.* A refrigerant recovery or recycling system which is capable of refrigerant extraction without the assistance of components contained within an air conditioning or refrigeration system.


3.8.2 *System Dependent Equipment.* Refrigerant recovery equipment which requires for its operation the assistance of components contained in an air conditioning or refrigeration system.


3.9 *“Shall”, “Should”, “Recommended”* or *“It is Recommended”,* “Shall” “Should”, “recommended”, or “it is recommended” shall be interpreted as follows:


3.9.1 *Shall.* Where “shall” or “shall not” is used for a provision specified, that provision is mandatory if compliance with the standard is claimed.


3.9.2 *Should, Recommended,* or *It is Recommended,* “Should”, “recommended”, is used to indicate provisions which are not mandatory but which are desirable as good practice.


4.1 The equipment manufacturer shall provide operating instructions, necessary maintenance procedures, and source information for replacement parts and repair.


4.2 The equipment shall indicate when any filter/drier(s) needs replacement. This requirement can be met by use of a moisture transducer and indicator light, by use of a sight glass/moisture indicator, or by some measurement of the amount of refrigerant processed such as a flow meter or hour meter. Written instructions such as “to change the filter every 400 pounds, or every 30 days” shall not be acceptable except for equipment in large systems where the Liquid Recovery Rate is greater than 25 lbs/min [11.3 Kg/min] where the filter/drier(s) would be changed for every job.


4.3 The equipment shall either automatically purge non-condensables if the rated level is exceeded or alert the operator that the non-condensable level has been exceeded. While air purge processes are subject to the requirements of this section, there is no specific requirement to include an air purge process for “recycle” equipment.


4.4 The equipment's refrigerant loss due to non-condensable purging shall not be exceeded 5% by weight of total recovered refrigerant. (See Section 9.4)


4.5 Internal hose assemblies shall not exceed a permeation rate of 12 pounds mass per square foot [5.8 g/cm 
2] of internal surface per year at a temperature of 120 F [48.8 °C] for any designated refrigerant.


4.6 The equipment shall be evaluated at 75 F [24 °C] per 7.1. Normal operating conditions range from 50 °F to 104 F [10 °C to 40 °C].


4.7 *Exemptions:*

4.7.1 Equpment intended for recovery only shall be exempt from sections 4.2 and 4.3.


5.1 The standard contaminated refrigerant sample shall have the characteristics specified in Table 1, except as provided in 5.2 


5.2 Recovery equipment not rated for any specific contaminant can be tested with new or reclaimed refrigerant. 


6.1 Self Contained Equipment Test Apparatus. The apparatus as shown in Figure 1 consists of a 3 cubic foot [0.085 m
3] mixing chamber with a conical-shaped bottom, although a larger mixing chamber is permissible. The size of the mixing chamber depends upon the size of the equipment. The outlet at the bottom of the cone and all restrictions and valves for liquid and vapor refrigerant lines in the test apparatus shall be a minimum of 0.375 in. [9.5 mm] inside diameter or equivalent. The minimum inside diameter for large equipment for use on chillers shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm.]. The mixing chamber shall contain various ports for receiving liquid refrigerant, oil, and contaminants. A recirculating line connected from the bottom outlet through a recirculating pump and then to a top vapor port shall be provided for stirring of the mixture. Isolation valves may be required for the pump. Alternative stirring means may be used if demonstrated to be equally effective. 


6.1.1 For liquid refrigerant feed, the liquid valve is opened. For vapor refrigerant feed, the vapor valve is opened and refrigerant passes through an evaporator coil. Flow is controlled by a thermostatic expansion valve to create 5 F [3 °C] superheat at an evaporator temperature of 70 F ±3 F[21 °C±2°]. The evaporator coil or equivalent evaporator means shall be either sized large enough for the largest system or be sized for each system. 


6.1.2 An alternative method for vapor refrigerant feed is to pass through a boiler and then an automatic pressure regulating valve set at refrigerant saturation pressure at 75 F ±3 F [24 °C ±2 °C]. 


6.2 System Dependent Equipment Test Apparatus. This test apparatus is to be used for final recovery vacuum rating of all system dependent equipment. 


6.2.1 The test apparatus shown in Figure 2 consists of a complete refrigeration system. The manufacturer shall identify the refrigerants to be tested. The test apparatus can be modified to facilitate operation or testing of the system dependent equipment if the modifications to the apparatus are specifically described within the manufacturer's literature. (*See Figure 2.*) A 
1/4 inch [6.3 mm] balance line shall be connected across the test apparatus between the high and low pressure sides, with an isolation valve located at the connection to the compressor high side. A 
1/4 inch [6.3 mm] access port with a valve core shall be located in the balance line for the purpose of measuring final recovery vacuum at the conclusion of the test. 


7.1 Contaminant removal and performance testing shall be conducted at 75 F ±2 F [23.9 °C ±1.1 °C]. 


7.1.1 The equipment shall be prepared for operation per the instruction manual. 


7.1.2 The contaminated sample batch shall consist of not less than the sum of the amounts required to complete steps 7.1.2.2 and 7.1.2.3 below. 


7.1.2.1 A liquid sample shall be drawn from the mixing chamber prior to starting the test to assure quality control of the mixing process. 


7.1.2.2 Vapor refrigerant feed testing, if elected, shall normally be processed first. After the equipment reaches stabilized conditions of condensing temperature and/or storage tank pressure, the vapor feed recovery rate shall be measured. One method is to start measuring the vapor refrigerant recovery rate when 85% of refrigerant remains in the mixing chamber and continue for a period of time sufficient to achieve the accuracy in 9.2. If liquid feed is not elected, complete Step 7.1.2.4. 


7.1.2.3 Liquid refrigerant feed testing, if elected, shall be processed next. After the equipment reaches stabilized conditions, the liquid feed recovery rate shall be measured. One method is to wait 2 minutes after starting liquid feed and then measure the liquid refrigerant recovery rate for a period of time sufficient to achieve the accuracy in 9.1. Continue liquid recovery operation as called for in 7.1.2.4. 


7.1.2.4 Continue recovery operation until all liquid is removed from the mixing chamber and vapor is removed to the point where the equipment shuts down per automatic means or is manually stopped per the operating instructions. 


7.1.2.5 After collecting the first contaminated refrigerant sample batch, the liquid and vapor value of the apparatus shall be closed and the mixing chamber pressure recorded after 1 minute as required in 9.5. After preparing a second contaminated refrigerant sample batch, continue recovery until the storage container reaches 80% liquid fill level. After recycling and measuring the recycle rate per section 7.1.3, set this container aside for the vapor sample in 8.2.2. 


7.1.2.6 Interruptions in equipment operations as called for in instruction manual are allowable. 


7.1.3 Recycle as called for in equipment operating instructions. Determine recycle rate by appropriate means as required in 9.3. 


7.1.4 Repeat steps 7.1.2, 7.1.2.4, and 7.1.3 with contaminated refrigerant sample until equipment indicator(s) show need to change filter(s). It will not be necessary to repeat the recycle rate determination in 7.1.3. 


7.1.4.1 For equipment with a multiple pass recirculating filter system, analyze the contents of the previous storage container. 


7.1.4.2 For equipment with a single pass filter system, analyze the contents of the current storage container. 


7.1.5 Refrigerant loss due to the equipment's non-condensable gas purge shall be determined by appropriate means. (See Section 9.4.) 


7.2 System Dependent Equipment. This procedure shall be used for vacuum rating of all system dependent equipment. Liquid refrigerant recovery rate, vapor refrigerant recovery rate, and recycle rate are not tested on system dependent systems. 


7.2.1 The apparatus operation and testing shall be conducted at 75 F ±2 F. [23.9 °C. ±/1.1. °C.]. 


7.2.2 The apparatus shall be charged with refrigerant per its system design specifications. 


7.2.3 For measurement of final recovery vacuum as required in 9.5, first shut the balance line isolation valve and wait 1 minute for pressure to balance. Then connect and operate the recovery system per manufacturers recommendations. When the evacuation is completed, open the balance line isolation valve and measure the pressure in the balance line.


8.1 The referee test methods for the various contaminants are summarized in the following paragraphs. Detailed test procedures are included in Appendix A “Test Procedures for ARI STD 700.” If alternate test methods are employed, the user must be able to demonstrate that they produce results equivalent to the specified referee method.


8.2 *Refrigerant Sampling.*

8.2.1 *Sampling Precautions.* Special precautions should be taken to assure that representative samples are obtained for analysis. Sampling shall be done by trained laboratory personnel following accepted sampling and safety procedures.


8.2.2 *Gas Phase Sample.* A gas phase sample shall be obtained for determining the non-condensables. Since non-condensable gases, if present, will concentrate in the vapor phase of the refrigerant, care must be exercised to eliminate introduction of air during the sample transfer. Purging is not and acceptable procedure for a gas phase sample since it may introduce a foreign product. Since R11, R113 and R123 have normal boiling points at or above room temperature, noncondensable determination is not required for these refrigerants.


8.2.2.1 The sample cylinder shall be connected to an evacuated gas sampling bulb by means of a manifold. The manifold should have a valve arrangement that facilitates evacuation of all connecting tubing leading to the sampling bulb.


8.2.2.2 After the manifold has been evacuated, close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. Allow the pressure to equilibrate and close valves.


8.2.3 *Liquid Phase Sample.* A liquid phase sample is required for all tests listed in this standard, except the test for non-condensables.


8.2.3.1 Place an empty sample cylinder with the valve open in an oven at 230 F [110 °C] for one hour. Remove it from the oven while hot, immediately connect to an evacuation system and evacuate to less than 1mm. mercury (1000 microns). Close the valve and allow it to cool.


8.2.3.2 The valve and lines from the unit to be sampled shall be clean and dry. Connect the line to the sample cylinder loosely. Purge through the loose connection. Make the connection tight at the end of the purge period. Take the sample as a liquid by chilling the sample cylinder slightly. Accurate analysis requires that the sample container be filled to at least 60% by volume; however under no circumstances should the cylinder be filled to more than 80% by volume. This can be accomplished by weighing the empty cylinder and then the cylinder with refrigerant. When the desired amount of refrigerant has been collected, close the valve(s) and disconnect the sample cylinder immediately.


8.2.3.3 Check the sample cylinder for leaks and record the gross weight.


8.3 *Water Content.*

8.3.1. The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be the primary test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is described in Appendix A. This method can be used for refrigerants that are either a liquid or a gas at room temperature, including Refrigerants 11 and 13. For all refrigerants, the sample for water analysis shall be taken from the liquid phase of the container to be tested. Proper operation of the analytical method requires special equipment and an experienced operator. The precision of the results is excellent if proper sampling and handling procedures are followed. Refrigerants containing a colored dye can be successfully analyzed for water using this method.


8.3.2 The Karl Fischer Test Method is an acceptable alternative test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is described in ASTM Standard for “Water in gases Using Karl Fisher Reagent” E700-79, reapproved 1984 (American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA).


8.3.3 Report the moisture level in parts per million by weight if a sample is required.


8.4 *Chloride.* The refrigerant shall be tested for chlorides as an indication of the presence of hydrochloric or similar acids. The recommended procedure is intended for use with new or reclaimed refrigerants. Significant amounts of oil may interfere with the results by indicating a failure in the absence of chlorides.


8.4.1 The test method shall be that described in Appendix A “Test Procedures for ARI-700.” The test will show noticeable turbidity at equivalent chloride levels of about 3 ppm by weight or higher.


8.4.2 The results of the test shall not exhibit any sign of turbity. Report results as “pass” or “fail.”


8.5 *Acidity.*

8.5.1 The acidity test uses the titration principle to detect any compound that is highly soluble in water and ionizes as an acid. The test method shall be that described in Appendix A. “Test Procedures for ARI-700.” The test may not be suitable for determination of high molecular weight organic acids; however these acids will be found in the high boiling residue test outlined in Section 5.7. The test requires about a 100 to 120 gram sample and has a low detection limit of 0.1 ppm by weight as HC1.


8.6 High Boiling Residue.


8.6.1 High boiling residue will be determined by measuring the residue of a standard volume of refrigerant after evaporation. The refrigerant sample shall be evaporated at room temperature or a temperature 50 F [10°.0C], above the boiling point of the sample using a Goetz tube as specified in Appendix A “Test Procedures for ARI-700.” Oils and or organic acids will be captured by this method.


8.6.2 The value for high boiling residue shall be expressed as a percentage by volume.


8.7 Particulates/Solids.


8.7.1 A measured amount of sample is evaporated from a Goetz bulb under controlled temperature conditions. The particulates/solids shall be determined by visual examination of the empty Goetz bulb after the sample has evaporated completely. Presence of dirt, rust or other particulate contamination is reported a “fail.” For details of this test method, refer to Appendix B “Test Procedures for ARI-700.”


8.8 Non-Condensables


8.8.1 A vapor phase sample shall be used for determination of non-condensables. Non-condensable gases consist primarily of air accumulated in the vapor phase of refrigerant containing tanks. The solubility of air in the refrigerants liquid phase is extremely low and air is not significant as a liquid phase contaminant. The presence of non-condensable gases may reflect poor quality control in transferring refrigerants to storage tanks and cylinders.


8.8.2 The test method shall be gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector as described in Appendix A “Test Procedures for ARI-700.”


8.8.2.1 The Federal Specification for “Fluorocarbon Refrigerants,” BB-F-1421B, dated March 5, 1992, section 4.4.2 (perchloroethylene method) is an acceptable alternate test method.


8.8.3 Report the level of non-condensable as percent by volume.


9.1 The liquid refrigerant recovery rate shall be expressed in pounds per minute [kg/min] and measured by weight change at the mixing chamber (See Figure 1) divided by elapsed time to an accuracy within .02 lbs/min. [.009 kg/min]. Ratings using the Push/Pull method shall be identified “Push/Pull”. Equipment may be rated by both methods.


9.2 The vapor refrigerant recovery rate shall be expressed in pounds per minute [kg/min] and measured by weight change at the mixing chamber (See Figure 1) divided by elapsed time to an accuracy within .02 lbs/min. [.0.009 kg/min].


9.3 The recycle rate is defined in 3.7 and expressed in pounds per minute [kg/min] of flow and shall be per ASHRAE 41.7-84 “Procedure For Fluid Measurement Of Gases” or ASHRAE 41.8-89 “Standard Method of Flow of Fluids—Liquids.”


9.3.1 For equipment using multipass recycling or a separate sequence, the recycle rate shall be determined by dividing the net weight W of the refrigerant to be recycled by the actual time T required to recycle the refrigerant. Any set-up or operator interruptions shall not be included in the time T. The accuracy of the recycle rate shall be within .02 lbs/min. [.009 kg/min].


9.3.2 If no separate recycling sequence is used, the recycle rate shall be the higher of the vapor refrigerant recovery rate or the liquid refrigerant recovery rate. The recycle rate shall match a process which leads to contaminant levels in 9.6. Specifically, a recovery rate determined from bypassing a contaminant removal device cannot be used as a recycle rate when the contaminant levels in 9.6 are determined by passing the refrigerant through the containment removal device.


9.4 Refrigerant loss due to non-condensable purging shall be less than 5%. This rating shall be expressed as “passed” if less than 5%.


This calculation will be based upon net loss of non-condensables and refrigerant due to the purge divided by the initial net content. The net loss shall be determined by weighing before and after the purge, by collecting purged gases, or an equivalent method.


9.5 The final recovery vacuum shall be the mixing chamber pressure called for in 7.1.2.5 expressed in inches of mercury vacuum, [mm Hg or kP]. The accuracy of the measurement shall be within ±.1 inch [±2.5mm] of Hg and rounding down to the nearest whole number.


9.6 The contaminant levels remaining after testing shall be published as follows:


9.7 Product Literature: Except as provided under product labelling in Section 11. performance ratings per 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, and 9.5 must be grouped together and shown for all listed refrigerants (11.2) subject to limitations of 9.8. Wherever any contaminant levels per 9.6 are rated, all ratings in 9.6 must be shown for all listed refrigerants subject to limitations of 9.8. The type of equipment in 11.1 must be included with either grouping. Optional ratings in 9.8 need not be shown.


9.8 Ratings shall include all of the parameters for each designed refrigerant in 11.2 as shown in Tables 2 and 3.


10.1 Any equipment tested shall produce contaminant levels not higher than the published ratings. The liquid refrigerant recovery rate, vapor refrigerant recovery rate, final recovery vacuum and recycle rate shall not be less than the published ratings.


11.1 *Type of equipment.* The type of equipment shall be as listed:


11.2 Designated refrigerants and the following as applicable for each:


11.3 The nameplate shall also conform to the labeling requirements established for certified recycling and recovery equipment established at 40 CFR 82.158(h).


Particulate Used in Standard Contaminated Refrigerant Sample.


1.1 The particulate material pm will be a blend of 50% coarse air cleaner dust as received, and 50% retained on a 200-mesh screen. The coarse air cleaner dust is available from: AC Spark Plug Division, General Motors Corporation, Flint, Michigan.


To prepare the blend of contaminant, first wet screen a quantity of coarse air cleaner dust on a 200-mesh screen (particle retention 74 pm). This is done by placing a portion of the dust on a 200-mesh screen and running water through the screen while stirring the dust with the fingers. The fine contaminant particles passing through the screen are discarded. The +200 mesh particles collected on the screen are removed and dried for one hour at 230 F [110 °C]. The blend of standard contaminant is prepared by mixing 50% by weight of coarse air cleaner dust as received after drying for one hour at 230 F [110 °C] with 50% by weight of the +200 mesh screened dust.


1.3 The coarse air cleaner dust as received and the blend used as the standard contaminant have the following approximate particle size analysis: Wt. % in various size ranges, pm.
