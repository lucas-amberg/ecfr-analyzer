# Appendix B4 to Subpart F of Part 82—Performance and Safety of Flammable Refrigerant Recovery and/or Recycling Equipment


This appendix is based on the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute Standard 740-2016, *Performance Rating of Refrigerant Recovery Equipment and Recovery/Recycling Equipment*, and Underwriters Laboratories Standard 1963-2011 (Fourth Edition), *Standard for Safety: Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment*, including Supplement SB (added October 11, 2013), *Requirements for Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment Intended for Use with a Flammable Refrigerant.*

1.1 The purpose of this standard is to establish methods of testing for rating and evaluating the performance and safety of refrigerant recovery and/or recycling equipment and general equipment requirements (herein referred to as “equipment”) for contaminant or purity levels, capacity, speed and purge loss to minimize emission into the atmosphere of designated refrigerants, as well as safety for use with flammable refrigerants.


2.1 This standard applies to equipment for recovering and/or recycling flammable single refrigerants, azeotropes, zeotropic blends, and their normal contaminants from refrigerant systems. This standard defines the test apparatus, test gas mixtures, sampling procedures, analytical techniques, and equipment construction that will be used to determine the performance and safety of refrigerant recovery and/or recycling equipment (hereinafter, “equipment”).


3.1 All terms in this appendix will follow the definitions in § 82.152 and Appendix B3 to Subpart F of Part 82 unless otherwise defined in this appendix.


3.2 All definitions used in UL 1963, including the definitions in Supplement SB, as applicable, are incorporated by reference, see § 82.168.


4.1 *Performance Ratings.* All recovery and/or recycling equipment to be tested under this appendix must follow the procedures and meet all requirements established in Appendix B3 to Subpart F of Part 82 to determine the performance ratings in addition to the safety evaluation conducted under the rest of this appendix.


4.2 *Safety.* All recovery and/or recycling equipment to be tested under this appendix must follow the procedures and meet all requirements in Supplement SB (added October 11, 2013), *Requirements for Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment Intended for Use with a Flammable Refrigerant* in Underwriters Laboratories Standard 1963-2011 (Fourth Edition), *Standard for Safety: Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment* (incorporated by reference, see § 82.168).
