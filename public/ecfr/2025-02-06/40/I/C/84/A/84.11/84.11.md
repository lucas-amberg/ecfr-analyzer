# § 84.11   Allocation of calendar-year consumption allowances.

(a) The relevant agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar years 2022 and 2023 consumption allowances to entities that imported or produced a bulk regulated substance in 2020, unless an individual accommodation is permitted by a relevant Agency official. If multiple entities that imported are related through shared corporate or common ownership or control, the relevant agency official will calculate and issue allowances to a single corporate or common owner. The number of consumption allowances allocated to each eligible entity for 2022-2023 is calculated as follows:


(1) Take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted consumption amounts chosen at the corporate or common ownership level for eligible entities reporting to the agency for each calendar year 2011 through 2019;


(2) Sum the “average high year” values determined in step 1 of all eligible entities and determine each entity's percentage of that total;


(3) Determine the amount of general pool consumption allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 and the set-aside in § 84.15 from the consumption cap § 84.7(b)(3);


(4) Determine individual entity consumption allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in step 2 by the amount of general pool allowances determined in step 3.


(b) Starting with the allocation of 2024 calendar years allowances the relevant Agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar year consumption allowances. The allocation of calendar year 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 consumption allowances is calculated as follows for each entity:


(1) For new market entrants that were allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3), take the allowances allocated for calendar year 2023 and divide that value by the proportion of calendar year 2023 consumption allowances received by general pool allowance holders pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section relative to their high three average calculated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section;


(2) For entities that produced or imported a regulated substance in 2021 or 2022, or both 2021 and 2022, and have not been allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3), the relevant Agency official will calculate and issue allowances. This calculation and issuance will be to a single entity if multiple entities with historic consumption data are related through shared corporate or common ownership. The relevant Agency official will take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted consumption amounts, which for entities related through shared corporate or common ownership or control would be aggregated and averaged at the corporate or common ownership level, that each eligible entity reported to the Agency for calendar years 2011 through 2019. If an entity, or commonly owned or controlled group of entities, does not have consumption amounts for three years between calendar years 2011 through 2019, the relevant Agency official will take the average of available year(s) of consumption for calendar years 2011 through 2019;


(3) If an entity has a value calculated under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, take the single higher value;


(4) If an entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3) was acquired by an entity that has a market share calculable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and EPA has approved this acquisition, sum the value calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3) with the value calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section disregarding any historic consumption activity by the entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3), except this paragraph (b)(4) shall not apply to an entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3) that has a higher value calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section than under paragraph (b)(1) of this section;


(5) Sum every entity's values as determined in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section and determine each entity's percentage of that total;


(6) Determine the amount of general pool consumption allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 from the consumption cap in § 84.7(b)(3); and


(7) Determine individual entities' consumption allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section by the amount of general pool allowances determined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.


(c)(1) EPA will allocate calendar year consumption allowances to individual entities by October 1 of the calendar year prior to the year in which the allowances may be used based on the exchange value-weighted quantities calculated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.


(2) EPA will provide public notice of the list of companies receiving consumption allowances as well as how they will be allocated by that date.
