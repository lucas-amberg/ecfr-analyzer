# § 84.25   Required processes to import regulated substances as feedstocks or for destruction.

(a)(1) *Petition to import regulated substances for use in a process resulting in transformation or destruction.* A person must petition the relevant Agency official for the import of each individual shipment of a regulated substance imported for use in a process resulting in transformation or destruction in order to not expend allowances. A petition is required at least 30 days before the shipment is to arrive at a U.S. port, and must contain the following information:


(i) Name, Harmonized Tariff Schedule code, and quantity in kilograms of each regulated substance to be imported;


(ii) Name and address of the importer, the importer ID number, and the contact person's name, email address, and phone number;


(iii) Name and address of the consignee and the contact person's name, email address, and phone number;


(iv) Source country;


(v) The U.S. port of entry for the import, the expected date of import, and the vessel transporting the material. If at the time of submitting the petition the entity does not know this information, and the entity receives a non-objection notice for the individual shipment in the petition, the entity is required to notify the relevant Agency official of this information prior to the date of importation (consistent with the definition at 19 CFR 101.1) of the individual shipment into the United States;


(vi) Name and address of any intermediary, including a contact person's name, email address and phone number, who will hold the material before the regulated substances are transformed or destroyed;


(vii) Name, address, contact person, email address, and phone number of the responsible party at the facility where the regulated substance will be used in a process resulting in the substance's transformation or destruction;


(viii) An English translation, if needed, of the export license, application for an export license, or official communication acknowledging the export from the appropriate government agency in the country of export;


(ix) The capacity of the container; and


(x) The unique identification number of the container used to transport the regulated substances as part of the petition.


(2) *Review of petition to import for use in a process resulting in transformation or destruction.* (i) The relevant Agency official will initiate a review of the information submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and take action within 21 days to issue either an objection notice or a non-objection notice for the individual shipment to the person who submitted the petition.


(ii) The relevant Agency official may issue an objection notice to a petition for the following reasons:


(A) If the relevant Agency official determines that the information is insufficient; that is, if the petition lacks or appears to lack any of the information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or other information that may be requested during the review of the petition necessary to verify that the regulated substance is for use in a process resulting in transformation or destruction;


(B) If the relevant Agency official determines that any portion of the petition contains false, inaccurate, or misleading information, or the official has information from other U.S. or foreign government agencies indicating that the petition contains false, inaccurate, or misleading information.


(iii) Within 10 working days after receipt of an objection notice with the basis being “insufficient information,” the importer may re-petition the relevant Agency official. If no re-petition is taken by the tenth working day after the date on the objection notice, the objection shall become final. Only one re-petition will be accepted for any petition received by EPA.


(iv) Any information contained in the re-petition which is inconsistent with the original petition must be identified and a description of the reason for the inconsistency must accompany the re-petition.


(v) In cases where the relevant Agency official does not object to the petition, the official will issue a non-objection notice.


(vi) If, following EPA's issuance of a non-objection notice, new information is brought to EPA's attention which shows that the non-objection notice was issued based on false, inaccurate, or misleading information, then EPA has the right to:


(A) Revoke and void the non-objection notice from the approval date;


(B) Pursue all means to ensure that the regulated substance is not imported into the United States; and


(C) Take appropriate enforcement and apply administrative consequences.


(3) *Timing.* (i) An individual shipment authorized through a non-objection notice must be used in the process resulting in its transformation within one year of import.


(ii) An individual shipment authorized through a non-objection notice must be used in the process resulting in its destruction within 120 days of import.


(4) * Quantity.* An individual shipment authorized through a non-objection notice may not exceed the quantity (in MTEVe) of the regulated substance stated in the non-objection notice.


(b)(1) *Petition to import used regulated substances for disposal by destruction.* A person must petition the relevant Agency official for the import of each individual shipment of a used regulated substance imported for purposes of destruction in order to not expend allowances. A petition is required at least 30 working days before the shipment is to leave the foreign port of export, and contain the following information:


(i) Name, Harmonized Tariff Schedule code, and quantity in kilograms of each regulated substance to be imported;


(ii) Name and address of the importer, the importer ID number, and the contact person's name, email address, and phone number;

(vi) An English translation, if needed, of the export license (or application for an export license) from the appropriate government agency in the country of export;


(vii) The U.S. port of entry for the import, the expected date of import, and the vessel transporting the material.

(viii) Name, address, contact person, email address, and phone number of the responsible party at the destruction facility.


(2) *Review of petition to import for destruction.* (i) The relevant Agency official will initiate a review of the information submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and take action within 30 working days to issue either an objection notice or a non-objection notice for the individual shipment to the person who submitted the petition.


(ii) The relevant Agency official may issue an objection notice to a petition for the following reasons:


(A) If the relevant Agency official determines that the information is insufficient; that is, if the petition lacks or appears to lack any of the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or other information that may be requested during the review of the petition necessary to verify that the regulated substance is used;


(B) If the relevant Agency official determines that any portion of the petition contains false, inaccurate, or misleading information, or the relevant Agency official has information from other U.S. or foreign government agencies indicating that the petition contains false, inaccurate, or misleading information;


(C) If allowing the import of the used regulated substance would run counter to government restrictions from either the country of recovery or export regarding regulated substances;


(D) If destruction capacity is installed or is being installed for that specific regulated substance in the country of recovery or country of export and the capacity is funded in full or in part through the Multilateral Fund to the Montreal Protocol.


(iii) Within 10 working days after receipt of an objection notice with the basis being “insufficient information,” the importer may re-petition the relevant Agency official. If no re-petition is taken by the tenth working day after the date on the objection notice, the objection shall become final. Only one re-petition will be accepted for any petition received by EPA.


(iv) Any information contained in the re-petition that is inconsistent with the original petition must be identified and a description of the reason for the inconsistency must accompany the re-petition.


(v) In cases where the relevant Agency official does not object to the petition, the official will issue a non-objection notice.


(vi) If, following EPA's issuance of a non-objection notice, new information is brought to EPA's attention which shows that the non-objection notice was issued based on false, inaccurate, or misleading information, then EPA and the relevant Agency official has the right to:


(A) Revoke and void the non-objection notice from the approval date;


(B) Pursue all means to ensure that the regulated substance is not imported into the United States; and


(C) Take appropriate enforcement and apply administrative consequences.
