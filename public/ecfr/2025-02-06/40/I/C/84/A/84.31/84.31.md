(3) *Report for Application-specific Allowances for Mission-critical Military End Use.* The Department of Defense must provide a report to EPA biannually by July 31 (covering prior activity from January 1 through June 30) and January 31 (covering prior activity from July 1 through December 31) of each year contains the following information:


(i) The quantity (in kilograms) of each regulated substance acquired for application-specific use by conferring application-specific allowances;


(ii) The quantity of inventory on June 30 of each regulated substance for application-specific use held by the Department of Defense or held under contract by another company for use by the Department of Defense;


(iii) The quantity of each regulated substance requested for mission-critical military end uses in the next calendar year;


(iv) The broad sectors of use covered by current mission-critical military end uses in the next calendar year; and

(4) *Conferral of allowances.* Entities who confer application-specific allowances, except for the conferral of allowances for mission-critical military end uses, must submit the following information about each conferral to the relevant Agency official prior to conferring allowances:


(i) The identities and addresses of the conferrer and the conferee;


(ii) The names, telephone numbers, and email addresses of contact persons for the conferrer and the conferee;


(iii) The specific application for which application-specific allowances are to be conferred;


(iv) The quantity (in MTEVe) of application-specific allowances being conferred;


(v) The amount of unexpended application-specific allowances of the type and for the year being conferred that the conferrer holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; and

The relevant agency official will reduce the conferrer's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity conferred. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the conferrer did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conferral or that the regulated substances produced or imported with conferred allowances are used for anything other than the specific application identified in the conferee's submittal and for the application those allowances were allocated for, the conferrer and conferee will be liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper conferral.
