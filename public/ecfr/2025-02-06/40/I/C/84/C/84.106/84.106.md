(a) *Applicability.* This section applies to refrigerant-containing appliances with a full charge of 15 or more pounds of refrigerant where the refrigerant contains:


(1) A regulated substance,


(2) A substitute for a regulated substance that has a global warming potential greater than 53, based on the global warming potentials listed in table 1 of ยง 84.64(b).


(3) Notwithstanding the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the requirements of this section do not apply to:


(i) Appliances (as defined in 40 CFR 82.152) containing solely an ozone-depleting substance as listed in 40 CFR part 82, subpart A as a refrigerant;


(ii) Refrigerant-containing appliances used for the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.


(4) The requirements of this section apply as of January 1, 2026.


(b) *Leak rate calculation.* Persons adding or removing refrigerant from a refrigerant-containing appliance must, upon conclusion of that installation, service, repair, or disposal, provide the owner or operator with documentation that meets the applicable requirements of paragraph (l)(2) of this section. The owner or operator must calculate the leak rate every time refrigerant is added to an appliance unless the addition is made immediately following a retrofit, installation of a new refrigerant-containing appliance, or qualifies as a seasonal variance.


(1) Where an owner or operator is using the annualizing method to calculate a leak rate for a refrigerant-containing appliance for the first time after January 1, 2026, the calculation should substitute 365 days as the number of days since last refrigerant addition.


(2) Where an owner or operator is using the rolling average method to calculate a leak rate for a refrigerant-containing appliance for the first time after January 1, 2026, the calculation should substitute pounds of refrigerant added since January 1, 2026.


(3) An owner or operator may switch to a different leak rate calculation methodology only if the following requirements are met:


(i) The owner or operator has purchased or otherwise acquired an operating facility with one or more refrigerant-containing appliance(s) which was previously using a different leak rate calculation methodology than the methodology being used at other facilities owned or operated by the owner or operator;


(ii) The owner or operator has determined the refrigerant-containing appliance(s) at any operating facility for which the leak rate calculation methodology would change are not exceeding the applicable leak rate in paragraph (c)(2) of this section under either of the leak rate calculation methodologies ; and


(iii) The owner or operator must retain a record of this change as described in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.


(c) *Requirement to address leaks through repair, or retrofitting or retiring a refrigerant-containing appliance.* (1) Owners or operators must repair leaks in refrigerant-containing appliances with a leak rate over the applicable leak rate in this paragraph in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section unless the owner or operator elects to retrofit or retire the refrigerant-containing appliance in compliance with paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section. If the owner or operator elects to repair leaks but fails to bring the leak rate below the applicable leak rate, the owner or operator must create and implement a retrofit or retirement plan in accordance with paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section. Repairs must be conducted by a certified technician, as defined in this subpart.


(2) Leak rates:


(i) 20 percent leak rate for commercial refrigeration appliances;


(ii) 30 percent leak rate for industrial process refrigeration appliances; and


(iii) 10 percent leak rate for comfort cooling appliances, refrigerated transport appliances, or other refrigerant-containing appliances with a full charge of 15 or more pounds of refrigerant not covered by paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.


(d) *Appliance repair.* Owners or operators must identify and repair leaks in accordance with this paragraph within 30 days (or 120 days if an industrial process shutdown is required) of when refrigerant is added to a refrigerant-containing appliance exceeding the applicable leak rate in paragraph (c) of this section.


(1) A certified technician must conduct a leak inspection, as described in paragraph (g) of this section, to identify the location of leaks.


(2) Leaks must be repaired such that the leak rate of the refrigerant-containing appliance is brought below the applicable leak rate. This must be confirmed by the leak rate calculation performed upon the next refrigerant addition. Leak repairs will be presumed to be successful if, over the 12-month period after the date of a successful follow-up verification test, there is no further refrigerant addition or if the leak inspections required under paragraph (g) and/or automatic leak detection systems required by ยง 84.108 do not find any leaks in the appliance. Repairs of leaks must be documented by both an initial and a follow-up verification test or tests.


(3) The time frames in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section are temporarily suspended when an appliance is mothballed. The time will resume on the day additional refrigerant is added to the refrigerant-containing appliance (or component of a refrigerant-containing appliance if the leaking component was isolated).


(e) *Verification tests.* The owner or operator must conduct both initial and follow-up verification tests on each leak that was repaired under paragraph (d) of this section.


(1) *Initial verification test.* Unless granted additional time, an initial verification test must be performed within 30 days (or 120 days if an industrial process shutdown is required) of a refrigerant-containing appliance exceeding the applicable leak rate in paragraph (c) of this section. An initial verification test must demonstrate that for leaks where repair attempts were made, the adjustments or alterations to the refrigerant-containing appliance have held.


(i) For repairs that can be completed without the need to open or evacuate the refrigerant-containing appliance, the test must be performed after the conclusion of the repairs and before any additional refrigerant is added to the refrigerant-containing appliance.


(ii) For repairs that require the evacuation of the refrigerant-containing appliance or portion of the refrigerant-containing appliance, the test must be performed before adding any refrigerant to the refrigerant-containing appliance.


(iii) If the initial verification test indicates that the repairs have not been successful, the owner or operator may conduct as many additional repairs and initial verification tests as needed within the applicable time period.


(2) *Follow-up verification test.* A follow-up verification test must be performed within 10 days of the successful initial verification test or 10 days of the refrigerant-containing appliance reaching normal operating characteristics and conditions (if the refrigerant-containing appliance or isolated component was evacuated for the repair(s)). Where it is unsafe to be present or otherwise impossible to conduct a follow-up verification test when the system is operating at normal operating characteristics and conditions, the verification test must, where practicable, be conducted prior to the system returning to normal operating characteristics and conditions.


(i) A follow-up verification test must demonstrate that leaks where repair attempts were made are repaired. If the follow-up verification test indicates that the repairs have not been successful, the owner or operator may conduct as many additional repairs and verification tests as needed to bring the refrigerant-containing appliance below the leak rate within the applicable time period and to verify the repairs.


(ii) [Reserved]


(f) *Extensions to the appliance repair deadlines.* Owners or operators are permitted more than 30 days (or 120 days if an industrial process shutdown is required) to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if they meet the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section or the refrigerant-containing appliance is mothballed. Extension requests must be signed by an authorized company official. The request will be considered approved unless EPA notifies the owners or operators otherwise.
