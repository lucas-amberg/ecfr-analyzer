# Appendix A to Subpart S of Part 85—Interpretive Ruling for § 85.1803—Remedial Plans


The purpose of this rule is to set forth EPA's interpretation regarding one aspect of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine manufacturer's recall liability under section 207(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7641(c)(1). This rule will provide guidance to vehicle and engine manufacturers to better enable them to submit acceptable remedial plans. 


Section 207(c)(1) requires the Administrator to base a recall order on a determination that a substantial number of in-use vehicles or engines within a given class or category of vehicles or engines, although properly maintained and used, fail to conform to the regulations prescribed under section 202 when in actual use throughout their useful lives. After making such a determination, he shall require the manufacturer to submit a plan to remedy the nonconformity of any such vehicles or engines. The plan shall provide that the manufacturer will remedy, at the manufacturer's expense, all properly maintained and used vehicles which experienced the nonconformity during their useful lives regardless of their age or mileage at the time of repair.
