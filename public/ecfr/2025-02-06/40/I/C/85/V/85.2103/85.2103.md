# § 85.2103   Emission warranty.

(a) The manufacturer of each vehicle to which this subpart applies must provide a written commitment to meet warranty requirements as described in this section.


(b) The warranty periods under this section apply based on the vehicle's age in years and on the vehicle's odometer reading. The warranty period expires based on the specified age or mileage, whichever comes first. The warranty period for a particular vehicle begins on the date the vehicle is delivered to its ultimate purchaser or, if the vehicle is first placed in service as a “demonstrator” or “company” car prior to delivery, on the date it is first placed in service.


(c) Under the emission performance warranty, in the case of a vehicle failing to conform at any time during its useful life to the applicable emission standards or family emission limits as determined by an EPA-approved emission test, the manufacturer must remedy that nonconformity at no cost to the owner if such nonconformity results or will result in the vehicle owner having to bear any penalty or other sanction (including the denial of the right to use the vehicle) under local, State, or Federal law. The following warranty periods apply:


(1) For light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles, the warranty period for the emission performance warranty is 24 months or 24,000 miles, except that the warranty period is 8 years or 80,000 miles for any nonconformity resulting from a failed specified major emission control component identified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) For medium-duty vehicles, the warranty period for the emission performance warranty is 5 years or 50,000 miles, except that the warranty period is 8 years or 80,000 miles for any nonconformity resulting from a failed specified major emission control component identified in paragraph (d) of this section.




(d) An emission defect warranty applies as follows:


(1) An emission defect warranty applies for light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles for a warranty period of two years or 24,000 miles, except that the following specified major emission control components have a warranty period of eight years or 80,000 miles:


(i) Catalytic converters and SCR catalysts, and related components.


(ii) Particulate filters and particulate traps, used with both spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines.


(iii) Components related to exhaust gas recirculation with compression-ignition engines.


(iv) Emission control module.


(v) Batteries serving as a Renewable Energy Storage System for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, along with all components needed to charge the system, store energy, and transmit power to move the vehicle. This paragraph (d)(1)(v) is optional for vehicles not yet subject to battery monitoring requirements under 40 CFR 86.1815-27.


(2) An emission defect warranty applies for medium-duty vehicles for a warranty period of five years or 50,000 miles, except that the specific major emission control components identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section have a warranty period of eight years or 80,000 miles.


(3) An electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle fails to meet the manufacturer-defined value for percentage usable battery energy for the specified period as determined by the State of Certified Energy monitor required under 40 CFR 86.1815-27, subject to the warranty claim procedures in § 85.2106.
