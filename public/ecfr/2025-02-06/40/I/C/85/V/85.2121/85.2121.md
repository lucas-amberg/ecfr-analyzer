(B) Were insufficient to justify a claim of durability exemption status. 


(viii) The aftermarket part manufacturer failed to pay a lost arbitration settlement within 30 days of the arbitrator's decision or within 30 days after completion of judicial review, if any. 


(2) Notice of a preliminary determination to decertify shall contain:

(A) Terminate the sale of the part as a certified part, or


(B) Make the necessary change (if so recommended by the Agency), and


(C) Request an opportunity in writing to dispute the allegations of the preliminary decertification.


(b) If the aftermarket part manufacturer requests an opportunity to respond to the preliminary determination, the manufacturer and other parties interested in the MOD Director's decision whether to decertify a part may, within 15 days of the date of the request, submit written presentations, including the relevant information and data, to the MOD Director. The MOD Director, in his or her discretion, may provide an opportunity for oral presentations.


(1) Any interested party may request additional time to respond to the information submitted by the part manufacturer. The MOD Director upon a showing of good cause by the interested party may grant an extension of time to reply up to 30 days.

(c) If a part manufacturer has disputed the allegations of the preliminary decisions, the MOD Director shall, after reviewing any additional information, notify the aftermarket part manufacturer of his or her decision whether the part may continue to be sold as certified. This notification shall include an explanation upon which the decision was made and the effective date for decertification, where appropriate.


(d) Within 20 days from the date of a decision made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, any adversely affected party may appeal the decision to the Office Director. 


(1) A petition for appeal to the Office Director must state all of the reasons why the decision of the MOD Director should be reversed.


(2) The Office Director may, in his or her discretion, allow additional oral or written testimony.


(3) If no appeal is filed with the Office Director within the permitted time period, the decision of the MOD Director shall be final.


(e) If a final decision is made to decertify a part under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer of such part shall notify his immediate customers (other than retail customers) that, as of the date of the final determination, the part in question has been decertified. The part manufacturer shall offer to replace decertified parts in the customer's inventory with certified replacement parts or, if unable to do so, shall at the customer's request repurchase such inventory at a reasonable price.


(f) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, a part purchased by a vehicle owner as certified, shall be considered certified pursuant to this subpart.
