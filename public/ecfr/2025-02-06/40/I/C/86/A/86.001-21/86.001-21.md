# § 86.001-21   Application for certification.

Section 86.001-21 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from § 86.094-21 or § 86.096-21. Where a paragraph in § 86.094-21 or § 86.096-21 is identical and applicable to § 86.001-21, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement “[Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21.” or “[Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.096-21.”


(a)-(b)(1)(i)(B) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21.


(b)(1)(i)(C) The manufacturer must submit a Statement of Compliance in the application for certification which attests to the fact that they have assured themselves that the engine family is designed to comply with the intermediate temperature cold testing criteria of subpart C of this part, and does not unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness of vehicles operating at high altitude or other conditions not experienced within the US06 (aggressive driving) and SC03 (air conditioning) test cycles.


(b)(1)(i)(C)(*1*)-(b)(1)(ii)(C) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21.


(b)(2) Projected U.S. sales data sufficient to enable the Administrator to select a test fleet representative of the vehicles (or engines) for which certification is requested, and data sufficient to determine projected compliance with the standards implementation schedules of § 86.000-8 and 86.000-9. Volume projected to be produced for U.S. sale may be used in lieu of projected U.S. sales.


(b)(3) A description of the test equipment and fuel proposed to be used.


(b)(4)(i) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, a description of the test procedures to be used to establish the evaporative emission and/or refueling emission deterioration factors, as appropriate, required to be determined and supplied in § 86.001-23(b)(2).


(b)(4)(ii)-(b)(5)(iv) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21.


(b)(5)(v) For light-duty vehicles and applicable light-duty trucks with non-integrated refueling emission control systems, the number of continuous UDDS cycles, determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle of that evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination, required to use a volume of fuel equal to 85% of fuel tank volume.


(b)(6)-(b)(8) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21.


(b)(9) For each light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, evaporative/refueling emission family or heavy-duty vehicle evaporative emission family, a description of any unique procedures required to perform evaporative and/or refueling emission tests, as applicable, (including canister working capacity, canister bed volume, and fuel temperature profile for the running loss test) for all vehicles in that evaporative and/or evaporative/refueling emission family, and a description of the method used to develop those unique procedures.


(10) For each light-duty vehicle or applicable light-duty truck evaporative/refueling emission family, or each heavy-duty vehicle evaporative emission family:


(i) Canister working capacity, according to the procedures specified in § 86.132-96(h)(1)(iv);


(ii) Canister bed volume; and


(iii) Fuel temperature profile for the running loss test, according to the procedures specified in § 86.129-94(d).


(c)-(j) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21.


(k) and (l) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.096-21.
