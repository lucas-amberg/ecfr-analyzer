(2) Particulate matter emissions from Otto-cycle certification engines or gaseous-fueled certification engines.


(3) CO emissions from diesel-cycle certification engines.


(4) Formaldehyde emissions from petroleum-fueled engines.


(5) Particulate matter and formaldehyde emissions when conducting Selective Enforcement Audit testing of Otto-cycle engines.


(6) Smoke from methanol-fueled or petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle certification engines.


(7) Smoke when conducting Selective Enforcement Audit testing of diesel-cycle engines.


(8) Evaporative emissions from vehicles fueled by natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, or hydrogen.
