(a)(1)(i) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the manufacturer, data derived from any inspection carried out under § 86.091-7(c) and any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator determines that a test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) meets the requirements of the Act and of this subpart, he will issue a certificate of conformity with respect to such vehicle(s) (or engine(s)) except in cases covered by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (c) of this section.


(ii) *Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles.* If, after a review of the statement(s) of compliance submitted by the manufacturer under § 86.094-23(b)(4) and any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator determines that the requirements of the Act and this subpart have been met, he will issue one certificate of conformity per manufacturer with respect to the evaporative emission family(ies) covered by paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) Such certificate will be issued for such period not to exceed one model year as the Administrator may determine and upon such terms as he may deem necessary or appropriate to assure that any new motor vehicle (or new motor vehicle engine) covered by the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.


(3)(i) One such certificate will be issued for each engine family. For gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and petroleum-fueled diesel cycle light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks not certified under § 86.098-28(g), one such certificate will be issued for each engine family-evaporative/refueling emission family combination. Each certificate will certify compliance with no more than one set of in-use and certification standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate).


(ii) For gasoline-fueled and methanol fueled heavy-duty vehicles, one such certificate will be issued for each manufacturer and will certify compliance for those vehicles previously identified in that manufacturer's statement(s) of compliance as required in § 86.098-23(b)(4)(i) and (ii).


(iii) For diesel light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, or diesel HDEs, included in the applicable particulate averaging program, the manufacturer may at any time during production elect to change the level of any family particulate emission limit by demonstrating compliance with the new limit as described in § 86.094-28(a)(6), § 86.094-28(b)(5)(i), or § 86.004-28(c)(5)(i). New certificates issued under this paragraph will be applicable only for vehicles (or engines) produced subsequent to the date of issuance.


(iv) For light-duty trucks or HDEs included in the applicable NO_X_ averaging program, the manufacturer may at any time during production elect to change the level of any family NO_X_ emission limit by demonstrating compliance with the new limit as described in § 86.094-28(b)(5)(ii) or § 86.004-28(c)(5)(ii). New certificates issued under this paragraph will be applicable only for vehicles (or engines) produced subsequent to the day of issue.

(2) The sanction of suspending a certificate may not be imposed for the reasons in paragraph (e)(1) (i), (ii), or (vii) of this section where such refusal or denial is caused by conditions and circumstances outside the control of the manufacturer which renders it impossible to comply with those requirements. Such conditions and circumstances shall include, but are not limited to, any uncontrollable factors which result in the temporary unavailability of equipment and personnel needed to conduct the required tests, such as equipment breakdown or failure or illness of personnel, but shall not include failure of the manufacturers to adequately plan for and provide the equipment and personnel needed to conduct the tests. The manufacturer will bear the burden of establishing the presence of the conditions and circumstances required by this paragraph.


(3) The sanction of suspending a certificate may be imposed for the reasons outlined in paragraph (e)(1)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this section only when the infraction is substantial.


(4) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submitted false or inaccurate information or knowingly rendered inaccurate any test data or committed any other fraudulent acts, and such acts contributed substantially to the Administrator's original decision not to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part, the Administrator may deem such certificate void from the date of such fraudulent act.


(5) In any case in which certification of a light-duty truck or heavy-duty engine is proposed to be suspended under paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section and in which the Administrator has presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of § 86.1006 in fact occurred, if the manufacturer wishes to contend that, although the violation occurred, the vehicle or engine configuration or engine family in question was not involved in the violation to a degree that would warrant suspension of certification under paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, he shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator.


(6) Any suspension of certification under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall:


(i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with § 86.1014; and


(ii) Not apply to vehicles or engines no longer in the hands of the manufacturer.


(7) Any voiding of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (e)(4) of this section shall be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with § 86.1014.


(8) Any voiding of the certificate under paragraph (a) (10) or (11) of this section will be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with § 86.1014.
