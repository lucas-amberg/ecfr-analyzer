# ยง 86.012-2   Definitions.

The definitions of ยง 86.010-2 continue to apply to model year 2010 and later model year vehicles. The definitions listed in this section apply beginning with model year 2012. *Urban bus* means a passenger-carrying vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen or more passengers and intended primarily for intracity operation, *i.e.*, within the confines of a city or greater metropolitan area. Urban bus operation is characterized by short rides and frequent stops. To facilitate this type of operation, more than one set of quick-operating entrance and exit doors would normally be installed. Since fares are usually paid in cash or tokens, rather than purchased in advance in the form of tickets, urban buses would normally have equipment installed for collection of fares. Urban buses are also typically characterized by the absence of equipment and facilities for long distance travel, *e.g.*, rest rooms, large luggage compartments, and facilities for stowing carry-on luggage.
