3/stroke, valve lash, initial injection timing, and idle speed;


(H) The prominent statement: “This engine conforms to U.S. EPA regulations applicable to XXXX Model Year New Heavy-Duty Engines.”;


(I) If the manufacturer has an alternate useful life period under the provisions of § 86.094-21(f), the prominent statement: “This engine has been certified to meet U.S. EPA standards for a useful-life period of XXX miles or XXX hours of operation, whichever occurs first. This engine's actual life may vary depending on its service application.” The manufacturer may alter this statement only to express the assigned alternate useful life in terms other than miles or hours (*e.g.,* years, or hours only);

(L) For diesel engines which are included in the diesel heavy-duty particulate averaging program, the family particulate emission limit to which the engine is certified;


(M) For any heavy-duty engines which are included in the heavy-duty NO_X_ averaging program, the family NO_X_ emission limit to which the engine is certified;


(N) Engines granted final admission under § 85.1505 of this chapter must comply with the labeling requirements contained in § 85.1510 of this chapter.

(A) The label heading: Vehicle Emission Control Information;


(B) Full corporate name and trademark of manufacturer;

(c) Vehicles powered by model year 2007 through 2013 diesel-fueled engines must include permanent, readily visible labels on the dashboard (or instrument panel) and near all fuel inlets that state “Use Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel Only”; or “Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel Only”.


(d)-(g) [Reserved]
