# § 86.098-2   Definitions.

The definitions of § 86.096-2 continue to apply to 1996 and later model year vehicles. The definitions listed in this section apply beginning with the 1998 model year.


*Dispensed fuel temperature* means the temperature (deg.F or deg.C may be used) of the fuel being dispensed into the tank of the test vehicle during a refueling test.


*Evaporative/refueling emission control system* means a unique combination within an evaporative/refueling family of canister adsorptive material, purge system configuration, purge strategy, and other parameters determined by the Administrator to affect evaporative and refueling emission control system durability or deterioration factors.


*Evaporative/refueling emission family* means the basic classification unit of a manufacturers' product line used for the purpose of evaporative and refueling emissions test fleet selection and determined in accordance with § 86.098-24.


*Fixed liquid level gauge* means a type of liquid level gauge used on liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles which uses a relatively small positive shutoff valve and is designed to indicate when the liquid level in the fuel tank being filled reaches the proper fill level. The venting of fuel vapor and/or liquid fuel to the atmosphere during the refueling event is generally associated with the use of the fixed liquid level gauge.


*Integrated refueling emission control system* means a system where vapors resulting from refueling are stored in a common vapor storage unit(s) with other evaporative emissions of the vehicle and are purged through a common purge system.


*Non-integrated refueling emission control system* means a system where fuel vapors from refueling are stored in a vapor storage unit assigned solely to the function of storing refueling vapors.


*Refueling emissions* means evaporative emissions that emanate from a motor vehicle fuel tank(s) during a refueling operation.


*Refueling emissions canister(s)* means any vapor storage unit(s) that is exposed to the vapors generated during refueling.


*Resting losses* means evaporative emissions that may occur continuously, that are not diurnal emissions, hot soak emissions, refueling emissions, running losses, or spitback emissions.


*Useful life* means:


(1) For light-duty vehicles, and for light light-duty trucks not subject to the Tier 0 standards of § 86.094-9(a), intermediate useful life and/or full useful life. Intermediate useful life is a period of use of 5 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Full useful life is a period of use of 10 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first, except as otherwise noted in § 86.094-9. The useful life of evaporative and/or refueling emission control systems on the portion of these vehicles subject to the evaporative emission test requirements of § 86.130-96, and/or the refueling emission test requirements of § 86.151-98, is defined as a period of use of 10 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first.


(2) For light light-duty trucks subject to the Tier 0 standards of § 86.094-9(a), and for heavy light-duty truck engine families, intermediate and/or full useful life. Intermediate useful life is a period of use of 5 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Full useful life is a period of use of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first. The useful life of evaporative emission control systems on the portion of these vehicles subject to the evaporative emission test requirements of § 86.130-96 is also defined as a period of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first.


(3) For an Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine family:


(i) For hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide standards, a period of use of 8 years or 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.


(ii) For the oxides of nitrogen standard, a period of use of 10 years or 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.


(iii) For the portion of evaporative emission control systems subject to the evaporative emission test requirements of § 86.1230-96, a period of use of 10 years or 110,000 miles, whichever occurs first.


(4) For a diesel heavy-duty engine family:


(i) For light heavy-duty diesel engines, for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and particulate standards, a period of use of 8 years or 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.


(ii) For light heavy-duty diesel engines, for the oxides of nitrogen standard, a period of use of 10 years or 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs.


(iii) For medium heavy-duty diesel engines, for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and particulate standards, a period of use of 8 years or 185,000 miles, whichever first occurs.


(iv) For medium heavy-duty diesel engines, for the oxides of nitrogen standard, a period of use of 10 years or 185,000 miles, whichever first occurs.


(v) For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and particulate standards, a period of use of 8 years or 290,000 miles, whichever first occurs, except as provided in paragraph (3)(vii) of this definition.


(vi) For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, for the oxides of nitrogen standard, a period of use of 10 years or 290,000 miles, whichever first occurs.


(vii) For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines used in urban buses, for the particulate standard, a period of use of 10 years or 290,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
