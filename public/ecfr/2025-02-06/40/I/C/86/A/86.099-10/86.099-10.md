# § 86.099-10   Emission standards for 1999 and later model year Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

Section 86.099-10 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from § 86.098-10. Where a paragraph in § 86.98-10 is identical and applicable to § 86.099-10, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement “[Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.098-10.”


(a) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.098-10.


(b) Evaporative emissions from heavy-duty vehicles shall not exceed the following standards. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. The spitback standard also applies to newly assembled vehicles. For certification vehicles only, manufacturers may conduct testing to quantify a level of nonfuel background emissions for an individual test vehicle. Such a demonstration must include a description of the source(s) of emissions and an estimated decay rate. The demonstrated level of nonfuel background emissions may be subtracted from emission test results from certification vehicles if approved in advance by the Administrator.


(1) *Hydrocarbons (for vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines).* (i) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 lbs:


(A)(*1*) For the full three-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.0 grams per test.


(*2*) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 3.5 grams per test.


(B) Running loss test (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 0.05 grams per mile.


(C) Fuel dispensing spitback test (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 1.0 gram per test.


(ii) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 14,000 lbs:


(A)(*1*) For the full three-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 4.0 grams per test.


(*2*) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 4.5 grams per test.


(B) Running loss test (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 0.05 grams per mile.


(2) *Total Hydrocarbon Equivalent (for vehicles equipped with methanol-fueled engines).* (i) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 lbs:


(A)(*1*) For the full three-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.0 grams carbon per test.


(*2*) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.5 grams carbon per test.


(B) Running loss test: 0.05 grams carbon per mile.


(C) Fuel dispensing spitback test: 1.0 gram carbon per test.


(ii) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 14,000 lbs:


(A)(*1*) For the full three-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 4.0 grams carbon per test.


(*2*) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in § 86.1230-96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 4.5 grams carbon per test.


(B) Running loss test: 0.05 grams carbon per mile.


(3)(i) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 26,000 lbs, the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section refer to a composite sample of evaporative emissions collected under the conditions and measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart M of this part.


(ii) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 26,000 lbs., the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section refer to the manufacturer's engineering design evaluation using good engineering practice (a statement of which is required in § 86.091-23(b)(4)(ii)).


(4) All fuel vapor generated in a gasoline- or methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicle during in-use operations shall be routed exclusively to the evaporative control system (e.g., either canister or engine purge). The only exception to this requirement shall be for emergencies.


(c)-(d) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.098-10.


(e) The standards described in this section do not apply to Otto-cycle medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPVs) that are subject to regulation under subpart S of this part, except as specified in subpart S of this part. The standards described in this section also do not apply to Otto-cycle engines used in such MDPVs, except as specified in subpart S of this part. The term “medium-duty passenger vehicle” is defined in § 86.1803.
