(xxvi) NMHC_conc_ = 3.553 ppm−0.89 ppm = 2.67 ppm.


(xxvii) NMHC_mass_ = (6048.1)(16.33)(2.67/1,000,000) = 0.263 grams per test phase.


(xxviii) NMHCE_mass_ = 0.263 + (13.8756/32.042)(2.44) + (13.8756/ 30.0262)(0.1405) = 1.39 grams per test phase.


(2) For the stabilized portion of the cold start test assume that similar calculations resulted in the following:


(i) THCE = 0.143 grams per test phase.


(ii) NO_Xmass_ = 0.979 grams per test phase.


(iii) CO_mass_ = 0.365 grams per test phase.


(iv) CO_2mass_ = 1467 grams per test phase.


(v) D_s_ = 3.854 miles.


(vi) NMHCE = 0.113 grams per test phase.


(3) For the “transient” portion of the hot start test assume that similar calculations resulted in the following:


(i) THCE = 0.488 grams as carbon equivalent per test phase.


(ii) NO_Xmass_ = 1.505 grams per test phase.


(iii) CO_mass_ = 3.696 grams per test phase.


(iv) CO_2mass_ = 1179 grams per test phase.


(v) D_ht_ = 3.577 miles.


(vi) NMHCE = 0.426 grams per test phase.


(4) Weighted emission results:


(i) THCE_wm_ = (0.43) × (1.473 + 0.143)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (0.488 + 0.143)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 0.142 grams as carbon equivalent per mile.


(ii) NOx_wm_ = (0.43) × (1.505 + 0.979)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (1.505 + 0.979)/3.577 + 3.854) = 0.344 grams per mile.


(iii) CO_wm_ = (0.43) × (18.983 + 0.365)/(3.583 = 3.854) + (0.57) × (3.696 + 0.365)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 1.43 grams per mile.


(iv) CO2_wm_ = (0.43) × (1353 + 1467)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (1179 + 1467)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 366 grams per mile.


(v) NMHCE_wm_ = (0.43) × (1.386 + 0.113)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (0.426 = 0.113)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 0.128 grams per mile.
