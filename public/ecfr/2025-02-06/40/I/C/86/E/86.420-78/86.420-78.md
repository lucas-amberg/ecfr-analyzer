# ยง 86.420-78   Engine families.

(a) The vehicles covered in the application will be divided into groupings whose engines are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their useful life. Each group of engines with similar emission characteristics shall be defined as a separate engine family.


(b) *Reciprocating families.* To be classed in the same engine family, reciprocating engines must be identical in all of the following applicable respects:


(1) The combustion cycle.


(2) The cooling mechanism.


(3) The cylinder configuration (inline, vee, opposed, bore spacings, etc.).


(4) The number of cylinders.


(5) The engine displacement class, ยง 86.419.


(6) The method of air aspiration.


(7) The number of catalytic converters, location, volume, and composition. 


(8) The thermal reactor characteristics.


(9) The number of carburetors.


(10) The prechamber characteristics.


(c) At the manufacturer's option, reciprocating engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph (b) of this section may be further divided into different engine families if the Administrator determines that they may be expected to have different emission characteristics. This determination will be based upon a consideration of features such as:


(1) The bore and stroke.


(2) The combustion chamber configuration.


(3) The intake and exhaust timing method of actuation (poppet valve, reed valve, rotary valve, etc.).


(4) The intake and exhaust valve or port sizes, as applicable.


(5) The fuel system.


(6) The exhaust system.


(d) *Rotary families.* To be classed in the same engine family, rotary combustion cycle engines must be identical in all of the following applicable respects:


(1) The major axis of the epitrochoidal curve.


(2) The minor axis of the epitrochoidal curve.


(3) The generating radius of the epitrochoidal curve.


(4) The cooling mechanism.


(5) The number of rotors.


(6) The engine displacement class, ยง 86.419.


(7) The method of air aspiration.


(8) The number of catalytic converters, location, volume and composition.


(9) The thermal reactor characteristics.


(10) The number of carburetors.


(11) The prechamber characteristics.


(e) At the manufacturer's option, rotary combustion cycle engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph (d) of this section, may be further divided into different engine families if the Administrator determines that they may be expected to have different emission characteristics. This determination will be based upon a consideration of features, such as:


(1) The width of the rotor housing.


(2) The type and location of intake port (side, peripheral, combination, etc.).


(3) The number of spark plugs per rotor.


(4) The fuel system.


(5) The exhaust system.


(f) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine families based upon the criteria listed in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, the Administrator will establish families of those engines based upon the features most related to their emission characteristics.
