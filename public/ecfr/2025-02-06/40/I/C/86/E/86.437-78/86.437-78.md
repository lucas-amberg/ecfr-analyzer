If such statements cannot be made with respect to any vehicle tested, the vehicle shall be identified, and all pertinent test data relating thereto shall be supplied.


(2)(i) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the manufacturer, data derived from any inspection carried out under § 86.441 and any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator determines that a test vehicle(s) meets the requirements of the Act and of this subpart, he will issue a certificate of conformity with respect to such vehicle(s) except in cases covered by § 86.442.


(ii) Such certificate will be issued for such period not to exceed one model year as the Administrator may determine and upon such terms as he may deem necessary to assure that any new motorcycle covered by the certificate will meet the requirements of the act and of this subpart.


(iii) The certificate will cover all vehicles represented by the test vehicle and will certify compliance with no more than one set of applicable standards.


(3)(i) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the manufacturer, data derived from any additional testing conducted pursuant to § 86.427, or information derived from any inspection carried out under § 86.441, or any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator determines that one or more test vehicles of the certification test fleet do not meet applicable standards, he will notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for his determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determination.

(A) Request a hearing.


(B) Delete from the application for certification the vehicles represented by the failing test vehicle.
