# § 86.544-90   Calculations; exhaust emissions.

This section describes how to calculate exhaust emissions. Determine emission results for each pollutant to at least one more decimal place than the applicable standard. Apply the deterioration factor, then round the adjusted figure to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each emission data vehicle. In the case of NO_X_ + HC standards, apply the deterioration factor to each pollutant and then add the results before rounding.
