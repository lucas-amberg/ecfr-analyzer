# § 86.601-84   Applicability.

The provisions of this subpart apply to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles. However, manufacturers that optionally certify heavy-duty vehicles based on chassis testing under § 86.1863-07 may choose instead to perform selective enforcement audits using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E. References to “light-duty vehicle” or “LDT” in this subpart G shall be deemed to include light-duty trucks and heavy-duty vehicles as appropriate.


(a) *Section numbering; construction.* (1) The model year of initial applicability is indicated by the two digits following the hyphen of the section number. A section remains in effect for subsequent model years until it is superseded.


(2) A section reference without a model year suffix shall be interpreted to be a reference to the section applicable to the appropriate model year.


(b) References in this subpart to engine families and emission control systems shall be deemed to refer to durability groups and test groups as applicable for manufacturers certifying new light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks under the provisions of subpart S of this part.
