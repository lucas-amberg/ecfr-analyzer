(c) EPA Enforcement Officers are authorized to obtain reasonable assistance without cost from those in charge of a facility to help them perform any function listed in this subpart and are authorized to request the manufacturer conducting the PCA to make arrangement with those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish reasonable assistance without cost to EPA, whether or not the manufacturer controls the facility.


(d) EPA Enforcement Officers are authorized to seek a warrant or court order authorizing the EPA Enforcement Officers to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section, as appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this section. EPA Enforcement Officers may proceed ex parte to obtain a warrant whether or not the Enforcement Officers first attempted to seek permission of the manufacturer conducting the PCA or the party in charge of the facilities in question to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section.


(e) A manufacturer that conducts a PCA shall permit EPA Enforcement Officers who present a warrant or court order as described in paragraph (d) of this section to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section and as described in the warrant or court order. The manufacturer shall cause those in charge of its facility or a facility operated for its benefit to permit EPA Enforcement Officers to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section pursuant to a warrant or court order whether or not the manufacturer controls the facility. In the absence of such a warrant or court order, EPA Enforcement Officers may conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section only upon the consent of the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facilities in question.


(f) It is not a violation of this part or the Clean Air Act for any person to refuse to permit EPA Enforcement Officers to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section without a warrant or court order.


(g) A manufacturer is responsible for locating its foreign testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions in which local foreign law does not prohibit EPA Enforcement Officers from conducting the entry and access activities specified in this section. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local foreign law prohibits.


(h) For purposes of this section, the following definitions are applicable:


(1) *Presentation of Credentials* means display of the document designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer.


(2) Where engine or vehicle storage areas or facilities are concerned, *operating hours* means all times during which personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of the area or facility and have access to it.


(3) Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph (h)(2) of this section are concerned, *operating hours* means all times during which an assembly line is in operation, engine or vehicle assembly is taking place, testing repair, service accumulation, preparation or compilation of records is taking place, or any other procedure or activity related to engine or vehicle manufacture, assembly or testing is being carried out in a facility.


(4) *Reasonable assistance* includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpreting and translating services, and making personnel of the facility being inspected available during their working hours on an EPA Enforcement Officer's request to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer of how the facility operates and to answer his or her questions.
