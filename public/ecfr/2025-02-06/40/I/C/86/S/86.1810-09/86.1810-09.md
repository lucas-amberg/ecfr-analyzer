# § 86.1810-09   General standards; increase in emissions; unsafe condition; waivers.

Section 86.1810-09 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from § 86.1810-01. Where a paragraph in § 86.1810-01 is identical and applicable to § 86.1810-09, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement “[Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.1810-01.” Where a corresponding paragraph of § 86.1810-01 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement “[Reserved]” This section applies to model year 2009 and later light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks fueled by gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels. This section also applies to MDPVs and complete heavy-duty vehicles certified according to the provisions of this subpart. Multi-fueled vehicles (including dual-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles) must comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel (or blend of fuels in the case of flexible fueled vehicles). The standards of this subpart apply to both certification and in-use vehicles unless otherwise indicated. This section also applies to hybrid electric vehicles and zero emission vehicles. Unless otherwise specified, requirements and provisions of this subpart applicable to methanol fueled vehicles are also applicable to Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 ethanol fueled vehicles.


(a) through (e) [Reserved] For guidance see § 86.1810-01.


(f) *Altitude requirements.* (1) All emission standards apply at low altitude conditions and at high altitude conditions, with the following exceptions:


(i) The supplemental exhaust emission standards as described in § 86.1811-04(f) apply only at low altitude conditions;


(ii) The cold temperature NMHC emission standards as described in § 86.1811-10(g) apply only at low altitude conditions;


(iii) The evaporative emission standards specified in § 86.1811-09(e) apply at low altitude conditions. The evaporative emission standards specified in § 86.1811-04(e) continue to apply at high altitude conditions for 2009 and later model year vehicles.


(2) For vehicles that comply with the cold temperature NMHC standards described in § 86.1811-10(g) and the CO_2_, N_2_O, and CH_4_ exhaust emission standards described in § 86.1818-12, manufacturers must submit an engineering evaluation indicating that common calibration approaches are utilized at high altitudes (except when there are specific high altitude calibration needs to deviate from low altitude emission control practices). Any deviation from low altitude emission control practices must be included in the auxiliary emission control device (AECD) descriptions submitted at certification. Any AECD specific to high altitude must require engineering emission data for EPA evaluation to quantify any emission impact and validity of the AECD.


(g) through (p) [Reserved] For guidance see § 86.1810-01.
