# § 86.1816-05   Emission standards for complete heavy-duty vehicles.

This section applies to 2005 and later model year complete heavy-duty vehicles (2003 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 1 in § 86.005-1(c)(1), or 2004 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 2 in § 86.005-1(c)(2)) fueled by gasoline, methanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels except as noted. This section does not apply to Medium-duty Passenger Vehicles, which are covered under § 86.1811. This section also applies to 2000 and later model year complete heavy duty vehicles participating in the early banking provisions of the averaging, trading and banking program as specified in § 86.1817-05(n). Multi-fueled vehicles shall comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel. For methanol fueled vehicles, references in this section to hydrocarbons or total hydrocarbons shall mean total hydrocarbon equivalents and references to non-methane hydrocarbons shall mean non-methane hydrocarbon equivalents. 


(a) *Exhaust emission standards.* (1) Exhaust emissions from 2005 and later model year complete heavy-duty vehicles at and above 8,500 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but equal to or less than 10,000 Gross Vehicle Weight Rating pounds shall not exceed the following standards at full useful life: 


(i) [Reserved]


(ii) *Non-methane organic gas.* 0.280 grams per mile; this requirement may be satisfied by measurement of non-methane hydrocarbons or total hydrocarbons, at the manufacturer's option. 


(iii) *Carbon monoxide.* 7.3 grams per mile. 


(iv) *Oxides of nitrogen.* 0.9 grams per mile. 


(v) [Reserved]


(2) Exhaust emissions from 2005 and later model year complete heavy-duty vehicles above 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but less than 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating shall not exceed the following standards at full useful life: 


(i) [Reserved]


(ii) *Non-methane organic gas.* 0.330 grams per mile; this requirement may be satisfied by measurement of non-methane hydrocarbons or total hydrocarbons, at the manufacturer's option. 


(iii) *Carbon monoxide.* 8.1 grams per mile. 


(iv) *Oxides of nitrogen.* 1.0 grams per mile. 


(v) [Reserved]


(b)-(c) [Reserved]


(d) *Evaporative emissions.* Evaporative hydrocarbon emissions from gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, and methanol-fueled complete heavy-duty vehicles shall not exceed the following standards. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. The spitback standard also applies to newly assembled vehicles. 


(1) Gasoline, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and methanol fuel. For the full three-diurnal test sequence, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.0 grams per test. 


(2) *Gasoline and methanol fuel only.* For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.5 grams per test. 


(3) *Gasoline and methanol fuel only.* Running loss test: 0.05 grams per mile. 


(4) *Gasoline and methanol fuel only.* Fuel dispensing spitback test: 1.0 grams per test. 


(e) *Refueling emissions*—(1) *Standards.* Refueling emissions from Otto-cycle complete heavy-duty vehicles equal to or less than 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating shall be phased in, in accordance with the schedule in Table S01-5 in § 86.1810-01 not to exceed the following emission standards: 


(i) For gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles: 0.20 grams hydrocarbon per gallon (0.053 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed. 


(ii) For liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles: 0.15 grams hydrocarbon per gallon (0.04 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed. 


(2) *Phase-in.* Complete heavy-duty vehicles subject to refueling standards must comply with the phase-in requirements found in Table S01-5 in § 86.1810-01, and must be grouped with HLDTs and MDPVs to determine phase-in compliance. 


(3) *Alternate timing.* (i) For manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 3 under § 86.005-1(c)(3), the refueling emissions standards are optional for 2004 model year complete heavy-duty vehicles. 


(ii) For manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 3 under § 86.005-1(c)(3), the manufacturer may exempt 2005 model year HDE test groups whose model year begins before July 31, 2004. Only 2005 model year HDE test groups whose model year begins on or after July 31, 2004 shall be considered (together with all 2005 model year HLDTs and MDPVs) for purposes of calculating the sales percentage for phase-in as outlined in § 86.1810-01(k). 


(iii) For complete heavy-duty vehicles which have total fuel tank capacity of greater than 35 gallons, or which do not share a common fuel system with a light-duty truck or medium-duty passenger vehicle configuration, the refueling emissions standards are optional for the 2004 and 2005 model years. 


(4) *Exceptions.* The provisions of this § 86.1816-05(e) do not apply to incomplete heavy-duty vehicles optionally certified to complete heavy duty vehicle standards under the provisions of § 86.1801-01(c)(2). 


(f) [Reserved]


(g) *Idle exhaust emission standards, complete heavy-duty vehicles.* Exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide from 2005 and later model year gasoline, methanol, natural gas-and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled complete heavy-duty vehicles shall not exceed 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle for a useful life of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first. This does not apply for vehicles certified to the requirements of § 86.1806-05


(h) *Alternate test groups.* Manufacturers may request to group complete heavy-duty vehicles into the same test group as vehicles subject to more stringent standards, so long as those complete heavy-duty vehicles meet the most stringent standards applicable to any vehicle within that test group, as provided at § 86.1827-(a)(5) and (d)(4).
