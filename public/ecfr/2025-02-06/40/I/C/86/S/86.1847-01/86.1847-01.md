(1) A complete record of all emission tests performed, including tests results, the date of each test, and the phase mass values for fuel economy, carbon dioxide and each pollutant measured by the Federal Test Procedure and Supplemental Federal Test Procedure as prescribed by subpart B of this part.


(2) For each test vehicle within a test group, a record and description of procedures and test results pertaining to any inspections, diagnostics, and maintenance performed on the test vehicle prior to any emission testing.


(3) A record and description of any inspections, diagnostics, maintenance performed and/or testing (including emission results) of any test vehicle tested subsequent to its initial emission test.


(g) Manufacturers of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles certified under this subpart must meet the following reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to testing performed under §§ 86.1815-27(f)(2) and (3):


(1) Submit the following records organized by monitor family and battery durability family related to Part A testing to verify accuracy of SOCE monitors within 30 days after completing low-mileage, intermediate-mileage, or high-mileage testing:


(i) A complete record of all tests performed, the dates and location of testing, measured SOCE values for each vehicle, along with the corresponding displayed SOCE values at the start of testing.


(ii) Test vehicle information, including model year, make, model, and odometer reading.


(iii) A summary of statistical information showing whether the testing shows a pass or fail result.


(2) Keep the following records related to testing under paragraph (g)(1) of this section:


(i) Test reports submitted under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(ii) Test facility information.


(iii) Routine testing records, such as dynamometer trace, and temperature and humidity during testing.


(3) Submit an annual report related to Part B testing to verify compliance with the Minimum Performance Requirement for SOCE, as applicable.
