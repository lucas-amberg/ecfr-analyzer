# § 86.1848-10   Compliance with emission standards for the purpose of certification.

(a)(1) If, after a review of the manufacturer's submitted Part I application, information obtained from any inspection, such other information as the Administrator may require, and any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator determines that the application is complete and that all vehicles within a test group and evaporative/refueling family as described in the application meet the requirements of this part and the Clean Air Act, the Administrator shall issue a certificate of conformity.


(2) If, after review of the manufacturer's application, request for certification, information obtained from any inspection, such other information as the Administrator may require, and any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator determines that the application is not complete or the vehicles within a test group or evaporative/refueling family as described in the application, do not meet applicable requirements or standards of the Act or of this part, the Administrator may deny the issuance of, suspend, or revoke a previously issued certificate of conformity. The Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for the determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determination.


(b) A certificate of conformity will be issued by the Administrator for a period not to exceed one model year and upon such terms as deemed necessary or appropriate to assure that any new motor vehicle covered by the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.


(c) Failure to meet any of the following conditions will be considered a failure to satisfy a condition upon which a certificate was issued, and any affected vehicles are not covered by the certificate:

(3) The manufacturer must comply with all implementation schedules sales percentages as required in this subpart.


(4) New incomplete vehicles must, when completed by having the primary load-carrying device or container attached, conform to the maximum curb weight and frontal area limitations described in the application for certification as required in § 86.1844.


(5) The manufacturer must meet the in-use testing and reporting requirements contained in §§ 86.1815, 86.1845, 86.1846, and 86.1847, as applicable.

The manufacturer bears the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the terms and conditions upon which each certificate was issued were satisfied. For recall and warranty purposes, vehicles not covered by a certificate of conformity will continue to be held to the standards stated or referenced in the certificate that otherwise would have applied to the vehicles. A manufacturer may not sell credits it has not generated.

(ii) Manufacturers subject to an alternative fleet average greenhouse gas emission standard approved under § 86.1818-12(g) must comply with the annual sales thresholds that are required to maintain use of those standards, including the thresholds required for new entrants into the U.S. market.


(10) Manufacturers must meet all the provisions of § 86.1815 both during and after model year production. The manufacturer bears the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the terms and conditions related to issued certificates were satisfied.


(d) One certificate will be issued for each test group and evaporative/refueling family combination. For diesel fueled vehicles and electric vehicles, one certificate will be issued for each test group. A certificate of conformity is deemed to cover the vehicles named in such certificate and produced during the model year.


(e) A manufacturer of new light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles must obtain a certificate of conformity covering such vehicles from the Administrator prior to selling, offering for sale, introducing into commerce, delivering for introduction into commerce, or importing into the United States the new vehicle.
