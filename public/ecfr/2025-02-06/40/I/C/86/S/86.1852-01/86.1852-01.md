# ยง 86.1852-01   Waivers for good in-use emission performance.

(a) The Administrator may waive requirements of this subpart relating to development of emission-related information or test data if the Administrator determines with confidence that the in-use emission test verification data required in ยง 86.1845-01 are below the applicable emission standards for an appropriate period of time, and that such performance is likely to continue in subsequent model years.


(b) Any waiver granted under paragraph (a) of this section will be granted only if the Administrator determines that the waived requirement is not needed to assure continued emission compliance and the Administrator will have sufficient testing and other information in order to make certification decisions.


(c) Any waiver granted under paragraph (a) of this section would be limited in duration to a period of one model year, unless extended by the Administrator as a result of continued demonstrations of good in-use emission performance.


(d) The Administrator reserves the right to deny or revoke a waiver which may have been granted if he/she determines that the manufacturer no longer qualifies for the waiver.
