# § 86.1870-12   CO

Full-size pickup trucks may be eligible for additional credits based on the implementation of hybrid technologies or on exhaust emission performance, as described in this section. Credits may be generated under either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section for a qualifying pickup truck, but not both. The provisions of this section do not apply for heavy-duty vehicles.


(a) *Credits for implementation of hybrid electric technology.* Full size pickup trucks that implement hybrid electric technologies may be eligible for an additional credit under this paragraph (a). Pickup trucks earning the credits under this paragraph (a) may not earn the credits described in paragraph (b) of this section. To claim this credit, the manufacturer must measure the recovered energy over the Federal Test Procedure according to 40 CFR 600.116-12(d) to determine whether a vehicle is a mild or strong hybrid electric vehicle. To provide for EPA testing, the vehicle must be able to broadcast battery pack voltage via an on-board diagnostics parameter ID channel.


(1) Full size pickup trucks that are mild hybrid electric vehicles and that are produced in the 2017 through 2021 model years are eligible for a credit of 10 grams/mile. To receive this credit in a model year, the manufacturer must produce a quantity of mild hybrid electric full size pickup trucks such that the proportion of production of such vehicles, when compared to the manufacturer's total production of full size pickup trucks, is not less than the amount specified in the table below for that model year.


(2) Full-size pickup trucks that are strong hybrid electric vehicles and that are produced in 2017 through 2021 model years are eligible for a credit of 20 grams/mile. This same credit is available again for those vehicles produced in 2023 and 2024 model years. To receive this credit in a model year, the manufacturer must produce a quantity of strong hybrid electric full-size pickup trucks such that the proportion of production of such vehicles, when compared to the manufacturer's total production of full-size pickup trucks, is not less than 10 percent in that model year. Full-size pickup trucks earning credits under this paragraph (a)(2) may not earn credits based on the production multipliers described in § 86.1866-12(b).


(b) *Credits for emission reduction performance.* Full size pickup trucks that achieve carbon-related exhaust emission values below the applicable target value determined in § 86.1818-12(c)(3) may be eligible for an additional credit. For the purposes of this paragraph (b), carbon-related exhaust emission values may include any applicable air conditioning leakage and/or efficiency credits as determined in § 86.1867 and § 86.1868. Pickup trucks earning the credits under this paragraph (b) may not earn credits described in paragraph (a) of this section and may not earn credits based on the production multipliers described in § 86.1866-12(b).


(1) Full size pickup trucks that are produced in the 2017 through 2021 model years and that achieve carbon-related exhaust emissions less than or equal to the applicable target value determined in § 86.1818-12(c)(3) multiplied by 0.85 (rounded to the nearest gram/mile) and greater than the applicable target value determined in § 86.1818-12(c)(3) multiplied by 0.80 (rounded to the nearest gram/mile) in a model year are eligible for a credit of 10 grams/mile. A pickup truck that qualifies for this credit in a model year may claim this credit for subsequent model years through the 2021 model year if the carbon-related exhaust emissions of that pickup truck do not increase relative to the emissions in the model year in which the pickup truck qualified for the credit. To qualify for this credit in a model year, the manufacturer must produce a quantity of full size pickup trucks that meet the initial emission eligibility requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) such that the proportion of production of such vehicles, when compared to the manufacturer's total production of full size pickup trucks, is not less than the amount specified in the table below for that model year.


(2) Full-size pickup trucks that are produced in 2017 through 2021 model years and that achieve carbon-related exhaust emissions less than or equal to the applicable target value determined in § 86.1818-12(c)(3) multiplied by 0.80 (rounded to the nearest gram/mile) in a model year are eligible for a credit of 20 grams/mile. This same credit is available again for qualifying vehicles produced in 2023 and 2024 model years. A pickup truck that qualifies for this credit in a model year may claim this credit for a maximum of four subsequent model years (a total of five consecutive model years) if the carbon-related exhaust emissions of that pickup truck do not increase relative to the emissions in the model year in which the pickup truck first qualified for the credit. This credit may not be claimed in model year 2022 or in any model year after 2024. To qualify for this credit in a model year, the manufacturer must produce a quantity of full-size pickup trucks that meet the emission requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) such that the proportion of production of such vehicles, when compared to the manufacturer's total production of full-size pickup trucks, is not less than 10 percent in that model year. A pickup truck that qualifies for this credit in a model year and is subject to a major redesign in a subsequent model year such that it qualifies for the credit in the model year of the redesign may be allowed to qualify for an additional five years with EPA approval (not to go beyond the 2024 model year). Use good engineering judgment to determine whether a pickup truck has been subject to a major redesign.


(c) *Calculation of total full size pickup truck credits.* Total credits in Megagrams of CO_2_ (rounded to the nearest whole number) shall be calculated for qualifying full size pickup trucks according to the following formula:
