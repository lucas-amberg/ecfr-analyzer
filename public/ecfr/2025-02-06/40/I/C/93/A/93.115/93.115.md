# § 93.115   Criteria and procedures: Projects from a transportation plan and TIP.

(a) The project must come from a conforming plan and program. If this criterion is not satisfied, the project must satisfy all criteria in Table 1 of § 93.109(b) for a project not from a conforming transportation plan and TIP. A project is considered to be from a conforming transportation plan if it meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and from a conforming program if it meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Special provisions for TCMs in an applicable implementation plan are provided in paragraph (d) of this section. 


(b) A project is considered to be from a conforming transportation plan if one of the following conditions applies: 


(1) For projects which are required to be identified in the transportation plan in order to satisfy § 93.106 (“Content of transportation plans”), the project is specifically included in the conforming transportation plan and the project's design concept and scope have not changed significantly from those which were described in the transportation plan, or in a manner which would significantly impact use of the facility; or 


(2) For projects which are not required to be specifically identified in the transportation plan, the project is identified in the conforming transportation plan, or is consistent with the policies and purpose of the transportation plan and will not interfere with other projects specifically included in the transportation plan. 


(c) A project is considered to be from a conforming program if the following conditions are met: 


(1) The project is included in the conforming TIP and the design concept and scope of the project were adequate at the time of the TIP conformity determination to determine its contribution to the TIP's regional emissions, and the project design concept and scope have not changed significantly from those which were described in the TIP; and 


(2) If the TIP describes a project design concept and scope which includes project-level emissions mitigation or control measures, written commitments to implement such measures must be obtained from the project sponsor and/or operator as required by § 93.125(a) in order for the project to be considered from a conforming program. Any change in these mitigation or control measures that would significantly reduce their effectiveness constitutes a change in the design concept and scope of the project. 


(d) *TCMs.* This criterion is not required to be satisfied for TCMs specifically included in an applicable implementation plan. 


(e) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a project must meet the requirements of § 93.104(f) during the 12-month lapse grace period.
