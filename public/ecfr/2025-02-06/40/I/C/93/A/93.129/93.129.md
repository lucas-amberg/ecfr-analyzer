# § 93.129   Special exemptions from conformity requirements for pilot program areas.

EPA and DOT may exempt no more than six areas for no more than three years from certain requirements of this subpart if these areas are selected to participate in a conformity pilot program and have developed alternative requirements that have been approved by EPA as an implementation plan revision in accordance with § 51.390 of this chapter. For the duration of the pilot program, areas selected to participate in the pilot program must comply with the conformity requirements of the pilot area's implementation plan revision for § 51.390 of this chapter and all other requirements in 40 CFR parts 51 and 93 that are not covered by the pilot area's implementation plan revision for § 51.390 of this chapter. The alternative conformity requirements in conjunction with any applicable state and/or federal conformity requirements must be proposed to fulfill all of the requirements of and achieve results equivalent to or better than section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act. After the three-year duration of the pilot program has expired, areas will again be subject to all of the requirements of this subpart and 40 CFR part 51, subpart T, and/or to the requirements of any implementation plan revision that was previously approved by EPA in accordance with § 51.390 of this chapter.
