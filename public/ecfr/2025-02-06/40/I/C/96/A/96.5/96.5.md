(2) The exemption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall become effective the day on which the unit is permanently retired. Within 30 days of permanent retirement, the NO_X_ authorized account representative (authorized in accordance with subpart B of this part) shall submit a statement to the permitting authority otherwise responsible for administering any NO_X_ Budget permit for the unit. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the Administrator. The statement shall state (in a format prescribed by the permitting authority) that the unit is permanently retired and will comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

(2)(i) A unit exempt under this section and located at a source that is required, or but for this exemption would be required, to have a title V operating permit shall not resume operation unless the NO_X_ authorized account representative of the source submits a complete NO_X_ Budget permit application under § 96.22 for the unit not less than 18 months (or such lesser time provided under the permitting authority's title V operating permits regulations for final action on a permit application) prior to the later of May 1, 2003 or the date on which the unit is to first resume operation.


(ii) A unit exempt under this section and located at a source that is required, or but for this exemption would be required, to have a non-title V permit shall not resume operation unless the NO_X_ authorized account representative of the source submits a complete NO_X_ Budget permit application under § 96.22 for the unit not less than 18 months (or such lesser time provided under the permitting authority's non-title V permits regulations for final action on a permit application) prior to the later of May 1, 2003 or the date on which the unit is to first resume operation.

(4) A unit that is exempt under this section is not eligible to be a NO_X_ Budget opt-in source under subpart I of this part.


(5) For a period of 5 years from the date the records are created, the owners and operators of a unit exempt under this section shall retain at the source that includes the unit, records demonstrating that the unit is permanently retired.
