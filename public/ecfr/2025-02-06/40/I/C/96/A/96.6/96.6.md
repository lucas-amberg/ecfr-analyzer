(2) The emissions measurements recorded and reported in accordance with subpart H of this part shall be used to determine compliance by the unit with the NO_X_ Budget emissions limitation under paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Nitrogen oxides requirements.* (1) The owners and operators of each NO_X_ Budget source and each NO_X_ Budget unit at the source shall hold NO_X_ allowances available for compliance deductions under § 96.54, as of the NO_X_ allowance transfer deadline, in the unit's compliance account and the source's overdraft account in an amount not less than the total NO_X_ emissions for the control period from the unit, as determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, plus any amount necessary to account for actual utilization under § 96.42(e) for the control period.


(2) Each ton of nitrogen oxides emitted in excess of the NO_X_ Budget emissions limitation shall constitute a separate violation of this part, the CAA, and applicable State law.

This period may be extended for cause, at any time prior to the end of 5 years, in writing by the permitting authority or the Administrator.


(i) The account certificate of representation for the NO_X_ authorized account representative for the source and each NO_X_ Budget unit at the source and all documents that demonstrate the truth of the statements in the account certificate of representation, in accordance with § 96.13; provided that the certificate and documents shall be retained on site at the source beyond such 5-year period until such documents are superseded because of the submission of a new account certificate of representation changing the NO_X_ authorized account representative.

(5) Any provision of the NO_X_ Budget Trading Program that applies to a NO_X_ Budget source (including a provision applicable to the NO_X_ authorized account representative of a NO_X_ Budget source) shall also apply to the owners and operators of such source and of the NO_X_ Budget units at the source.


(6) Any provision of the NO_X_ Budget Trading Program that applies to a NO_X_ Budget unit (including a provision applicable to the NO_X_ authorized account representative of a NO_X_ budget unit) shall also apply to the owners and operators of such unit. Except with regard to the requirements applicable to units with a common stack under subpart H of this part, the owners and operators and the NO_X_ authorized account representative of one NO_X_ Budget unit shall not be liable for any violation by any other NO_X_ Budget unit of which they are not owners or operators or the NO_X_ authorized account representative and that is located at a source of which they are not owners or operators or the NO_X_ authorized account representative.


(g) *Effect on other authorities.* No provision of the NO_X_ Budget Trading Program, a NO_X_ Budget permit application, a NO_X_ Budget permit, or an exemption under § 96.5 shall be construed as exempting or excluding the owners and operators and, to the extent applicable, the NO_X_ authorized account representative of a NO_X_ Budget source or NO_X_ Budget unit from compliance with any other provision of the applicable, approved State implementation plan, a federally enforceable permit, or the CAA.
