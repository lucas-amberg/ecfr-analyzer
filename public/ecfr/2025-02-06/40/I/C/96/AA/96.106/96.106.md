(a) *Permit requirements.* (1) The CAIR designated representative of each CAIR NO_X_ source required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR NO_X_ unit required to have a title V operating permit at the source shall:


(i) Submit to the permitting authority a complete CAIR permit application under § 96.122 in accordance with the deadlines specified in § 96.121; and


(ii) Submit in a timely manner any supplemental information that the permitting authority determines is necessary in order to review a CAIR permit application and issue or deny a CAIR permit.


(2) The owners and operators of each CAIR NO_X_ source required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR NO_X_ unit required to have a title V operating permit at the source shall have a CAIR permit issued by the permitting authority under subpart CC of this part for the source and operate the source and the unit in compliance with such CAIR permit.


(3) Except as provided in subpart II of this part, the owners and operators of a CAIR NO_X_ source that is not otherwise required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR NO_X_ unit that is not otherwise required to have a title V operating permit are not required to submit a CAIR permit application, and to have a CAIR permit, under subpart CC of this part for such CAIR NO_X_ source and such CAIR NO_X_ unit.


(b) *Monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.* (1) The owners and operators, and the CAIR designated representative, of each CAIR NO_X_ source and each CAIR NO_X_ unit at the source shall comply with the monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of subpart HH of this part.


(2) The emissions measurements recorded and reported in accordance with subpart HH of this part shall be used to determine compliance by each CAIR NO_X_ source with the CAIR NO_X_ emissions limitation under paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Nitrogen oxides emission requirements.* (1) As of the allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the owners and operators of each CAIR NO_X_ source and each CAIR NO_X_ unit at the source shall hold, in the source's compliance account, CAIR NO_X_ allowances available for compliance deductions for the control period under § 96.154(a) in an amount not less than the tons of total nitrogen oxides emissions for the control period from all CAIR NO_X_ units at the source, as determined in accordance with subpart HH of this part.


(2) A CAIR NO_X_ unit shall be subject to the requirements under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the control period starting on the later of January 1, 2009 or the deadline for meeting the unit's monitor certification requirements under § 96.170(b)(1), (2), or (5) and for each control period thereafter.

(4) CAIR NO_X_ allowances shall be held in, deducted from, or transferred into or among CAIR NO_X_ Allowance Tracking System accounts in accordance with subparts FF, GG, and II of this part.


(5) A CAIR NO_X_ allowance is a limited authorization to emit one ton of nitrogen oxides in accordance with the CAIR NO_X_ Annual Trading Program. No provision of the CAIR NO_X_ Annual Trading Program, the CAIR permit application, the CAIR permit, or an exemption under § 96.105 and no provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the State or the United States to terminate or limit such authorization.


(6) A CAIR NO_X_ allowance does not constitute a property right.


(7) Upon recordation by the Administrator under subpart EE, FF, GG, or II of this part, every allocation, transfer, or deduction of a CAIR NO_X_ allowance to or from a CAIR NO_X_ source's compliance account is incorporated automatically in any CAIR permit of the source.


(d) *Excess emissions requirements.* If a CAIR NO_X_ source emits nitrogen oxides during any control period in excess of the CAIR NO_X_ emissions limitation, then:


(1) The owners and operators of the source and each CAIR NO_X_ unit at the source shall surrender the CAIR NO_X_ allowances required for deduction under § 96.154(d)(1) and pay any fine, penalty, or assessment or comply with any other remedy imposed, for the same violations, under the Clean Air Act or applicable State law; and


(2) Each ton of such excess emissions and each day of such control period shall constitute a separate violation of this subpart, the Clean Air Act, and applicable State law.


(e) *Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.* (1) Unless otherwise provided, the owners and operators of the CAIR NO_X_ source and each CAIR NO_X_ unit at the source shall keep on site at the source each of the following documents for a period of 5 years from the date the document is created. This period may be extended for cause, at any time before the end of 5 years, in writing by the permitting authority or the Administrator.
