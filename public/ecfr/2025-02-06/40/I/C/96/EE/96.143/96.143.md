# ยง 96.143   Compliance supplement pool.

(a) In addition to the CAIR NO_X_ allowances allocated under ยง 96.142, the permitting authority may allocate for the control period in 2009 up to the following amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances to CAIR NO_X_ units in the respective State: 


(b) For any CAIR NO_X_ unit in the State that achieves NO_X_ emission reductions in 2007 and 2008 that are not necessary to comply with any State or federal emissions limitation applicable during such years, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request early reduction credits, and allocation of CAIR NO_X_ allowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section for such early reduction credits, in accordance with the following:


(1) The owners and operators of such CAIR NO_X_ unit shall monitor and report the NO_X_ emissions rate and the heat input of the unit in accordance with subpart HH of this part in each control period for which early reduction credit is requested.


(2) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO_X_ unit shall submit to the permitting authority by May 1, 2009 a request, in a format specified by the permitting authority, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the sum of the amounts (in tons) of the unit's NO_X_ emission reductions in 2007 and 2008 that are not necessary to comply with any State or federal emissions limitation applicable during such years, determined in accordance with subpart HH of this part.


(c) For any CAIR NO_X_ unit in the State whose compliance with the CAIR NO_X_ emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request the allocation of CAIR NO_X_ allowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the following:


(1) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO_X_ unit shall submit to the permitting authority by May 1, 2009 a request, in a format specified by the permitting authority, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the minimum amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances necessary to remove such undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply.


(2) In the request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO_X_ unit shall demonstrate that, in the absence of allocation to the unit of the amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances requested, the unit's compliance with the CAIR NO_X_ emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period. This demonstration must include a showing that it would not be feasible for the owners and operators of the unit to:


(i) Obtain a sufficient amount of electricity from other electricity generation facilities, during the installation of control technology at the unit for compliance with the CAIR NO_X_ emissions limitation, to prevent such undue risk; or


(ii) Obtain under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, or otherwise obtain, a sufficient amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances to prevent such undue risk.


(d) The permitting authority will review each request under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section submitted by May 1, 2009 and will allocate CAIR NO_X_ allowances for the control period in 2009 to CAIR NO_X_ units in the State and covered by such request as follows:


(1) Upon receipt of each such request, the permitting authority will make any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that the amount of the CAIR NO_X_ allowances requested meets the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.


(2) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has an amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances not less than the total amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the permitting authority will allocate to each CAIR NO_X_ unit covered by such requests the amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section).


(3) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has a smaller amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances than the total amount of CAIR NO_X_ allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the permitting authority will allocate CAIR NO_X_ allowances to each CAIR NO_X_ unit covered by such requests according to the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate:


(4) By November 30, 2009, the permitting authority will determine, and submit to the Administrator, the allocations under paragraph (d)(2) or (3)of this section.


(5) By January 1, 2010, the Administrator will record the allocations under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
