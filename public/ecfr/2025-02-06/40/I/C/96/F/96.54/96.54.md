# § 96.54   Compliance.

(a) *NO*_X_*allowance transfer deadline.* The NO_X_ allowances are available to be deducted for compliance with a unit's NO_X_ Budget emissions limitation for a control period in a given year only if the NO_X_ allowances:


(1) Were allocated for a control period in a prior year or the same year; and


(2) Are held in the unit's compliance account, or the overdraft account of the source where the unit is located, as of the NO_X_ allowance transfer deadline for that control period or are transferred into the compliance account or overdraft account by a NO_X_ allowance transfer correctly submitted for recordation under § 96.60 by the NO_X_ allowance transfer deadline for that control period.


(b) *Deductions for compliance.* (1) Following the recordation, in accordance with § 96.61, of NO_X_ allowance transfers submitted for recordation in the unit's compliance account or the overdraft account of the source where the unit is located by the NO_X_ allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will deduct NO_X_ allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section to cover the unit's NO_X_ emissions (as determined in accordance with subpart H of this part), or to account for actual utilization under § 96.42(e), for the control period:


(i) From the compliance account; and


(ii) Only if no more NO_X_ allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section remain in the compliance account, from the overdraft account. In deducting allowances for units at the source from the overdraft account, the Administrator will begin with the unit having the compliance account with the lowest NO_X_ Allowance Tracking System account number and end with the unit having the compliance account with the highest NO_X_ Allowance Tracking System account number (with account numbers sorted beginning with the left-most character and ending with the right-most character and the letter characters assigned values in alphabetical order and less than all numeric characters).


(2) The Administrator will deduct NO_X_ allowances first under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and then under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:


(i) Until the number of NO_X_ allowances deducted for the control period equals the number of tons of NO_X_ emissions, determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, from the unit for the control period for which compliance is being determined, plus the number of NO_X_ allowances required for deduction to account for actual utilization under § 96.42(e) for the control period; or


(ii) Until no more NO_X_ allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section remain in the respective account.


(c)(1) *Identification of NO*_X_*allowances by serial number.* The NO_X_ authorized account representative for each compliance account may identify by serial number the NO_X_ allowances to be deducted from the unit's compliance account under paragraph (b), (d), or (e) of this section. Such identification shall be made in the compliance certification report submitted in accordance with § 96.30.


(2) *First-in, first-out.* The Administrator will deduct NO_X_ allowances for a control period from the compliance account, in the absence of an identification or in the case of a partial identification of NO_X_ allowances by serial number under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the overdraft account on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the following order:


(i) Those NO_X_ allowances that were allocated for the control period to the unit under subpart E or I of this part;


(ii) Those NO_X_ allowances that were allocated for the control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of recordation;


(iii) Those NO_X_ allowances that were allocated for a prior control period to the unit under subpart E or I of this part; and


(iv) Those NO_X_ allowances that were allocated for a prior control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of recordation.


(d) *Deductions for excess emissions.* (1) After making the deductions for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will deduct from the unit's compliance account or the overdraft account of the source where the unit is located a number of NO_X_ allowances, allocated for a control period after the control period in which the unit has excess emissions, equal to three times the number of the unit's excess emissions.


(2) If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NO_X_ allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NO_X_ allowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NO_X_ allowances are recorded in either account.


(3) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d) of this section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of the NO_X_ Budget unit for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or their obligation to comply with any other remedy, for the same violation, as ordered under the CAA or applicable State law. The following guidelines will be followed in assessing fines, penalties or other obligations:


(i) For purposes of determining the number of days of violation, if a NO_X_ Budget unit has excess emissions for a control period, each day in the control period (153 days) constitutes a day in violation unless the owners and operators of the unit demonstrate that a lesser number of days should be considered.


(ii) Each ton of excess emissions is a separate violation.


(e) *Deductions for units sharing a common stack.* In the case of units sharing a common stack and having emissions that are not separately monitored or apportioned in accordance with subpart H of this part:


(1) The NO_X_ authorized account representative of the units may identify the percentage of NO_X_ allowances to be deducted from each such unit's compliance account to cover the unit's share of NO_X_ emissions from the common stack for a control period. Such identification shall be made in the compliance certification report submitted in accordance with § 96.30.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Administrator will deduct NO_X_ allowances for each such unit until the number of NO_X_ allowances deducted equals the unit's identified percentage (under paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the number of tons of NO_X_ emissions, as determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, from the common stack for the control period for which compliance is being determined or, if no percentage is identified, an equal percentage for each such unit, plus the number of allowances required for deduction to account for actual utilization under § 96.42(e) for the control period.


(f) The Administrator will record in the appropriate compliance account or overdraft account all deductions from such an account pursuant to paragraphs (b), (d), or (e) of this section.
