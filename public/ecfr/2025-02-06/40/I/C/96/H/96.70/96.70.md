# § 96.70   General requirements.

The owners and operators, and to the extent applicable, the NO_X_ authorized account representative of a NO_X_ Budget unit, shall comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements as provided in this subpart and in subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. For purposes of complying with such requirements, the definitions in § 96.2 and in § 72.2 of this chapter shall apply, and the terms “affected unit,” “designated representative,” and “continuous emission monitoring system” (or “CEMS”) in part 75 of this chapter shall be replaced by the terms “NO_X_ Budget unit,” “NO_X_ authorized account representative,” and “continuous emission monitoring system” (or “CEMS”), respectively, as defined in § 96.2.


(a) *Requirements for installation, certification, and data accounting.* The owner or operator of each NO_X_ Budget unit must meet the following requirements. These provisions also apply to a unit for which an application for a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit is submitted and not denied or withdrawn, as provided in subpart I of this part:


(1) Install all monitoring systems required under this subpart for monitoring NO_X_ mass. This includes all systems required to monitor NO_X_ emission rate, NO_X_ concentration, heat input, and flow, in accordance with §§ 75.72 and 75.76.


(2) Install all monitoring systems for monitoring heat input, if required under § 96.76 for developing NO_X_ allowance allocations.


(3) Successfully complete all certification tests required under § 96.71 and meet all other provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter applicable to the monitoring systems under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.


(4) Record, and report data from the monitoring systems under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.


(b) *Compliance dates.* The owner or operator must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section on or before the following dates and must record and report data on and after the following dates:


(1) NO_X_ Budget units for which the owner or operator intends to apply for early reduction credits under § 96.55(d) must comply with the requirements of this subpart by May 1, 2000.


(2) Except for NO_X_ Budget units under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, NO_X_ Budget units under § 96.4 that commence operation before January 1, 2002, must comply with the requirements of this subpart by May 1, 2002.


(3) NO_X_ Budget units under § 96.4 that commence operation on or after January 1, 2002 and that report on an annual basis under § 96.74(d) must comply with the requirements of this subpart by the later of the following dates:


(i) May 1, 2002; or


(ii) The earlier of:


(A) 180 days after the date on which the unit commences operation or, (B) For units under § 96.4(a)(1), 90 days after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation.


(4) NO_X_ Budget units under § 96.4 that commence operation on or after January 1, 2002 and that report on a control season basis under § 96.74(d) must comply with the requirements of this subpart by the later of the following dates:


(i) The earlier of:


(A) 180 days after the date on which the unit commences operation or,


(B) For units under § 96.4(a)(1), 90 days after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation.


(ii) However, if the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(4)(i) section does not occur during a control period, May 1; immediately following the date determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.


(5) For a NO_X_ Budget unit with a new stack or flue for which construction is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section or subpart I of this part:


(i) 90 days after the date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue;


(ii) However, if the unit reports on a control season basis under § 96.74(d) and the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section does not occur during the control period, May 1 immediately following the applicable deadline in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.


(6) For a unit for which an application for a NO_X_ Budget opt in permit is submitted and not denied or withdrawn, the compliance dates specified under subpart I of this part.


(c) *Reporting data prior to initial certification.* (1) The owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit that misses the certification deadline under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not eligible to apply for early reduction credits. The owner or operator of the unit becomes subject to the certification deadline under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(2) The owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget under paragraphs (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section must determine, record and report NO_X_ mass, heat input (if required for purposes of allocations) and any other values required to determine NO_X_ Mass (e.g. NO_X_ emission rate and heat input or NO_X_ concentration and stack flow) using the provisions of § 75.70(g) of this chapter, from the date and hour that the unit starts operating until all required certification tests are successfully completed.


(d) *Prohibitions.* (1) No owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit or a non-NO_X_ Budget unit monitored under § 75.72(b)(2)(ii) shall use any alternative monitoring system, alternative reference method, or any other alternative for the required continuous emission monitoring system without having obtained prior written approval in accordance with § 96.75.


(2) No owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit or a non-NO_X_ Budget unit monitored under § 75.72(b)(2)(ii) shall operate the unit so as to discharge, or allow to be discharged, NO_X_ emissions to the atmosphere without accounting for all such emissions in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter except as provided for in § 75.74 of this chapter.


(3) No owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit or a non-NO_X_ Budget unit monitored under § 75.72(b)(2)(ii) shall disrupt the continuous emission monitoring system, any portion thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring method, and thereby avoid monitoring and recording NO_X_ mass emissions discharged into the atmosphere, except for periods of recertification or periods when calibration, quality assurance testing, or maintenance is performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter except as provided for in § 75.74 of this chapter.


(4) No owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit or a non-NO_X_ Budget unit monitored under § 75.72(b)(2)(ii) shall retire or permanently discontinue use of the continuous emission monitoring system, any component thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring system under this subpart, except under any one of the following circumstances:


(i) During the period that the unit is covered by a retired unit exemption under § 96.5 that is in effect;


(ii) The owner or operator is monitoring emissions from the unit with another certified monitoring system approved, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter, by the permitting authority for use at that unit that provides emission data for the same pollutant or parameter as the retired or discontinued monitoring system; or


(iii) The NO_X_ authorized account representative submits notification of the date of certification testing of a replacement monitoring system in accordance with § 96.71(b)(2).
