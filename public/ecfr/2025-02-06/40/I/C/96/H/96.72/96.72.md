# ยง 96.72   Out of control periods.

(a) Whenever any monitoring system fails to meet the quality assurance requirements of appendix B of part 75 of this chapter, data shall be substituted using the applicable procedures in subpart D, appendix D, or appendix E of part 75 of this chapter.


(b) *Audit decertification.* Whenever both an audit of a monitoring system and a review of the initial certification or recertification application reveal that any system or component should not have been certified or recertified because it did not meet a particular performance specification or other requirement under ยง 96.71 or the applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter, both at the time of the initial certification or recertification application submission and at the time of the audit, the permitting authority will issue a notice of disapproval of the certification status of such system or component. For the purposes of this paragraph, an audit shall be either a field audit or an audit of any information submitted to the permitting authority or the Administrator. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the permitting authority revokes prospectively the certification status of the system or component. The data measured and recorded by the system or component shall not be considered valid quality-assured data from the date of issuance of the notification of the revoked certification status until the date and time that the owner or operator completes subsequently approved initial certification or recertification tests. The owner or operator shall follow the initial certification or recertification procedures in ยง 96.71 for each disapproved system.
