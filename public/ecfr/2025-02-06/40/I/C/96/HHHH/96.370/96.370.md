# § 96.370   General requirements.

The owners and operators, and to the extent applicable, the CAIR designated representative, of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit, shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as provided in this subpart and in subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. For purposes of complying with such requirements, the definitions in § 96.302 and in § 72.2 of this chapter shall apply, and the terms “affected unit,” “designated representative,” and “continuous emission monitoring system” (or “CEMS”) in part 75 of this chapter shall be deemed to refer to the terms “CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit,” “CAIR designated representative,” and “continuous emission monitoring system” (or “CEMS”) respectively, as defined in § 96.302. The owner or operator of a unit that is not a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit but that is monitored under § 75.72(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter shall comply with the same monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit.


(a) *Requirements for installation, certification, and data accounting.* The owner or operator of each CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit shall:


(1) Install all monitoring systems required under this subpart for monitoring NO_X_ mass emissions and individual unit heat input (including all systems required to monitor NO_X_ emission rate, NO_X_ concentration, stack gas moisture content, stack gas flow rate, CO_2_ or O_2_ concentration, and fuel flow rate, as applicable, in accordance with §§ 75.71 and 75.72 of this chapter);


(2) Successfully complete all certification tests required under § 96.371 and meet all other requirements of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter applicable to the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and


(3) Record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) *Compliance deadlines.* Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall meet the monitoring system certification and other requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section on or before the following dates. The owner or operator shall record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on and after the following dates.


(1) For the owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation before July 1, 2007, by May 1, 2008.


(2) For the owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation on or after July 1, 2007 and that reports on an annual basis under § 96.374(d), by the later of the following dates:


(i) 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation; or


(ii) May 1, 2008. 


(3) For the owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation on or after July 1, 2007 and that reports on a control period basis under § 96.374(d)(2)(ii), by the later of the following dates:


(i) 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation; or


(ii) If the compliance date under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is not during a control period, May 1 immediately following the compliance date under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.


(4) For the owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit for which construction of a new stack or flue or installation of add-on NO_X_ emission controls is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (2), (6), or (7) of this section and that reports on an annual basis under § 96.374(d), by 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue or add-on NO_X_ emissions controls.


(5) For the owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit for which construction of a new stack or flue or installation of add-on NO_X_ emission controls is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (3), (6), or (7) of this section and that reports on a control period basis under § 96.374(d)(2)(ii), by the later of the following dates:


(i) 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue or add-on NO_X_ emissions controls; or


(ii) If the compliance date under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section is not during a control period, May 1 immediately following the compliance date under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.


(6) Notwithstanding the dates in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, for the owner or operator of a unit for which a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season opt-in permit application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in permit is not yet issued or denied under subpart IIII of this part, by the date specified in § 96.384(b).


(7) Notwithstanding the dates in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, for the owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season opt-in unit, by the date on which the CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season opt-in unit under subpart IIII of this part enters the CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season Trading Program as provided in § 96.384(g).


(c) *Reporting data.* The owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit that does not meet the applicable compliance date set forth in paragraph (b) of this section for any monitoring system under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall, for each such monitoring system, determine, record, and report maximum potential (or, as appropriate, minimum potential) values for NO_X_ concentration, NO_X_ emission rate, stack gas flow rate, stack gas moisture content, fuel flow rate, and any other parameters required to determine NO_X_ mass emissions and heat input in accordance with § 75.31(b)(2) or (c)(3) of this chapter, section 2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, or section 2.5 of appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable.


(d) *Prohibitions.* (1) No owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit shall use any alternative monitoring system, alternative reference method, or any other alternative to any requirement of this subpart without having obtained prior written approval in accordance with § 96.375.


(2) No owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit shall operate the unit so as to discharge, or allow to be discharged, NO_X_ emissions to the atmosphere without accounting for all such emissions in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter.


(3) No owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit shall disrupt the continuous emission monitoring system, any portion thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring method, and thereby avoid monitoring and recording NO_X_ mass emissions discharged into the atmosphere or heat input, except for periods of recertification or periods when calibration, quality assurance testing, or maintenance is performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter.


(4) No owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit shall retire or permanently discontinue use of the continuous emission monitoring system, any component thereof, or any other approved monitoring system under this subpart, except under any one of the following circumstances:


(i) During the period that the unit is covered by an exemption under § 96.305 that is in effect;


(ii) The owner or operator is monitoring emissions from the unit with another certified monitoring system approved, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter, by the permitting authority for use at that unit that provides emission data for the same pollutant or parameter as the retired or discontinued monitoring system; or


(iii) The CAIR designated representative submits notification of the date of certification testing of a replacement monitoring system for the retired or discontinued monitoring system in accordance with § 96.371(d)(3)(i). 


(e) *Long-term cold storage.* The owner or operator of a CAIR NO_X_ Ozone Season unit is subject to the applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter concerning units in long-term cold storage.
