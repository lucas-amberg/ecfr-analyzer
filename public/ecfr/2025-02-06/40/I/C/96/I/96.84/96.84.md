# § 96.84   Opt-in process.

The permitting authority will issue or deny a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit for a unit for which an initial application for a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit under § 96.83 is submitted, in accordance with § 96.20 and the following:


(a) *Interim review of monitoring plan.* The permitting authority will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit under § 96.83. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information demonstrating that the NO_X_ emissions rate and heat input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart H of this part. A determination of sufficiency shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the unit's monitoring plan.


(b) If the permitting authority determines that the unit's monitoring plan is sufficient under paragraph (a) of this section and after completion of monitoring system certification under subpart H of this part, the NO_X_ emissions rate and the heat input of the unit shall be monitored and reported in accordance with subpart H of this part for one full control period during which monitoring system availability is not less than 90 percent and during which the unit is in full compliance with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements. Solely for purposes of applying the requirements in the prior sentence, the unit shall be treated as a “NO_X_ Budget unit” prior to issuance of a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit covering the unit.


(c) Based on the information monitored and reported under paragraph (b) of this section, the unit's baseline heat rate shall be calculated as the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control period and the unit's baseline NO_X_ emissions rate shall be calculated as the unit's total NO_X_ emissions (in lb) for the control period divided by the unit's baseline heat rate.


(d) After calculating the baseline heat input and the baseline NO_X_ emissions rate for the unit under paragraph (c) of this section, the permitting authority will serve a draft NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit on the NO_X_ authorized account representative of the unit.


(e) *Confirmation of intention to opt-in.* Within 20 days after the issuance of the draft NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit, the NO_X_ authorized account representative of the unit must submit to the permitting authority a confirmation of the intention to opt in the unit or a withdrawal of the application for a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit under § 96.83. The permitting authority will treat the failure to make a timely submission as a withdrawal of the NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit application.


(f) *Issuance of draft NO*_X_*Budget opt-in permit.* If the NO_X_ authorized account representative confirms the intention to opt-in the unit under paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority will issue the draft NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit in accordance with § 96.20.


(g) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, if at any time before issuance of a draft NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority determines that the unit does not qualify as a NO_X_ Budget opt-in source under § 96.80, the permitting authority will issue a draft denial of a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit for the unit in accordance with § 96.20.


(h) *Withdrawal of application for NO*_X_*Budget opt-in permit.* A NO_X_ authorized account representative of a unit may withdraw its application for a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit under § 96.83 at any time prior to the issuance of the final NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit. Once the application for a NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit is withdrawn, a NO_X_ authorized account representative wanting to reapply must submit a new application for a NO_X_ Budget permit under § 96.83.


(i) *Effective date.* The effective date of the initial NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit shall be May 1 of the first control period starting after the issuance of the initial NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit by the permitting authority. The unit shall be a NO_X_ Budget opt-in source and a NO_X_ Budget unit as of the effective date of the initial NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit.
