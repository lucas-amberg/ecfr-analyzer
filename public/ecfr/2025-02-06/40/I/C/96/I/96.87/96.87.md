# § 96.87   Change in regulatory status.

(a) *Notification.* When a NO_X_ Budget opt-in source becomes a NO_X_ Budget unit under § 96.4, the NO_X_ authorized account representative shall notify in writing the permitting authority and the Administrator of such change in the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source's regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.


(b) *Permitting authority's and Administrator's action.* (1)(i) When the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source becomes a NO_X_ Budget unit under § 96.4, the permitting authority will revise the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source's NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit to meet the requirements of a NO_X_ Budget permit under § 96.23 as of an effective date that is the date on which such NO_X_ Budget opt-in source becomes a NO_X_ Budget unit under § 96.4. 


(ii)(A) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account for the NO_X_ Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of the NO_X_ Budget source where the unit is located, NO_X_ allowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as:


(*1*) Any NO_X_ allowances allocated to the NO_X_ Budget unit (as a NO_X_ Budget opt-in source) under § 96.88 for any control period after the last control period during which the unit's NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit was effective; and


(*2*) If the effective date of the NO_X_ Budget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the NO_X_ allowances allocated to the NO_X_ Budget unit (as a NO_X_ Budget opt-in source) under § 96.88 for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period.


(B) The NO_X_ authorized account representative shall ensure that the compliance account of the NO_X_ Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of the NO_X_ Budget source where the unit is located, includes the NO_X_ allowances necessary for completion of the deduction under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NO_X_ allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NO_X_ allowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NO_X_ allowances are recorded in either account.


(iii)(A) For every control period during which the NO_X_ Budget permit revised under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is effective, the NO_X_ Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be treated, solely for purposes of NO_X_ allowance allocations under § 96.42, as a unit that commenced operation on the effective date of the NO_X_ Budget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and will be allocated NO_X_ allowances under § 96.42.


(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, if the effective date of the NO_X_ Budget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the following number of NO_X_ allowances will be allocated to the NO_X_ Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section under § 96.42 for the control period: the number of NO_X_ allowances otherwise allocated to the NO_X_ Budget unit under § 96.42 for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period.


(2)(i) When the NO_X_ authorized account representative of a NO_X_ Budget opt-in source does not renew its NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit under § 96.83(b), the Administrator will deduct from the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft account of the NO_X_ Budget source where the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source is located, NO_X_ allowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any NO_X_ allowances allocated to the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source under § 96.88 for any control period after the last control period for which the NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit is effective. The NO_X_ authorized account representative shall ensure that the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source's compliance account or the overdraft account of the NO_X_ Budget source where the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source is located includes the NO_X_ allowances necessary for completion of such deduction. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NO_X_ allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NO_X_ allowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NO_X_ allowances are recorded in either account.


(ii) After the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is completed, the Administrator will close the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source's compliance account. If any NO_X_ allowances remain in the compliance account after completion of such deduction and any deduction under § 96.54, the Administrator will close the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source's compliance account and will establish, and transfer any remaining allowances to, a new general account for the owners and operators of the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source. The NO_X_ authorized account representative for the NO_X_ Budget opt-in source shall become the NO_X_ authorized account representative for the general account.
