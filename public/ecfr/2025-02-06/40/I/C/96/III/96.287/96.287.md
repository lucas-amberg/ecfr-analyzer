# § 96.287   Change in regulatory status.

(a) *Notification.* If a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204, then the CAIR designated representative shall notify in writing the permitting authority and the Administrator of such change in the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit's regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.


(b) *Permitting authority's and Administrator's actions.* (1) If a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204, the permitting authority will revise the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit's CAIR opt-in permit to meet the requirements of a CAIR permit under § 96.223, and remove the CAIR opt-in permit provisions, as of the date on which the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204.


(2)(i) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of the source that includes a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit that becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204, CAIR SO_2_ allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as:


(A) Any CAIR SO_2_ allowances allocated to the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit under § 96.288 for any control period after the date on which the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204; and


(B) If the date on which the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204 is not December 31, the CAIR SO_2_ allowances allocated to the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit under § 96.288 for the control period that includes the date on which the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the date on which the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204 divided by the total number of days in the control period and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.


(ii) The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that the compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit that becomes a CAIR SO_2_ unit under § 96.204 contains the CAIR SO_2_ allowances necessary for completion of the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
