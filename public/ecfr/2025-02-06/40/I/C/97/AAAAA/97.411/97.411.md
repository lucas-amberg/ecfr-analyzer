# § 97.411   Timing requirements for CSAPR NO

(a) *Existing units.* (1) CSAPR NO_X_ Annual allowances are allocated, for the control periods in 2015 and each year thereafter, as provided in a notice of data availability issued by the Administrator. Providing an allocation to a unit in such notice does not constitute a determination that the unit is a CSAPR NO_X_ Annual unit, and not providing an allocation to a unit in such notice does not constitute a determination that the unit is not a CSAPR NO_X_ Annual unit.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a unit provided an allocation in the notice of data availability issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not operate, starting after 2014, during the control period in two consecutive years, such unit will not be allocated the CSAPR NO_X_ Annual allowances provided in such notice for the unit for the control periods in the fifth year after the first such year and in each year after that fifth year. All CSAPR NO_X_ Annual allowances that would otherwise have been allocated to such unit will be allocated to the new unit set-aside for the State where such unit is located and for the respective years involved. If such unit resumes operation, the Administrator will allocate CSAPR NO_X_ Annual allowances to the unit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *New units*—(1) *New unit set-asides.* (i)(A) By June 1 of each year from 2015 through 2020, the Administrator will calculate the CSAPR NO_X_ Annual allowance allocation to each CSAPR NO_X_ Annual unit in a State and areas of Indian country within the borders of the State subject to the State's SIP authority, in accordance with § 97.412(a)(2) through (7) and (12) and §§ 97.406(b)(2) and 97.430 through 97.435, for the control period in the year of the applicable calculation deadline under this paragraph and will promulgate a notice of data availability of the results of the calculations.
