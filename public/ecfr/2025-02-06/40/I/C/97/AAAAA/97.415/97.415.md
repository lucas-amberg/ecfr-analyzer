(a) *Changing designated representative.* The designated representative may be changed at any time upon receipt by the Administrator of a superseding complete certificate of representation under § 97.416. Notwithstanding any such change, all representations, actions, inactions, and submissions by the previous designated representative before the time and date when the Administrator receives the superseding certificate of representation shall be binding on the new designated representative and the owners and operators of the CSAPR NO_X_ Annual source and the CSAPR NO_X_ Annual units at the source.


(b) *Changing alternate designated representative.* The alternate designated representative may be changed at any time upon receipt by the Administrator of a superseding complete certificate of representation under § 97.416. Notwithstanding any such change, all representations, actions, inactions, and submissions by the previous alternate designated representative before the time and date when the Administrator receives the superseding certificate of representation shall be binding on the new alternate designated representative, the designated representative, and the owners and operators of the CSAPR NO_X_ Annual source and the CSAPR NO_X_ Annual units at the source.


(c) *Changes in owners and operators.* (1) In the event an owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Annual source or a CSAPR NO_X_ Annual unit at the source is not included in the list of owners and operators in the certificate of representation under § 97.416, such owner or operator shall be deemed to be subject to and bound by the certificate of representation, the representations, actions, inactions, and submissions of the designated representative and any alternate designated representative of the source or unit, and the decisions and orders of the Administrator, as if the owner or operator were included in such list.


(2) Within 30 days after any change in the owners and operators of a CSAPR NO_X_ Annual source or a CSAPR NO_X_ Annual unit at the source, including the addition or removal of an owner or operator, the designated representative or any alternate designated representative shall submit a revision to the certificate of representation under § 97.416 amending the list of owners and operators to reflect the change.


(d) *Changes in units at the source.* Within 30 days of any change in which units are located at a CSAPR NO_X_ Annual source (including the addition or removal of a unit), the designated representative or any alternate designated representative shall submit a certificate of representation under § 97.416 amending the list of units to reflect the change.


(1) If the change is the addition of a unit that operated (other than for purposes of testing by the manufacturer before initial installation) before being located at the source, then the certificate of representation shall identify, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, the entity from whom the unit was purchased or otherwise obtained (including name, address, telephone number, and facsimile number (if any)), the date on which the unit was purchased or otherwise obtained, and the date on which the unit became located at the source.


(2) If the change is the removal of a unit, then the certificate of representation shall identify, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, the entity to which the unit was sold or that otherwise obtained the unit (including name, address, telephone number, and facsimile number (if any)), the date on which the unit was sold or otherwise obtained, and the date on which the unit became no longer located at the source.
