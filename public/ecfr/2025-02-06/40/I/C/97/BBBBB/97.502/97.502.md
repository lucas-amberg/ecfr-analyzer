*Permitting authority* means “permitting authority” as defined in §§ 70.2 and 71.2 of this chapter.


*Potential electrical output capacity* means, for a unit (in MWh/yr), 33 percent of the unit's maximum design heat input rate (in Btu/hr), divided by 3,413 Btu/kWh, divided by 1,000 kWh/MWh, and multiplied by 8,760 hr/yr.


*Receive* or *receipt of* means, when referring to the Administrator, to come into possession of a document, information, or correspondence (whether sent in hard copy or by authorized electronic transmission), as indicated in an official log, or by a notation made on the document, information, or correspondence, by the Administrator in the regular course of business.


*Recordation, record,* or *recorded* means, with regard to CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowances, the moving of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowances by the Administrator into, out of, or between Allowance Management System accounts, for purposes of allocation, auction, transfer, or deduction.


*Reference method* means any direct test method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant as specified in § 75.22 of this chapter.


*Replacement, replace,* or *replaced* means, with regard to a unit, the demolishing of a unit, or the permanent retirement and permanent disabling of a unit, and the construction of another unit (the replacement unit) to be used instead of the demolished or retired unit (the replaced unit).


*Sequential use of energy* means:


(1) The use of reject heat from electricity production in a useful thermal energy application or process; or


(2) The use of reject heat from a useful thermal energy application or process in electricity production.


*Serial number* means, for a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowance, the unique identification number assigned to each CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowance by the Administrator.


*Solid waste incineration unit* means a stationary, fossil-fuel-fired boiler or stationary, fossil-fuel-fired combustion turbine that is a “solid waste incineration unit” as defined in section 129(g)(1) of the Clean Air Act.


*Source* means all buildings, structures, or installations located in one or more contiguous or adjacent properties under common control of the same person or persons. This definition does not change or otherwise affect the definition of “major source”, “stationary source”, or “source” as set forth and implemented in a title V operating permit program or any other program under the Clean Air Act.




*State* means one of the States that is subject to the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 Trading Program pursuant to § 52.38(b)(1), (b)(2)(i), and (b)(3) through (5) and (13) through (15) of this chapter.




*Submit* or *serve* means to send or transmit a document, information, or correspondence to the person specified in accordance with the applicable regulation:


(1) In person;


(2) By United States Postal Service; or


(3) By other means of dispatch or transmission and delivery;


(4) Provided that compliance with any “submission” or “service” deadline shall be determined by the date of dispatch, transmission, or mailing and not the date of receipt.


*Topping-cycle unit* means a unit in which the energy input to the unit is first used to produce useful power, including electricity, where at least some of the reject heat from the electricity production is then used to provide useful thermal energy.


*Total energy input* means, for a unit, total energy of all forms supplied to the unit, excluding energy produced by the unit. Each form of energy supplied shall be measured by the lower heating value of that form of energy calculated as follows:


*Total energy output* means, for a unit, the sum of useful power and useful thermal energy produced by the unit.


*Unit* means a stationary, fossil-fuel-fired boiler, stationary, fossil-fuel-fired combustion turbine, or other stationary, fossil-fuel-fired combustion device. A unit that undergoes a physical change or is moved to a different location or source shall continue to be treated as the same unit. A unit (the replaced unit) that is replaced by another unit (the replacement unit) at the same or a different source shall continue to be treated as the same unit, and the replacement unit shall be treated as a separate unit.


*Unit operating day* means, with regard to a unit, a calendar day in which the unit combusts any fuel.


*Unit operating hour* or *hour of unit operation* means, with regard to a unit, an hour in which the unit combusts any fuel.


*Useful power* means, with regard to a unit, electricity or mechanical energy that the unit makes available for use, excluding any such energy used in the power production process (which process includes, but is not limited to, any on-site processing or treatment of fuel combusted at the unit and any on-site emission controls).


*Useful thermal energy* means thermal energy that is:


(1) Made available to an industrial or commercial process (not a power production process), excluding any heat contained in condensate return or makeup water;


(2) Used in a heating application (*e.g.*, space heating or domestic hot water heating); or


(3) Used in a space cooling application (*i.e.*, in an absorption chiller).


*Utility power distribution system* means the portion of an electricity grid owned or operated by a utility and dedicated to delivering electricity to customers.
