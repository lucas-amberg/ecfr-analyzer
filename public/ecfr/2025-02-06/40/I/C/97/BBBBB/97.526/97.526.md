# § 97.526   Banking and conversion.

(a) A CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowance may be banked for future use or transfer in a compliance account or a general account in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) Any CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowance that is held in a compliance account or a general account will remain in such account unless and until the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowance is deducted or transferred under § 97.511(c), § 97.523, § 97.524, § 97.525, § 97.527, or § 97.528 or paragraph (c) or (d)

 of this section.


(c) At any time after the allowance transfer deadline for the last control period for which a State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 trading budget is established under § 97.510(a) for a given State and after completion of the procedures under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator may record a transfer of any CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowances held in the compliance account for a source in such State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) to a general account identified or established by the Administrator with the source's designated representative as the authorized account representative and with the owners and operators of the source (as indicated on the certificate of representation for the source) as the persons represented by the authorized account representative. The Administrator will notify the designated representative not less than 15 days before making such a transfer.






(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, part 52 of this chapter, or any SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(4) or (5) of this chapter:


(1) As soon as practicable after the completion of deductions under § 97.524 for the control period in 2016, but not later than March 1, 2018, the Administrator will temporarily suspend acceptance of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowance transfers submitted under § 97.522 and, before resuming acceptance of such transfers, will take the actions in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section with regard to every general account and every compliance account except a compliance account for a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State):


(i) The Administrator will deduct all CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowances allocated for the control periods in 2015 and 2016 from each such account.


(ii) The Administrator will determine a conversion factor equal to the greater of 1.0000 or the quotient, expressed to four decimal places, of the sum of all CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowances deducted from all such accounts under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section divided by the product of 1.5 multiplied by the sum of the variability limits for the control period in 2017 set forth in § 97.810(b) for all States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter.






(iii) The Administrator will allocate and record in each such account an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances for the control period in 2017 computed as the quotient, rounded up to the nearest allowance, of the number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowances deducted from such account under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.




(iv) Where, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator deducts CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 1 allowances from the compliance account for a source in a State not listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State), the Administrator will not record CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances in that compliance account but instead will allocate and record the amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances for the control period in 2017 computed for such source in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section in a general account identified by the designated representative for such source, provided that if the designated representative fails to identify such a general account in a submission to the Administrator by July 14, 2021, the Administrator may record such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances in a general account identified or established by the Administrator with the designated representative as the authorized account representative and with the owners and operators of such source (as indicated on the certificate of representation for the source) as the persons represented by the authorized account representative.
