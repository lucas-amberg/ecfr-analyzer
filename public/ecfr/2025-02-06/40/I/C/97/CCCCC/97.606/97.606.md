(c) *SO*_2_*emissions requirements*—(1) *CSAPR SO*_2_*Group 1 emissions limitation.* (i) As of the allowance transfer deadline for a control period in a given year, the owners and operators of each CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 source and each CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 unit at the source shall hold, in the source's compliance account, CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 allowances available for deduction for such control period under § 97.624(a) in an amount not less than the tons of total SO_2_ emissions for such control period from all CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 units at the source.

(iii) Total SO_2_ emissions from all CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 units at CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 sources in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) during a control period in a given year exceed the State assurance level if such total SO_2_ emissions exceed the sum, for such control period, of the State SO_2_ Group 1 trading budget under § 97.610(a) and the State's variability limit under § 97.610(b).


(iv) It shall not be a violation of this subpart or of the Clean Air Act if total SO_2_ emissions from all CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 units at CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 sources in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) during a control period exceed the State assurance level or if a common designated representative's share of total SO_2_ emissions from the CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 units at CSAPR SO_2_ Group 1 sources in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) during a control period exceeds the common designated representative's assurance level.
