# § 97.811   Timing requirements for CSAPR NO

(a) *Existing units.* (1) CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowances are allocated, for the control periods in 2017 and each year thereafter, as provided in a notice of data availability issued by the Administrator. Providing an allocation to a unit in such notice does not constitute a determination that the unit is a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 unit, and not providing an allocation to a unit in such notice does not constitute a determination that the unit is not a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 unit.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section:


(i) If a unit provided an allocation of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances in the applicable notice of data availability issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not operate, starting after 2016, during the control period in two consecutive years, such unit will not be allocated the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances provided in such notice for the unit for the control periods in the fifth year after the first such year and in each year after that fifth year.


(ii) If a unit provided an allocation of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Expanded Group 2 allowances in the applicable notice of data availability issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not operate, starting after 2020, during the control period in two consecutive years, such unit will not be allocated the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Expanded Group 2 allowances provided in such notice for the unit for the control periods in the fifth year after the first such year and in each year after that fifth year.


(iii) All CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowances that would otherwise have been allocated to a unit described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section will be allocated to the new unit set-aside for the State where such unit is located and for the respective years involved.

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, not later than September 15, 2023, the owners and operators of the source shall hold sufficient CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances eligible to satisfy such unsatisfied surrender requirements under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section in the source's compliance account.


(B) With regard to any portion of such unsatisfied surrender requirements that apply to former owners and operators of the source pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, not later than September 15, 2023, such former owners and operators shall hold sufficient CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances eligible to satisfy such portion of the unsatisfied surrender requirements under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section either in the source's compliance account or in another Allowance Management System account identified to the Administrator on or before such date in a submission by the authorized account representative for such account.

(v) When making deductions under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iv) of this section to address the surrender requirements under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section for a given source:


(A) The Administrator will make deductions to address any surrender requirements with regard to first the 2023 control period and then the 2024 control period.


(B) When making deductions to address the surrender requirements with regard to a given control period, the Administrator will first deduct CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for such given control period and will then deduct CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for each successively earlier control period in sequence.


(C) When deducting CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for a given control period from a given Allowance Management System account, the Administrator will first deduct CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances initially recorded in the account under § 97.821 (if the account is a compliance account) in the order of recordation and will then deduct CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances recorded in the account under § 97.526(d) or § 97.823 in the order of recordation.


(4)(i) To the extent the surrender requirements under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section corresponding to any CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for a control period after 2022 and initially recorded in a given source's compliance account have not been fully satisfied through the deductions under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, as soon as practicable on or after November 15, 2023, the Administrator will deduct such initially recorded CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances from any Allowance Management System accounts in which such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances are held, making such deductions in any order determined by the Administrator, until all such surrender requirements for such source have been satisfied or until all such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances have been deducted, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.


(ii) If no person with an ownership interest in a given CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowance as of April 30, 2022, was an owner or operator of the source in whose compliance account such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowance was initially recorded, was a direct or indirect parent or subsidiary of an owner or operator of such source, or was directly or indirectly under common ownership with an owner or operator of such source, the Administrator will not deduct such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowance under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii), each owner or operator of a source shall be deemed to be a person with an ownership interest in any CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowance held in that source's compliance account. The limitation established by this paragraph (e)(4)(ii) on the deductibility of certain CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section shall not be construed as a waiver of the surrender requirements under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section corresponding to such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances.


(iii) Not less than 45 days before the planned date for any deductions under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, the Administrator will send a notification to the authorized account representative for the Allowance Management System account from which such deductions will be made identifying the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances to be deducted and the data upon which the Administrator has relied and specifying a process for submission of any objections to such data.

(i) The persons identified in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section with regard to such source and each such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowance shall pay any fine, penalty, or assessment or comply with any other remedy imposed under the Clean Air Act; and


(ii) Each such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowance, and each day in such control period, shall constitute a separate violation of this subpart and the Clean Air Act.

(7)(i) Each submission, objection, or other written communication from a designated representative, authorized account representative, or other person to the Administrator under paragraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section shall be sent electronically to the email address *CSAPR@epa.gov*.
