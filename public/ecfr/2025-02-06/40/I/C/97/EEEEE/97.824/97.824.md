(c) *Selection of CSAPR NO*_X_*Ozone Season Group 2 allowances for deduction*—(1) *Identification by serial number.* The designated representative for a source may request that specific CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowances, identified by serial number, in the source's compliance account be deducted for emissions or excess emissions for a control period in a given year in accordance with paragraph (b) or (d) of this section. In order to be complete, such request shall be submitted to the Administrator by the allowance transfer deadline for such control period and include, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, the identification of the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 source and the appropriate serial numbers.

(d) *Deductions for excess emissions.* After making the deductions for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section for a control period in a year in which the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 source has excess emissions, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance account an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowances, allocated or auctioned for a control period in a prior year or the control period in the year of the excess emissions or in the immediately following year, equal to two times the number of tons of the source's excess emissions, provided that—
