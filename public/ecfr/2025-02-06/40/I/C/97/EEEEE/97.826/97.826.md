# § 97.826   Banking and conversion.

(a) A CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowance may be banked for future use or transfer in a compliance account or a general account in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) Any CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowance that is held in a compliance account or a general account will remain in such account unless and until the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowance is deducted or transferred under § 97.811(c), (d), or (e), § 97.823, § 97.824, § 97.825, § 97.827, or § 97.828, or paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section.












(c) At any time after the allowance transfer deadline for the last control period for which a State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 trading budget is established under § 97.810(a) for a given State and after completion of the procedures under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the Administrator may record a transfer of any CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowances held in the compliance account for a source in such State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) to a general account identified or established by the Administrator with the source's designated representative as the authorized account representative and with the owners and operators of the source (as indicated on the certificate of representation for the source) as the persons represented by the authorized account representative. The Administrator will notify the designated representative not less than 15 days before making such a transfer.




(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, part 52 of this chapter, or any SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(8) or (9) of this chapter:


(1) By August 13, 2021, the Administrator will temporarily suspend acceptance of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowance transfers submitted under § 97.822 and, before resuming acceptance of such transfers, will take the following actions:


(i) The Administrator will determine each of the following values:


(A) The total amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for the control periods in 2017 through 2020 attributable to the States listed in  § 52.38(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such States), computed as the sum of the State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 trading budgets under § 97.810(a) for such States for all such control periods plus the product of 1.5 multiplied by the sum of the variability limits under § 97.810(b) for such States for the control period in 2017.


(B) The total tons of NO_X_ emissions reported in accordance with §§ 97.806(b) and 97.830 through 97.835 for all CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 units at CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 sources in the States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such States) for the control periods in 2017 through 2020.






(C) The full-season CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance bank target, computed as the sum for all States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(A) of this chapter of the variability limits under § 97.1010(e) for such States for the control period in 2022.












(D) A conversion factor, computed as the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of the remainder of the total amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section minus the total tons of NO_X_ emissions determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section divided by the full-season CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section.


(E) The adjusted CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance bank target, computed as the product, rounded to the nearest allowance, of the full-season CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number of days from June 29, 2021 through September 30, 2021, inclusive, and whose denominator is 153.


(ii) The Administrator will allocate CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 to sources in States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(A) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such States) as follows:


(A) The Administrator will determine for each such source the source's maximum share, computed as the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of the amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 held in the source's compliance account divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.


(B) The Administrator will determine a source allocation scaling factor, computed as the lesser of 1.0000 or the quotient, expressed to four decimal places, of the adjusted CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(E) of this section divided by the sum for all such sources of the maximum shares under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.


(C) The Administrator will allocate to each such source an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances computed as the product, rounded to the nearest allowance, of such source's maximum share under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section multiplied by the source allocation scaling factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.


(iii) If the sum for all sources of the allocations under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section is less than the adjusted CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(E) of this section, the Administrator will allocate CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 to general accounts as follows:


(A) The Administrator will determine for each general account the account's maximum share, computed as the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of the amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 held in the account divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.


(B) The Administrator will determine a general account allocation scaling factor, computed as the lesser of 1.0000 or the quotient, expressed to four decimal places, of the remainder of the adjusted CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(E) of this section minus the sum for all sources of the allocations under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section divided by the sum for all general accounts of the maximum shares under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.


(C) The Administrator will allocate to each general account an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances computed as the product, rounded to the nearest allowance, of such account's maximum share under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section multiplied by the general account allocation scaling factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.


(iv) For the compliance account of each source, and for each general account, to which an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances greater than zero is allocated under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) or (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section, respectively:


(A) The Administrator will determine the amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances required to be deducted from the account, computed as the product of the amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances allocated to the source or general account under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) or (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section multiplied by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section. The Administrator will deduct CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 from the account on a first-in, first-out basis in the order set forth in § 97.824(c)(2)(i) and (ii).


(B) The Administrator will record in the account the allocations of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) or (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section and the deductions of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances under paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.






(2)(i) During the period beginning February 1, 2022 and ending February 28, 2022, the designated representative for a source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(A) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State) may request that the Administrator allocate additional CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 to the source pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. Any such request shall be submitted to the Administrator electronically at the email address *CSAPR@epa.gov.*

(ii) For each source covered by a request under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, as soon as practicable on or after March 1, 2022, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance account, on a first-in, first-out basis in the order set forth in § 97.824(c)(2)(i) and (ii), the maximum number of sets of 18 CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 available in the compliance account. The Administrator will then allocate to the source one CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance for the control period in 2021 for each set of 18 CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances deducted. The Administrator will record the allocations and deductions under this paragraph in the source's compliance account.


(3) [Reserved]


(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, part 52 of this chapter, or any SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(8) or (9) of this chapter:


(1) By September 18, 2023, the Administrator will temporarily suspend acceptance of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 allowance transfers submitted under § 97.822 and, before resuming acceptance of such transfers, will take the following actions with regard to every general account and every compliance account except a compliance account for a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(ii)(A) or (b)(2)(iii)(D)(*1*) through (*3*) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State):








(i) The Administrator will deduct all CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances allocated for the control periods in 2017 through 2022 from each such account.


(ii) The Administrator will determine a conversion factor equal to the greater of 1.0000 or the quotient, expressed to four decimal places, of—


(A) The sum of all CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances deducted from all such accounts under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section; divided by


(B) The product of the sum of the trading budgets for the control period in 2024 under § 97.1010(a)(1)(i) for all States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this chapter and not listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(D)(*2*) or (*3*) of this chapter multiplied by 0.21 and further multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number of days from August 4, 2023 through September 30, 2023, inclusive, and whose denominator is 153.






(iii) The Administrator will allocate and record in each such account an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2023 computed as the quotient, rounded up to the nearest allowance, of the number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances deducted from such account under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) or (v) of this section.


(iv) Where, pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator deducts CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances from the compliance account for a source in a State not listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State), the Administrator will not record CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances in that compliance account but instead will allocate and record the amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2023 computed for such source in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section in a general account identified by the designated representative for such source, provided that if the designated representative fails to identify such a general account in a submission to the Administrator by September 18, 2023, the Administrator may record such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances in a general account identified or established by the Administrator with the designated representative as the authorized account representative and with the owners and operators of such source (as indicated on the certificate of representation for the source) as the persons represented by the authorized account representative.


(v)(A) In computing any amounts of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to be allocated to and recorded in general accounts under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, the Administrator may group multiple general accounts whose ownership interests are held by the same or related persons or entities and treat the group of accounts as a single account for purposes of such computation.


(B) Following a computation for a group of general accounts in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the Administrator will allocate to and record in each individual account in such group a proportional share of the quantity of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances computed for such group, basing such shares on the respective quantities of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances removed from such individual accounts under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.


(C) In determining the proportional shares under paragraph (e)(1)(v)(B) of this section, the Administrator may employ any reasonable adjustment methodology to truncate or round each such share up or down to a whole number and to cause the total of such whole numbers to equal the amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances computed for such group of accounts in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(v)(A) of this section, even where such adjustments cause the numbers of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances allocated to some individual accounts to equal zero.


(2) [Reserved]

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart or any SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(8) or (9) of this chapter, CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Expanded Group 2 allowances or CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances may be used to satisfy requirements to hold CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances under this subpart and CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances may be used to satisfy requirements to hold CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Expanded Group 2 allowances under this subpart as follows, provided that nothing in this paragraph (f) alters the time as of which any such allowance holding requirement must be met or limits any consequence of a failure to timely meet any such allowance holding requirement:


(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, after the Administrator has carried out the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and before November 6, 2024, the owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State) may satisfy a requirement to hold a given number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances for a control period in 2017 through 2020 by holding instead, in a general account established for this sole purpose, an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 (or any later control period for which the allowance transfer deadline defined in § 97.1002 has passed) computed as the quotient, rounded up to the nearest allowance, of such given number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.


(ii) After the Administrator has carried out the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and § 97.1026(e)(1) and before November 6, 2024, the owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(D)(*1*) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State) may satisfy a requirement to hold a given number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances for a control period in 2017 through 2020 by holding instead, in a general account established for this sole purpose, an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Expanded Group 2 allowances for the control period in 2023 (or any later control period for which the allowance transfer deadline defined in § 97.802 has passed) computed as the quotient, rounded up to the nearest allowance, of such given number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.


(2) After the Administrator has carried out the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and before November 6, 2024, the owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(ii)(C) of this chapter and not listed in § 52.38(b)(iii)(D)(*2*) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such a State) may satisfy a requirement to hold a given number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances for a control period in 2017 through 2022 by holding instead, in a general account established for this sole purpose, an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2023 (or any later control period for which the allowance transfer deadline defined in § 97.1002 has passed) computed as the quotient, rounded up to the nearest allowance, of such given number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.


(3) On or after November 6, 2024, the owner or operator of a source subject to the requirements of the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 2 Trading Program for the control period in the current year and required to demonstrate compliance under such program for such control period by holding CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Expanded Group 2 allowances may satisfy a requirement to hold a given number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Original Group 2 allowances for the control period in a previous year for which the allowance transfer deadline defined in § 97.802 has passed by holding instead in the source's compliance account an equal number of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Expanded Group 2 allowances for the control period in the current year.
