(2) The emissions data determined in accordance with §§ 97.930 through 97.935 shall be used to calculate allocations of Texas SO_2_ Trading Program allowances under § 97.912 and to determine compliance with the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program emissions limitation and assurance provisions under paragraph (c) of this section, provided that, for each monitoring location from which mass emissions are reported, the mass emissions amount used in calculating such allocations and determining such compliance shall be the mass emissions amount for the monitoring location determined in accordance with §§ 97.930 through 97.935 and rounded to the nearest ton, with any fraction of a ton less than 0.50 being deemed to be zero and any fraction of a ton greater than or equal to 0.50 being deemed to be a whole ton.


(c) *SO*_2_* emissions requirements*—(1) *Texas SO*_2_* Trading Program emissions limitation.* (i) As of the allowance transfer deadline for a control period in a given year, the owners and operators of each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program source and each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program unit at the source shall hold, in the source's compliance account, Texas SO_2_ Trading Program allowances available for deduction for such control period under § 97.924(a) in an amount not less than the tons of total SO_2_ emissions for such control period from all Texas SO_2_ Trading Program units at the source.


(ii) If total SO_2_ emissions during a control period in a given year from the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program units at a Texas SO_2_ Trading Program source are in excess of the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program emissions limitation set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, then:

(iii) Total SO_2_ emissions from all Texas SO_2_ Trading Program units at Texas SO_2_ Trading Program sources during a control period in a given year exceed the State assurance level if such total SO_2_ emissions exceed the sum, for such control period, of the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program budget under § 97.910(a)(1) and the variability limit under § 97.910(b).


(iv) It shall not be a violation of this subpart or of the Clean Air Act if total SO_2_ emissions from all Texas SO_2_ Trading Program units at Texas SO_2_ Trading Program sources during a control period exceed the State assurance level or if a common designated representative's share of total SO_2_ emissions from the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program units at Texas SO_2_ Trading Program sources during a control period exceeds the common designated representative's assurance level.
