# § 97.912   Texas SO

(a) For the control periods in 2019 and 2020, the Administrator will allocate Texas SO_2_ Trading Program allowances from the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program Supplemental Allowance Pool as follows:


(1) No later than February 15, 2020 and February 15, 2021, the Administrator will review all the quarterly SO_2_ emissions reports provided under § 97.934(d) for each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program unit for the previous control period. The Administrator will identify each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program source for which the total amount of emissions reported for the units at the source for that control period exceeds the total amount of allowances allocated to the units at the source for that control period under § 97.911 and recorded under § 97.921.


(2) For each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program source identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Administrator will calculate the amount by which the total amount of reported emissions for that control period exceeds the total amount of allowances allocated for that control period under § 97.911 and recorded under § 97.921.


(3)(i) For Coleto Creek (ORIS 6178), if the source is identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Administrator will allocate and record in the source's compliance account an amount of allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool equal to the lesser of the amount calculated for the source under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the total number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section.


(ii) For any Texas SO_2_ Trading Program sources identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section other than Coleto Creek (ORIS 6178), the Administrator will allocate and record allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool as follows:


(A) If the total for all such sources of the amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is less than or equal to the total number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section that remain after any allocation under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate and record in the compliance account for each such source an amount of allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool equal to the amount calculated for the source under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(B) If the total for all such sources of the amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is greater than the total number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section that remain after any allocation under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, then the Administrator will calculate each such source's allocation of allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool by dividing the amount calculated under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the source by the sum of the amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for all such sources, then multiplying by the number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section that remain after any allocation under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and rounding to the nearest allowance. The Administrator will adjust the sources' allocations up or down by one allowance, starting with the largest allocation and continuing in descending order, as necessary to cause the sum of the sources' allocations to equal the total number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section that remain after any allocation under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. The Administrator will then record the calculated allocations of allowances in the applicable compliance accounts.


(iii) Any unallocated allowances remaining in the Supplemental Allowance Pool after the allocations determined under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section will be maintained in the Supplemental Allowance Pool. These allowances will be available for allocation by the Administrator in subsequent control periods to the extent consistent with paragraph (d) of this section.


(b) For each control period in 2021 and thereafter, the Administrator will allocate Texas SO_2_ Trading Program allowances from the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program Supplemental Allowance Pool as follows:


(1) For each control period, the Administrator will assign each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program unit to an affiliated ownership group reflecting the unit's ownership as of December 31 of the control period. The affiliated ownership group assignments for each control period will be as shown in § 97.911(a)(1) except that the Administrator will revise the assignments, based on the information required to be submitted in accordance with § 97.915(c) and any other information available to the Administrator, as necessary to reflect any ownership transfer resulting in a 50% or greater ownership share of a unit being held by a new owner that the Administrator determines is not affiliated with the previous holder of a 50% or greater ownership share of the unit.


(2) No later than May 1, 2022 and May 1 of each year thereafter, the Administrator will review all the quarterly SO_2_ emissions reports provided under § 97.934(d) for each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program unit for the previous control period. The Administrator will identify each affiliated ownership group of Texas SO_2_ Trading Program units as of December 31 of such control period for which the total amount of emissions reported for the units in the group for that control period exceeds the total amount of allowances allocated to the units in the group for that control period under § 97.911 and recorded under § 97.921.


(3) For each affiliated ownership group of Texas SO_2_ Trading Program units identified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Administrator will calculate the amount by which the total amount of reported emissions for that control period exceeds the total amount of allowances allocated for that control period under § 97.911 and recorded under § 97.921.


(4)(i) The Administrator will allocate and record allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool as follows:


(A) If the total for all such affiliated ownership groups of the amounts calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is less than or equal to the total number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section, then each such group's allocation of allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool shall equal to the amount calculated for the group under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(B) If the total for all such affiliated ownership groups of the amounts calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is greater than the total number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section, then the Administrator will calculate each such group's allocation of allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool by dividing the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the group by the sum of the amounts calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for all such groups, then multiplying by the number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section and rounding to the nearest allowance. The Administrator will adjust the groups' allocations up or down by one allowance, starting with the largest allocation and continuing in descending order, as necessary to cause the sum of the groups' allocations to equal the total number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation under paragraph (d) of this section.


(C) When an affiliated ownership group receives an allocation of allowances under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, each source in the group whose emissions during the control period for which allowances are being allocated exceed the amount of allowances allocated to the source under § 97.911 and recorded under § 97.921 will receive a share of the group's allocation. The Administrator will compute each such source's share by dividing the amount of the source's emissions during the control period exceeding the source's allocation under § 97.911 by the sum for all such sources of the amounts of the sources' emissions during the control period exceeding the sources' allocations under § 97.911, then multiplying by the group's allocation under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section and rounding to the nearest allowance. The Administrator will adjust the sources' allocations up or down by one allowance, starting with the largest allocation and continuing in descending order, as necessary to cause the sum of the sources' allocations to equal the group's allocation. The Administrator will then record the calculated allocations of allowances in the applicable sources' compliance accounts.


(ii) Any unallocated allowances remaining in the Supplemental Allowance Pool after the allocations determined under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section will be maintained in the Supplemental Allowance Pool. These allowances will be available for allocation by the Administrator in subsequent control periods to the extent consistent with paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) The Administrator will notify the designated representative of each Texas SO_2_ Trading Program source when the allowances from the Supplemental Allowance Pool have been recorded.


(d) The total amount of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool available for allocation for a control period is equal to the sum of the Supplemental Allowance Pool budget under § 97.910(a)(2), any allowances from retired units pursuant to § 97.911(a)(2) and from corrections pursuant to § 97.911(c)(5), and any allowances maintained in the Supplemental Allowance Pool pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) or (b)(4)(ii) of this section, provided that if the number of allowances in the Supplemental Allowance Pool exceeds the applicable limit for the control period under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, then the Administrator may only allocate allowances up to such applicable limit.


(1) For the control periods in 2019 and 2020, the total amount of allowances allocated from the Supplemental Allowance Pool for a control period may not exceed by more than 44,711 tons the sum of the Supplemental Allowance Pool budget under § 97.910(a)(2) and any portion of the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program budget under § 97.910(a)(1) not otherwise allocated for that control period under § 97.911(a)(1).


(2) For each control period in 2021 and thereafter, the total amount of allowances allocated from the Supplemental Allowance Pool for a control period may not exceed the sum of the variability limit under § 97.910(b) and any portion of the Texas SO_2_ Trading Program budget under § 97.910(a)(1) not otherwise allocated for that control period under § 97.911(a)(1).
