(a) *State NO*_X_*Ozone Season Group 3 trading budgets.* (1)(i) The State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budgets for allocations of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control periods in 2021 through 2025 shall be as indicated in table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1)(i), subject to prorating for the control period in 2023 as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section:


(ii) For the control period in 2023, the State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget for each State shall be calculated as the sum, rounded to the nearest allowance, of the following prorated amounts:


(A) The product of the non-prorated trading budget for the portion of the 2023 control period before August 4, 2023, shown for the State in table 1 to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (or zero if table 1 to paragraph (a)(1)(i) shows no amount for such portion of the 2023 control period for the State) multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number of days from May 1, 2023, through the day before August 4, 2023, inclusive, and whose denominator is 153; plus


(B) The product of the non-prorated trading budget for the portion of the 2023 control period on and after August 4, 2023, shown for the State in table 1 to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number of days from August 4, 2023, through September 30, 2023, inclusive, and whose denominator is 153.


(2)(i) The State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget for each State and each control period in 2026 through 2029 shall be the preset trading budget indicated for the State and control period in table 2 to this paragraph (a)(2)(i), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.


(ii) If the preset trading budget indicated for a given State and control period in table 2 to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is less than the dynamic trading budget for the State and control period referenced in the applicable notice promulgated under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(C) of this section, then the State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget for the State and control period shall be the dynamic trading budget for the State and control period referenced in the applicable notice promulgated under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(C) of this section.


(3) The State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget for each State and each control period in 2030 and thereafter shall be the dynamic trading budget for the State and control period referenced in the applicable notice promulgated under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(C) of this section.


(4) The Administrator will calculate the dynamic trading budget for each State and each control period in 2026 and thereafter in the year before the year of the control period as follows:


(i) The Administrator will include a unit in a State (and Indian country within the borders of the State) in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget for a control period if—


(A) To the best of the Administrator's knowledge, the unit qualifies as a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit under § 97.1004, without regard to whether the unit has permanently retired, provided that including a unit in the calculation of a dynamic trading budget does not constitute a determination that the unit is a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit, and not including a unit in the calculation of a dynamic trading budget does not constitute a determination that the unit is not a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit;


(B) The unit's deadline for certification of monitoring systems under § 97.1030(b) is on or before May 1 of the year two years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated; and


(C) The owner or operator reported heat input greater than zero for the unit in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the historical control period in the year two years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated.


(ii) For each unit identified for inclusion in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget for a control period under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the Administrator will calculate the heat input amount in mmBtu to be used in the budget calculation as follows:


(A) For each such unit, the Administrator will determine the following unit-level amounts:


(*1*) The total heat input amounts reported in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the unit for the historical control periods in the years two, three, four, five, and six years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated, except any historical control period that commenced before the unit's first deadline under any regulatory program to begin recording and reporting heat input in accordance with part 75 of this chapter; and


(*2*) The average of the three highest unit-level total heat input amounts identified for the unit under paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(A)(*1*) of this section or, if fewer than three non-zero amounts are identified for the unit, the average of all such non-zero total heat input amounts.


(B) For the State, the Administrator will determine the following state-level amounts:


(*1*) The sum for all units in the State meeting the criterion under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section, without regard to whether such units also meet the criteria under paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, of the total heat input amounts reported in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the historical control periods in the years two, three, and four years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated, provided that for the historical control periods in 2022 and 2023, the total reported heat input amounts for Nevada and Utah as otherwise determined under this paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*1*) shall be increased by 13,489,332 mmBtu for Nevada and by 1,888,174 mmBtu for Utah;


(*2*) The average of the three state-level total heat input amounts calculated for the State under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section; and

(C) The heat input amount for a unit used in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget shall be the product of the unit-level average total heat input amount calculated for the unit under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the state-level average total heat input amount calculated under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section and whose denominator is the state-level sum of the unit-level average heat input amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*3*) of this section.


(iii) For each unit identified for inclusion in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget for a control period under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the Administrator will identify the NO_X_ emissions rate in lb/mmBtu to be used in the calculation as follows:


(A) For a unit listed in the document entitled “Unit-Specific Ozone Season NO_X_ Emissions Rates for Dynamic Budget Calculations” posted at *www.regulations.gov* in docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0668, the NO_X_ emissions rate used in the calculation for the control period shall be the NO_X_ emissions rate shown for the unit and control period in that document.


(B) For a unit not listed in the document referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the NO_X_ emissions rate used in the calculation for the control period shall be identified according to the type of unit and the type of fuel combusted by the unit during the control period beginning May 1 on or immediately after the unit's deadline for certification of monitoring systems under § 97.1030(b) as follows:


(*1*) 0.011 lb/mmBtu, for a simple cycle combustion turbine or a combined cycle combustion turbine other than an integrated coal gasification combined cycle unit;


(*2*) 0.030 lb/mmBtu, for a boiler combusting only fuel oil or gaseous fuel (other than coal-derived fuel) during such control period; or
