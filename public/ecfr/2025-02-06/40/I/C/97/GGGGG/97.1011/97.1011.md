# § 97.1011   CSAPR NO

(a) *Allocations to existing units in general.* (1) For the control periods in 2021 and each year thereafter, CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances will be allocated to units in each State and areas of Indian country within the borders of the State subject to the State's SIP authority as provided in notices of data availability issued by the Administrator. Starting with the control period in 2026, the notices of data availability will be the notices issued under paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section.


(2) For the control periods in 2023 and each year thereafter, CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances will be allocated to units in areas of Indian country within the borders of each State not subject to the State's SIP authority as provided in notices of data availability issued by the Administrator. Starting with the control period in 2026, the notices of data availability will be the notices issued under paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section.


(3) Providing an allocation to a unit in a notice of data availability does not constitute a determination that the unit is a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit, and not providing an allocation to a unit in such notice does not constitute a determination that the unit is not a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit.




(b) *Calculation of default allocations to existing units for control periods in 2026 and thereafter.* For each control period in 2026 and thereafter, and for the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 units in each State and areas of Indian country within the borders of the State, the Administrator will calculate default allocations of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 units as follows:


(1) For each State and control period, the total amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for which the Administrator will calculate default allocations shall be the remainder of the State NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget for the control period under § 97.1010(a) minus the new unit set-aside for the control period under § 97.1010(c).


(2) The Administrator will calculate a default allocation of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for each CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit in the State and Indian country within the borders of the State meeting the following criteria:


(i) To the best of the Administrator's knowledge, the unit qualifies as a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit under § 97.1004, without regard to whether the unit has permanently retired;


(ii) The unit's deadline for certification of monitoring systems under § 97.1030(b) is on or before May 1 of the year two years before the year of the control period for which the allowances are being allocated; and


(iii) The owner or operator reported heat input greater than zero for the unit in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the historical control period in the year two years before the year of the control period for which the allowances are being allocated.


(3) For each CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit for which a default allocation is being calculated for a control period, the Administrator will calculate an average heat input amount to be used in the allocation calculations as follows:


(i) The Administrator will identify the total heat input amounts reported for the unit in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the historical control periods in the years two, three, four, five, and six years before the year of the control period for which the allowances are being allocated, except any historical control period that commenced before the unit's first deadline under any regulatory program to begin recording and reporting heat input in accordance with part 75 of this chapter.


(ii) The average heat input amount used in the allocation calculations shall be the average of the three highest total heat input amounts identified for the unit under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section or, if fewer than three non-zero amounts are identified for the unit, the average of all such non-zero total heat input amounts.


(4) For each CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit for which a default allocation is being calculated for a control period, the Administrator will calculate a tentative maximum allocation amount to be used in the allocation calculations as follows:


(i) The Administrator will identify the total NO_X_ emissions amounts reported for the unit in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the historical control periods in the years two, three, four, five, and six years before the year of the control period for which the allowances are being allocated.


(ii) The tentative maximum allocation amount used in the allocation calculations shall be the highest of the total NO_X_ emissions amounts identified for the unit under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section or, if less, any applicable amount calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.


(iii)(A) The tentative maximum allocation amount under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section for a unit described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section may not exceed a maximum controlled baseline calculated as the product (converted to tons at a conversion factor of 2,000 lb/ton and rounded to the nearest ton) of the highest total heat input amount identified for the unit under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in mmBtu multiplied by a NO_X_ emissions rate of 0.08 lb/mmBtu.


(B) For the control period in 2026, a maximum controlled baseline under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section shall apply to any unit that combusted any coal or solid coal-derived fuel during the historical control period for which the unit's heat input was most recently reported, that serves a generator with nameplate capacity of 100 MW or more, and that is equipped with selective catalytic reduction controls, except a circulating fluidized bed boiler.


(C) For each control period in 2027 and thereafter, a maximum controlled baseline under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section shall apply to any unit that combusted any coal or solid coal-derived fuel during the historical control period for which the unit's heat input was most recently reported and that serves a generator with nameplate capacity of 100 MW or more, except a circulating fluidized bed boiler.


(5) The Administrator will calculate the initial unrounded default allocations for each CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit according to the procedure in paragraph (b)(6) of this section and will recalculate the unrounded default allocations according to the procedures in paragraph (b)(7) or (8) of this section, as applicable, iterating the recalculations as necessary until the total of the unrounded default allocations to all eligible units equals the amount of allowances determined for the State under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(6) The Administrator will calculate the initial unrounded default allocations to CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 units as follows:


(i) The Administrator will calculate the sum, for all units determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to be eligible to receive default allocations, of the units' average heat input amounts determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.


(ii) For each unit determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to be eligible to receive a default allocation, the Administrator will calculate the unit's unrounded default allocation as the lesser of—


(A) The product of the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the unit's average heat input amount determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and whose denominator is the sum determined under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section; and


(B) The unit's tentative maximum allocation amount determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.


(iii) If the sum of the unrounded default allocations determined under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section is less than the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator will follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(7) or (8) of this section, as applicable.


(iv) If the sum of the unrounded default allocations determined under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section equals the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator will determine the rounded default allocations according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section.


(7) If the unrounded default allocation determined in the previous round of the calculation procedure for at least one CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit is less than the unit's tentative maximum allocation amount determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the Administrator will recalculate the unrounded default allocations as follows:


(i) The Administrator will calculate the additional pool of allowances to be allocated as the remainder of the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section minus the sum of the unrounded default allocations from the previous round of the calculation procedure for all units determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to be eligible to receive default allocations.


(ii) The Administrator will calculate the sum, for all units whose unrounded default allocations determined in the previous round of the calculation procedure were less than the respective units' tentative maximum allocation amounts determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, of the units' average heat input amounts determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.


(iii) For each unit whose unrounded default allocation determined in the previous round of the calculation procedure was less than the unit's tentative maximum allocation amount determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the Administrator will recalculate the unit's unrounded default allocation as the lesser of—


(A) The sum of the unit's unrounded default allocation determined in the previous round of the calculation procedure plus the product of the additional pool of allowances determined under paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the unit's average heat input amount determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and whose denominator is the sum determined under paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section; and


(B) The unit's tentative maximum allocation amount determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.


(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, a unit's unrounded default allocation shall equal the amount determined in the previous round of the calculation procedure.


(v) If the sum of the unrounded default allocations determined under paragraphs (b)(7)(iii) and (iv) of this section is less than the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator will iterate the procedures in paragraph (b)(7) of this section or follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, as applicable.


(vi) If the sum of the unrounded default allocations determined under paragraphs (b)(7)(iii) and (iv) of this section equals the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator will determine the rounded default allocations according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section.


(8) If the unrounded default allocation determined in the previous round of the calculation procedure for every CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit equals the unit's tentative maximum allocation amount determined under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the Administrator will recalculate the unrounded default allocations as follows:


(i) The Administrator will calculate the additional pool of allowances to be allocated as the remainder of the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section minus the sum of the unrounded default allocations from the previous round of the calculation procedure for all units determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to be eligible to receive default allocations.


(ii) The Administrator will recalculate the unrounded default allocation for each eligible unit as the sum of—


(A) The unit's unrounded default allocation as determined in the previous round of the calculation procedure; plus


(B) The product of the additional pool of allowances determined under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the unit's average heat input amount determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and whose denominator is the sum determined under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.


(9) The Administrator will round the default allocation for each eligible unit determined under paragraph (b)(6), (7), or (8) of this section to the nearest allowance and make any adjustments required under paragraph (b)(10) of this section.


(10) If the sum of the default allocations after rounding under paragraph (b)(9) of this section does not equal the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator will adjust the default allocations as follows. The Administrator will list the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 units in descending order based on such units' allocation amounts under paragraph (b)(9) of this section and, in cases of equal allocation amounts, in alphabetical order of the relevant sources' names and numerical order of the relevant units' identification numbers, and will adjust each unit's allocation amount upward or downward by one CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowance (but not below zero) in the order in which the units are listed, and will repeat this adjustment process as necessary, until the total of the adjusted default allocations equals the total amount of allowances determined for the State and control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(11)(i) By March 1, 2025 and March 1 of each year thereafter, the Administrator will calculate the default allocation of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to each CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit in a State and Indian country within the borders of the State, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (10) of this section and §§ 97.1006(b)(2) and 97.1030 through 97.1035, for the control period in the year after the year of the applicable calculation deadline under this paragraph (b)(11)(i) and will promulgate a notice of data availability of the results of the calculations.


(ii) For each notice of data availability required in paragraph (b)(11)(i) of this section, the Administrator will provide an opportunity for submission of objections to the calculations referenced in such notice. Objections shall be submitted by the deadline specified in such notice and shall be limited to addressing whether the calculations (including the identification of the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 units) are in accordance with the provisions referenced in paragraph (b)(11)(i) of this section.


(iii) The Administrator will adjust the calculations to the extent necessary to ensure that they are in accordance with the provisions referenced in paragraph (b)(11)(i) of this section. By May 1 immediately after the promulgation of each notice of data availability required in paragraph (b)(11)(i) of this section, the Administrator will promulgate a notice of data availability of the results of the calculations incorporating any adjustments that the Administrator determines to be necessary and the reasons for accepting or rejecting any objections submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(11)(ii) of this section.




(c) *Incorrect allocations of CSAPR NO*_X_*Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to existing units.* (1) For each control period in 2021 and thereafter, if the Administrator determines that CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances were allocated for the control period to a recipient covered by the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, then the Administrator will notify the designated representative of the recipient and will act in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section:


(i) The recipient is not actually a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit under § 97.1004 as of the first day of the control period and is allocated CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for such control period under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section;


(ii) The recipient is not actually a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit under § 97.1004 as of the first day of the control period and is allocated CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for such control period under a provision of a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(10), (11), or (12) of this chapter that the SIP revision provides should be allocated only to recipients that are CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 units as of the first day of such control period; or


(iii) The recipient is not located as of the first day of the control period in the State (and Indian country within the borders of the State) from whose NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances were allocated to the recipient for such control period under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section or under a provision of a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(10), (11), or (12) of this chapter.






(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section, the Administrator will not record such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances under § 97.1021.


(3) If the Administrator already recorded such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances under § 97.1021 and if the Administrator makes the determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section before making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.1024(b) for such control period, then the Administrator will deduct from the account in which such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances were recorded an amount of CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances allocated for the same or a prior control period equal to the amount of such already recorded CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances. The authorized account representative shall ensure that there are sufficient CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances in such account for completion of the deduction.


(4) If the Administrator already recorded such CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances under § 97.1021 and if the Administrator makes the determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section after making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.1024(b) for such control period, then the Administrator will not make any deduction to take account of such already recorded CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances.






(5) With regard to any CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances that are not recorded, or that are deducted as an incorrect allocation, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section:


(i) If the non-recordation decision under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or the deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section occurs on or before May 1, 2024, the Administrator will transfer the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to the new unit set-aside for 2021, 2022, or 2023 for the State from whose NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances were allocated.


(ii) If the non-recordation decision under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or the deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section occurs after May 1, 2024, and on or before May 1 of the year following the year of the control period for which the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances were allocated, the Administrator will transfer the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to the new unit set-aside for such control period for the State from whose NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances were allocated.


(iii) If the non-recordation decision under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or the deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section occurs after May 1, 2024, and after May 1 of the year following the year of the control period for which the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances were allocated, the Administrator will transfer the CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances to a surrender account.


(d) *Recall of CSAPR NO*_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances allocated for the control period in 2024. As soon as practicable on or after November 21, 2024, the Administrator will deduct from every general account and compliance account all CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 allowances allocated for the control period in 2024 and will record the deductions in each such account.
