# § 97.1030   General monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.

The owners and operators, and to the extent applicable, the designated representative, of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit, shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as provided in this subpart and subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. For purposes of applying such requirements, the definitions in § 97.1002 and in § 72.2 of this chapter shall apply, the terms “affected unit,” “designated representative,” and “continuous emission monitoring system” (or “CEMS”) in part 75 of this chapter shall be deemed to refer to the terms “CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit,” “designated representative,” and “continuous emission monitoring system” (or “CEMS”) respectively as defined in § 97.1002, and the term “newly affected unit” shall be deemed to mean “newly affected CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit”. The owner or operator of a unit that is not a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit but that is monitored under § 75.72(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter shall comply with the same monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit.


(a) *Requirements for installation, certification, and data accounting.* The owner or operator of each CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit shall:


(1) Install all monitoring systems required under this subpart for monitoring NO_X_ mass emissions and individual unit heat input (including all systems required to monitor NO_X_ emission rate, NO_X_ concentration, stack gas moisture content, stack gas flow rate, CO_2_ or O_2_ concentration, and fuel flow rate, as applicable, in accordance with §§ 75.71 and 75.72 of this chapter);


(2) Successfully complete all certification tests required under § 97.1031 and meet all other requirements of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter applicable to the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and


(3) Record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) *Compliance deadlines.* Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit shall meet the monitoring system certification and other requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section on or before the latest of the following dates and shall record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on and after the latest of the following dates:


(1)(i) May 1, 2021, for a unit in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(A) of this chapter;


(ii) May 1, 2023, for a unit in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(B) of this chapter;


(iii) August 4, 2023, for a unit in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(C) of this chapter, where the unit is required to report NO_X_ mass emissions data or NO_X_ emissions rate data according to 40 CFR part 75 to address other regulatory requirements; or


(iv) January 31, 2024, for a unit in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iii)(C) of this chapter, where the unit is not required to report NO_X_ mass emissions data or NO_X_ emissions rate data according to 40 CFR part 75 to address other regulatory requirements.




(2) 180 calendar days after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation; or


(3) Where data for the unit are reported on a control period basis under § 97.1034(d)(1)(ii)(B), and where the compliance date under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section is not in a month from May through September, May 1 immediately after the compliance date under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.


(4) The owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit for which construction of a new stack or flue or installation of add-on NO_X_ emission controls is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section shall meet the requirements of § 75.4(e)(1) through (4) of this chapter, except that:


(i) Such requirements shall apply to the monitoring systems required under § 97.1030 through § 97.1035, rather than the monitoring systems required under part 75 of this chapter;


(ii) NO_X_ emission rate, NO_X_ concentration, stack gas moisture content, stack gas volumetric flow rate, and O_2_ or CO_2_ concentration data shall be determined and reported, rather than the data listed in § 75.4(e)(2) of this chapter; and


(iii) Any petition for another procedure under § 75.4(e)(2) of this chapter shall be submitted under § 97.1035, rather than § 75.66 of this chapter.


(c) *Reporting data.* The owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit that does not meet the applicable compliance date set forth in paragraph (b) of this section for any monitoring system under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall, for each such monitoring system, determine, record, and report maximum potential (or, as appropriate, minimum potential) values for NO_X_ concentration, NO_X_ emission rate, stack gas flow rate, stack gas moisture content, fuel flow rate, and any other parameters required to determine NO_X_ mass emissions and heat input in accordance with § 75.31(b)(2) or (c)(3) of this chapter, section 2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, or section 2.5 of appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable.


(d) *Prohibitions.* (1) No owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit shall use any alternative monitoring system, alternative reference method, or any other alternative to any requirement of this subpart without having obtained prior written approval in accordance with § 97.1035.


(2) No owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit shall operate the unit so as to discharge, or allow to be discharged, NO_X_ to the atmosphere without accounting for all such NO_X_ in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter.


(3) No owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit shall disrupt the continuous emission monitoring system, any portion thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring method, and thereby avoid monitoring and recording NO_X_ mass discharged into the atmosphere or heat input, except for periods of recertification or periods when calibration, quality assurance testing, or maintenance is performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter.




(4) No owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit shall retire or permanently discontinue use of the continuous emission monitoring system, any component thereof, or any other approved monitoring system under this subpart, except under any one of the following circumstances:


(i) During the period that the unit is covered by an exemption under § 97.1005 that is in effect;


(ii) The owner or operator is monitoring emissions from the unit with another certified monitoring system approved, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter, by the Administrator for use at that unit that provides emission data for the same pollutant or parameter as the retired or discontinued monitoring system; or


(iii) The designated representative submits notification of the date of certification testing of a replacement monitoring system for the retired or discontinued monitoring system in accordance with § 97.1031(d)(3)(i).


(e) *Long-term cold storage.* The owner or operator of a CSAPR NO_X_ Ozone Season Group 3 unit is subject to the applicable provisions of § 75.4(d) of this chapter concerning units in long-term cold storage.
