(ii) May 1, 2003, if the compliance date under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is before May 1, 2003.


(4) For the owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit under § 97.4(a) that commences operation on or after January 1, 2003 and that reports on a control period basis under § 97.74(d)(2)(ii), by the following dates:


(i) The earlier of 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation, if this compliance date is during a control period; or


(ii) May 1 immediately following the compliance date under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, if such compliance date is not during a control period.


(5) For the owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit that has a new stack or flue or add-on NO_X_ emission controls for which construction is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or under subpart I of this part and that reports on an annual basis under § 97.74(d), by the earlier of 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days after the date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue or add-on NO_X_ emission controls.


(6) For the owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit that has a new stack or flue or add-on NO_X_ emission controls for which construction is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or under subpart I of this part and that reports on a control period basis under § 97.74(d)(2)(ii), by the following dates:


(i) The earlier of 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days after the date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue or add-on NO_X_ emission controls, if this compliance date is during a control period; or


(ii) May 1 immediately following the compliance date under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, if such compliance date is not during a control period.

(c) *Commencement of data reporting.* (1) The owner or operator of NO_X_ Budget units under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall determine, record and report NO_X_ mass emissions, heat input rate, and any other values required to determine NO_X_ mass emissions (*e.g.,* NO_X_ emission rate and heat input rate, or NO_X_ concentration and stack flow rate) in accordance with § 75.70(g) of this chapter, beginning on the first hour of the applicable compliance deadline in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.


(2) The owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit under paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section shall determine, record and report NO_X_ mass emissions, heat input rate, and any other values required to determine NO_X_ mass emissions (*e.g.,* NO_X_ emission rate and heat input rate, or NO_X_ concentration and stack flow rate) and electric and thermal output in accordance with § 75.70(g) of this chapter, beginning on:


(i) The date and hour on which the unit commences operation, if the date and hour on which the unit commences operation is during a control period; or

(2) No owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit shall operate the unit so as to discharge, or allow to be discharged, NO_X_ emissions to the atmosphere without accounting for all such emissions in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter, except as provided in § 75.74 of this chapter. 


(3) No owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit shall disrupt the continuous emission monitoring system, any portion thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring method, and thereby avoid monitoring and recording NO_X_ mass emissions discharged into the atmosphere, except for periods of recertification or periods when calibration, quality assurance testing, or maintenance is performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter or except as provided in § 75.74 of this chapter. 


(4) No owner or operator of a NO_X_ Budget unit shall retire or permanently discontinue use of the continuous emission monitoring system, any component thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring system under this subpart, except under any one of the following circumstances:

(ii) The owner or operator is monitoring emissions from the unit with another certified monitoring system approved, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter, by the permitting authority for use at that unit that provides emission data for the same pollutant or parameter as the retired or discontinued monitoring system; or 


(iii) The NO_X_ authorized account representative submits notification of the date of certification testing of a replacement monitoring system for the retired or discontinued monitoring system in accordance with § 97.71(b)(2).
