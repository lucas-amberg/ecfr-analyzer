The submission shall be made no later than 90 days prior to the requested effective date of withdrawal. 


(b) *Conditions for withdrawal.* Before a NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may withdraw from the NO_X_ Budget Trading Program and the NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit may be terminated under paragraph (e) of this section, the following conditions must be met: 


(1) For the control period immediately before the withdrawal is to be effective, the NO_X_ authorized account representative must submit or must have submitted to the Administrator and the permitting authority an annual compliance certification report in accordance with § 97.30. 


(2) If the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit has excess emissions for the control period immediately before the withdrawal is to be effective, the Administrator will deduct or has deducted from the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft account of the NO_X_ Budget source where the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit is located, the full amount required under § 97.54(d) for the control period. 


(3) After the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are met, the Administrator will deduct from the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft account of the NO_X_ Budget source where the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit is located, NO_X_ allowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any NO_X_ allowances allocated to that source under § 97.88 for any control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. The Administrator will close the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit's compliance account and transfer any remaining allowances to a general account specified by the owners and operators of the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit. 


(c) A NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit that withdraws from the NO_X_ Budget Trading Program shall comply with all requirements under the NO_X_ Budget Trading Program concerning all years for which such NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit was a NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit, even if such requirements arise or must be complied with after the withdrawal takes effect.

(2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are not met, the Administrator will issue a notification to the permitting authority and the NO_X_ authorized account representative of the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit that the request to withdraw is denied. If the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit's request to withdraw is denied, the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit shall remain subject to the requirements for a NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit. 


(e) *Permit revision.* After the Administrator issues a notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section that the requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will revise the NO_X_ Budget permit covering the NO_X_ Budget opt-in unit to terminate the NO_X_ Budget opt-in permit as of the effective date specified under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
