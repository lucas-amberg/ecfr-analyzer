# § 97.284   Opt-in process.

The permitting authority will issue or deny a CAIR opt-in permit for a unit for which an initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under § 97.183 is submitted in accordance with the following, to the extent provided in a State implementation plan revision submitted in accordance with § 51.124(r)(1), (2), or (3) of this chapter and approved by the Administrator:


(a) *Interim review of monitoring plan.* The permitting authority and the Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under § 97.283. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information demonstrating that the SO_2_ emissions rate and heat input of the unit and all other applicable parameters are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart HHH of this part. A determination of sufficiency shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the monitoring plan.


(b) *Monitoring and reporting.* (1)(i) If the permitting authority and the Administrator determine that the monitoring plan is sufficient under paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and report the SO_2_ emissions rate and the heat input of the unit and all other applicable parameters, in accordance with subpart HHH of this part, starting on the date of certification of the appropriate monitoring systems under subpart HHH of this part and continuing until a CAIR opt-in permit is denied under § 97.284(f) or, if a CAIR opt-in permit is issued, the date and time when the unit is withdrawn from the CAIR SO_2_ Trading Program in accordance with § 97.286.


(ii) The monitoring and reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall include the entire control period immediately before the date on which the unit enters the CAIR SO_2_ Trading Program under § 97.284(g), during which period monitoring system availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HHH of this part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.


(2) To the extent the SO_2_ emissions rate and the heat input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart HHH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90 percent under subpart HHH of this part and the unit is in full compliance with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3 years before the unit enters the CAIR SO_2_ Trading Program under § 97.284(g), such information shall be used as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.


(c) *Baseline heat input.* The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:


(1) If the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate and heat input are monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control period; or


(2) If the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate and heat input are monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the average of the amounts of the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control periods under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section.


(d) *Baseline SO*_2_*emission rate.* The unit's baseline SO_2_ emission rate shall equal:


(1) If the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate and heat input are monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;


(2) If the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate and heat input are monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit does not have add-on SO_2_ emission controls during any such control periods, the average of the amounts of the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control periods under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section; or


(3) If the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate and heat input are monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on SO_2_ emission controls during any such control periods, the average of the amounts of the unit's SO_2_ emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on SO_2_ emission controls.


(e) *Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit.* After calculating the baseline heat input and the baseline SO_2_ emissions rate for the unit under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit in § 97.280 and meets the elements certified in § 97.283(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. The permitting authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit to the Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for the source that includes the CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit unless the source already has a compliance account.


(f) *Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit.* Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show that the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit in § 97.280 or meets the elements certified in § 97.283(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit.


(g) *Date of entry into CAIR SO*_2_*Trading Program.* A unit for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is issued by the permitting authority shall become a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit, and a CAIR SO_2_ unit, as of the later of January 1, 2010 or January 1 of the first control period during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.


(h) *Repowered CAIR SO*_2_*opt-in unit.* (1) If CAIR designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit providing for, allocation to a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit of CAIR SO_2_ allowances under § 97.288(c) and such unit is repowered after its date of entry into the CAIR SO_2_ Trading Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the repowered unit shall be treated as a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit replacing the original CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit, as of the date of start-up of the repowered unit's combustion chamber.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat input, and baseline SO_2_ emission rate as the original CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit, and the original CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit shall no longer be treated as a CAIR SO_2_ opt-in unit or a CAIR SO_2_ unit.
