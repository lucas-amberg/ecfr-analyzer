# § 98.481   Reporting threshold.

(a) You must report under this subpart if your CO_2_-EOR project uses CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:19 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) as a method of quantifying geologic sequestration of CO_2_ in association with CO_2_-EOR operations. There is no threshold for reporting.


(b) The requirements of § 98.2(i) do not apply to this subpart. Once a CO_2_-EOR project becomes subject to the requirements of this subpart, you must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all requirements of this subpart, including the requirement to submit annual reports until the facility has met the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section and submitted a notification to discontinue reporting according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(1) Discontinuation of reporting under this subpart must follow the requirements set forth under Clause 10 of CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:19 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7).


(2) CO_2_-EOR project termination is completed when all of the following occur:


(i) Cessation of CO_2_ injection.


(ii) Cessation of hydrocarbon production from the project reservoir; and


(iii) Wells are plugged and abandoned unless otherwise required by the appropriate regulatory authority.


(3) You must notify the Administrator of your intent to cease reporting and provide a copy of the CO_2_-EOR project termination documentation.


(c) If you previously met the source category definition for subpart UU of this part for your CO_2_-EOR project and then began using CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:19 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7) as a method of quantifying geologic sequestration of CO_2_ in association with CO_2_-EOR operations during a reporting year, you must report under subpart UU of this part for the portion of the year before you began using CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:19 and report under subpart VV for the portion of the year after you began using CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:19.
