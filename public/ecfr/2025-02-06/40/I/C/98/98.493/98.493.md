# ยง 98.493   Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) Calculate GHG emissions required to be reported in ยง 98.492(a) using the applicable methods in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) For each coke calcining unit, calculate GHG emissions according to the applicable provisions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) If you operate and maintain a CEMS that measures CO_2_ emissions according to subpart C of this part, you must calculate and report CO_2_ emissions under this subpart by following the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part. Auxiliary fuel use CO_2_ emissions should be calculated in accordance with subpart C of this part and subtracted from the CO_2_ CEMS emissions to determine process CO_2_ emissions. Other coke calcining units must either install a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part or follow the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(2) Calculate the CO_2_ emissions from the coke calcining unit using monthly measurements and equation 1 to this paragraph (b)(2).


(3) Calculate CH4 emissions using equation 2 to this paragraph (b)(3).


(4) Calculate N_2_O emissions using equation 3 to this paragraph (b)(4).
