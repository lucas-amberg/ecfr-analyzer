# § 98.495   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required (*e.g.,* concentrations, flow rates, fuel heating values, carbon content values). Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (*e.g.,* if a CEMS malfunctions during unit operation or if a required sample is not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used in the calculations.


(a) For missing auxiliary fuel use data, use the missing data procedures in subpart C of this part.


(b) For each missing value of mass or carbon content of coke, substitute the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data incident. If the “after” value is not obtained by the end of the reporting year, you may use the “before” value for the missing data substitution. If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value must be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data period.


(c) For missing CEMS data, you must use the missing data procedures in § 98.35.
