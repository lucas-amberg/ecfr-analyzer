# ยง 98.505   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations in ยง 98.503 is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used in the calculations as specified in the paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such estimates.


(a) If you determine CO_2_ emissions for the calcium carbide process unit at your facility using the carbon mass balance procedure in ยง 98.503(b), 100 percent data availability is required for the carbon content of the input and output materials. You must repeat the test for average carbon contents of inputs according to the procedures in ยง 98.504(b) if data are missing.


(b) For missing records of the monthly mass of carbon-containing inputs and outputs, the substitute data value must be based on the best available estimate of the mass of the inputs and outputs from all available process data or data used for accounting purposes, such as purchase records.
