# ยง 98.515   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used in the calculations as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(a) For each missing value of caprolactam, glyoxal, or glyoxylic acid production, the substitute data must be the best available estimate based on all available process data or data used for accounting purposes (such as sales records).


(b) For missing values related to the N_2_O abatement device, assuming that the operation is generally constant from year to year, the substitute data value should be the most recent quality-assured value.
