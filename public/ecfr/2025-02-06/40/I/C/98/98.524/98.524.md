(a) You must measure annual amounts of carbonate-based raw materials charged to each ceramics process unit from monthly measurements using plant instruments used for accounting purposes, such as calibrated scales or weigh hoppers. Total annual mass charged to ceramics process units at the facility must be compared to records of raw material purchases for the year.


(b) You must use the default value of 1.0 for the mass fraction of a carbonate-based mineral, or you may opt to obtain the mass fraction of any carbonate-based materials from the supplier of the raw material or by sampling the raw material. If you opt to obtain the mass fractions of any carbonate-based minerals from the supplier of the raw material or by sampling the raw material, you must measure the carbonate-based mineral mass fractions at least annually to verify the mass fraction data. You may conduct the sampling and chemical analysis using any x-ray fluorescence test, x-ray diffraction test, or other enhanced testing method published by an industry consensus standards organization (*e.g.,* ASTM, ASME, API). If it is determined that the mass fraction of a carbonate based raw material is below the detection limit of available industry testing standards, you may use a default value of 0.005.


(c) You must use the default value of 1.0 for the mass fraction of a carbonate-based mineral, or you may opt to obtain the mass fraction of any carbonate-based materials from the supplier of the raw material or by sampling the raw material. If you obtain the mass fractions of any carbonate-based minerals from the supplier of the raw material or by sampling the raw material, you must determine the annual average mass fraction for the carbonate-based mineral in each carbonate-based raw material at least annually by calculating an arithmetic average of the data obtained from raw material suppliers or sampling and chemical analysis.


(d) You must use the default value of 1.0 for the calcination fraction of a carbonate-based mineral. Alternatively, you may opt to obtain the calcination fraction of any carbonate-based mineral by sampling. If you opt to obtain the calcination fraction of any carbonate-based minerals from sampling, you must determine on an annual basis the calcination fraction for each carbonate-based mineral consumed based on sampling and chemical analysis. You may conduct the sampling and chemical analysis using any x-ray fluorescence test, x-ray diffraction test, or other enhanced testing method published by an industry consensus standards organization (*e.g.,* ASTM, ASME, API).
