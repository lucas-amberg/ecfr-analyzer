# ยง 98.525   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations in ยง 98.523 is required. If the monitoring and quality assurance procedures in ยง 98.524 cannot be followed and data is unavailable, you must use the most appropriate of the missing data procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in the calculations. You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such missing value estimates.


(a) If the CEMS approach is used to determine combined process and combustion CO_2_ emissions, the missing data procedures in ยง 98.35 apply.


(b) For missing data on the monthly amounts of carbonate-based raw materials charged to any ceramics process unit, use the best available estimate(s) of the parameter(s) based on all available process data or data used for accounting purposes, such as purchase records.


(c) For missing data on the mass fractions of carbonate-based minerals in the carbonate-based raw materials, assume that the mass fraction of a carbonate-based mineral is 1.0, which assumes that one carbonate-based mineral comprises 100 percent of the carbonate-based raw material.
