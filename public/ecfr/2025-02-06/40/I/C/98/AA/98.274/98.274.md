# § 98.274   Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

(a) Each facility subject to this subpart must quality assure the GHG emissions data according to the applicable requirements in § 98.34. All QA/QC data must be available for inspection upon request.


(b) Fuel properties needed to perform the calculations in Equations AA-1 and AA-2 of this subpart must be determined according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.


(1) High heat values of black liquor must be determined no less than annually using T684 om-06 Gross Heating Value of Black Liquor, TAPPI (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7). If measurements are performed more frequently than annually, then the high heat value used in Equation AA-1 of this subpart must be based on the average of the representative measurements made during the year.


(2) The annual mass of spent liquor solids must be determined using either of the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section.


(i) Measure the mass of spent liquor solids annually (or more frequently) using T-650 om-05 Solids Content of Black Liquor, TAPPI (incorporated by reference in § 98.7). If measurements are performed more frequently than annually, then the mass of spent liquor solids used in Equation AA-1 of this subpart must be based on the average of the representative measurements made during the year.


(ii) Determine the annual mass of spent liquor solids based on records of measurements made with an online measurement system that determines the mass of spent liquor solids fired in a chemical recovery furnace or chemical recovery combustion unit.


(3) Carbon analyses for spent pulping liquor must be determined no less than annually using ASTM D5373-08 Standard Test Methods for Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Laboratory Samples of Coal (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7). If measurements using ASTM D5373-08 are performed more frequently than annually, then the spent pulping liquor carbon content used in Equation AA-2 of this subpart must be based on the average of the representative measurements made during the year.


(c) Each facility must keep records that include a detailed explanation of how company records of measurements are used to estimate GHG emissions. The owner or operator must also document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the measurements of fuel, spent liquor solids, and makeup chemical usage, including, but not limited to calibration of weighing equipment, fuel flow meters, and other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with these devices must be recorded and the technical basis for these estimates must be provided. The procedures used to convert spent pulping liquor flow rates to units of mass (i.e., spent liquor solids firing rates) also must be documented.


(d) Records must be made available upon request for verification of the calculations and measurements.
