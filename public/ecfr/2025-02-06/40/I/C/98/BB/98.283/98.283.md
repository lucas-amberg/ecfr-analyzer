# ยง 98.283   Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the combined annual process CO_2_ emissions from all silicon carbide process units and production furnaces using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.


(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined annual process CO_2_ emissions by operating and maintaining CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined annual process CO_2_ emissions using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.


(1) Use Equation BB-1 of this section to calculate the facility-specific emissions factor for determining CO_2_ emissions. The carbon content must be measured monthly and used to calculate a monthly CO_2_ emissions factor:




(2) Calculate annual CO_2_ process emissions from the silicon carbide production facility according to Equation BB-2 of this section:


(c) If GHG emissions from a silicon carbide production furnace or process unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO_2_ emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
