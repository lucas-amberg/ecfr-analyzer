(a) You must measure your consumption of petroleum coke using plant instruments used for accounting purposes including direct measurement weighing the petroleum coke fed into your process (by belt scales or a similar device) or through the use of purchase records.


(b) You must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of monthly petroleum coke consumption measurements.


(c) For CO_2_ process emissions, you must determine the monthly carbon content of the petroleum coke using reports from the supplier. Alternatively, facilities can measure monthly carbon contents of the petroleum coke using ASTM D3176-89 (Reapproved 2002) Standard Practice for Ultimate Analysis of Coal and Coke (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 98.7) and ASTM D5373-08 Standard Test Methods for Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Laboratory Samples of Coal (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 98.7).


(d) For quality assurance and quality control of the supplier data, you must conduct an annual measurement of the carbon content of the petroleum coke using ASTM D3176-89 and ASTM D5373-08 Standard Test Methods for Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Laboratory Samples of Coal (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 98.7).
