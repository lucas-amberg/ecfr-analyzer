# ยง 98.286   Data reporting requirements.

In addition to the information required by ยง 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, and paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable for each silicon carbide production facility.




(a) If a CEMS is used to measure process CO_2_ emissions, you must report under this subpart the relevant information required for the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in ยง 98.36 and the information listed in this paragraph (a):


(1) Annual consumption of petroleum coke (tons).


(2) Annual production of silicon carbide (tons).


(3) Annual production capacity of silicon carbide (tons).


(b) If a CEMS is not used to measure process CO_2_ emissions, you must report the information in paragraph (b)(1) through (8) of this section for all silicon carbide process units or production furnaces combined:


(1) [Reserved]


(2) *Annual production of* silicon carbide (tons).


(3) Annual production capacity of silicon carbide (tons).


(4) [Reserved]


(5) Whether carbon content of the petroleum coke is based on reports from the supplier or through self measurement using applicable ASTM standard method.


(6) [Reserved]


(7) Sampling analysis results for carbon content of consumed petroleum coke as determined for QA/QC of supplier data under ยง 98.284(d) (percent by weight expressed as a decimal fraction).


(8) Number of times in the reporting year that missing data procedures were followed to measure the carbon contents of petroleum coke (number of months) and petroleum coke consumption (number of months).


(c) If methane abatement technology is used at the silicon carbide production facility, you must report the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. Upon reporting this information once in an annual report, you are not required to report this information again unless the information changes during a reporting year, in which case, the reporter must include any updates in the annual report for the reporting year in which the change occurred.


(1) Type of methane abatement technology used on each silicon carbide process unit or production furnace, and date of installation for each.


(2) Methane destruction efficiency for each methane abatement technology (percent destruction). You must either use the manufacturer's specified destruction efficiency or the destruction efficiency determined via a performance test. If you report the destruction efficiency determined via a performance test, you must also report the test method that was used during the performance test.


(3) Percentage of annual operating hours that methane abatement technology was in use for all silicon carbide process units or production furnaces combined.
