# § 98.35   Procedures for estimating missing data.

Whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a CEMS malfunctions during unit operation or if a required fuel sample is not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the calculations.


(a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be followed for CO_2_ concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content.


(b) For units that use the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 Calculation Methodologies, perform missing data substitution as follows for each parameter:


(1) For each missing value of the high heating value, carbon content, or molecular weight of the fuel, substitute the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data incident. If the “after” value has not been obtained by the time that the GHG emissions report is due, you may use the “before” value for missing data substitution or the best available estimate of the parameter, based on all available process data (e.g., electrical load, steam production, operating hours). If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data period.


(2) For missing records of CO_2_ concentration, stack gas flow rate, percent moisture, fuel usage, and sorbent usage, the substitute data value shall be the best available estimate of the parameter, based on all available process data (e.g., electrical load, steam production, operating hours, etc.). You must document and retain records of the procedures used for all such estimates.
