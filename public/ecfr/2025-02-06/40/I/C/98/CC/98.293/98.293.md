# ยง 98.293   Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual process CO_2_ emissions from each soda ash manufacturing line using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.


(a) For each soda ash manufacturing line that meets the conditions specified in ยง 98.33(b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii), you must calculate and report under this subpart the combined process and combustion CO_2_ emissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure CO_2_ emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(b) For each soda ash manufacturing line that is not subject to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, calculate and report the process CO_2_ emissions from the soda ash manufacturing line by using the procedure in either paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section; and the combustion CO_2_ emissions using the procedure in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(1) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined process and combustion CO_2_ emissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure CO_2_ emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(2) Use either Equation CC-1 or Equation CC-2 of this section to calculate annual CO_2_ process emissions from each manufacturing line that calcines trona to produce soda ash:


(3) *Site-specific emission factor method.* Use Equations CC-3, CC-4, and CC-5 of this section to determine annual CO_2_ process emissions from manufacturing lines that use the liquid alkaline feedstock process to produce soda ash. You must conduct an annual performance test and measure CO_2_ emissions and flow rates at all process vents from the mine water stripper/evaporator for each manufacturing line and calculate CO_2_ emissions as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(i) During the performance test, you must measure the process vent flow from each process vent during the test and calculate the average rate for the test period in metric tons per hour.


(ii) Using the test data, you must calculate the hourly CO_2_ emission rate using Equation CC-3 of this section:


(iii) Using the test data, you must calculate a CO_2_ emission factor for the process using Equation CC-4 of this section:


(iv) You must calculate annual CO_2_ process emissions from each manufacturing line using Equation CC-5 of this section:


(4) Calculate and report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the combustion CO_2_, CH_4_, and N_2_O emissions in the soda ash manufacturing line according to the applicable requirements in subpart C.
