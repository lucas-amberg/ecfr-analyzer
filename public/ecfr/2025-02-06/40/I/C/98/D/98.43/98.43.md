# § 98.43   Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, continue to monitor and report CO_2_ mass emissions as required under § 75.13 or section 2.3 of appendix G to 40 CFR part 75, and § 75.64. Calculate CO_2_, CH_4_, and N_2_O emissions as follows:


(1) Convert the cumulative annual CO_2_ mass emissions reported in the fourth quarter electronic data report required under § 75.64 from units of short tons to metric tons. To convert tons to metric tons, divide by 1.1023.


(2) Calculate and report annual CH_4_ and N_2_O mass emissions under this subpart by following the applicable method specified in § 98.33(c).


(b) Calculate and report biogenic CO_2_ emissions under this subpart by following the applicable methods specified in § 98.33(e). The CO_2_ emissions (excluding biogenic CO_2_) for units subject to this subpart that are reported under §§ 98.3(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(iii)(B) shall be calculated by subtracting the biogenic CO_2_ mass emissions calculated according to § 98.33(e) from the cumulative annual CO_2_ mass emissions from paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Separate calculation and reporting of biogenic CO_2_ emissions is optional only for the 2010 reporting year pursuant to § 98.3(c)(12) and required every year thereafter.
