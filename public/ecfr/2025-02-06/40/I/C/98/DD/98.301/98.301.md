# ยง 98.301   Reporting threshold.

(a) You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if you are an electric power system as defined in ยง 98.308 and your facility meets the requirements of ยง 98.2(a)(1). To calculate total annual GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO_2_e per year emission threshold in table A-3 to subpart A to this part, you must calculate emissions of each fluorinated GHG that is a component of a reportable insulating gas and then sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG resulting from the use of electrical transmission and distribution equipment for threshold applicability purposes using equation DD-1 to this section.


(b) A facility other than an electric power system that is subject to this part because of emissions from any other source category listed in table A-3 or A-4 to subpart A of this part is not required to report emissions under subpart DD of this part unless the total estimated emissions of fluorinated GHGs that are components of reportable insulating gases, as calculated in equation DD-2 to this section, equals or exceeds 25,000 tons CO_2_e.
