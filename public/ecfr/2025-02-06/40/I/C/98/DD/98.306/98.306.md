# ยง 98.306   Data reporting requirements.

In addition to the information required by ยง 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the following information for each electric power system, by chemical:


(a) Nameplate capacity of equipment (pounds) containing each insulating gas:


(1) Existing at the beginning of the year (excluding hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear).


(2) New hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(3) New equipment other than hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(4) Retired hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(5) Retired equipment other than hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(b) Transmission miles (length of lines carrying voltages above 35 kilovolts).


(c) Distribution miles (length of lines carrying voltages at or below 35 kilovolts).


(d) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas stored in containers, but not in energized equipment, at the beginning of the year.


(e) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas stored in containers, but not in energized equipment, at the end of the year.


(f) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas purchased or otherwise acquired in bulk from chemical producers, chemical distributors, or other entities.


(g) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas purchased or otherwise acquired from equipment manufacturers, equipment distributors, or other entities with or inside equipment, including hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear, while the equipment was not in use.


(h) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas returned to facility after off-site recycling.


(i) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas acquired inside equipment, except hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear, that was transferred while the equipment was in use, *e.g.,* through acquisition of all or part of another electric power system.


(j) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas returned to suppliers.


(k) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas that was sold or transferred to other entities in bulk.


(l) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas sent off-site for recycling.


(m) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas sent off-site for destruction.


(n) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas contained in equipment, including hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear, that was sold or transferred to other entities while the equipment was not in use.


(o) Pounds of each reportable insulating gas disbursed inside equipment, except hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear, that was transferred while the equipment was in use, *e.g.,* through sale of all or part of the electric power system to another electric power system.


(p) State(s) or territory in which the facility lies.


(q) The number of reportable-insulating-gas-containing pieces of equipment in each of the following equipment categories:


(1) New hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(2) New equipment other than hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(3) Retired hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(4) Retired equipment other than hermetically sealed-pressure switchgear during the year.


(r) The total of the nameplate capacity values most recently assigned by the electrical equipment manufacturer(s) to each of the following groups of equipment:


(1) All new equipment whose nameplate capacity values were measured by the user under this subpart and for which the user adopted the user-measured nameplate capacity value during the year.


(2) All retiring equipment whose nameplate capacity values were measured by the user under this subpart and for which the user adopted the user-measured nameplate capacity value during the year.


(s) The total of the nameplate capacity values measured by the electrical equipment user for each of the following groups of equipment:


(1) All new equipment whose nameplate capacity values were measured by the user under this subpart and for which the user adopted the user-measured nameplate capacity value during the year.


(2) All retiring equipment whose nameplate capacity values were measured by the user under this subpart and for which the user adopted the user-measured nameplate capacity value during the year.


(t) For each reportable insulating gas reported in paragraphs (a), (d) through (o), and (q) of this section, an ID number or other appropriate descriptor that is unique to that reportable insulating gas.


(u) For each ID number or descriptor reported in paragraph (t) of this section for each unique insulating gas, the name (as required in ยง 98.3(c)(4)(iii)(G)(1)) and weight percent of each fluorinated gas in the insulating gas.
