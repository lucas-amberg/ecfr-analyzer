# § 98.57   Records that must be retained.

In addition to the information required by § 98.3(g), you must retain the records specified in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section at the facility level:

(a) Annual adipic acid production capacity (tons).


(b) Records of significant changes to process.


(c) Number of facility and unit operating hours in calendar year.


(d) Documentation of how accounting procedures were used to estimate production rate.


(e) Documentation of how process knowledge was used to estimate abatement technology destruction efficiency.


(f) Performance test reports.


(g) Measurements, records and calculations used to determine reported parameters.


(h) Documentation of the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the measurements of all reported parameters, including but not limited to, calibration of weighing equipment, flow meters, and other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with these devices must also be recorded, and the technical basis for these estimates must be provided.


(i) *Verification software records.* You must keep a record of the file generated by the verification software specified in § 98.5(b) for the applicable data specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (3) of this section. Retention of this file satisfies the recordkeeping requirement for the data in paragraphs (i)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Annual adipic acid production from each adipic acid production unit (tons) (Equations E-2, E-3a, E-3b, E-3c, and E-3d of § 98.53).


(2) Production rate per test run during the performance test for each production unit test run (tons adipic acid produced/hr) (Equation E-1 of § 98.53).


(3) Annual adipic acid production per N_2_O abatement technology during which N_2_O abatement technology was used (tons adipic acid produced) (Equation E-2).
