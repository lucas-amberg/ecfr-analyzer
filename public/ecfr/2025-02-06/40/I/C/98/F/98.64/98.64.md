# ยง 98.64   Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

(a) Effective December 31, 2010 for smelters with no prior measurement or effective December 31, 2012, for facilities with historic measurements, the smelter-specific slope coefficients, overvoltage emission factors, and weight fractions used in Equations F-2, F-3, and F-4 of this subpart must be measured in accordance with the recommendations of the EPA/IAI Protocol for Measurement of Tetrafluoromethane (CF_4_) and Hexafluoroethane (C_2_F_6_) Emissions from Primary Aluminum Production (2008) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7), except the minimum frequency of measurement shall be every 10 years unless a change occurs in the control algorithm that affects the mix of types of anode effects or the nature of the anode effect termination routine.Facilities which operate at less than 0.2 anode effect minutes per cell day or operate with less than 1.4mV anode effect overvoltage can use either smelter-specific slope coefficients or the technology specific default values in Table F-1 of this subpart.


(b) The minimum frequency of the measurement and analysis is annually except as follows:


(1) Monthly for anode effect minutes per cell day (or anode effect overvoltage and current efficiency).


(2) Monthly for aluminum production.


(3) Smelter-specific slope coefficients, overvoltage emission factors, and weight fractions according to paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) Sources may use either smelter-specific values from annual measurements of parameters needed to complete the equations in ยง 98.63 (e.g., sulfur, ash, and hydrogen contents) or the default values shown in Table F-2 of this subpart.
