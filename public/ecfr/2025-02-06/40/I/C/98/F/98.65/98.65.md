# ยง 98.65   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter malfunctions during unit operation or if a required sample measurement is not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the calculations, according to the following requirements:


(a) Where anode or paste consumption data are missing, CO_2_ emissions can be estimated from aluminum production by using Equation F-9 of this section.




(b) For other parameters, use the average of the two most recent data points after the missing data.
