(a) You must report CH_4_ liberated from ventilation and degasification systems.


(b) You must report CH_4_ destruction from systems where gas is sold, used onsite, or otherwise destroyed (including by VAM oxidation and by flaring).


(c) You must report net CH_4_ emissions from ventilation and degasification systems.


(d) You must report under this subpart the CO_2_ emissions from coal mine gas CH_4_ destruction occurring at the facility, where the gas is not a fuel input for energy generation or use (*e.g.,* flaring and VAM oxidation).


(e) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the CO_2_, CH_4_, and N_2_O emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit by following the requirements of subpart C. Report emissions from both the combustion of collected coal mine CH_4_ and any other fuels.


(f) An underground coal mine that is subject to this part because emissions from source categories described in Tables A-3, A-4 or A-5 of subpart A of this part, or from stationary combustion (subpart C of this part), is not required to report emissions under this subpart unless the coal mine liberates 36,500,000 actual cubic feet (acf) or more of methane per year from its ventilation system.
