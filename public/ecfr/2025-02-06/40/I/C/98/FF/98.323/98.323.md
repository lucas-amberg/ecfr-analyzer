# ยง 98.323   Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) For each ventilation shaft, vent hole, or centralized point into which CH_4_ from multiple shafts and/or vent holes are collected, you must calculate the quarterly CH_4_ liberated from the ventilation system using Equation FF-1 of this section. You must measure CH_4_ content, flow rate, temperature, pressure, and moisture content of the gas using the procedures outlined in ยง 98.324.


(1) The quarterly periods are:

(i) January 1-March 31.


(ii) April 1-June 30.


(iii) July 1-September 30.


(iv) October 1-December 31.


(2) Values of V, C, T, P, and, if applicable, (f_H2O_), must be based on measurements taken at least once each quarter with no fewer than 6 weeks between measurements. If measurements are taken more frequently than once per quarter, then use the average value for all measurements taken. If continuous measurements are taken, then use the average value over the time period of continuous monitoring.


(3) If a facility has more than one monitoring point, the facility must calculate total CH_4_ liberated from ventilation systems (CH_4VTotal_) as the sum of the CH_4_ from all ventilation monitoring points in the mine, as follows:


(b) For each monitoring point in the degasification system (this could be at each degasification well and/or vent hole, or at more centralized points into which CH_4_ from multiple wells and/or vent holes are collected), you must calculate the weekly CH_4_ liberated from the mine using CH_4_ measured weekly or more frequently (including by CEMS) according to 98.234(c), CH_4_ content, flow rate, temperature, pressure, and moisture content, and Equation FF-3 of this section.


(1) Values for V, C, T, P, and, if applicable, (f_H2O_), must be based on measurements taken at least once each calendar week with at least 3 days between measurements. If measurements are taken more frequently than once per week, then use the average value for all measurements taken that week. If continuous measurements are taken, then use the average values over the time period of continuous monitoring when the continuous monitoring equipment is properly functioning.


(2) Quarterly total CH_4_ liberated from degasification systems for the mine must be determined as the sum of CH_4_ liberated determined at each of the monitoring points in the mine, summed over the number of weeks in the quarter, as follows:




(c) If gas from a degasification system or ventilation system is sold, used onsite, or otherwise destroyed (including by flaring or VAM oxidation), you must calculate the quarterly CH_4_ destroyed for each destruction device and each point of offsite transport to a destruction device, using Equation FF-5 of this section. You must measure CH_4_ content and flow rate according to the provisions in ยง 98.324, and calculate the methane routed to the destruction device (CH_4_) using either Equation FF-1 or Equation FF-4 of this section, as applicable.


(1) Calculate total CH_4_ destroyed as the sum of the methane destroyed at all destruction devices (onsite and offsite), using Equation FF-6 of this section.


(2) [Reserved]


(d) You must calculate the quarterly measured net CH_4_ emissions to the atmosphere using Equation FF-7 of this section.


(e) For the methane collected from degasification and/or ventilation systems that is destroyed on site and is not a fuel input for energy generation or use (those emissions are monitored and reported under Subpart C of this part), you must estimate the CO_2_ emissions using Equation FF-8 of this section.
