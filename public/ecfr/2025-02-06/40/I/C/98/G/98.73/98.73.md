# ยง 98.73   Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual CO_2_ process emissions from each ammonia manufacturing unit using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.




(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the process CO_2_ emissions by operating and maintaining CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(b) Calculate and report under this subpart process CO_2_ emissions using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable.


(1) *Gaseous feedstock.* You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO_2_ process emissions from gaseous feedstock according to equation G-1 to this section:


(2) *Liquid feedstock.* You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO_2_ process emissions from liquid feedstock according to Equation G-2 of this section:


(3) *Solid feedstock.* You must calculate, from each ammonia manufacturing unit, the CO_2_ process emissions from solid feedstock according to Equation G-3 of this section:


(4) You must calculate the annual process CO_2_ emissions from each ammonia processing unit k at your facility according to Equation G-4 of this section:


(5) You must determine the combined CO_2_ emissions from all ammonia processing units at your facility using Equation G-5 of this section.


(c) If GHG emissions from an ammonia manufacturing unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO_2_ emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
