# § 98.74   Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

(a) You must continuously measure the quantity of gaseous or liquid feedstock consumed using a flow meter. The quantity of solid feedstock consumed can be obtained from company records and aggregated on a monthly basis.


(b) You must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the estimates of feedstock consumption.


(c) You must determine monthly carbon contents and the average molecular weight of each feedstock consumed from reports from your supplier. As an alternative to using supplier information on carbon contents, you can also collect a sample of each feedstock on a monthly basis and analyze the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel using any of the following methods listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of this section, as applicable.


(1) ASTM D1945-03 Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(2) ASTM D1946-90 (Reapproved 2006) Standard Practice for Analysis of Reformed Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(3) ASTM D2502-04 (Reapproved 2002) Standard Test Method for Estimation of Mean Relative Molecular Mass of Petroleum Oils from Viscosity Measurements (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(4) ASTM D2503-92 (Reapproved 2007) Standard Test Method for Relative Molecular Mass (Molecular Weight) of Hydrocarbons by Thermoelectric Measurement of Vapor Pressure (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(5) ASTM D3238-95 (Reapproved 2005) Standard Test Method for Calculation of Carbon Distribution and Structural Group Analysis of Petroleum Oils by the n-d-M Method (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(6) ASTM D5291-02 (Reapproved 2007) Standard Test Methods for Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Petroleum Products and Lubricants (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(7) ASTM D3176-89 (Reapproved 2002) Standard Practice for Ultimate Analysis of Coal and Coke (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(8) ASTM D5373-08 Standard Methods for Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Laboratory Samples of Coal (incorporated by reference, *see* § 98.7).


(d) Calibrate all oil and gas flow meters that are used to measure liquid and gaseous feedstock volumes and flow rates (except for gas billing meters) according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for the Tier 3 methodology in § 98.34(b)(1). Perform oil tank drop measurements (if used to quantify feedstock volumes) according to § 98.34(b)(2).


(e) For quality assurance and quality control of the supplier data, on an annual basis, you must measure the carbon contents of a representative sample of the feedstocks consumed using the appropriate ASTM Method as listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of this section.


(f) You may use company records or an engineering estimate to determine the annual ammonia production and the annual methanol production.


(g) If CO_2_ from ammonia production is used to produce urea at the same facility, you must determine the quantity of urea produced using methods or plant instruments used for accounting purposes (such as sales records). You must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the estimates of urea produced.
