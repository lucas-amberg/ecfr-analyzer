# ยง 98.75   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever the monitoring and quality assurance procedures in ยง 98.74 cannot be followed (e.g., if a meter malfunctions during unit operation), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the calculations following paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such estimates.


(a) For missing data on monthly carbon contents of feedstock, the substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that carbon content in the month preceding and the month immediately following the missing data incident. If no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured value for carbon content obtained in the month after the missing data period.


(b) For missing feedstock supply rates used to determine monthly feedstock consumption, you must determine the best available estimate(s) of the parameter(s), based on all available process data.
