# ยง 98.86   Data reporting requirements.

In addition to the information required by ยง 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as appropriate.


(a) If a CEMS is used to measure CO_2_ emissions, then you must report under this subpart the relevant information required by ยง 98.36(e)(2)(vi) and the information listed in this paragraph(a):


(1) Monthly clinker production from each kiln at the facility.


(2) Annual facility cement production.


(3) Number of kilns and number of operating kilns.


(4) Annual arithmetic average of total CaO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(5) Annual arithmetic average of non-calcined CaO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(6) Annual arithmetic average of total MgO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(7) Annual arithmetic average of non-calcined MgO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(8) Annual facility CKD not recycled to the kiln(s), tons.








(b) If a CEMS is not used to measure CO_2_ emissions, then you must report the information listed in this paragraph (b) for each kiln:


(1) Kiln identification number.


(2) [Reserved]


(3) Annual cement production at the facility.


(4) Number of kilns and number of operating kilns.


(5)-(6) [Reserved]


(7) Method used to determine non-calcined CaO and non-calcined MgO in clinker.


(8) [Reserved]


(9) Method used to determine non-calcined CaO and non-calcined MgO in CKD.


(10) [Reserved]


(11) Quarterly kiln-specific CKD CO_2_ emission factors for each kiln (metric tons CO_2_/metric ton CKD produced).


(12) [Reserved]


(13) Name of raw kiln feed or raw material.

(14) Number of times missing data procedures were used to determine the following information:


(i) Clinker production (number of months).


(ii) Carbonate contents of clinker (number of months).


(iii) Non-calcined content of clinker (number of months).


(iv) CKD not recycled to kiln (number of quarters).


(v) Non-calcined content of CKD (number of quarters)


(vi) Organic carbon contents of raw materials (number of times).


(vii) Raw material consumption (number of months).


(15) Method used to determine the monthly clinker production from each kiln.


(16) Annual clinker production (metric tons).


(17) Annual average clinker CO_2_ emission factor for the facility, averaged across all kilns (metric tons CO_2_/metric ton clinker produced).


(18) Annual average CKD CO_2_ emission factor for the facility, averaged across all kilns (metric tons CO_2_/metric ton CKD produced).


(19) Annual arithmetic average of total CaO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(20) Annual arithmetic average of non-calcined CaO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(21) Annual arithmetic average of total MgO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(22) Annual arithmetic average of non-calcined MgO content of clinker at the facility, wt-fraction.


(23) Annual arithmetic average of total CaO content of CKD not recycled to the kiln(s) at the facility, wt-fraction.


(24) Annual arithmetic average of non-calcined CaO content of CKD not recycled to the kiln(s) at the facility, wt-fraction.


(25) Annual arithmetic average of total MgO content of CKD not recycled to the kiln(s) at the facility, wt-fraction.


(26) Annual arithmetic average of non-calcined MgO content of CKD not recycled to the kiln(s) at the facility, wt-fraction.


(27) Annual facility CKD not recycled to the kiln(s), tons.


(28) The amount of raw kiln feed consumed annually at the facility, tons (dry basis).
