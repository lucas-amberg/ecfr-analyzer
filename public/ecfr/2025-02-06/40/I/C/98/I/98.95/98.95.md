# ยง 98.95   Procedures for estimating missing data.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a complete record of all measured parameters used in the fluorinated GHG and N_2_O emissions calculations in ยง 98.93 and ยง 98.94 is required.


(b) If you use fluorinated heat transfer fluids at your facility and are missing data for one or more of the parameters in Equation I-16 of this subpart, you must estimate fluorinated heat transfer fluid emissions using the arithmetic average of the emission rates for the reporting year immediately preceding the period of missing data and the months immediately following the period of missing data. Alternatively, you may estimate missing information using records from the fluorinated heat transfer fluid supplier. You must document the method used and values used for all missing data values.
