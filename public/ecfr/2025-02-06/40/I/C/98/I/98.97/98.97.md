In addition to the information required by § 98.3(g), you must retain the following records:


(a) All data used and copies of calculations made as part of estimating gas consumption and emissions, including all spreadsheets.


(b) If you use HC fuel CECS purchased and installed on or after January 1, 2025, to control emissions from tools that use either NF_3_ as an input gas in remote plasma cleaning processes or F_2_ as an input gas in any process, and if you use a value less than 1 for either a_F2,j_ or a_NF3,RPC_ in equation I-9 to § 98.93, certification and documentation that the model for each of the systems that you claim does not form CF_4_ from F_2_ has been tested and verified to produce less than 0.1% CF_4_ from F_2_, and certification that the site maintenance plan includes the HC fuel CECS manufacturer's recommendations and specifications for installation, operation, and maintenance of those systems. If you are relying on your own testing to make the certification that the model produces less than 0.1% CF_4_ from F_2_, the documentation must include the model tested, the method used to perform the testing (*e.g.,* EPA 430-R-10-003, modified to calculate the formation rate of CF_4_ from F_2_ rather than the DRE), complete documentation of the results of any initial and subsequent tests, and a final report similar to that specified in EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7), with appropriate adjustments to reflect the measurement of the formation rate of CF_4_ from F_2_ rather than the DRE. If you are relying on testing by the HC fuel CECS manufacturer to make the certification that the system produces less than 0.1% CF_4_ from F_2_, the documentation must include the model tested, the method used to perform the testing, and the results of the test.
