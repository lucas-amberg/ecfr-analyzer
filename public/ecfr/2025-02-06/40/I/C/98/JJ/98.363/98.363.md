# ยง 98.363   Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) For all manure management system components listed in 98.360(b) except digesters, estimate the annual CH_4_ emissions and sum for all the components to obtain total emissions from the manure management system for all animal types using Equation JJ-1.


(1) Average annual animal populations for static populations (e.g., dairy cows, breeding swine, layers) must be estimated by performing an animal inventory or review of facility records once each reporting year.


(2) Average annual animal populations for growing populations (meat animals such as beef and veal cattle, market swine, broilers, and turkeys) must be estimated each year using the average number of days each animal is kept at the facility and the number of animals produced annually, and an equation similar or equal to Equation JJ-4 below, adapted from Equation 10.1 in *2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,* Volume 4, Chapter 10.


(b) For each digester, calculate the total amount of CH_4_ emissions, and then sum the emissions from all digesters, as shown in Equation JJ-5 of this section.


(1) For each digester, calculate the annual CH_4_ flow to the combustion device (CH_4_C) using Equation JJ-6 of this section. A fully integrated system that directly reports the quantity of CH_4_ flow to the digester combustion device requires only summing the results of all monitoring periods for a given year to obtain CH_4_C.


(2) For each digester, calculate the average annual volumetric flow rate, CH_4_ concentration of digester gas, temperature, and pressure at which flow are measured using Equations JJ-7 through JJ-10 of this section.


(3) For each digester, calculate the CH_4_ destruction at the digester combustion device using Equation JJ-11 of this section.


(4) For each digester, calculate the CH_4_ leakage using Equation JJ-12 of this section.


(c) For each MMS component, estimate the annual N_2_O emissions and sum for all MMS components to obtain total emissions from the manure management system for all animal types using Equation JJ-13 of this section.


(d) Estimate the annual total facility emissions using Equation JJ-15 of this section.
