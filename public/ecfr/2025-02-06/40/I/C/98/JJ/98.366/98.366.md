# ยง 98.366   Data reporting requirements.

(a) In addition to the information required by ยง 98.3(c), each annual report must contain the following information:


(1) List of manure management system components at the facility.


(2) Fraction of manure from each animal type that is handled in each manure management system component.


(3) Average annual animal population (for each animal type) for static populations or the results of Equation JJ-4 for growing populations.


(4) Average number of days that growing animals are kept at the facility (for each animal type).


(5) The number of animals produced annually for growing populations (for each animal type).


(6) Typical animal mass (for each animal type).


(7) Total facility emissions (results of Equation JJ-15).


(8) CH_4_ emissions from manure management system components listed in ยง 98.360(b), except digesters (results of Equation JJ-2).


(9) VS value used (for each animal type).


(10) B_0_ value used (for each animal type).


(11) Methane conversion factor used for each MMS component.


(12) Average ambient temperature used to select each methane conversion factor.


(13) N_2_O emissions (results of Equation JJ-13).


(14) N value used for each animal type.


(15) N_2_O emission factor selected for each MMS component.


(b) Facilities with anaerobic digesters must also report:


(1) CH_4_ emissions from anaerobic digesters (results of Equation JJ-5).


(2) CH_4_ flow to the digester combustion device for each digester (results of Equation JJ-6, or value from fully integrated monitoring system as described in 98.363(b)).


(3) CH_4_ destruction for each digester (results of Equation JJ-11).


(4) CH_4_ leakage for each digester (results of Equation JJ-12).


(5) Total annual volumetric biogas flow for each digester (results of Equation JJ-7).


(6) Average annual CH_4_ concentration for each digester (results of Equation JJ-8).


(7) Average annual temperature at which gas flow is measured for each digester (results of Equation JJ-9).


(8) Average annual gas flow pressure at which gas flow is measured for each digester (results of Equation JJ-10).


(9) Destruction efficiency used for each digester.


(10) Number of days per year that each digester was operating.


(11) Collection efficiency used for each digester.
