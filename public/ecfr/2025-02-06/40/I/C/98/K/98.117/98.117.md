# § 98.117   Records that must be retained.

In addition to the records required by § 98.3(g), you must retain the records specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section for each EAF, as applicable.

(a) If a CEMS is used to measure CO_2_ emissions according to the requirements in § 98.113(a), then you must retain under this subpart the records required for the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.37 and the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.


(1) Monthly EAF production quantity for each ferroalloy product (tons).


(2) Number of EAF operating hours each month.


(3) Number of EAF operating hours in a calendar year.


(b) If the carbon mass balance procedure is used to determine CO_2_ emissions according to the requirements in § 98.113(b)(2), then you must retain records for the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section.


(1) Monthly EAF production quantity for each ferroalloy product (tons).


(2) Number of EAF operating hours each month.


(3) Number of EAF operating hours in a calendar year.


(4) Monthly material quantity consumed, used, or produced for each material included for the calculations of annual process CO_2_ emissions (tons).


(5) Average carbon content determined and records of the supplier provided information or analyses used for the determination for each material included for the calculations of annual process CO_2_ emissions.


(c) You must keep records that include a detailed explanation of how company records of measurements are used to estimate the carbon input and output to each EAF, including documentation of specific input or output materials excluded from Equation K-1 of this subpart that contribute less than 1 percent of the total carbon into or out of the process. You also must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the measurements of materials fed, charged, or placed in an EAF including, but not limited to, calibration of weighing equipment and other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with these devices must also be recorded, and the technical basis for these estimates must be provided.


(d) If you are required to calculate CH_4_ emissions for the EAF as specified in § 98.113(d), you must maintain records of the total amount of each alloy product produced for the specified reporting period, and the appropriate alloy-product specific emission factor used to calculate the CH_4_ emissions.


(e) *Verification software records.* You must keep a record of the file generated by the verification software specified in § 98.5(b) for the applicable data specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (13) of this section. Retention of this file satisfies the recordkeeping requirement for the data in paragraphs (e)(1) through (13) of this section.


(1) Carbon content in reducing agent (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction) (Equation K-1 of § 98.113).


(2) Annual mass of reducing agent fed, charged, or otherwise introduced into the EAF (tons) (Equation K-1).


(3) Carbon content of carbon electrode (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction) (Equation K-1).


(4) Annual mass of carbon electrode consumed in the EAF (tons) (Equation K-1).


(5) Carbon content in ore (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction) (Equation K-1).


(6) Annual mass of ore charged to the EAF (tons) (Equation K-1).


(7) Carbon content in flux material (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction) (Equation K-1).


(8) Annual mass of flux material fed, charged, or otherwise introduced into the EAF to facilitate slag formation (tons) (Equation K-1).


(9) Carbon content in alloy product (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction) (Equation K-1).


(10) Annual mass of alloy product produced/tapped in the EAF (tons) (Equation K-1).


(11) Carbon content in non-product outgoing material (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction) (Equation K-1).


(12) Annual mass of non-product outgoing material removed from EAF (tons) (Equation K-1).


(13) CH_4_ emission factor selected from Table K-1 of this subpart for each product (kg of CH_4_ emissions/metric ton of alloy product) (Equation K-3 of § 98.113).
