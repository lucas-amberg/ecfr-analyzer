# ยง 98.145   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required (e.g., carbonate raw materials consumed, etc.). If the monitoring and quality assurance procedures in ยง 98.144 cannot be followed and data is missing, you must use the most appropriate of the missing data procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such missing value estimates.


(a) For missing data on the monthly amounts of carbonate-based raw materials charged to any continuous glass melting furnace use the best available estimate(s) of the parameter(s), based on all available process data or data used for accounting purposes, such as purchase records.


(b) For missing data on the mass fractions of carbonate-based minerals in the carbonate-based raw materials assume that the mass fraction of each carbonate based mineral is 1.0.
