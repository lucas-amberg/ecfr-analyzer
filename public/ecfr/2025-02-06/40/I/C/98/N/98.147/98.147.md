# § 98.147   Records that must be retained.

In addition to the information required by § 98.3(g), you must retain the records listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.




(a) If a CEMS is used to measure emissions, then you must retain the records required under § 98.37 for the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology and the following information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section:


(1) Monthly glass production rate for each continuous glass melting furnace, by glass type (tons).


(2) Monthly amount of each carbonate-based raw material charged to each continuous glass melting furnace (tons).


(3) Monthly amount (tons) of recycled scrap glass (cullet) charged to each continuous glass melting furnace, by glass type.


(b) If process CO_2_ emissions are calculated according to the procedures specified in § 98.143(b), you must retain the records in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.


(1) Monthly glass production rate for each continuous glass melting furnace, by glass type (tons).


(2) Monthly amount of each carbonate-based raw material charged to each continuous glass melting furnace (tons).


(3) Monthly amount (tons) of recycled scrap glass (cullet) charged to each continuous glass melting furnace, by glass type.


(4) Data on carbonate-based mineral mass fractions provided by the raw material supplier for all raw materials consumed annually and included in calculating process emissions in equation N-1 to § 98.143, if applicable.


(5) Results of all tests, if applicable, used to verify the carbonate-based mineral mass fraction for each carbonate-based raw material charged to a continuous glass melting furnace, including the data specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (v) of this section.


(i) Date of test.


(ii) Method(s), and any variations of the methods, used in the analyses.


(iii) Mass fraction of each sample analyzed.


(iv) Relevant calibration data for the instrument(s) used in the analyses.


(v) Name and address of laboratory that conducted the tests.


(6) The decimal fraction of calcination achieved for each carbonate-based raw material, if a value other than 1.0 is used to calculate process mass emissions of CO_2_.




(c) All other documentation used to support the reported GHG emissions.


(d) *Verification software records.* You must keep a record of the file generated by the verification software specified in § 98.5(b) for the applicable data specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. Retention of this file satisfies the recordkeeping requirement for the data in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) Annual average decimal mass fraction of carbonate-based mineral in each carbonate-based raw material for each continuous glass melting furnace (specify the default value, if used, or the value determined according to § 98.144) (percentage, expressed as a decimal) (Equation N-1 of § 98.143).


(2) Annual amount of each carbonate-based raw material charged to each continuous glass melting furnace (tons) (Equation N-1 of this subpart).


(3) Decimal fraction of calcination achieved for each carbonate-based raw material for each continuous glass melting furnace (specify the default value, if used, or the value determined according to § 98.144) (percentage, expressed as a decimal) (Equation N-1 of this subpart).
