# § 98.405   Procedures for estimating missing data.

(a) Whenever a quality-assured value of the quantity of natural gas liquids or natural gas supplied during any period is unavailable (e.g., if a flow meter malfunctions), a substitute data value for the missing quantity measurement must be used in the calculations according to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


(b) *Determination of quantity.* (1) NGL fractionators shall substitute meter records provided by pipeline(s) for all pipeline receipts of NGLs; by manifests for deliveries made to trucks or rail cars; or metered quantities accepted by the entities purchasing the output from the fractionator whether by pipeline or by truck or rail car. In cases where the metered data from the receiving pipeline(s) or purchasing entities are not available, fractionators may substitute estimates based on contract quantities required to be delivered under purchase or delivery contracts with other parties.


(2) LDCs shall either substitute their delivering pipeline metered deliveries at the city gate or substitute nominations and scheduled delivery quantities for the period when metered values of actual deliveries are not available.


(c) *Determination of HHV and EF.* (1) Whenever an LDC that makes its own HHV measurements according to established business practices cannot follow the quality assurance procedures for developing a reporter-specific HHV, as specified in § 98.404, during any period for any reason, the reporter shall use either its delivering pipeline measurements or the default HHV provided in Table NN-1 of this part for that period.


(2) Whenever an LDC that does not make its own HHV measurements according to established business practices or an NGL fractionator cannot follow the quality assurance procedures for developing a reporter-specific HHV, as specified in § 98.404, during any period for any reason, the reporter shall use the default HHV provided in Table NN-1 of this part for that period.


(3) [Reserved]


(4) Whenever a reporter cannot follow the quality assurance procedures for developing a reporter-specific EF, as specified in § 98.404, during any period for any reason, the reporter shall use the default EF provided in § 98.408 for that period.
