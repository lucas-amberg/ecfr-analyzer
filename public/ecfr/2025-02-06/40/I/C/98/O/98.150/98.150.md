# ยง 98.150   Definition of the source category.

The HCFC-22 production and HFC-23 destruction source category consists of HCFC-22 production processes and HFC-23 destruction processes.


(a) An HCFC-22 production process produces HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane, or CHClF_2_) from chloroform (CHCl_3_) and hydrogen fluoride (HF).


(b) An HFC-23 destruction process is any process in which HFC-23 undergoes destruction. An HFC-23 destruction process may or may not be co-located with an HCFC-22 production process at the same facility.
