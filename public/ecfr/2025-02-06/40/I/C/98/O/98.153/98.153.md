# ยง 98.153   Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) The mass of HFC-23 generated from each HCFC-22 production process shall be estimated by using one of two methods, as applicable:


(1) Where the mass flow of the combined stream of HFC-23 and another reaction product (e.g., HCl) is measured, multiply the weekly (or more frequent) HFC-23 concentration measurement (which may be the average of more frequent concentration measurements) by the weekly (or more frequent) mass flow of the combined stream of HFC-23 and the other product. To estimate annual HFC-23 production, sum the weekly (or more frequent) estimates of the quantities of HFC-23 produced over the year. This calculation is summarized in Equation O-1 of this section:


(2) Where the mass of only a reaction product other than HFC-23 (either HCFC-22 or HCl) is measured, multiply the ratio of the weekly (or more frequent) measurement of the HFC-23 concentration and the weekly (or more frequent) measurement of the other product concentration by the weekly (or more frequent) mass produced of the other product. To estimate annual HFC-23 production, sum the weekly (or more frequent) estimates of the quantities of HFC-23 produced over the year. This calculation is summarized in Equation O-2 of this section, assuming that the other product is HCFC-22. If the other product is HCl, HCl may be substituted for HCFC-22 in Equations O-2 and O-3 of this section.


(b) The mass of HCFC-22 produced over the period p shall be estimated by using Equation O-3 of this section:


(c) For HCFC-22 production facilities that do not use a destruction device or that have a destruction device that is not directly connected to the HCFC-22 production equipment, HFC-23 emissions shall be estimated using Equation O-4 of this section:


(d) For HCFC-22 production facilities that use a destruction device connected to the HCFC-22 production equipment, HFC-23 emissions shall be estimated using Equation O-5 of this section:


(1) The mass of HFC-23 emitted annually from equipment leaks (for use in Equation O-5 of this section) shall be estimated by using Equation O-6 of this section:


(2) The mass of HFC-23 emitted annually from process vents (for use in Equation O-5 of this section) shall be estimated by using Equation O-7 of this section:


(3) The total mass of HFC-23 emitted from destruction devices shall be estimated by using Equation O-8 of this section:


(4) For facilities that destroy HFC-23, the total mass of HFC-23 destroyed shall be estimated by using Equation O-9 of this section:
