# ยง 98.418   Definitions.

Except as provided below, all of the terms used in this subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part. If a conflict exists between a definition provided in this subpart and a definition provided in subpart A, the definition in this subpart shall take precedence for the reporting requirements in this subpart.


*Isolated intermediate* means a product of a process that is stored before subsequent processing. An isolated intermediate is usually a product of chemical synthesis. Storage of an isolated intermediate marks the end of a process. Storage occurs at any time the intermediate is placed in equipment used solely for storage.


*Low-concentration constituent* means, for purposes of fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF production and export, a fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF constituent of a fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF product that occurs in the product in concentrations below 0.1 percent by mass. For purposes of fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF import, low-concentration constituent means a fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF constituent of a fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF product that occurs in the product in concentrations below 0.5 percent by mass. Low-concentration constituents do not include fluorinated GHGs or fluorinated HTFs that are deliberately combined with the product (*e.g.,* to affect the performance characteristics of the product).
