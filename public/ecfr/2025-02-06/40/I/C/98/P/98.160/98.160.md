# ยง 98.160   Definition of the source category.

(a) A hydrogen production source category consists of facilities that produce hydrogen gas as a product.


(b) This source category comprises process units that produce hydrogen by reforming, gasification, oxidation, reaction, or other transformations of feedstocks except the processes listed in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.


(1) Any process unit for which emissions are reported under another subpart of this part. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to:


(i) Ammonia production units for which emissions are reported under subpart G.


(ii) Catalytic reforming units at petroleum refineries that transform naphtha into higher octane aromatics for which emissions are reported under subpart Y.


(iii) Petrochemical process units for which emissions are reported under subpart X.


(2) Any process unit that only separates out diatomic hydrogen from a gaseous mixture and is not associated with a unit that produces hydrogen created by transformation of one or more feedstocks, other than those listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(c) This source category includes the process units that produce hydrogen and stationary combustion units directly associated with hydrogen production (*e.g.* , reforming furnace and hydrogen production process unit heater).
