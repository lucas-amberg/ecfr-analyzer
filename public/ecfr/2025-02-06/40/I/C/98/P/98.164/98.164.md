# § 98.164   Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

The GHG emissions data for hydrogen production process units must be quality-assured as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate for each process unit, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section:






(a) If a CEMS is used to measure GHG emissions, then the facility must comply with the monitoring and QA/QC procedures specified in § 98.34(c).


(b) If a CEMS is not used to measure GHG emissions, then you must:


(1) Calibrate all oil and gas flow meters that are used to measure liquid and gaseous fuel and feedstock volumes (except for gas billing meters) according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for the Tier 3 methodology in § 98.34(b)(1). Perform oil tank drop measurements (if used to quantify liquid fuel or feedstock consumption) according to § 98.34(b)(2). Calibrate all solids weighing equipment according to the procedures in § 98.3(i).


(2) Determine the carbon content and the molecular weight annually of standard gaseous hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks having consistent composition (*e.g.,* natural gas) according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For gaseous fuels and feedstocks that have a maximum product specification for carbon content less than or equal to 0.00002 kg carbon per kg of gaseous fuel or feedstock, you may instead determine the carbon content and the molecular weight annually using the product specification's maximum carbon content and molecular weight. For other gaseous fuels and feedstocks (*e.g.,* biogas, refinery gas, or process gas), sample and analyze no less frequently than weekly to determine the carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel and feedstock according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.


(3) Determine the carbon content of fuel oil, naphtha, and other liquid fuels and feedstocks at least monthly, except annually for standard liquid hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks having consistent composition, or upon delivery for liquid fuels and feedstocks delivered by bulk transport (*e.g.,* by truck or rail) according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For liquid fuels and feedstocks that have a maximum product specification for carbon content less than or equal to 0.00006 kg carbon per gallon of liquid fuel or feedstock, you may instead determine the carbon content annually using the product specification's maximum carbon content.


(4) Determine the carbon content of coal, coke, and other solid fuels and feedstocks at least monthly, except annually for standard solid hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks having consistent composition, or upon delivery for solid fuels and feedstocks delivered by bulk transport (*e.g.,* by truck or rail) according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.


(5) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section for fuels and feedstocks with a carbon content below the specified levels, you must use the following applicable methods to determine the carbon content for all fuels and feedstocks, and molecular weight of gaseous fuels and feedstocks. Alternatively, you may use the results of chromatographic analysis of the fuel and feedstock, provided that the chromatograph is operated, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions; and the methods used for operation, maintenance, and calibration of the chromatograph are documented in the written monitoring plan for the unit under § 98.3(g)(5).

(xix) For fuels and feedstocks with a carbon content below the specified levels in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, if the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (xviii) of this section are not appropriate because the relevant compounds cannot be detected, the quality control requirements are not technically feasible, or use of the method would be unsafe, you may use modifications of the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (xviii) or use other methods that are applicable to your fuel or feedstock.


(c) You may use best available monitoring methods as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for measuring the fuel used by each stationary combustion unit directly associated with hydrogen production (*e.g.,* reforming furnace and hydrogen production process unit heater) that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Eligibility to use best available monitoring methods ends upon the completion of any planned process unit or equipment shutdown after January 1, 2025.


(1) To be eligible to use best available monitoring methods, you must meet all criteria in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) The stationary combustion unit must be directly associated with hydrogen production (*e.g.,* reforming furnace and hydrogen production process unit heater).


(ii) A measurement device meeting the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not installed to measure the fuel used by each stationary combustion unit as of January 1, 2025.


(iii) The hydrogen production unit and associated stationary combustion unit are operated continuously.


(iv) Installation of a measurement device to measure the fuel used by each stationary combustion unit that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must require a planned process equipment or unit shutdown or can only be done through a hot tap.


(2) Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods:


(i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart.


(ii) Supplier data.


(iii) Engineering calculations.
