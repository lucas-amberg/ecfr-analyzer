# ยง 98.420   Definition of the source category.

(a) The carbon dioxide (CO_2_) supplier source category consists of the following:


(1) Facilities with production process units that capture a CO_2_ stream for purposes of supplying CO_2_ for commercial applications or that capture and maintain custody of a CO_2_ stream in order to sequester or otherwise inject it underground. Capture refers to the initial separation and removal of CO_2_ from a manufacturing process or any other process.


(2) Facilities with CO_2_ production wells that extract or produce a CO_2_ stream for purposes of supplying CO_2_ for commercial applications or that extract and maintain custody of a CO_2_ stream in order to sequester or otherwise inject it underground.


(3) Importers or exporters of bulk CO_2_.




(4) Facilities with process units, including but not limited to direct air capture (DAC), that capture a CO_2_ stream from ambient air for purposes of supplying CO_2_ for commercial applications or that capture and maintain custody of a CO_2_ stream in order to sequester or otherwise inject it underground.






(b) This source category is focused on upstream supply. It does not cover:


(1) Storage of CO_2_ above ground or in geologic formations.


(2) Use of CO_2_ in enhanced oil and gas recovery.


(3) Transportation or distribution of CO_2_.


(4) Purification, compression, or processing of CO_2_.


(5) On-site use of CO_2_ captured on site.


(c) This source category does not include CO_2_ imported or exported in equipment, such as fire extinguishers.
