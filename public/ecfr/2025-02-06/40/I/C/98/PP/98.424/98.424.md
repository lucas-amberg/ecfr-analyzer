# § 98.424   Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

(a) *Determination of quantity.* (1) Reporters following the procedures in § 98.423(a) shall determine quantity using a flow meter or meters located in accordance with this paragraph.


(i) If the CO_2_ stream is segregated such that only a portion is captured for commercial application or for injection, you must locate the flow meter according to the following:


(A) For reporters following the procedures in § 98.423(a)(3)(i), you must locate the flow meter(s) after the point of segregation.


(B) For reporters following the procedures in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of § 98.423, you must locate the main flow meter(s) on the captured CO_2_ stream(s) prior to the point of segregation and the subsequent flow meter(s) on the CO_2_ stream(s) for on-site use after the point of segregation. You may only follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of § 98.423 if the CO_2_ stream(s) for on-site use is/are the only diversion(s) from the main, captured CO_2_ stream(s) after the main flow meter location(s).


(ii) Reporters that have a mass flow meter or volumetric flow meter installed to measure the flow of a CO_2_ stream that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall base calculations in § 98.423 of this subpart on the installed mass flow or volumetric flow meters.


(iii) Reporters that do not have a mass flow meter or volumetric flow meter installed to measure the flow of the CO_2_ stream that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall base calculations in § 98.423 of this subpart on the flow of gas transferred off site using a mass flow meter or a volumetric flow meter located at the point of off-site transfer.


(2) Reporters following the procedures in paragraph (b) of § 98.423 shall determine quantity in accordance with this paragraph.


(i) Reporters that supply CO_2_ in containers using weigh bills, scales, or load cells shall measure the mass of contents of each CO_2_ container to which the CO_2_ stream is delivered, sum the mass of contents supplied in all containers to which the CO_2_ stream is delivered during each quarter, sample the CO_2_ stream delivering CO_2_ to containers on a quarterly basis to determine the composition of the CO_2_ stream, and apply Equation PP-1.


(ii) Reporters that supply CO_2_ in containers using loaded container volumes shall measure the volume of contents of each CO_2_ container to which the CO_2_ stream is delivered, sum the volume of contents supplied in all containers to which the CO_2_ stream is delivered during each quarter, sample the CO_2_ stream on a quarterly basis to determine the composition of the CO_2_ stream, determine the density quarterly, and apply Equation PP-2.


(3) Importers or exporters that import or export CO_2_ in containers shall measure the mass in each CO_2_ container using weigh bills, scales, or load cells and sum the mass in all containers imported or exported during the reporting year.


(4) All flow meters, scales, and load cells used to measure quantities that are reported in § 98.423 of this subpart shall be operated and calibrated according to the following procedure:


(i) You shall use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the American Gas Association (AGA), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).


(ii) Where no appropriate standard method developed by a consensus-based standards organization exists, you shall follow industry standard practices.


(iii) You must ensure that any flow meter calibrations performed are NIST traceable.


(5) Reporters using Equation PP-2 of this subpart and measuring CO_2_ concentration as weight % CO_2_ shall determine the density of the CO_2_ stream on a quarterly basis in order to calculate the mass of the CO_2_ stream according to one of the following procedures:


(i) You may use a method published by a consensus-based standards organization. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373, *http://www.astm.org*), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293-8020, *http://www.ansi.org*), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824-7000, *http://www.aga.org*), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990, (800) 843-2763, *http://www.asme.org*), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-4070, (202) 682-8000, *http://www.api.org*), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356-0060, *http://www.api.org*). The method(s) used shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under § 98.3(g)(5).


(ii) You may follow an industry standard method.


(b) *Determination of concentration.* (1) Reporters using Equation PP-1 or PP-2 of this subpart shall sample the CO_2_ stream on a quarterly basis to determine the composition of the CO_2_ stream.


(2) Methods to measure the composition of the CO_2_ stream must conform to applicable chemical analytical standards. Acceptable methods include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration food-grade specifications for CO_2_ (*see* 21 CFR 184.1240) and ASTM standard E1747-95 (Reapproved 2005) Standard Guide for Purity of Carbon Dioxide Used in Supercritical Fluid Applications (ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373, *http://www.astm.org*).


(c) You shall convert the density of the CO_2_ stream(s) and all measured volumes of carbon dioxide to the following standard industry temperature and pressure conditions: Standard cubic meters at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at an absolute pressure of 1 atmosphere. If you apply the density value for CO_2_ at standard conditions, you must use 0.001868 metric tons per standard cubic meter.
