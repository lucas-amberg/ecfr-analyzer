# ยง 98.425   Procedures for estimating missing data.

(a) Whenever the quality assurance procedures in ยง 98.424(a)(1) of this subpart cannot be followed to measure quarterly mass flow or volumetric flow of CO_2_, the most appropriate of the following missing data procedures shall be followed:


(1) A quarterly CO_2_ mass flow or volumetric flow value that is missing may be substituted with a quarterly value measured during another quarter of the current reporting year.


(2) A quarterly CO_2_ mass flow or volumetric flow value that is missing may be substituted with a quarterly value measured during the same quarter from the past reporting year.


(3) If a mass or volumetric flow meter is installed to measure the CO_2_ stream, you may substitute data from a mass or volumetric flow meter measuring the CO_2_ stream transferred for any period during which the installed meter is inoperable.


(4) The mass or volumetric flow used for purposes of product tracking and billing according to the reporter's established procedures may be substituted for any period during which measurement equipment is inoperable.


(b) Whenever the quality assurance procedures in ยง 98.424(b) cannot be followed to determine concentration of the CO_2_ stream, the most appropriate of the following missing data procedures shall be followed:


(1) A quarterly concentration value that is missing may be substituted with a quarterly value measured during another quarter of the current reporting year.


(2) A quarterly concentration value that is missing may be substituted with a quarterly value measured during the same quarter from the previous reporting year.


(3) The concentration used for purposes of product tracking and billing according to the reporter's established procedures may be substituted for any quarterly value.


(c) Missing data on density of the CO_2_ stream shall be substituted with quarterly or annual average values from the previous calendar year.


(d) Whenever the quality assurance procedures in ยง 98.424(a)(2) of this subpart cannot be followed to measure quarterly quantity of CO_2_ in containers, the most appropriate of the following missing data procedures shall be followed:


(1) A quarterly quantity of CO_2_ in containers that is missing may be substituted with a quarterly value measured during another representative quarter of the current reporting year.


(2) A quarterly quantity of CO_2_ in containers that is missing may be substituted with a quarterly value measured during the same quarter from the past reporting year.


(3) The quarterly quantity of CO_2_ in containers recorded for purposes of product tracking and billing according to the reporter's established procedures may be substituted for any period during which measurement equipment is inoperable.
