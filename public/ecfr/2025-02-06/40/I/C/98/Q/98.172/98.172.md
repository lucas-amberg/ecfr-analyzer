# § 98.172   GHGs to report.

(a) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO_2_, CH_4_, and N_2_O from each stationary combustion unit following the requirements of subpart C except for flares. Stationary combustion units include, but are not limited to, by-product recovery coke oven battery combustion stacks, blast furnace stoves, boilers, process heaters, reheat furnaces, annealing furnaces, flame suppression, ladle reheaters, and other miscellaneous combustion sources.


(b) You must report CO_2_ emissions from flares that burn blast furnace gas or coke oven gas according to the procedures in § 98.253(b)(1) of subpart Y (Petroleum Refineries) of this part. When using the alternatives set forth in § 98.253(b)(1)(ii)(B) and § 98.253(b)(1)(iii)(C), you must use the default CO_2_ emission factors for coke oven gas and blast furnace gas from Table C-1 to subpart C in Equations Y-2 and Y-3 of subpart Y. You must report CH_4_ and N_2_O emissions from flares according to the requirements in § 98.33(c)(2) using the emission factors for coke oven gas and blast furnace gas in Table C-2 to subpart C of this part.


(c) You must report process CO_2_ emissions from each taconite indurating furnace; basic oxygen furnace; non-recovery coke oven battery combustion stack; coke pushing process; sinter process; EAF; decarburization vessel; and direct reduction furnace by following the procedures in this subpart.
