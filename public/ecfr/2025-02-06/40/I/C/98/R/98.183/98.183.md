# ยง 98.183   Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual process CO_2_ emissions from each smelting furnace using the procedure in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(a) For each smelting furnace that meets the conditions specified in ยง 98.33(b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii), you must calculate and report combined process and combustion CO_2_ emissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure CO_2_ emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(b) For each smelting furnace that is not subject to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, calculate and report the process and combustion CO_2_ emissions from the smelting furnace by using the procedure in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.


(1) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined process and combustion CO_2_ emissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure CO_2_ emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(2) Calculate and report process and combustion CO_2_ emissions separately using the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section.


(i) For each smelting furnace, determine the annual mass of carbon in each carbon-containing material, other than fuel, that is fed, charged, or otherwise introduced into the smelting furnace and estimate annual process CO_2_ emissions using Equation R-1 of this section. Carbon-containing materials include carbonaceous reducing agents. If you document that a specific material contributes less than 1 percent of the total carbon into the process, you do not have to include the material in your calculation using Equation R-1 of this section.


(ii) Determine the combined annual process CO_2_ emissions from the smelting furnaces at your facility using Equation R-2 of this section.


(iii) Calculate and report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the combustion CO_2_ emissions from the smelting furnaces according to the applicable requirements in subpart C.
