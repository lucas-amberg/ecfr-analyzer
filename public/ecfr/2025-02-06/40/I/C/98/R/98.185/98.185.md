# ยง 98.185   Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations in ยง 98.183 is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the calculations as specified in the paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such estimates.


(a) For each missing data for the carbon content for the smelting furnaces at your facility that estimate annual process CO_2_ emissions using the carbon mass balance procedure in ยง 98.183(b)(2)(i) and (ii), 100 percent data availability is required. You must repeat the test for average carbon contents of inputs according to the procedures in ยง 98.184(b) if data are missing.


(b) For missing records of the monthly mass of carbon-containing materials, the substitute data value must be based the best available estimate of the mass of the material from all available process data or data used for accounting purposes (such as purchase records).
