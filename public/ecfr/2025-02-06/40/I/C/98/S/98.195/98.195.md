# ยง 98.195   Procedures for estimating missing data.

For the procedure in ยง 98.193(b)(1), a complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required (e.g., oxide content, quantity of lime products, etc.). Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the calculations as specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such estimates.


(a) For each missing value of the quantity of lime produced (by lime type), and quantity of calcined byproduct or waste produced and sold, the substitute data value shall be the best available estimate based on all available process data or data used for accounting purposes.


(b) For missing values related to the CaO and MgO content, you must conduct a new composition test according to the standard methods in ยง 98.194 (c)(1) or (c)(2).
