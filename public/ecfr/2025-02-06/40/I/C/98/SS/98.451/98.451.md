# § 98.451   Reporting threshold.

You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains an electrical equipment manufacturing or refurbishing process and the facility meets the requirements of § 98.2(a)(2). To calculate total annual GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO_2_e per year emission threshold in § 98.2(a)(2), follow the requirements of § 98.2(b), with one exception. Instead of following the requirement of § 98.453 to calculate emissions from electrical equipment manufacture or refurbishment, you must calculate emissions of each fluorinated GHG that is a component of a reportable insulating gas and then sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG resulting from manufacturing and refurbishing electrical equipment using equation SS-1 to this section.
