# ยง 98.203   Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) Calculate the mass of each GHG emitted from magnesium production or processing over the calendar year using either Equation T-1 or Equation T-2 of this section, as appropriate. Both of these equations equate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases to consumption of cover gases or carrier gases.


(1) To estimate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases by monitoring changes in container masses and inventories, emissions of each cover gas or carrier gas shall be estimated using Equation T-1 of this section:


(2) To estimate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases by monitoring changes in the masses of individual containers as their contents are used, emissions of each cover gas or carrier gas shall be estimated using Equation T-2 of this section:


(b) For purposes of Equation T-2 of this section, the mass of the cover gas used over the period p for an individual container shall be estimated by using Equation T-3 of this section:


(c) If a facility has mass flow controllers (MFC) and the capacity to track and record MFC measurements to estimate total gas usage, the mass of each cover or carrier gas monitored may be used as the mass of cover or carrier gas consumed (Q_p_), in kg for period p in Equation T-2 of this section.
