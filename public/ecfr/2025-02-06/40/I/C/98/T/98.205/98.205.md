# ยง 98.205   Procedures for estimating missing data.

(a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emission calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the missing parameter will be used in the calculations as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) Replace missing data on the emissions of cover or carrier gases by multiplying magnesium production during the missing data period by the average cover or carrier gas usage rate from the most recent period when operating conditions were similar to those for the period for which the data are missing. Calculate the usage rate for each cover or carrier gas using Equation T-4 of this section:


(c) If the precise before and after weights are not available, it should be assumed that the container was emptied in the process (*i.e.,* quantity purchased should be used, less heel).
