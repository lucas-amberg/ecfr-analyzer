# ยง 98.206   Data reporting requirements.

In addition to the information required by ยง 98.3(c), each annual report must include the following information at the facility level:


(a) Emissions of each cover or carrier gas in metric tons.


(b) Types of production processes at the facility (*e.g.,* primary, secondary, die casting).


(c) Amount of magnesium produced or processed in metric tons for each process type. This includes the output of primary and secondary magnesium production processes and the input to magnesium casting processes.


(d) Cover and carrier gas flow rate (*e.g.,* standard cubic feet per minute) for each production unit and composition in percent by volume.


(e) For any missing data, you must report the length of time the data were missing for each cover gas or carrier gas, the method used to estimate emissions in their absence, and the quantity of emissions thereby estimated.


(f) The annual cover gas usage rate for the facility for each cover gas, excluding the carrier gas (kg gas/metric ton Mg).


(g) If applicable, an explanation of any change greater than 30 percent in the facility's cover gas usage rate (*e.g.,* installation of new melt protection technology or leak discovered in the cover gas delivery system that resulted in increased emissions).


(h) A description of any new melt protection technologies adopted to account for reduced or increased GHG emissions in any given year.
