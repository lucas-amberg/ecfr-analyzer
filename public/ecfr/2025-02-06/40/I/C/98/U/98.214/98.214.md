# ยง 98.214   Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

(a) The annual mass of carbonate consumed (for Equation U-1 of this subpart) or carbonate inputs (for Equation U-2 of this subpart) must be determined annually from monthly measurements using the same plant instruments used for accounting purposes including purchase records or direct measurement, such as weigh hoppers or weigh belt feeders.


(b) The annual mass of carbonate outputs (for Equation U-2 of this subpart) must be determined annually from monthly measurements using the same plant instruments used for accounting purposes including purchase records or direct measurement, such as weigh hoppers or belt weigh feeders.


(c) If you follow the procedures of ยง 98.213(a), as an alternative to assuming a calcination fraction of 1.0, you can determine on an annual basis the calcination fraction for each carbonate consumed based on sampling and chemical analysis using a suitable method such as using an x-ray fluorescence standard method or other enhanced industry consensus standard method published by an industry consensus standard organization (e.g., ASTM, ASME, etc.).
