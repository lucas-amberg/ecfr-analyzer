# § 98.217   Records that must be retained.

In addition to the records required by § 98.3(g), you must retain the records specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section: 


(a) Monthly carbonate consumption (by carbonate type in tons).


(b) You must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the monthly measurements of carbonate consumption, carbonate input or carbonate output including, but not limited to, calibration of weighing equipment and other measurement devices.


(c) Records of all analyses conducted to meet the requirements of this rule.


(d) Records of all calculations conducted.


(e) *Verification software records.* You must keep a record of the file generated by the verification software specified in § 98.5(b) for the applicable data specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section. Retention of this file satisfies the recordkeeping requirement for the data in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) Fraction calcination achieved for each particular carbonate type. As an alternative to measuring the calcination fraction, a value of 1.0 can be used (decimal fraction) (Equation U-1 of § 98.213).


(2) Annual mass of each carbonate type consumed (tons) (Equation U-1).


(3) Annual mass of each input carbonate type (tons) (Equation U-2 of § 98.213).


(4) Annual mass of each output carbonate type (tons) (Equation U-2).
