# § 98.233   Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual GHG emissions as prescribed in this section. For calculations that specify measurements in actual conditions, reporters may use a flow or volume measurement system that corrects to standard conditions and determine the flow or volume at standard conditions; otherwise, reporters must use average atmospheric conditions or typical operating conditions as applicable to the respective monitoring methods in this section.


(a) *Natural gas pneumatic device venting.* Calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from natural gas pneumatic device venting using the applicable provisions as specified in this paragraph (a) of this section. If you have a continuous flow meter on the natural gas supply line dedicated to any one or combination of natural gas pneumatic devices or natural gas driven pneumatic pumps vented directly to the atmosphere for any portion of the year, you must use the method specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from those devices. For natural gas pneumatic devices vented directly to the atmosphere for which the natural gas supply rate is not continuously measured, use the applicable methods specified in paragraphs (a)(2) through (7) of this section to calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions. For natural gas pneumatic devices that are routed to flares, combustion, or vapor recovery systems, use the applicable provisions specified in paragraphs (a)(8) of this section. All references to natural gas pneumatic devices for Calculation Method 1 in this paragraph (a) also apply to combinations of natural gas pneumatic devices and natural gas driven pneumatic pumps that are served by a common natural gas supply line.


(1) *Calculation Method 1.* If you have or elect to install a continuous flow meter that is capable of meeting the requirements of § 98.234(b) on the natural gas supply line dedicated to any one or combination of natural gas pneumatic devices and natural gas driven pneumatic pumps that are vented directly to the atmosphere, you must use the applicable methods specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section to calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from those devices.


(i) For volumetric flow monitors:


(A) Determine the cumulative annual volumetric flow, in standard cubic feet, as measured by the flow monitor in the reporting year. If all natural gas pneumatic devices supplied by the measured natural gas supply line are routed to the atmosphere for only a portion of the year and are routed to a flare, combustion, or vapor recovery system for the remaining portion of the year, determine the cumulative annual volumetric flow considering only those times when one or more of the natural gas pneumatic devices were vented directly to the atmosphere. If the flow meter was installed during the year, calculate the total volumetric flow for the year based on the measured volumetric flow times the total hours in the calendar year the devices were in service (*i.e.,* supplied with natural gas) divided by the number of hours the devices were in service (*i.e.,* supplied with natural gas) and the volumetric flow was being measured.


(B) Convert the natural gas volumetric flow from paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section to CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric emissions following the provisions in paragraph (u) of this section.


(C) Convert the CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric emissions from paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section to CH_4_ and CO_2_ mass emissions using calculations in paragraph (v) of this section.


(ii) For mass flow monitors:


(A) Determine the cumulative annual mass flow, in metric tons, as measured by the flow monitor in the reporting year. If all natural gas pneumatic devices supplied by the measured natural gas supply line are vented directly to the atmosphere for only a portion of the year and are routed to a flare, combustion, or vapor recovery system for the remaining portion of the year, determine the cumulative annual mass flow considering only those times when one or more of the natural gas pneumatic devices were vented directly to the atmosphere. If the flow meter was installed during the year, calculate the total mass flow for the year based on the measured mass flow times the total hours in the calendar year the devices were in service (*i.e.,* supplied with natural gas) divided by the number of hours the devices were in service (*i.e.,* supplied with natural gas) and the mass flow was being measured.


(B) Convert the cumulative mass flow from paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section to CH_4_ and CO_2_ mass emissions by multiplying by the mass fraction of CH_4_ and CO_2_ in the supplied natural gas. You must follow the provisions in paragraph (u) of this section for determining the mole fraction of CH_4_ and CO_2_ and use molecular weights of 16 kg/kg-mol and 44 kg/kg-mol for CH_4_ and CO_2_, respectively. You may assume unspecified components have an average molecular weight of 28 kg/kg-mol.


(iii) If the flow meter on the natural gas supply line serves both natural gas pneumatic devices and natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, disaggregate the total measured amount of natural gas to pneumatic devices and natural gas driven pneumatic pumps based on engineering calculations and best available data.


(iv) The flow meter must be operated and calibrated according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b).




(2) *Calculation Method 2.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you may elect to measure the volumetric flow rate of each natural gas pneumatic device vent that vents directly to the atmosphere at your well-pad site, gathering and boosting site, or facility, as applicable, as specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (ix) of this section. You must exclude the counts of devices measured according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section from the counts of devices to be measured or for which emissions are calculated according to the requirements in this paragraph (a)(2).






(i) For facilities in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segments, you may elect to measure your pneumatic devices according to this Calculation Method 2 for some well-pad sites or gathering and boosting sites and use other methods for other sites. When you elect to measure the emissions from natural gas pneumatic devices according to this Calculation Method 2 at a well-pad site or gathering and boosting site, you must measure all natural gas pneumatic devices that are vented directly to the atmosphere at the well-pad site or gathering and boosting site during the same calendar year and you must measure and calculate emissions according to the provisions in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) through (viii) of this section.


(ii) For facilities in the onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, or natural gas distribution industry segments electing to use this Calculation Method 2, you must measure all natural gas pneumatic devices vented directly to the atmosphere at your facility each year or, if your facility has 26 or more pneumatic devices, over multiple years, not to exceed the number of years as specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section. If you elect to measure your pneumatic devices over multiple years, you must measure approximately the same number of devices each year. You must measure and calculate emissions for natural gas pneumatic devices at your facility according to the provisions in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) through (ix), as applicable.


(A) If your facility has at least 26 but not more than 50 natural gas pneumatic devices vented directly to the atmosphere, the maximum number of years to measure all devices at your facility is 2 years.


(B) If your facility has at least 51 but not more than 75 natural gas pneumatic devices vented directly to the atmosphere, the maximum number of years to measure all devices at your facility is 3 years.

(D) If your facility has 101 or more natural gas pneumatic devices vented directly to the atmosphere, the maximum number of years to measure all devices at your facility is 5 years.










(iii) For all industry segments, determine the volumetric flow rate of each natural gas pneumatic device vent (in standard cubic feet per hour) using one of the methods specified in § 98.234(b) through (d), as appropriate, according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section. You must measure the emissions under conditions representative of normal operations, which excludes periods immediately after conducting maintenance on the device or manually actuating the device.




(A) If you use a temporary meter, such as a vane anemometer, according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b) or a high volume sampler according to methods set forth in § 98.234(d), you must measure the emissions from each device for a minimum of 15 minutes while the device is in service (i.e., supplied with natural gas), except for natural gas pneumatic isolation valve actuators. For natural gas pneumatic isolation valve actuators, you must measure the emissions from each device for a minimum of 5 minutes while the device is in service (*i.e.,* supplied with natural gas). If there is no measurable flow from the natural gas pneumatic device after the minimum sampling period, you can discontinue monitoring and follow the applicable methods in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section.


(B) If you use calibrated bagging, follow the methods set forth in § 98.234(c) except you need only fill one bag to have a valid measurement. You must collect sample for a minimum of 5 minutes for natural gas pneumatic isolation valve actuators or 15 minutes for other natural gas pneumatic devices. If no gas is collected in the calibrated bag during the minimum sampling period, you can discontinue monitoring and follow the applicable methods in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section. If gas is collected in the bag during the minimum sampling period, you must either continue sampling until you fill the calibrated bag or you may elect to remeasure the vent according to paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.


(C) You do not need to use the same measurement method for each natural gas pneumatic device vent.


(D) If the measurement method selected measures the volumetric flow rate in actual cubic feet, convert the measured flow to standard cubic feet following the methods specified in paragraph (t)(1) of this section.


(E) If there is measurable flow from the device vent, calculate the volumetric flow rate of each natural gas pneumatic device vent (in standard cubic feet per hour) by dividing the cumulative volume of natural gas measured during the measurement period (in standard cubic feet) by the duration of the measurement (in hours).


(iv) For all industry segments, if there is measurable flow from the device vent, calculate the volume of natural gas emitted from each natural gas pneumatic device vent as the product of the natural gas flow rate measured in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section and the number of hours the pneumatic device was in service (*i.e.,* supplied with natural gas) in the calendar year.

(*2*) Determine natural gas bleed rate (in standard cubic feet per hour) at the supply pressure used for the pneumatic device based on the manufacturer's steady state natural gas bleed rate reported for the device. If the steady state bleed rate is reported in terms of air consumption, multiply the air consumption rate by 1.29 to calculate the steady state natural gas bleed rate. If a steady state bleed rate is not reported, follow the requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B)(*4*) of this section.


(*3*) Calculate the volume of natural gas emitted from the natural gas pneumatic device vent as the product of the natural gas steady state bleed rate determined in paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B)(*2*) of this section and number of hours the pneumatic device was in service (*i.e.*, supplied with natural gas) in the calendar year.


(*4*) If a steady state bleed rate is not reported, reassess whether the device is correctly characterized as a continuous low bleed pneumatic device according to the provisions in paragraph (a)(7) of this section. If the device is confirmed to be a continuous low bleed pneumatic device, you must remeasure the device vent using a different measurement method specified in § 98.234(b) through (d) or longer monitoring duration until there is a measurable flow from the device and calculate natural gas emissions from the device according to paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section.

(*5*) Calculate the volume of natural gas emitted from the natural gas pneumatic device vent as the product of the per actuation volume in standard cubic feet determined in paragraph (a)(2)(v)(C)(3) of this section, the number of actuations during the year as determined in paragraph (a)(2)(v)(C)(*4*) of this section, and the relay correction factor. Use 1 for the relay correction factor if there is no relay; use 3 for the relay correction factor if there is a relay.

A device is considered malfunctioning if any leak is observed when the device is not actuating or if a leak is observed for more than 5 seconds, or the extended duration as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section if applicable, during a device actuation. If you cannot tell when a device is actuating, any observed leak from the device indicates a malfunctioning device.

You must exclude the counts of devices measured according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section from the counts of devices to be monitored or for which emissions are calculated according to the requirements in this paragraph (a)(4). You may not use this Calculation Method 4 for those devices for which you elected to measure emissions according to paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.


(i) You must calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric emissions using equation W-1B to this section, except use the appropriate default whole gas population emission factors for natural gas pneumatic device vents (in standard cubic feet per hour per device) of each type “t” (continuous high bleed, continuous low bleed, and intermittent bleed) as listed in table W-1 to this subpart.

(8) *Routing to flares, combustion, or vapor recovery systems.* Calculate emissions from natural gas pneumatic devices routed to flares, combustion, or vapor recovery systems as specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. If a device was vented directly to the atmosphere for part of the year and routed to a flare, combustion unit, or vapor recovery system during another part of the year, then calculate emissions from the time the device vents directly to the atmosphere as specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section, as applicable, and calculate emissions from the time the device was routed to a flare or combustion as specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. During periods when natural gas pneumatic device emissions are collected in a vapor recovery system that is not routed to combustion, paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) and (a)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply and no emissions calculations are required. Notwithstanding the calculation and emissions reporting requirements as specified in this paragraph (a)(8) of this section, the number of natural gas pneumatic devices routed to flares, combustion, or vapor recovery systems, by type, must be reported as specified in § 98.236(b)(2)(iii).

If you have a continuous flow meter on the natural gas supply line that is dedicated to any one or more natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, each of which only vents directly to the atmosphere, you must use Calculation Method 1 as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate vented CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from those pumps. Use Calculation Method 1 for any portion of a year when all of the pumps on the continuously measured natural gas supply line were vented directly to atmosphere. For natural gas driven pneumatic pumps vented directly to the atmosphere for which the natural gas supply rate is not continuously measured or the continuously measured natural gas supply line supplies some natural gas driven pneumatic pumps that vent emissions directly to the atmosphere and others that route emissions to flares, combustion or vapor recovery, use either the method specified in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section to calculate vented CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions for all of the natural gas driven pneumatic pumps at your facility that are not subject to Calculation Method 1; you may not use Calculation Method 2 for some vented natural gas driven pneumatic pumps and Calculation Method 3 for other natural gas driven pneumatic pumps. Calculate emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pumps routed to flares or combustion as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. All references to natural gas driven pneumatic pumps for Calculation Method 1 in this paragraph (c) also apply to combinations of natural gas pneumatic devices and natural gas driven pneumatic pumps that are served by a common natural gas supply line. You do not have to calculate emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pumps covered in paragraph (e) of this section under this paragraph (c).

You must follow the provisions in paragraph (u) of this section for determining the mole fraction of CH_4_ and CO_2_ and use molecular weights of 16 kg/kg-mol and 44 kg/kg-mol for CH_4_ and CO_2_, respectively. You may assume unspecified components have an average molecular weight of 28 kg/kg-mol.


(iii) If the supply line serves both natural gas pneumatic devices and natural gas driven pneumatic pumps, disaggregate the total measured amount of natural gas to natural gas pneumatic devices and natural gas driven pneumatic pumps based on engineering calculations and best available data.

(ii) Determine the volumetric flow rate of each natural gas driven pneumatic pump (in standard cubic feet per hour) using one of the methods specified in § 98.234(b) through (d), as appropriate, according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section. You must measure the emissions under conditions representative of normal operations, which excludes periods immediately after conducting maintenance on the pump.








(A) If you use a temporary meter, such as a vane anemometer, according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b) or a high volume sampler according to methods set forth in § 98.234(d), you must measure the emissions from each pump for a minimum of 5 minutes, during a period when the pump is continuously pumping liquid.


(B) If you use calibrated bagging, follow the methods set forth in § 98.234(c), except under § 98.234(c)(2), only one bag must be filled to have a valid measurement. You must collect sample for a minimum of 5 minutes, or until the bag is full, whichever is shorter, during a period when the pump is continuously pumping liquid. If the bag is not full after 5 minutes, you must either continue sampling until you fill the calibrated bag or you may elect to remeasure the vent according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.


(C) You do not need to use the same measurement method for each natural gas driven pneumatic pump vent.


(D) If the measurement method selected measures the volumetric flow rate in actual cubic feet, convert the measured flow to standard cubic feet following the methods specified in paragraph (t)(1) of this section. Convert the measured flow during the test period to standard cubic feet per hour, as appropriate.


(iii) Calculate the volume of natural gas emitted from each natural gas driven pneumatic pump vent as the product of the natural gas emissions flow rate measured in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and the number of hours that liquid was pumped by the pneumatic pump in the calendar year.

If you elect not to measure emissions as specified in Calculation Method 2, then you must use the applicable method specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section to calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from all natural gas driven pneumatic pumps that are vented directly to the atmosphere at each well-pad site or gathering and boosting site at your facility and that are not measured according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. You must exclude the counts of devices measured according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section from the counts of pumps for which emissions are calculated according to the requirements in this paragraph (c)(3).


(i) Calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pumps using equation W-2B to this section, except use the appropriate default whole gas population emission factor for natural gas pneumatic pump vents (in standard cubic feet per hour per device) as provided in table W-1 to this subpart.

(4) *Routing to flares, combustion, or vapor recovery systems*. Calculate emissions from natural gas driven pneumatic pumps for periods when they are routed to flares or combustion as specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. If emissions from a natural gas driven pneumatic pump were vented directly to the atmosphere for part of the year and routed to a flare, combustion, or vapor recovery for another part of the year, then calculate vented emissions for the portion of the year when venting occurs using the applicable method in paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for the period when venting occurs (including periods when emissions bypassed a flare), and calculate emissions for the portion of the year when the emissions are routed to a flare or combustion unit using the method in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. During periods when emissions from a pump are routed to a vapor recovery system without subsequently being routed to combustion, paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) and (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply and no emissions calculations are required. Notwithstanding the calculation and emissions reporting requirements as specified in this paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the number of natural gas pneumatic pumps routed to flares, combustion, or vapor recovery systems must be reported as specified in § 98.236(c)(2)(iii) and (iv).

For NRU vents, calculate emissions for CH_4_ vented directly to the atmosphere using any of the calculation methods described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section, and also comply with paragraphs (d)(5) through (12) of this section, as applicable. If any AGR vents or NRU vents are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O emissions for the flare stack as specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n). If any AGR vents or NRU vents are routed through an engine (*e.g.,* permeate from a membrane or de-adsorbed gas from a pressure swing adsorber used as fuel supplement) (*i.e.,* routed to combustion), you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O emissions as specified in subpart C of this part or as specified in paragraph (z) of this section, as applicable.








(1) *Calculation Method 1*. If you operate and maintain a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) that has both a CO_2_ concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor, you must calculate CO_2_ emissions under this subpart by following the Tier 4 Calculation Method and all associated calculation, quality assurance, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). Alternatively, you may follow the manufacturer's instructions or industry standard practice. If a CO_2_ concentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor are not available, you may elect to install a CO_2_ concentration monitor and a volumetric flow rate monitor that comply with all of the requirements specified for the Tier 4 Calculation Method in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(2) *Calculation Method 2*. Except as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for CO_2_ emissions, if a CEMS is not available but a vent meter is installed, use the CO_2_ composition and annual volume of vent gas to calculate emissions using equation W-3 to this section. Except as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for CH_4_ emissions, if a vent meter is installed, including the volumetric flow rate monitor on a CEMS for CO_2_, use the CH_4_ composition and annual volume of vent gas to calculate emissions using equation W-3 to this section.


(3) *Calculation Method 3*. If a CEMS for CO_2_ or a vent meter is not installed, you may use the inlet and/or outlet gas flow rate of the AGR or NRU to calculate emissions for CH_4_ and CO_2_ using equation W-4A, W-4B, or W-4C to this section. If inlet gas flow rate and CH_4_ and CO_2_ content of the vent gas are known, use equation W-4A to this section. If outlet gas flow rate and CH_4_ and CO_2_ content of the vent gas are known, use equation W-4B to this section. If inlet gas flow rate and outlet gas flow rate are known, use equation W-4C to this section. If the calculated annual total volumetric emissions (Ea,i) are less than or equal to 0 cubic feet per year, you may not use this calculation method for either CH_4_ or CO_2_.


(4) *Calculation Method 4*. If CEMS for CO_2_ or a vent meter is not installed, you may calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from an AGR or NRU using any standard simulation software package, such as AspenTech HYSYS®, or API 4679 AMINECalc, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state and speciates CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions. A minimum of the parameters listed in paragraph (d)(4)(i) through (x) of this section, as applicable, must be used to characterize emissions. If paragraph (d)(4)(i) through (x) of this section indicates that an applicable parameter must be measured, collect measurements reflective of representative operating conditions over the time period covered by the simulation. Determine all other applicable parameters in paragraph (d)(4)(i) through (x) of this section by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data and, if necessary, adjust parameters to represent the operating conditions over the time period covered by the simulation. Determine the number of simulations and associated time periods such that the simulations cover the entire reporting year (*i.e.*, if you calculate emissions using one simulation, use representative parameters for the operating conditions over the calendar year; if you use periodic simulations to cover the calendar year, use parameters for the operating conditions over each corresponding appropriate portion of the calendar year). You may also use this method for CO_2_ emissions from an AGR if a vent meter is installed but a CEMS is not, or for CH_4_ emissions from an AGR if a vent meter is installed (including the volumetric flow rate monitor on a CEMS for CO_2_), in which case you must determine the difference between the annual volume of vent gas measured by the vent meter and the simulated annual volume of vent gas according to paragraph (d)(9) of this section.

If you do not have a continuous flow meter, either install a continuous flow meter or use an engineering calculation to determine the flow rate.


(6) *Composition of vent gas*. For Calculation Method 2 or Calculation Method 3 when using equation W-4A or W-4B to this section, if a continuous gas analyzer is not available on the vent stack, either install a continuous gas analyzer or take quarterly gas samples from the vent gas stream for each quarter that the AGR or NRU is operating to determine Vol_i_ in equation W-3 to this section or Vol_EM,i_ in equation W-4A or W-4B to this section, according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b).


(7) *Composition of inlet gas stream*. For Calculation Method 3, if a continuous gas analyzer is installed on the inlet gas stream, then the continuous gas analyzer results must be used. If a continuous gas analyzer is not available, either install a continuous gas analyzer or take quarterly gas samples from the inlet gas stream for each quarter that the AGR or NRU is operating to determine VolI,i in equation W-4A, W-4B, or W-4C to this section, according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b).


(8) *Composition of outlet gas stream*. For Calculation Method 3, determine annual average volumetric fraction of GHGi (either CH_4_ or CO_2_) content in natural gas flowing out of the AGR or NRU using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) If a continuous gas analyzer is installed on the outlet natural gas stream, then the continuous gas analyzer results must be used. If a continuous gas analyzer is not available, you may install a continuous gas analyzer.


(ii) If a continuous gas analyzer is not available or installed, quarterly gas samples may be taken from the outlet natural gas stream for each quarter that the AGR or NRU is operating to determine Vol_O,i_ in equation W-4A, W-4B, or W-4C to this section, according to the methods set forth in § 98.234(b).


(iii) If a continuous gas analyzer is not available or installed, you may use the outlet pipeline quality specification for CO_2_ in natural gas and the outlet quality specification for CH_4_ in natural gas.


(9) Comparison of annual volume of vent gas. If a vent meter is installed but you wish to use Calculation Method 4 rather than Calculation Method 2 for an AGR, use equation W-4D to this section to determine the difference between the annual volume of vent gas measured by the vent meter and the simulated annual volume of vent gas.


(10) *Volumetric emissions*. Calculate annual volumetric CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions at standard conditions using calculations in paragraph (t) of this section.


(11) *Emissions vented directly to atmosphere from AGRs or NRUs routed to vapor recovery systems or flares*.

If emissions are routed to a flare but the flare is unlit, calculate emissions in accordance with the methodology specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).


(i) Calculate vented emissions as specified in paragraph (d)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, which represents the emissions from the AGR vent or NRU vent prior to the vapor recovery system or flare. Calculate an average hourly vented emissions rate by dividing the vented emissions by the number of hours that the AGR or NRU was in operation.


(ii) To calculate vented emissions during periods when the AGR vent or NRU vent was not routing emissions to a vapor recovery system or a flare, multiply the average hourly vented emissions rate determined in paragraph (d)(11)(i) of this section by the number of hours that the AGR or NRU vented directly to the atmosphere. Determine the number of hours that the AGR or NRU vented directly to atmosphere by subtracting the hours that the AGR or NRU was connected to a vapor recovery system or flare (based on engineering estimate and best available data) from the total operating hours for the AGR or NRU in the calendar year. You must take into account periods with reduced capture efficiency of the vapor recovery system or flare.

(e) *Dehydrator vents.* For dehydrator vents, calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions using the applicable calculation methods described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section. For glycol dehydrators that have an annual average daily natural gas throughput that is greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, use Calculation Method 1 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. For glycol dehydrators that have an annual average of daily natural gas throughput that is greater than 0 million standard cubic feet per day and less than 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day, use either Calculation Method 1 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or Calculation Method 2 in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If you are required to use a software program consistent with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section for compliance with Federal or state regulations, air permit requirements, or annual emissions inventory reporting for the current reporting year, you must use Calculation Method 1 to calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions. If emissions from dehydrator vents are routed to a vapor recovery system, you must calculate the emissions according to paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If emissions from dehydrator vents are routed to a regenerator firebox/fire tubes or to other non-flare combustion units, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. If any dehydrator vents are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O emissions for the flare stack as specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).










(1) *Calculation Method 1*. Calculate annual mass emissions from glycol dehydrators by using a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS®, Bryan Research & Engineering ProMax@, or GRI-GLYCalcTM, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state to calculate the equilibrium coefficient, speciates CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from dehydrators, and has provisions to include regenerator control devices, a separator flash tank, stripping gas, and a gas injection pump or gas assist pump. If you elect to use ProMax@, you must use version 5.0 or above. Emissions must be modeled from both the still vent and, if applicable, the flash tank vent. A minimum of the parameters listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) through (xi) of this section, as applicable, must be used to characterize emissions. If paragraph (e)(1)(i) through (xi) of this section indicates that an applicable parameter must be measured, collect measurements reflective of representative operating conditions for the time period covered by the simulation. Sample and analyze composition at least once every five years. Samples must be collected within six months of the startup or by January 1, 2030, whichever date is later. Until such a time that a sample is collected, determine composition by using one of the existing methods. Determine all other applicable parameters in paragraph (e)(1)(i) through (xi) of this section by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data and, if necessary, adjust parameters to represent the operating conditions over the time period covered by the simulation. Determine the number of simulations and associated time periods such that the simulations cover the entire reporting year (i.e., if you calculate emissions using one simulation, use representative parameters for the operating conditions over the calendar year; if you use periodic simulations to cover the calendar year, use parameters for the operating conditions over each corresponding appropriate portion of the calendar year). If more than one simulation is performed, input parameters should be remeasured if no longer representative of operating conditions.

(3) *Calculation Method 3*. For dehydrators of any size that use desiccant, you must calculate emissions from the amount of gas vented from the vessel when it is depressurized for the desiccant refilling process using equation W-6 to this section. From volumetric natural gas emissions, calculate both CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric and mass emissions using the procedures in paragraphs (u) and (v) of this section. Desiccant dehydrator emissions covered in this paragraph do not have to be calculated separately using the method specified in paragraph (i) of this section for blowdown vent stacks.

(ii) To calculate total emissions vented directly to atmosphere during periods when the dehydrator was not routing emissions to a vapor recovery system, flare, or regenerator firebox/fire tubes for dehydrator(s) with emissions calculated using Calculation Method 1 or 2, multiply the average hourly vented emissions rate determined in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section by the number of hours that the dehydrator vented directly to the atmosphere. Determine the number of hours that the dehydrator vented directly to atmosphere by subtracting the hours that the dehydrator was connected to a vapor recovery system, flare, or regenerator firebox/fire tubes (based on engineering estimate and best available data) from the total operating hours for the dehydrator in the calendar year. You must take into account periods with reduced capture efficiency of the vapor recovery system, flare, or regenerator firebox/fire tubes. If emissions are routed to a flare but the flare is unlit, calculate emissions in accordance with the methodology specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).




(iii) When emissions from dehydrator(s) are calculated using Calculation Method 3, calculate total annual emissions vented directly to atmosphere from the dehydrator(s) during periods of time when emissions were not routed to the vapor recovery system, flare, or other non-flare combustion unit by determining of the number of depressurization events (including portions of an event) that vented to atmosphere based on engineering estimate and best available data.

You must follow the Tier 4 Calculation Method and all associated calculation, quality assurance, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). If a CEMS is used to calculate emissions from a regenerator firebox/fire tubes or other non-flare combustion unit, the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section are not required.






(f) *Well venting for liquids unloadings.* Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from well venting for liquids unloading when the well is unloaded to the atmosphere using one of the calculation methods described in paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric and mass emissions using the method described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If emissions from well venting for liquids unloading are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).


(1) *Calculation Method 1.* Calculate emissions from manual and automated unloadings at wells with plunger lifts and wells without plunger lifts separately. For at least one well of each unique well tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category (see § 98.238 for the definitions of tubing diameter group, pressure group, and sub-basin category), where gas wells are vented directly to the atmosphere to expel liquids accumulated in the tubing, install a recording flow meter on the vent line used to vent gas from the well (e.g., on the vent line off the wellhead separator or atmospheric storage tank) according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b). Calculate the total emissions from well venting to the atmosphere for liquids unloading using equation W-7A to this section. Equation W-7A to this section must be used for each unloading type combination (automated plunger lift unloadings, manual plunger lift unloadings, automated unloadings without plunger lifts and manual unloadings without plunger lifts) for any tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin.


(i) Determine the well vent average flow rate (“FR” in equation W-7A to this section) as specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section for at least one well in a unique well tubing diameter group and pressure group combination in each sub-basin category.

Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from gas well and oil well venting during completions and workovers involving hydraulic fracturing using equation W-10A or equation W-10B to this section. Equation W-10A to this section applies to well venting when the gas flowback rate is measured from a specified number of example completions or workovers in a sub-basin and well type combination and equation W-10B to this section applies when the gas flowback vent volume is measured for each completion or workover in a sub-basin and well type combination. Completion and workover activities are separated into two periods, an initial period when flowback is routed to open pits or tanks and a subsequent period when gas content is sufficient to route the flowback to a separator or when the gas content is sufficient to allow measurement by the devices specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, regardless of whether a separator is actually utilized. If you elect to use equation W-10A to this section, you must follow the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If you elect to use equation W-10B to this section, you must use a recording flow meter installed on the vent line, downstream of a separator and ahead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback. To calculate emissions during the initial period, you must calculate the gas flowback rate in the initial flowback period as described in equation W-10B to this section. Alternatively, you may use a multiphase flow meter placed on the flow line downstream of the wellhead and ahead of the separator to directly measure gas flowback during the initial period when flowback is routed to open pits or tanks. If you use a multiphase flow meter, measurements must be taken from initiation of flowback to the beginning of the period of time when sufficient quantities of gas are present to enable separation. For either equation, emissions must be calculated separately for completions and workovers, for each sub-basin, and for each well type combination identified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. You must calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric and mass emissions as specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. If emissions from well venting during completions and workovers with hydraulic fracturing are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (n) of this section, report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n), and report additional information specified in § 98.236(g), as applicable.


(1) If you elect to use equation W-10A to this section on gas wells, you must use Calculation Method 1 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. If you are unable to measure the gas flowback rates using a recording flow meter for gas well completions or workovers as described in Calculation Method 1, for example due to field conditions, operating conditions, or health and safety considerations, you may use Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the value of FRM_s_ and FRM_i_. These values must be based on the flow rate for flowback gases, once sufficient gas is present to enable separation. The number of measurements or calculations required to estimate FRM_s_ and FRM_i_ must be determined individually for completions and workovers per sub-basin and well type combination as follows: Complete measurements or calculations for at least one completion or workover for less than or equal to 25 completions or workovers for each well type combination within a sub-basin; complete measurements or calculations for at least two completions or workovers for 26 to 50 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination; complete measurements or calculations for at least three completions or workovers for 51 to 100 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination; complete measurements or calculations for at least four completions or workovers for 101 to 250 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination; and complete measurements or calculations for at least five completions or workovers for greater than 250 completions or workovers for each sub-basin and well type combination.


(i) *Calculation Method 1*. You must use equation W-12A to this section as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section to determine the value of FRM_s_. You must use equation W-12B to this section as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section to determine the value of FRM_i_. The procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(v) and (vi) of this section also apply. When making gas flowback measurements for use in equations W-12A and W-12B to this section, you must use a recording flow meter (digital or analog) installed on the vent line, downstream of a separator and ahead of a flare or vent, to measure the gas flowback rates in units of standard cubic feet per hour according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b). Alternatively, you may use a multiphase flow meter placed on the flow line downstream of the wellhead and ahead of the separator to directly measure gas flowback during the initial period when flowback is routed to open pits or tanks. If you use a multiphase flow meter, measurements must be taken from initiation of flowback to the beginning of the period of time when sufficient quantities of gas are present to enable separation.


(ii) *Calculation Method 2 (for gas wells)*. You must use equation W-12A to this section as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section to determine the value of FRM_s_. You must use equation W-12B to this section as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section to determine the value of FRM_i_. The procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(v) and (vi) also apply. When calculating the flowback rates for use in equations W-12A and W-12B to this section based on well parameters, you must record the well flowing pressure immediately upstream (and immediately downstream in subsonic flow) of a well choke according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b) to calculate the well flowback. The upstream pressure must be surface pressure and reservoir pressure cannot be assumed. The downstream pressure must be measured after the choke and atmospheric pressure cannot be assumed. Calculate flowback rate using equation W-11A to this section for subsonic flow or equation W-11B to this section for sonic flow. You must use best engineering estimates based on best available data along with equation W-11C to this section to determine whether the predominant flow is sonic or subsonic. If the value of R in equation W-11C to this section is greater than or equal to 2, then flow is sonic; otherwise, flow is subsonic. Convert calculated FR_a_ values from actual conditions upstream of the restriction orifice to standard conditions (FR_s,p_ and FR_i,p_) for use in equations W-12A and W-12B to this section using equation W-33 to this section.


(iii) For equation W-10A to this section, calculate FRMs using equation W-12A to this section.


(iv) For equation W-10A to this section, calculate FRMi using equation W-12B to this section.


(v) For equation W-10A to this section, the ratio of gas flowback rate during well completions and workovers from hydraulic fracturing to 30-day gas production rate are applied to all well completions and well workovers, respectively, in the sub-basin and well type combination for the total number of hours of flowback and for the first 30 day average gas production rate for each of these wells.


(vi) For equations W-12A and W-12B to this section, calculate new flowback rates for well completions and well workovers in each sub-basin and well type combination once every two years starting in the first calendar year of data collection.


(vii) For oil wells where the gas production rate is not metered and you elect to use equation W-10A to this section, calculate the average gas production rate (PR_s,p_) using equation W-12C to this section. If GOR cannot be determined from your available data, then you must use one of the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(A) or (B) of this section to determine GOR. If GOR from each well is not available, use the GOR from a cluster of wells in the same sub-basin category.


(A) You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists.


(B) You may use an industry standard practice as described in § 98.234(b).


(2) For paragraphs (g) introductory text and (g)(1) of this section, measurements and calculations are completed separately for workovers and completions per sub-basin and well type combination. A well type combination is a unique combination of the parameters listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) Vertical or horizontal (directional drilling).


(ii) With flaring or without flaring.


(iii) Reduced emission completion/workover or not reduced emission completion/workover.


(iv) Oil well or gas well.

Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from each gas well venting during workovers without hydraulic fracturing using equation W-13A to this section. Calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions from each gas well venting during completions without hydraulic fracturing using equation W-13B to this section. You must convert annual volumetric natural gas emissions to CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric and mass emissions as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If emissions from gas well venting during completions and workovers without hydraulic fracturing are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (n) of this section, report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n), and report additional information specified in § 98.236(h), as applicable.

Calculate CO_2_ and CH_4_ blowdown vent stack emissions from the depressurization of equipment to reduce system pressure for planned or emergency shutdowns resulting from human intervention or to take equipment out of service for maintenance as specified in either paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section. You may use the method in paragraph (i)(2) of this section for some blowdown vent stacks at your facility and the method in paragraph (i)(3) of this section for other blowdown vent stacks at your facility. For industry segments other than natural gas distribution, equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet as determined in paragraph (i)(1) of this section are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section. Natural gas distribution blowdowns with a unique physical volume of less than 500 cubic feet as determined in paragraph (i)(1) of this section are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section. The requirements in this paragraph (i) do not apply to blowdown vent stack emissions from depressurizing to a flare, over-pressure relief, operating pressure control venting, blowdown of non-GHG gases, and desiccant dehydrator blowdown venting before reloading. If emissions from blowdown vent stacks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).


(1) *Method for calculating unique physical volumes or distribution pipeline physical volumes.* You must calculate each unique physical volume (including pipelines, compressor case or cylinders, manifolds, suction bottles, discharge bottles, and vessels) between isolation valves, in cubic feet, by using engineering estimates based on best available data. For natural gas distribution pipelines without isolation valves, calculate the unique physical volume of the distribution pipeline section that was isolated from operation by methods other than isolation valves, in cubic feet, by using engineering estimates based on best available data (e.g., diameter of the pipeline and length of isolated section).


(2) *Method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks according to equipment or event type*. If you elect to determine emissions according to each equipment or event type, using unique physical volumes as calculated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, you must calculate emissions as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and either paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section or, if applicable, paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section for each equipment or event type. Categorize equipment and event types for each industry segment as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(iv) of this section.

Calculate the total annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions for each equipment or event type by summing the annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ mass emissions for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment or event type.


(iii) For onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities and LNG import and export equipment, as an alternative to using the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, you may elect to sum the annual natural gas emissions as calculated using either equation W-14A or equation W-14B to this section for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment type or event type. Calculate the total annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric and mass emissions for each equipment type or event type using the sums of the total annual natural gas emissions for each equipment type and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.


(iv) Categorize blowdown vent stack emission events as specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section, as applicable.


(A) For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, LNG storage, LNG import and export equipment, and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segments, equipment or event types must be grouped into the following seven categories: Facility piping (*i.e.,* physical volumes associated with piping for which the entire physical volume is located within the facility boundary), pipeline venting (*i.e.,* physical volumes associated with pipelines for which a portion of the physical volume is located outside the facility boundary and the remainder, including the blowdown vent stack, is located within the facility boundary), compressors, scrubbers/strainers, pig launchers and receivers, emergency shutdowns (this category includes emergency shutdown blowdown emissions regardless of equipment type), and all other equipment with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple equipment types and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different equipment types, then categorize the blowdown event as the equipment type that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event.


(B) For the onshore natural gas transmission pipeline and natural gas distribution industry segments, pipeline segments or event types must be grouped into the following eight categories: Pipeline integrity work (*e.g.,* the preparation work of modifying facilities, ongoing assessments, maintenance or mitigation), traditional operations or pipeline maintenance, equipment replacement or repair (*e.g.,* valves), pipe abandonment, new construction or modification of pipelines including commissioning and change of service, operational precaution during activities (*e.g.* excavation near pipelines), emergency shutdowns including pipeline incidents as defined in 49 CFR 191.3, and all other pipeline segments with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple categories and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different categories, then categorize the blowdown event in the category that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event.


(3) *Method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks using a flow meter.* In lieu of determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks as specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, you may use a flow meter and measure blowdown vent stack emissions for any unique physical volumes determined according to paragraph (i)(1) of this section to be greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If you choose to use this method, you must measure the natural gas emissions from the blowdown(s) through the monitored stack(s) using a flow meter according to methods in § 98.234(b) and calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric and mass emissions measured by the meters according to paragraph (i)(4) of this section.


(4) *Method for converting from natural gas emissions to GHG volumetric and mass emissions.* Calculate both CH_4_ and CO_2_ volumetric and mass emissions using the methods specified in paragraphs (u) and (v) of this section.




(j) *Hydrocarbon liquids and produced water storage tanks.* Calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions from atmospheric pressure storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon liquids and CH_4_ emissions from atmospheric pressure storage tanks receiving produced water, from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities (including stationary liquid storage not owned or operated by the reporter), and onshore natural gas processing facilities as specified in this paragraph (j). For wells, gas-liquid separators, or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting or onshore natural gas processing non-separator equipment (*e.g.,* stabilizers, slug catchers) with annual average daily throughput of hydrocarbon liquids greater than or equal to 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ using Calculation Method 1 or 2 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section. For wells, gas-liquid separators, or non-separator equipment with annual average daily throughput of hydrocarbon liquids greater than 0 barrels per day and less than 10 barrels per day, calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions using Calculation Method 1, 2, or 3 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section. Annual average daily throughput of hydrocarbon liquids should be calculated using the flow out of the separator, well, or non-separator equipment determined over the actual days of operation. For atmospheric pressure storage tanks receiving produced water, calculate annual CH_4_ emissions using Calculation Method 1, 2, or 3 as specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section. If you are required to use the flash emissions modeling software in paragraph (j)(1) of this section for compliance with federal or state regulations, air permit requirements, or annual inventory reporting for the current reporting year, you must use Calculation Method 1 to calculate annual CH_4_ and, if applicable, CO_2_ emissions. For atmospheric pressure storage tanks routing emissions to a vapor recovery system or a flare, calculate annual emissions vented directly to atmosphere as specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 for gas-liquid separators sending hydrocarbon liquids to atmospheric pressure storage tanks, you must also calculate emissions that may have occurred due to hydrocarbon liquid dump valves not closing properly using the method specified in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. If emissions from atmospheric pressure storage tanks are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O emissions for the flare stack as specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).


(1) *Calculation Method 1.* For atmospheric pressure storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon liquids, calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions, and for atmospheric pressure tanks receiving produced water, calculate annual CH_4_ emissions, using operating conditions in the well, last gas-liquid separator, or last non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks. Calculate flashing emissions with a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS®, Bryan Research & Engineering ProMax®, or, for atmospheric pressure storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon liquids from gas-liquid separator or non-separator equipment, API 4697 E&P Tank, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state, models flashing emissions, and speciates CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions that will result when the hydrocarbon liquids or produced water from the well, separator, or non-separator equipment enter an atmospheric pressure storage tank. If you elect to use ProMax®, you must use version 5.0 or above. A minimum of the parameters listed in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section, as applicable, must be used to characterize emissions. If paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section indicate that an applicable parameter must be measured, collect measurements reflective of representative operating conditions for the time period covered by the simulation and at least at the frequency specified. Determine all other applicable parameters in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data and, if necessary, adjust parameters to represent the operating conditions over the time period covered by the simulation. Determine the number of simulations and associated time periods such that the simulations cover the entire reporting year (*i.e.,* if you calculate emissions using one simulation, use representative parameters for the operating conditions over the calendar year; if you use periodic simulations to cover the calendar year, use parameters for the operating conditions over each corresponding appropriate portion of the calendar year). If more than one simulation is performed, input parameters should be remeasured if no longer representative of operating conditions.


(i) Well, separator, or non-separator equipment temperature (must be measured at least annually if required as an input for the model).


(ii) Well, separator, or non-separator equipment pressure (must be measured at least annually if required as an input for the model).

You must sample and analyze sales or stabilized oil for API gravity, and hydrocarbon liquids or produced water for composition and Reid vapor pressure within six months of equipment start-up or by January 1, 2030, whichever is later, and at least once every five years thereafter. Until such time that a sample is collected, determine API gravity by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and determine composition and Reid vapor pressure by using one of the methods described in paragraphs (j)(1)(vii)(A) through (C) of this section. For produced water, you may instead elect to use a representative sales oil or stabilized hydrocarbon liquid API gravity and a hydrocarbon liquid composition and Reid vapor pressure, and assume oil entrainment of 1 percent or greater.


(A) If separator or non-separator equipment hydrocarbon liquids composition and Reid vapor pressure default data are provided with the software program, select the default values that most closely match your separator or non-separator equipment pressure first, and API gravity secondarily.


(B) If separator or non-separator equipment hydrocarbon liquids composition and Reid vapor pressure data are available through your previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of hydrocarbon liquids from the sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or from the county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting.


(C) Analyze a representative sample of separator or non-separator equipment hydrocarbon liquids in each sub-basin category for onshore petroleum and natural gas production or each county for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting for hydrocarbon liquids composition and Reid vapor pressure using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization.


(2) *Calculation Method 2.* For atmospheric pressure storage tanks receiving hydrocarbon liquids, calculate annual CH_4_ and CO_2_ emissions and for atmospheric pressure tanks receiving produced water, calculate annual CH_4_ emissions, using operating conditions in the well, last gas-liquid separator, or last non-separator equipment before liquid transfer to storage tanks and the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.


(i) Assume that all of the CH_4_ and, if applicable, CO_2_ in solution at well, separator, or non-separator equipment temperature and pressure is emitted from hydrocarbon liquids or produced water sent to atmospheric pressure storage tanks. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice as described in § 98.234(b) to sample and analyze hydrocarbon liquids or produced water composition at well, separator, or non-separator pressure and temperature. You must sample and analyze hydrocarbon liquids or produced water composition within six months of equipment start-up or by January 1, 2030, whichever is later, and at least once every five years thereafter. Until such time that a sample is collected, determine produced water composition by engineering estimate and process knowledge based on best available data, and determine hydrocarbon liquids composition by using one of the methods described in paragraphs (j)(1)(vii)(A) through (C) of this section. For produced water, you may instead elect to use a representative hydrocarbon liquid composition and assume oil entrainment of 1 percent or greater.

Determine recovered mass as specified in paragraph (j)(4)(ii) of this section.


(i) For an atmospheric pressure storage tank that routes any emissions to a vapor recovery system or a flare, calculate vented emissions as specified in paragraphs (j)(4)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.


(A) Calculate vented emissions as specified in paragraph (j)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, which represents the emissions from the atmospheric storage tank prior to the vapor recovery system or flare. Calculate an average hourly vented emissions rate by dividing the vented emissions by the number of hours that the tank was in operation.


(B) To calculate vented emissions during periods when the tank was not routing emissions to a vapor recovery system or a flare, multiply the average hourly vented emissions rate determined in paragraph (j)(4)(i)(A) of this section by the number of hours that the tank vented directly to the atmosphere. Determine the number of hours that the tank vented directly to atmosphere by subtracting the hours that the tank was connected to a vapor recovery system or flare (based on engineering estimate and best available data) from the total operating hours for the tank in the calendar year. If emissions are routed to a flare but the flare is unlit, calculate emissions in accordance with the methodology specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).




(C) During periods when a thief hatch is open and emissions from the tank are routed to a vapor recovery system or a flare, assume the capture efficiency of the vapor recovery system or a flare is 0 percent. A thief hatch is open if it is fully or partially open such there is a visible gap between the hatch cover and the hatch portal. To calculate vented emissions during such periods, multiply the average hourly vented emissions rate determined in paragraph (j)(4)(i)(A) of this section by the number of hours that the thief hatch is open. Determine the number of hours that the thief hatch is open as specified in paragraph (j)(7) of this section.




(D) Calculate vented emissions not captured by the vapor recovery system or a flare due to causes other than open thief hatches based on best available data, including any data from operating pressure sensors on atmospheric pressure storage tanks.

(ii) Using engineering estimates based on best available data, determine the portion of the total emissions estimated in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section that is recovered using a vapor recovery system. You must take into account periods with reduced capture efficiency of the vapor recovery system (*e.g.,* when a thief hatch is open) when calculating mass recovered as specified in paragraphs (j)(4)(i)(C) and (D) of this section.


(5) *Gas-liquid separator dump valves*. If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section, calculate emissions from occurrences of gas-liquid separator liquid dump valves that did not close properly during the calendar year by using equation W-16 to this section. Determine the total time a dump valve did not close properly in the calendar year (Tdv) as specified in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section.


(i) If a parametric monitor is operating on a controlled atmospheric pressure storage tank or gas-liquid separator, you must use data obtained from the parametric monitor to determine periods when the gas-liquid separator liquid dump valve is stuck in an open or partially open position. An applicable operating parametric monitor must be capable of logging data whenever a gas-liquid separator liquid dump valve is stuck in an open or partially open position, as well as when the gas-liquid separator liquid dump valve is subsequently closed. If an applicable parametric monitor is not operating, including during periods of time when the parametric monitor is malfunctioning, you must perform an audio, visual, and olfactory inspection of each gas-liquid separator liquid dump valve to determine if the valve is stuck in an open or partially open position, in accordance with paragraphs (j)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.


(A) Audio, visual and olfactory inspections must be conducted at least once in a calendar year.


(B) If stuck gas-liquid separator liquid dump valve is identified, the dump valve must be counted as being open since the beginning of the calendar year, or from the previous audio, visual, and olfactory inspection that did not identify the dump valve as being stuck in the open position in the same calendar year. If the dump valve is fixed following audio, visual, and olfactory inspection, the time period for which the dump valve was stuck open will end upon being repaired. If a stuck dump valve is identified and not repaired, the time period for which the dump valve was stuck open must be counted as having occurred through the rest of the calendar year.










(ii) [Reserved]


(6) *Mass emissions.* Calculate both CH_4_ and CO_2_ mass emissions from natural gas volumetric emissions using calculations in paragraph (v) of this section.


(7) *Thief hatches*. If a thief hatch sensor is operating on a controlled atmospheric pressure storage tank, you must use data obtained from the thief hatch sensor to determine periods when the thief hatch is open. An applicable operating thief hatch sensor must be capable of logging data whenever a thief hatch is open, as well as when the thief hatch is subsequently closed. If a thief hatch sensor is not operating but a tank pressure sensor is operating on a controlled atmospheric pressure storage tank, you must use data obtained from the pressure sensor to determine periods when the thief hatch is open. An applicable operating pressure sensor must be capable of logging tank pressure data. If neither an applicable thief hatch sensor nor an applicable pressure sensor is operating, including during periods of time when the sensors are malfunctioning, for longer than 30 days, you must perform a visual inspection of each thief hatch on a controlled atmospheric pressure storage tank in accordance with paragraph (j)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) For thief hatches on controlled atmospheric pressure storage tanks subject to the standards in § 60.5395b of this chapter, or an applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter, visual inspections must be conducted at least as frequent as the required audio, visual, and olfactory inspections described in § 60.5416b or the applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62. If the time between required audio, visual, and olfactory inspections described in § 60.5416b or the applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 is greater than one year, visual inspections must be conducted at least annually.


(ii) For thief hatches on controlled atmospheric pressure storage tanks not subject to the standards in § 60.5395b of this chapter, or an applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter, visual inspections must be conducted at least once in a calendar year.


(iii) If one visual inspection is conducted in the calendar year and an open thief hatch is found, assume the thief hatch was open for the entire calendar year or the entire period that the sensor(s) was not operating or malfunctioning. If multiple visual inspections are conducted in the calendar year, assume a thief hatch found open in the first visual inspection was open since the beginning of the year until the date of the visual inspection; assume a thief hatch found open in the last visual inspection of the year was open from the preceding visual inspection through the end of the year; assume a thief hatch found open in a visual inspection between the first and last visual inspections of the year was open since the preceding visual inspection until the date of the visual inspection.


(k) *Condensate storage tanks.* For vent stacks connected to one or more condensate storage tanks, either water or hydrocarbon, without vapor recovery, flares, or other controls, in onshore natural gas transmission compression or underground natural gas storage, calculate CH_4_ and CO_2_ annual emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage as specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) of this section. If emissions from compressor scrubber dump valve leakage are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O annual emissions as specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n).

You must document these periods and maintain records as specified in § 98.237 of the date when the non-conformance began, and the date when full conformance is re-established.


(2) *Pilot*. Continuously monitor for the presence of a pilot flame or combustion flame as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section or visually inspect for the presence of a pilot flame or combustion flame as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(ii) of this section, as applicable.. If you comply with tier 2, you must also use data collected according to paragraph (n)(2)(iii) of this section in your calculations of time the flare was unlit and the fraction of gas routed to the flare during periods when the flare was unlit. If you continuously monitor, then periods when the flare is unlit must be determined based on those data, except when contradicted by data collected according to paragraph (n)(2)(iii) of this section. Determine the fraction of the total volume that is routed to the flare during unlit periods as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(iv) of this section.


(i) At least once every five minutes monitor for the presence of a pilot flame or combustion flame using a device (including, but not limited to, a thermocouple, ultraviolet beam sensor, infrared sensor, video surveillance system, or advanced remote monitoring method) capable of detecting that the pilot or combustion flame is present at all times.


(A) Monitoring for the presence of a flare flame in accordance with § 60.5417b satisfies the requirement of this paragraph (n)(2).


(B) You may use multiple or redundant monitoring devices. When a discrepancy occurs between multiple devices, you must either visually confirm or use video surveillance output to confirm that the flame is present as soon as practicable after detecting the discrepancy to ensure that at least one device is operating properly. If you confirm that at least one device is operating properly, you may rely on the properly operating device(s) to monitor the flame.


(C) Continuous monitoring systems used for the presence of a pilot flame or combustion flame are not subject to a minimum accuracy requirement beyond being able to detect the presence or absence of a flame and are exempt from the calibration requirements of this part 98.

If all continuous monitoring devices are out of service for less than one week, then at least one visual inspection must be conducted during the outage. If a flame is not detected during a weekly visual inspection, assume the pilot has been unlit since the previous inspection or the last time the continuous monitoring device detected a flame, and assume that the pilot remains unlit until a subsequent inspection or continuous monitoring device detects a flame. If the monitoring device outage lasts more than 4 weeks, then you may switch to conducting inspections at least once per month in accordance with paragraph (n)(2)(ii) of this section.


(ii) As an alternative to continuous monitoring as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section, if you comply with tier 3 in paragraph (n)(1)(iii) of this section, at least once per month visually inspect for the presence of a pilot flame or combustion flame. You may also conduct visual inspections when using an alternative test method in accordance with paragraph (n)(1)(iv) of this section that allows visual inspections. If a flame is not detected, track the time since the previous inspection until a subsequent inspection detects a flame, and use this time in your calculation of the fraction of the total flow to the flare that was routed to the flare when the flare was unlit as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(iv) of this section. Use the sum of the measured flows, as determined from measurements obtained under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, during all time periods when the pilot was determined to be unlit, to calculate the fraction of the total annual volume that is routed to the flare when it is unlit.


(iii) For a flare subject to 40 CFR part 60 subpart OOOOb, or an applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter, a flare inspection conducted using an OGI camera during a fugitive emissions survey in accordance with § 60.5415b(f)(1)(x) constitutes a pilot flame inspection under this subpart. If a flame is not detected, track the time from the previous inspection until a subsequent inspection or continuous monitoring device detects a flame and use this time in your calculation of the fraction of the total flow to the flare that was routed to the flare when the flare was unlit as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(iv) of this section.


(iv) If you measure total flow to the flare in accordance with paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this section, calculate the fraction of the total annual volume that is routed to the flare when it is unlit using the actual flow during the unlit time periods that are tracked according to paragraph (n)(2)(i)(D), (ii), or (iii) of this section. If you determine flows of individual streams routed to the flare in accordance with paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section, use the stream-specific average flow rates for the streams routed to the flare during unlit times to calculate the fraction of the total annual volume that is routed to the flare when it is unlit.


(3) *Flow determination.* Calculate total flow to the flare as specified in paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this section or determine flow of each individual stream that is routed to the flare as specified in paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section. Use engineering calculations based on best available data and company records to calculate pilot gas flow to add to the total gas flow to the flare.


(i) Use a continuous parameter monitoring system to measure flow of gas to the flare downstream of any sweep, purge, or auxiliary gas addition. You may use either flow meters or indirectly calculate flow using other parameter monitoring systems combined with engineering calculations, such as line pressure, line size, and burner nozzle dimensions. If you use a continuous parameter monitoring system, you must use the measured flow in calculating the total flow volume to the flare. The continuous parameter monitoring system must measure data values at least once every hour.


(ii) Determine flow to the flare from individual sources, including sweep, purge, auxiliary fuel, and collective flow from offsite sources that route gas to the flare using any combination of the methods in paragraphs (n)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, as applicable. Adjust the volumes determined as specified in paragraphs (n)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section by any estimated bypass volumes diverted from entering the flare and leaks from the closed vent system in accordance with paragraphs (n)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section. Do not adjust the volumes routed to the flare for volumes diverted through bypass lines located upstream of the flow measurement or determination location.


(A) Use a continuous flow meter to measure the flow of gas from individual sources (or combination of sources) that route gas to the flare. If the emission streams for multiple sources are routed to a manifold before being combined with other emission streams, you may conduct the measurement in the manifold instead of from each source that is routed to the manifold. If you use a continuous flow meter, you must use the measured flow in calculating the total flow volume to the flare. The continuous flow meter must measure data values at least once every hour.


(B) If flow from a source is not measured using a continuous flow meter, then use methods specified in paragraphs (n)(3)(ii)(B)(1) through (*8*) of this section, as applicable.


(*1*) Determine flow of emission streams routed to flares from acid gas removal units using Calculation Method 3 or Calculation Method 4 as specified in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section.

(C) If the closed vent system that routes emissions to the flare contains one or more bypass devices that could be used to divert all or a portion of the gases from entering the flare, then you must determine when flow is diverted through the bypass and estimate the volume that bypasses the flare. The bypass volume may be determined based on engineering calculations, process knowledge, and best available data. Use the estimated bypass volume to adjust the volumes determined in accordance with paragraph (n)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section to determine the flow to the flare. For bypass volumes that are diverted directly to atmosphere, use the estimated volume in the calculation and reporting of vented emissions from the applicable source(s).


(D) If you determine a component in the closed vent system is leaking, you must adjust the flow determined in accordance with paragraph (n)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section by the estimated volume of the leak to determine the flow to the flare. Estimate the leak volume based on engineering calculations, process knowledge, and best available data. Report the estimated leak volume as vented emissions from the applicable source(s).


(4) *Gas composition.* Determine the composition of the inlet gas to the flare as specified in either paragraph (n)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, or determine composition of the individual streams that are combined and routed to the flare as specified in paragraph (n)(4)(iii) of this section. Use representative compositions of pilot gas determined by engineering calculation based on process knowledge and best available data.


(i) Use a continuous gas composition analyzer on the inlet gas to the flare burner downstream of any purge, sweep, or auxiliary fuel addition to measure annual average mole fractions of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentanes plus, and CO_2_.

The continuous gas composition analyzer must measure data values at least once every hour.


(ii) Take samples of the inlet gas to the flare burner downstream of any purge, sweep, or auxiliary fuel addition at least annually in which gas is routed to the flare and analyze for methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentanes plus, and CO_2_ constituents.

(A) Use a continuous gas composition analyzer to measure annual average mole fractions of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentanes plus, and CO_2_ constituents. If emission streams for multiple sources are routed to a manifold before being combined with other emission streams, you may measure gas composition in the manifold instead of from each source that is routed to the manifold. If you use a continuous gas composition analyzer, you must use the measured annual average mole fractions to calculate flared emissions for the stream. The continuous gas composition analyzer must measure data values at least once every hour.


(B) If composition is not measured in accordance with paragraph (n)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, then use methods specified in paragraphs (n)(4)(iii)(B)(*1*) through (*7*) of this section to determine composition, as applicable. When paragraphs (n)(4)(iii)(B)(*1*) through (*5*) reference continuous gas composition analyzer requirements in paragraph (u)(2) of this section, the requirements in paragraph (n)(4)(iii)(A) apply for the purposes of this paragraph (n)(4)(iii)(B). When paragraphs (n)(4)(iii)(B)(*1*) through (*5*) reference paragraph (u)(2) of this section, the language “your most recent available analysis” in paragraph (u)(2)(i) of this section means “annual samples” for the purposes of this paragraph (n)(4)(iii)(B).

(*4*) For onshore natural gas processing facilities, determine GHG mole fractions for all emission sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control based on samples of facility-specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems taken at least once per year according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b), and determine GHG mole fractions for all emission sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control based on samples of feed natural gas taken at least once per year according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b). For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, use the GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas liquid streams as determined from samples taken at least once per year. If multiple samples of a stream are taken in a year, use the arithmetic average GHG composition.

(3) *Calculation Method 2: Leaker measurement methodology.* For industry segments listed in § 98.230(a)(2) through (10), if equipment leaks are detected during surveys required or elected for components listed in paragraphs (q)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, you may elect to measure the volumetric flow rate of each natural gas leak identified during a complete leak survey. If you elect to use this method, you must use this method for all components included in a complete leak survey and you must determine the volumetric flow rate of each natural gas leak identified during the leak survey and aggregate the emissions by the method of leak detection and component type as specified in paragraphs (q)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.


(i) Determine the volumetric flow rate of each natural gas leak identified during the leak survey following the methods § 98.234(b) through (d), as appropriate for each leak identified. You do not need to use the same measurement method for each leak measured. If you are unable to measure the natural gas leak because it would require elevating the measurement personnel more than 2 meters above the surface and a lift is unavailable at the site or it would pose immediate danger to measurement personnel, then you must substitute the default leak rate for the component and site type from tables W-2, W-4, or W-6 to this subpart, as applicable, as the measurement for this leak.


(ii) For each leak, calculate the volume of natural gas emitted as the product of the natural gas flow rate measured in paragraph (q)(3)(i) of this section and the duration of the leak. If one leak detection survey is conducted in the calendar year, assume the component was leaking for the entire calendar year. If multiple leak detection surveys are conducted in the calendar year, assume a component found leaking in the first survey was leaking since the beginning of the year until the date of the survey; assume a component found leaking in the last survey of the year was leaking from the preceding survey through the end of the year; assume a component found leaking in a survey between the first and last surveys of the year was leaking since the preceding survey until the date of the survey. For each leaking component, account for time the component was not operational (*i.e.*, not operating under pressure) using an engineering estimate based on best available data.


(iii) For each leak, convert the volumetric emissions of natural gas determined in paragraph (q)(3)(ii) of this section to standard conditions using the method specified in paragraph (t)(1) of this section.

(v) For each leak, convert the GHG volumetric emissions at standard conditions determined in paragraph (q)(3)(iv) of this section to GHG mass emissions using the methods specified in paragraph (v) of this section.

(vii) Multiply the total CO_2_ and CH_4_ mass emissions by survey method and component type determined in paragraph (q)(3)(vi) of this section by the survey specific value for “k”, the factor adjustment for undetected leaks, where k equals 1.25 for the methods in § 98.234(a)(1), (3) and (5); k equals 1.55 for the method in § 98.234(a)(2)(i); and k equals 1.27 for the method in § 98.234(a)(2)(ii).






(viii) For natural gas distribution facilities:


(A) Use equation W-31 to this section to determine the meter/regulator run population emission factors for each GHG_i_ using the methods as specified in paragraphs (q)(2)(x)(A) and (B) of this section, except use the sum of the GHG volumetric emissions for each type of component required to be surveyed by the method used for the survey for which a leak was detected calculated in paragraph (q)(3)(iv) of this section rather than the emissions calculated using equation W-30 to this section.


(B) If you chose to conduct equipment leak surveys at all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations over multiple years, “n,” according to paragraph (q)(1)(viii) of this section, you must use the meter/regulator run population emission factors calculated according to paragraph (q)(3)(viii)(A) of this section and the total count of all meter/regulator runs at above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations to calculate emissions from all above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations using equation W-32B to this section.




(4) *Development of facility-specific component-level leaker emission factors by leak detection method.* If you elect to measure leaks according to Calculation Method 2 as specified in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, you must use the measurement values determined in accordance with paragraph (q)(3) of this section to calculate a facility-specific component-level leaker emission factor by leak detection method as provided in paragraphs (q)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.












(i) You must track the leak measurements made separately for each of the applicable components listed in paragraphs (q)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section and by the leak detection method according to the following three bins.




(A) Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(2)(i).


(B) Method 21 as specified in § 98.234(a)(2)(ii).


(C) Optical gas imaging (OGI) and other leak detection methods as specified in § 98.234(a)(1), (3), or (5).


(ii) You must accumulate a minimum of 50 leak measurements total for a given component type and leak detection method combination before you can develop and use a facility-specific component-level leaker emission factor for use in calculating emissions according to paragraph (q)(2) of this section (Calculation Method 1: Leaker emission factor calculation methodology).


(iii) Sum the volumetric flow rate of natural gas determined in accordance with paragraph (q)(3)(i) of this section for each leak by component type and leak detection method as specified in paragraph (q)(4)(i) of this section meeting the minimum number of measurement requirement in paragraph (q)(4)(ii) of this section.


(iv) Convert the volumetric flow rate of natural gas determined in paragraph (q)(4)(iii) of this section to standard conditions using the method specified in paragraph (t)(1) of this section.


(v) Determine the emission factor in units of standard cubic feet per hour component (scf/hr-component) by dividing the sum of the volumetric flow rate of natural gas determined in paragraph (q)(4)(iv) of this section by the total number of leak measurements for that component type and leak detection method combination.


(vi) You must update the emission factor determined in (q)(4)(v) of this section annually to include the results from all complete leak surveys for which leak measurement was performed during the reporting year in accordance with paragraph (q)(3) of this section.






(r) *Equipment leaks by population count.* This paragraph (r) applies to emissions sources listed in § 98.232(c)(21)(ii), (f)(7), (g)(5), (h)(6), (j)(10)(ii), (m)(3)(i), and (m)(4)(i) if you are not required to comply with paragraph (q) of this section and if you do not elect to comply with paragraph (q) of this section for these components in lieu of this paragraph (r). This paragraph (r) also applies to emission sources listed in § 98.232(i)(2) through (6), (j)(11), and (m)(5). To be subject to the requirements of this paragraph (r), the listed emissions sources also must contact streams with gas content greater than 10 percent CH_4_ plus CO_2_ by weight. Emissions sources that contact streams with gas content less than or equal to 10 percent CH_4_ plus CO_2_ by weight are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph (r) and do not need to be reported. Tubing systems equal to or less than one half inch diameter are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph (r) and do not need to be reported. Equipment leak components in vacuum service are exempt from the survey and emission estimation requirements of this paragraph (r) and only the count of these equipment must be reported. You must calculate emissions from all emission sources listed in this paragraph (r) using equation W-32A to this section, except for natural gas distribution facility emission sources listed in § 98.232(i)(3). Natural gas distribution facility emission sources listed in § 98.232(i)(3) must calculate emissions using equation W-32B to this section and according to paragraph (r)(6)(ii) of this section.


(1) Calculate both CH_4_ and CO_2_ mass emissions from volumetric emissions using calculations in paragraph (v) of this section.

Natural gas distribution facilities that do not have above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations are not required to calculate emissions for above grade metering-regulating stations and are not required to report GHG emissions in § 98.236(r)(2)(v).


(7) Onshore natural gas transmission pipeline facilities must use the appropriate default methane population emission factors listed in table W-5 to this subpart to estimate emissions from components listed in § 98.232(m)(3)(i), (4)(i) and (5).

(1) Offshore production facilities that report to BOEM's emissions inventory must calculate emissions as specified in paragraph (s)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.


(i) Report the same annual emissions calculated using the most recent monitoring and calculation methods published by BOEM as referenced in 30 CFR 550.302 through 304 for any reporting year that overlaps with a BOEM emissions inventory year and any other reporting year in which the BOEM's emissions reporting system is available and the facility has the data needed to use BOEM's emissions reporting system.


(ii) If BOEM's emissions reporting system is not available or if the facility does not have the data needed to use BOEM's emissions reporting system, adjust emissions from the most recent emissions calculated in accordance with paragraph (s)(1)(i), (s)(3), or (s)(4) of this section, as applicable, by using a ratio of the operating time for the facility in the current reporting year relative to the operating time for the facility during the reporting year for which emissions were calculated as specified in paragraph (s)(1)(i), (s)(3), or (s)(4) of this section, as applicable.


(2) Offshore production facilities that do not report to BOEM's emissions inventory must calculate emissions as specified in paragraph (s)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.

*(t) GHG volumetric emissions using actual conditions.* If equation parameters in § 98.233 are already determined at standard conditions as provided in the introductory text in § 98.233, which results in volumetric emissions at standard conditions, then this paragraph does not apply. Calculate volumetric emissions at standard conditions as specified in paragraph (t)(1) or (2) of this section, with actual pressure and temperature determined by engineering estimates based on best available data unless otherwise specified.

(i) *GHG mole fraction in produced natural gas for onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities.* If you have a continuous gas composition analyzer for produced natural gas, you must use an annual average of these values for determining the mole fraction. If you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer, then you must use an annual average gas composition based on your most recent available analysis of the sub-basin category or facility, as applicable to the emission source.


(ii) *GHG mole fraction in feed natural gas for all emissions sources upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control and GHG mole fraction in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing facilities.* For onshore natural gas processing plants that solely fractionate a liquid stream, use the GHG mole percent in feed natural gas liquid for all streams. If you have a continuous gas composition analyzer on feed natural gas, you must use these values for determining the mole fraction. If you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer, then annual samples must be taken according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b).


(iii) *GHG mole fraction in transmission pipeline natural gas that passes through the facility for the onshore natural gas transmission compression industry segment and the onshore natural gas transmission pipeline industry segment.* You may use either a default 95 percent methane and 1 percent carbon dioxide fraction for GHG mole fraction in natural gas or site specific engineering estimates based on best available data.

(y) *Other large release events.* Calculate CO_2_ and CH_4_ emissions from other large release events as specified in paragraphs (y)(2) through (5) of this section for each release that meets or exceeds the applicable criteria in paragraph (y)(1) of this section. You are not required to measure every release from your facility, but if you have EPA-provided notification(s) under the super emitter program in § 60.5371, 60.5371a, or 60.5371b of this chapter or an applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter or if EPA- or facility-funded monitoring or measurement data that demonstrate the release meets or exceeds one of the thresholds or may reasonably be anticipated to meet or exceed (or to have met or exceeded) one of the thresholds in paragraph (y)(1) of this section, then you must calculate the event emissions and, if the thresholds are confirmed to be exceeded, report the emissions as an other large release event. If you receive an EPA-provided notification under the super emitter program in § 60.5371, 60.5371a, or 60.5371b of this chapter or an applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter, you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (y)(6) of this section.


(1) You must report emissions for other large release events that emit GHG at or above any applicable threshold listed in paragraphs (y)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. You must report the emissions for the entire duration of the event, not just those time periods of the event emissions exceed the thresholds in paragraphs (y)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.


(i) For sources not subject to reporting under paragraphs (a) through (s), (w), (x), (dd), or (ee) of this section (such as but not limited to a fire, explosion, well blowout, or pressure relief), a release that emits methane at any point in time at a rate of 100 kg/hr or greater.


(ii) For sources subject to reporting under paragraphs (a) through (h), (j) through (s), (w), (x), (dd), or (ee) of this section, a release that emits methane at any point in time at a rate of 100 kg/hr or greater in excess of the emissions calculated from the source using the applicable methods under paragraphs (a) through (h), (j) through (s), (w), (x), (dd), or (ee) of this section. For a release meeting the criteria in this paragraph (y)(1)(ii), you must report the emissions as an other large release event and exclude the emissions that would have been calculated for that source during the timespan of the event in the source-specific emissions calculated under paragraphs (a) through (h), (j) through (s), (w), (x), (dd), or (ee) of this section, as applicable.


(2) Estimate the total volume of gas released during the event in standard cubic feet and the methane emission rate at any point in time during the event in kilograms per hour using measurement data according to § 98.234(b), if available, or a combination of process knowledge, engineering estimates, and best available data when measurement data are not available according to paragraphs (y)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.


(i) The total volume of gas released must be estimated as the product of the measured or estimated average flow or release rate and the estimated event duration. For events for which information is available showing variable or decaying flow rates, you must calculate the maximum natural gas flow or release rate during the event and either determine a representative average release rate across the entire event or determine representative release rates for specific time periods within the event duration. If you elect to determine representative release rates for specific time periods within the event duration, calculate the volume of gas released for each time period within the event duration as the product of the representative release rate and the length of the corresponding time period and sum the volume of gas released across each of the time periods for the full duration of the event. For events that have releases from multiple release points but have a common root cause (*e.g.*, over-pressuring of a system causes releases from multiple pressure relief devices), you must report the event as a single other large release event considering the cumulative volume of gas released across all release points.


(ii) The start time of the event must be determined based on monitored process parameters and sound engineering principles. If monitored process parameters cannot identify the start of the event, the event must be assumed to start on the date of the most recent monitoring or measurement survey that confirms the source was not emitting at or above the rates specified in paragraph (y)(1) of this section or assumed to have started 91 days prior to the date the event was first identified, whichever start date is most recent.


(iii) The end time of the event must be the date of the confirmed repair or confirmed cessation of emissions.


(iv) For the purposes of paragraph (y)(2)(ii) of this section, “monitoring or measurement survey” includes any monitoring or measurement method in § 98.234(a) through (d) as well as advanced screening methods such as monitoring systems mounted on vehicles, drones, helicopters, airplanes, or satellites capable of identifying emissions at the thresholds specified in paragraph (y)(1) of this section at a 90 percent probability of detection as demonstrated by controlled release tests. Audio, visual, and olfactory inspections are considered monitoring surveys if and only if the event was identified via an audio, visual, and olfactory inspection.


(v) For events that span two different reporting years, calculate the portion of the event's volumetric emissions calculated according to paragraph (y)(2)(i) of this section that occurred in each reporting year considering only reporting year 2025 and later reporting years. For events with consistent flow or for which one average emissions rate is used, use the relative duration of the event within each reporting year to apportion the volume of gas released for each reporting year. For variable flow events for which the volume of gas released is estimated for separate time periods, sum the volume of gas released across each of the time periods within a given reporting year separately. If one of the time periods span two different reporting years, calculate the portion of the volumetric emissions calculated for that time period that applies to each reporting year based on the number of hours in that time period within each reporting year.


(3) Determine the composition of the gas released to the atmosphere using measurement data, if available, or a combination of process knowledge, engineering estimates, and best available data when measurement data are not available. In the event of an explosion or fire, where a portion of the natural gas may be combusted, estimate the composition of the gas released to the atmosphere considering the fraction of natural gas released directly to the atmosphere and the fraction of natural gas that was combusted by the explosion or fire during the release event. Assume combustion efficiency equals destruction efficiency and assume a maximum combustion efficiency of 92 percent for natural gas that is combusted in an explosion or fire when estimating the CO_2_ and CH_4_ composition of the release. You may use different compositions for different periods within the duration if available information suggests composition varied during the release (*e.g.*, if a portion of the release occurred while fire was present and a portion of the release occurred when no fire was present).


(4) Calculate the GHG volumetric emissions using equation W-35 to this section.


(5) Calculate both CH_4_ and CO_2_ mass emissions from volumetric emissions using calculations in paragraph (v) of this section.


(6) If you receive an EPA-provided notification under the super emitter program in § 60.5371, 60.5371a, or 60.5371b of this chapter or an applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter, you must include the emissions from that source or event within your subpart W report unless you can provide certification as specified in either paragraph (y)(6)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, or unless the EPA has determined that the notification has a demonstrable error, as specified in paragraph (y)(6)(iii) of this section.


(i) If you do not own or operate any petroleum and natural gas system equipment within 50 meters of the location identified in the notification, you may prepare and submit the certification that the facility does not own or operate the equipment at the location identified in the notification.


(ii) If you own or operate petroleum and natural gas system equipment within 50 meters of the location identified in the notification, but there are also other petroleum and natural gas system equipment within 50 meters of the location identified in the notification owned and operated by a different facility, you may prepare and submit the certification that the facility does not own or operate the emitting equipment at the location identified in the notification if and only if you comply with all of the following requirements.


(A) Within 5 days of receiving the notification, complete an investigation of available data as specified in § 60.5371b(d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this chapter to identify the emissions source related to the event notification.


(B) If the data investigation in paragraph (y)(6)(ii)(A) of this section does not identify the emissions source related to the event notification, you must conduct a complete survey of equipment at your facility that is within 50 meters of the location identified in the notification following any one of the methods provided in § 98.234(a)(1) through (3) within 15 days of receiving the notification.


(C) The investigations and surveys conducted in paragraphs (y)(6)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section verify that none of the equipment that you own or operate at the location identified in the notification were responsible for the high emissions event.


(iii) For consideration of demonstrable error, you must submit a statement of demonstrable error as specified by § 60.5371, 60.5371a, or 60.5371b of this chapter or an applicable approved state plan or applicable Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter. You must report emissions associated with the notification unless the EPA has determined that the notification contained a demonstrable error.

Examples include natural gas that is not of pipeline quality, natural gas that has a higher heating value of less than 950 Btu per standard cubic feet, and natural gas that is not pipeline quality and does not meet the criteria of either paragraph (z)(2)(i)(B) or (C) of this section. Other examples include field gas that does not meet the definition of natural gas in § 98.238 and blends containing field gas that does not meet the definition of natural gas in § 98.238.


(ii) For fuels listed in paragraph (z)(3)(i) of this section, calculate combustion emissions for each unit or group of units combusting the same fuel using the applicable steps from paragraphs (z)(3)(ii)(A) through (G) of this section:


(A) You may use company records to determine the volume of fuel combusted in the unit or group of units during the reporting year.


(B) If you have a continuous gas composition analyzer on fuel to the combustion unit(s), you must use these compositions for determining the concentration of each constituent in the flow of gas to the unit or group of units. If you do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer on gas to the combustion unit(s), you may use engineering estimates based on best available data to determine the concentration of each constituent in the flow of gas to the unit or group of units. Otherwise, you must use the appropriate gas compositions for each stream going to the combustion unit(s) as specified in paragraph (u)(2) of this section.


(C) For reciprocating internal combustion engines or gas turbines, you may conduct a performance test following the applicable procedures in § 98.234(i) and calculate CH_4_ emissions in accordance with paragraph (z)(3)(ii)(G) of this section. Otherwise, you must calculate CH_4_ emissions in accordance with paragraphs (z)(3)(ii)(D) through (F) of this section.


(D) Calculate GHG volumetric emissions at actual conditions using equations W-39A and W-39B to this section:

(4) For each natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engine or gas turbine calculating emissions according to paragraph (z)(1)(ii) or (z)(2)(ii) of this section, you must determine a CH_4_ emission factor (kg CH_4_/MMBtu) using one of the methods provided in paragraphs (z)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. For each reciprocating internal combustion engine or gas turbine calculating CH_4_ emissions according to paragraph (z)(3)(ii)(G) of this section, you must determine a CH_4_ emission factor (kg CH_4_/MMBtu) using the method provided in paragraph (z)(4)(i).


(i) Conduct a performance test following the applicable procedures in § 98.234(i). If you are required or elect to conduct a performance test for any reason, you must use that result to determine the CH_4_ emission factors. If multiple performance tests are conducted in the same reporting year, the arithmetic average of all performance tests completed that year must be used to determine the CH_4_ emission factor.


(ii) Original equipment manufacturer information, which may include manufacturer specification sheets, emissions certification data, or other manufacturer data providing expected emission rates from the reciprocating internal combustion engine or gas turbine.


(iii) Applicable equipment type-specific emission factor from table W-7 to this subpart.


(5) Emissions from fuel combusted in stationary or portable equipment at onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, at onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, and at natural gas distribution facilities that are calculated according to the procedures in either paragraph (z)(1)(ii) or (z)(2)(ii) of this section must be reported according to the requirements specified in § 98.236(z) rather than the reporting requirements specified in subpart C of this part.

(aa) through (cc) [Reserved]


(dd) *Drilling mud degassing.* Calculate annual volumetric CH_4_ emissions from the degassing of drilling mud using one of the calculation methods described in paragraphs (dd)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. If you have taken mudlogging measurements from the penetration of the first hydrocarbon bearing zone until drilling mud ceases to be circulated in the wellbore, including mud pumping rate and gas trap-derived gas concentration that is reported in parts per million (ppm) or is reported in units from which ppm can be derived, you must use Calculation Method 1 as described in paragraph (dd)(1) of this section. If you have not taken mudlogging measurements, you must use Calculation Method 2 as described in paragraph (dd)(2) of this section. If you have taken mudlogging measurements for some, but not all, of the time the well bore has penetrated the first hydrocarbon bearing zone until drilling mud ceases to be circulated in the wellbore including mud pumping rate and gas trap-derived gas concentration that is reported in parts per million (ppm) or is reported in units from which ppm can be derived, you must use Calculation Method 3 as described in paragraph (dd)(3) of this section.


(1) *Calculation Method 1.* For each well in the sub-basin in which drilling mud was used during well drilling, you must calculate CH_4_ emissions from drilling mud degassing by applying an emissions rate derived from a representative well in the same sub-basin and within the equivalent stratigraphic interval. You must follow the procedures specified in paragraph (dd)(1)(i) of this section to calculate CH_4_ emissions for the representative well and follow the procedures in paragraphs (dd)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section to calculate CH_4_ emissions for every well drilled in the sub-basin and within the equivalent stratigraphic interval.


(i) Calculate CH_4_ emissions from mud degassing for one representative well in each sub-basin and within the equivalent stratigraphic interval. For the representative well, you must use mudlogging measurements, including gas trap derived gas concentration and mud pumping rate, taken during the reporting year. In the first year of reporting, you may use measurements from the prior reporting year if measurements from the current reporting year are not available. Use equation W-41 to this section to calculate natural gas emissions from mud degassing at the representative well. You must identify and calculate CH_4_ emissions for a representative well for the sub-basin and within the equivalent stratigraphic interval every 2 calendar years or on a more frequent basis. If a representative well is not available in the same sub-basin and within the equivalent stratigraphic interval, you may choose a well within the facility that is drilled into the same formation and within the equivalent stratigraphic interval.


(ii) Calculate the emissions rate of CH_4_ in standard cubic feet per minute from the representative well using equation W-42 to this section.


(iii) Use equation W-43 to this section to calculate emissions for any wells drilled in the same sub-basin and within the equivalent stratigraphic interval in the reporting year.


(iv) Calculate CH_4_ mass emissions using calculations in paragraph (v) of this section.


(2) *Calculation Method 2.* If you did not take mudlogging measurements, calculate emissions from mud degassing for each well using equation W-44 to this section:


(3) *Calculation Method 3*. If you have taken mudlogging measurements at intermittent time intervals for some, but not all, of the time the well bore has penetrated the first hydrocarbon bearing zone until drilling mud ceases to be circulated in the wellbore, you must use Calculation Method 1 to calculate emissions for the cumulative amount of time mudlogging measurements were taken and Calculation Method 2 for the cumulative amount of time mudlogging measurements were not taken. To determine total annual CH_4_ emissions for the well, add Mass_CH4,p_ calculated using Calculation Method 2 to E_s,CH4,p_, if the well is a representative well, or E_s,CH4,p_, if the well is not a representative well, calculated using Calculation Method 1.


(ee) *Crankcase venting.* For each reciprocating internal combustion engine with a rated heat capacity greater than 1 mmBtu/hr (or the equivalent of 130 horsepower), calculate annual CH_4_ mass emissions from crankcase venting using one of the methods provided in paragraphs (ee)(1) and (2) of this section. If you elect to use the method in paragraph (ee)(1) of this section, you must use the results of the direct measurement to determine the CH_4_ emissions. If any crankcase vents are routed to a flare, you must calculate CH_4_, CO_2_, and N_2_O emissions for the flare stack as specified in paragraph (n) of this section and report emissions from the flare as specified in § 98.236(n). Notwithstanding the calculation and emissions reporting requirements as specified in this paragraph (ee) of this section, the number of reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents routed to flares must be reported as specified in § 98.236(ee)(1).


(1) *Calculation Method 1.* Determine the CH_4_ mass emissions from reciprocating internal combustion engines annually using the method provided in paragraphs (ee)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. If you choose to use this method you must use it for all reciprocating internal combustion engines at the facility, well-pad site, or gathering and boosting site, except that if you choose to perform the screening specified in paragraph (ee)(1)(ii) of this section, you must use the method in paragraph (ee)(2) of this section to determine emissions from each reciprocating internal combustion engine that is not operating at the facility, well-pad site, or gathering and boosting site at the time of the screening.


(i) Determine the volumetric flow from the crankcase vent at standard conditions using an appropriate meter, calibrated bag, or high volume sampler according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b), (c), and (d), respectively. Each measurement must be conducted within 10 percent of 100 percent peak load. You may not measure during period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.


(ii) You may choose to use any of the methods set forth in § 98.234(a)(1) through (3) to screen for emissions. If emissions are detected using the methods set forth in § 98.234(a)(1) through (3), then you must use one of the methods specified in paragraphs (ee)(1)(i) of this section to determine the volumetric flow from the crank case vent at standard conditions. If emissions are not detected using the methods in § 98.234(a)(1) through (3), then you may assume that the emissions are zero. For the purposes of this paragraph, when using any of the methods in § 98.234(a)(1) through (3), emissions are detected whenever a leak is detected according to the method.


(iii) If conducting measurements for a manifolded group of crankcase vent sources, you must measure at a single point in the manifold downstream of all crankcase vent inputs and, if practical, prior to comingling with other non-compressor emission sources. Determine the volumetric flow at standard conditions from the common stack using one of the methods specified in paragraph (ee)(1)(i) of this section. If the manifolded group contains only crankcase vent sources, divide the measured volumetric flow equally between all operating reciprocating internal combustion engines. If the manifolded group contains crankcase vent sources and compressor vent sources, follow the methods for manifolded sources provided in paragraphs (o) or (p) of this section, as applicable, and report emissions from the crankcase vent as specified in § 98.236(o) or (p), as applicable.


(iv) Using equation W-45 to this section, calculate the annual volumetric CH_4_ emissions for each reciprocating internal combustion engine that was measured during the reporting year.


(v) You must calculate CH_4_ mass emissions from volumetric emissions using calculations in paragraph (v) of this section.


(2) Calculation Method 2. Calculate annual CH_4_ mass emissions from crankcase venting for each reciprocating internal combustion engine using equation W-46 to this section:
