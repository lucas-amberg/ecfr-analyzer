(iv) Total annual CH_4_ emissions, in metric tons CH_4_, from drilling mud degassing, calculated from summing the annual CH_4_ emissions calculated from § 98.233(dd)(3)(iii)(E) and § 98.233(dd)(3)(iv)(C).


(ee) *Crankcase vents.* You must indicate whether your facility performs any crankcase venting from reciprocating internal combustion engines. For all reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents, you must report the information specified in paragraph (ee)(1) of this section for each well-pad site (for onshore petroleum and natural gas production), gathering and boosting site (for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting), or facility (for all other applicable industry segments). For each reciprocating internal combustion engine that you conduct measurements as specified in § 98.233(ee)(1), you must report the information specified in paragraph (ee)(2) of this section. For reciprocating internal combustion engines with CH_4_ emissions calculated as specified in § 98.233(ee)(2), you must report the information specified in paragraph (ee)(3) of this section for each well-pad site (for onshore petroleum and natural gas production), gathering and boosting site (for onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting), or facility (for all other applicable industry segments).


(1) The information and number of reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents as specified in paragraphs (ee)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable. If a reciprocating internal combustion engine with crankcase vents was vented directly to the atmosphere for part of the year and routed to a flare during another part of the year, then include the engine in each of the applicable counts specified in paragraphs (ee)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section.


(i) Well-pad ID (for the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment only) or gathering and boosting site ID (for the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment only).


(ii) The total number of reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents.


(iii) The total number of reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents that operated and were vented directly to the atmosphere.


(iv) The total number of reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents that operated and were routed to a flare.


(v) The total number of reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents that were in a manifolded group containing a compressor vent source with emissions reported under paragraph (o) or (p) of this section.


(2) Reciprocating internal combustion engines with crankcase vents that calculate emissions according to § 98.233(ee)(1) must report the information specified in paragraphs (ee)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.


(i) For each measurement performed on a crankcase vent, report the information specified in paragraphs (ee)(2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section.

(B) Unique name or ID for the reciprocating internal combustion engine.


(C) Measurement date.


(D) Measurement method. If emissions were not detected when using a screening method, report the screening method. If emissions were detected using a screening method, report only the method subsequently used to measure the volumetric emissions.
