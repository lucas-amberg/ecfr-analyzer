# § 98.244   Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

(a) If you use CEMS to determine emissions from process vents, you must comply with the procedures specified in § 98.34(c).


(b) If you use the mass balance methodology in § 98.243(c), use the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section to determine feedstock and product flows and carbon contents.


(1) Operate, maintain, and calibrate belt scales or other weighing devices as described in Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices NIST Handbook 44 (2009) (incorporated by reference, see § 98.7), or follow procedures specified by the measurement device manufacturer. You must recalibrate each weighing device according to one of the following frequencies. You may recalibrate either at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer or biennially (*i.e.,* once every two years).


(2) Operate and maintain all flow meters used for gas and liquid feedstocks and products according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. You must calibrate each of these flow meters as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section:


(i) You may use either the calibration methods specified by the flow meter manufacturer or an industry consensus standard method. Each flow meter must meet the applicable accuracy specification in § 98.3(i), except as otherwise specified in §§ 98.3(i)(4) through (i)(6).


(ii) You must recalibrate each flow meter according to one of the following frequencies. You may recalibrate at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer, biennially (every two years), or at the interval specified by the industry consensus standard practice used.


(3) You must perform tank level measurements (if used to determine feedstock or product flows) according to one of the following methods. You may use any standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization or you may use an industry standard practice.

(4) Beginning January 1, 2010, use any applicable methods specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (xv) of this section to determine the carbon content or composition of feedstocks and products and the average molecular weight of gaseous feedstocks and products. Calibrate instruments in accordance with paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (xv) of this section, as applicable. For coal used as a feedstock, the samples for carbon content determinations shall be taken at a location that is representative of the coal feedstock used during the corresponding monthly period. For carbon black products, samples shall be taken of each grade or type of product produced during the monthly period. Samples of coal feedstock or carbon black product for carbon content determinations may be either grab samples collected and analyzed monthly or a composite of samples collected more frequently and analyzed monthly. Analyses conducted in accordance with methods specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (xv) of this section may be performed by the owner or operator, by an independent laboratory, by the supplier of a feedstock, or by a product customer.
