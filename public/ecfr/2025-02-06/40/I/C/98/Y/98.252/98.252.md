# § 98.252   GHGs to report.

You must report:


(a) CO_2_, CH_4_, and N_2_O combustion emissions from stationary combustion units and from each flare. Calculate and report the emissions from stationary combustion units under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the requirements of subpart C, except for emissions from combustion of fuel gas. For CO_2_ emissions from combustion of fuel gas, use either Equation C-5 in subpart C of this part or the Tier 4 methodology in subpart C of this part, unless either of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section are met, in which case use either Equations C-1 or C-2a in subpart C of this part. For CH_4_ and N_2_O emissions from combustion of fuel gas, use the applicable procedures in § 98.33(c) for the same tier methodology that was used for calculating CO_2_ emissions. (Use the default CH_4_ and N_2_O emission factors for “Fuel Gas” in Table C-2 of this part. For Tier 3, use either the default high heat value for fuel gas in Table C-1 of subpart C of this part or a calculated HHV, as allowed in Equation C-8 of subpart C of this part.) You may aggregate units, monitor common stacks, or monitor common (fuel) pipes as provided in § 98.36(c) when calculating and reporting emissions from stationary combustion units. Calculate and report the emissions from flares under this subpart.


(1) The annual average fuel gas flow rate in the fuel gas line to the combustion unit, prior to any split to individual burners or ports, does not exceed 345 standard cubic feet per minute at 60 °F and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute and either of the conditions in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section exist. Calculate the annual average flow rate using company records assuming total flow is evenly distributed over 525,600 minutes per year.


(i) A flow meter is not installed at any point in the line supplying fuel gas or an upstream common pipe.


(ii) The fuel gas line contains only vapors from loading or unloading, waste or wastewater handling, and remediation activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator.


(2) The combustion unit has a maximum rated heat input capacity of less than 30 mmBtu/hr and either of the following conditions exist:


(i) A flow meter is not installed at any point in the line supplying fuel gas or an upstream common pipe; or


(ii) The fuel gas line contains only vapors from loading or unloading, waste or wastewater handling, and remediation activities that are combusted in a thermal oxidizer or thermal incinerator.


(b) CO_2_, CH_4_, and N_2_O coke burn-off emissions from each catalytic cracking unit, fluid coking unit, and catalytic reforming unit under this subpart.


(c) CO_2_ emissions from sour gas sent off site for sulfur recovery operations under this subpart. You must follow the calculation methodologies from § 98.253(f) and the monitoring and QA/QC methods, missing data procedures, reporting requirements, and recordkeeping requirements of this subpart.


(d) CO_2_ process emissions from each on-site sulfur recovery plant under this subpart.


(e) [Reserved]


(f) CO_2_ and CH_4_ emissions from asphalt blowing operations under this subpart.


(g) CH_4_ emissions from equipment leaks, storage tanks, loading operations, delayed coking units, and uncontrolled blowdown systems under this subpart.


(h) CO_2_, CH_4_, and N_2_O emissions from each process vent not specifically included in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section under this subpart.




(i) [Reserved]
