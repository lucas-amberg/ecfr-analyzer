# ยง 98.253   Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) Calculate GHG emissions required to be reported in ยง 98.252(b) through (i) using the applicable methods in paragraphs (b) through (n) of this section.


(b) For flares, calculate GHG emissions according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. All gas discharged through the flare stack must be included in the flare GHG emissions calculations with the exception of the following, which may be excluded as applicable: gas used for the flare pilots, and if using the calculation method in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the gas released during start-up, shutdown, or malfunction events of 500,000 scf/day or less.








(1) Calculate the CO_2_ emissions according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this section.


(i) *Flow measurement.* If you have a continuous flow monitor on the flare, you must use the measured flow rates when the monitor is operational and the flow rate is within the calibrated range of the measurement device to calculate the flare gas flow. If you do not have a continuous flow monitor on the flare and for periods when the monitor is not operational or the flow rate is outside the calibrated range of the measurement device, you must use engineering calculations, company records, or similar estimates of volumetric flare gas flow.


(ii) *Heat value or carbon content measurement.* If you have a continuous higher heating value monitor or gas composition monitor on the flare or if you monitor these parameters at least weekly, you must use the measured heat value or carbon content value in calculating the CO_2_ emissions from the flare using the applicable methods in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B).


(A) If you monitor gas composition, calculate the CO_2_ emissions from the flare using either Equation Y-1a or Equation Y-1b of this section. If daily or more frequent measurement data are available, you must use daily values when using Equation Y-1a or Equation Y-1b of this section; otherwise, use weekly values.


(B) If you monitor heat content but do not monitor gas composition, calculate the CO_2_ emissions from the flare using Equation Y-2 of this section. If daily or more frequent measurement data are available, you must use daily values when using Equation Y-2 of this section; otherwise, use weekly values.


(iii) *Alternative to heat value or carbon content measurements.* If you do not measure the higher heating value or carbon content of the flare gas at least weekly, determine the quantity of gas discharged to the flare separately for periods of routine flare operation and for periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, and calculate the CO_2_ emissions as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(A) through (b)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.


(A) For periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, use engineering calculations and process knowledge to estimate the carbon content of the flared gas for each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction event exceeding 500,000 scf/day.


(B) For periods of normal operation, use the average higher heating value measured for the fuel gas used as flare sweep or purge gas for the higher heating value of the flare gas. If higher heating value of the fuel gas is not measured, the higher heating value of the flare gas under normal operations may be estimated from historic data or engineering calculations.


(C) Calculate the CO_2_ emissions using Equation Y-3 of this section.


(2) Calculate CH_4_ using Equation Y-4 of this section.


(3) Calculate N_2_O emissions using Equation Y-5 of this section.

Other catalytic cracking units and traditional fluid coking units must either install a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Combustion Sources), or follow the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section.


(i) Calculate CO_2_ emissions by following the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).


(ii) For catalytic cracking units whose process emissions are discharged through a combined stack with other CO_2_ emissions (*e.g.,* co-mingled with emissions from a CO boiler) you must also calculate the other CO_2_ emissions using the applicable methods for the applicable subpart (*e.g.,* subpart C of this part in the case of a CO boiler). Calculate the process emissions from the catalytic cracking unit or fluid coking unit as the difference in the CO_2_ CEMS emissions and the calculated emissions associated with the additional units discharging through the combined stack.


(2) For catalytic cracking units and fluid coking units with rated capacities greater than 10,000 barrels per stream day (bbls/sd) that do not use a continuous CO_2_ CEMS for the final exhaust stack, you must continuously or no less frequently than hourly monitor the O_2_, CO_2_, and (if necessary) CO concentrations in the exhaust stack from the catalytic cracking unit regenerator or fluid coking unit burner prior to the combustion of other fossil fuels and calculate the CO_2_ emissions according to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section:

(i) If you continuously or no less frequently than daily monitor the O_2_, CO_2_, and (if necessary) CO concentrations in the exhaust stack from the catalytic cracking unit regenerator or fluid coking unit burner prior to the combustion of other fossil fuels, you must calculate the CO_2_ emissions according to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section, except that daily averages are allowed and the summation can be performed on a daily basis.


(ii) If you do not monitor at least daily the O_2_, CO_2_, and (if necessary) CO concentrations in the exhaust stack from the catalytic cracking unit regenerator or fluid coking unit burner prior to the combustion of other fossil fuels, calculate the CO_2_ emissions from each catalytic cracking unit and fluid coking unit using Equation Y-8 of this section.

(5) Calculate N_2_O emissions using either unit specific measurement data, a unit-specific emission factor based on a source test of the unit, or equation Y-10 to this section.


(d) For fluid coking units that use the flexicoking design, the GHG emissions from the resulting use of the low value fuel gas must be accounted for only once. Typically, these emissions will be accounted for using the methods described in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). Alternatively, you may use the methods in paragraph (c) of this section provided that you do not otherwise account for the subsequent combustion of this low value fuel gas.


(e) For catalytic reforming units, calculate the CO_2_ emissions from coke burn-off using the applicable methods described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section and calculate the CH_4_ and N_2_O emissions using the methods described in paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this section, respectively.




(1) If you operate and maintain a CEMS that measures CO_2_ emissions according to subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), you must calculate CO_2_ emissions as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Other catalytic reforming units must either install a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part, or follow the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section.


(2) If you continuously or no less frequently than daily monitor the O_2_, CO_2_, and (if necessary) CO concentrations in the exhaust stack from the catalytic reforming unit catalyst regenerator prior to the combustion of other fossil fuels, you must calculate the CO_2_ emissions according to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

(f) For on-site sulfur recovery plants and for sour gas sent off site for sulfur recovery, calculate and report CO_2_ process emissions from sulfur recovery plants according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section, or, for non-Claus sulfur recovery plants, according to the requirements in paragraph (j) of this section regardless of the concentration of CO_2_ in the vented gas stream. Combustion emissions from the sulfur recovery plant (e.g., from fuel combustion in the Claus burner or the tail gas treatment incinerator) must be reported under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). For the purposes of this subpart, the sour gas stream for which monitoring is required according to paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section is not considered a fuel.


(1) If you operate and maintain a CEMS that measures CO_2_ emissions according to subpart C of this part, you must calculate CO_2_ emissions under this subpart by following the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). You must monitor fuel use in the Claus burner, tail gas incinerator, or other combustion sources that discharge via the final exhaust stack from the sulfur recovery plant and calculate the combustion emissions from the fuel use according to subpart C of this part. Calculate the process emissions from the sulfur recovery plant as the difference in the CO_2_ CEMS emissions and the calculated combustion emissions associated with the sulfur recovery plant final exhaust stack. Other sulfur recovery plants must either install a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C, or follow the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section, or (for non-Claus sulfur recovery plants only) follow the requirements in paragraph (j) of this section to determine CO_2_ emissions for the sulfur recovery plant.


(2) Flow measurement. If you have a continuous flow monitor on the sour gas feed to the sulfur recovery plant or the sour gas feed sent for off-site sulfur recovery, you must use the measured flow rates when the monitor is operational to calculate the sour gas flow rate. If you do not have a continuous flow monitor on the sour gas feed to the sulfur recovery plant or the sour gas feed sent for off-site sulfur recovery, you must use engineering calculations, company records, or similar estimates of volumetric sour gas flow.


(3) Carbon content. If you have a continuous gas composition monitor capable of measuring carbon content on the sour gas feed to the sulfur recovery plant or the sour gas feed sent for off-site for sulfur recovery, or if you monitor gas composition for carbon content on a routine basis, you must use the measured carbon content value. Alternatively, you may develop a site-specific carbon content factor using limited measurement data or engineering estimates or use the default factor of 0.20.


(4) Calculate the CO_2_ emissions from each on-site sulfur recovery plant and for sour gas sent off-site for sulfur recovery using Equation Y-12 of this section.


(5) If tail gas is recycled to the front of the sulfur recovery plant and the recycled flow rate and carbon content is included in the measured data under paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, respectively, then the annual CO_2_ emissions calculated in paragraph (f)(4) of this section must be corrected to avoid double counting these emissions. You may use engineering estimates to perform this correction or assume that the corrected CO_2_ emissions are 95 percent of the uncorrected value calculated using Equation Y-12 of this section.
