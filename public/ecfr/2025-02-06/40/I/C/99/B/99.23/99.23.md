# § 99.23   How will the transfer of negative net WEC emissions for facilities under the same parent company be determined?

(a) Subject to the requirements of this section, a WEC obligated party with a negative quantity of net WEC emissions, as calculated pursuant to § 99.22, may elect to transfer negative quantities of net WEC emissions to another WEC obligated party sharing the same parent company, as indicated in the annual WEC filing for the reporting year submitted pursuant to § 99.7 by each WEC obligated party involved in the transfer.


(b) Following each transfer, the net WEC emissions of the WEC obligated party transferring the negative quantities of net WEC emissions will increase by the quantity of metric tons of CH_4_ transferred and the net WEC emissions of the WEC obligated party receiving the transfer will decrease by this amount. In no case can the net WEC emissions of the WEC obligated party transferring the negative quantities of net WEC emissions become a positive value as a result of transfers.


(c) Each transfer of negative quantities of net WEC emissions must be submitted electronically in a format specified by the Administrator and must be approved by the designated representative of each WEC obligated party. Each transfer will designate the WEC obligated party making the transfer, the quantity of metric tons of negative emissions to transfer, and the WEC obligated party that is receiving the transfer. Each transfer must be initiated by the designated representative of the WEC obligated party that is transferring the negative quantities of net WEC emissions. The transfer shall be considered to have occurred at such time that the designated representative of the WEC obligated party that is receiving the transfer approves receipt of the transfer.


(d) Transfers may occur prior to the deadline for submission of the WEC filing under § 99.5, provided that all necessary information to determine net WEC emissions has been completed by both WEC obligated parties involved in the transfer. Transfers for a reporting year must be completed by the date specified in § 99.7(e).


(e) For transfers occurring after the deadline for submission of the WEC filing under § 99.5, the WEC obligated party receiving the transfer must follow the provisions of § 99.7(e) regarding WEC filing revisions and § 99.8(d) regarding resubmittals that result in a change in WEC obligation.


(f) If a WEC obligated party that previously transferred negative quantities of net WEC emissions to another WEC obligated party submits a revised WEC filing pursuant to § 99.7(e) that results in a change to that WEC obligated party's net WEC emissions, the validity of any previously transferred negative quantities of net WEC emissions will be assessed as follows:


(1) If the revised WEC filing results in a greater magnitude of negative quantities of net WEC emissions than in the prior WEC filing, those negative quantities of net WEC emissions are eligible for transfer subject to the requirements of this section.


(2) If the revised WEC filing results in a decrease or elimination of negative quantities of net WEC emissions compared to the prior WEC filing (*i.e.,* the WEC obligated party's net WEC emissions are closer to zero or a positive number), and the WEC obligated party had previously transferred negative quantities of net WEC emissions greater than the revised net WEC emissions, any previously transferred negative quantities of net WEC emissions will be invalidated such that the total quantity of remaining valid negative quantities of net WEC emissions does not exceed the revised net WEC emissions. Previously transferred negative quantities of net WEC emissions will be invalidated in the order that the transfers were approved by the designated representative of the WEC obligated party that received the transfer, beginning with the last transfer approved. Each WEC obligated party that received invalidated negative quantities of net WEC emissions must follow the provisions of § 99.7(e) regarding WEC filing revisions and § 99.8(d) regarding resubmittals that result in a change in WEC obligation.


(g) For each transfer of negative quantities of net WEC emissions between WEC obligated parties, the WEC obligated party that transferred negative quantities of net WEC emissions and the WEC obligated party that received negative quantities of net WEC emissions must maintain all records of the transaction, including any value exchanged, if applicable.


(h) Each transfer of net WEC emissions will be denominated in hundredths of a metric ton of methane (*i.e.,* 0.01 mt CH_4_) or larger order of magnitude.
