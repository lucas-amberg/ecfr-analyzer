# § 99.24   How will the WEC Obligation for a WEC obligated party be determined?

(a) If the net WEC emissions for a WEC obligated party as determined in § 99.22 and following any transfers pursuant to § 99.23 (*i.e.,* the net WEC emissions after transfers) are less than or equal to zero, the WEC obligated party's WEC obligation is zero and the WEC obligated party is not subject to a waste emissions charge in the reporting year for the WEC applicable facilities included in the calculation of the net WEC emissions as determined in § 99.22.


(b) If the net WEC emissions for a WEC obligated party as determined in § 99.22 and following any transfers pursuant to § 99.23 (*i.e.,* the net WEC emissions after transfers) are greater than zero, the WEC obligation will be calculated according to the applicable provisions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) For reporting year 2024, multiply the net WEC emissions after transfers by $900 per mt CH_4_ to determine the WEC obligation.


(2) For reporting year 2025, multiply the net WEC emissions after transfers by $1,200 per mt CH_4_ to determine the WEC obligation.


(3) For reporting year 2026 and each year thereafter, multiply the net WEC emissions after transfers by $1,500 per mt CH_4_ to determine the WEC obligation.
