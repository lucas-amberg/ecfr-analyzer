# § 99.42   What are the reporting requirements for the exemption for regulatory compliance?

(a) *Facilities that qualify to report.* For a WEC applicable facility that meets each of the criteria described in § 99.41(a) through (d) and elects to claim for exemption any emissions related to regulatory compliance, report the information as described in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, as applicable. The regulatory compliance exemption information shall be submitted as described in § 99.7.


(b) *Submission of reports.* For each WEC applicable facility report all of the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section, as applicable.


(1) For each WEC applicable facility, the final compliance date as determined in accordance with § 99.40(b)(3) and a certification that the facility meets all of the eligibility criteria in § 99.41.


(2) The ICIS-AIR ID (or Facility Registry Service (FRS) ID if the ICIS-AIR ID is not available) and the EPA Registry ID from CEDRI associated with each affected facility and designated facility that are located at the WEC applicable facility. For WEC applicable facilities in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segments, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, indicate the well-pad site ID(s) or gathering and boosting site ID(s), as reported to § 98.236 of this chapter, that is/are part of each affected facility and/or designated facility.


(3) If a report, or reports, prepared and submitted in accordance with part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan under part 62 of this chapter that implements the emission guidelines contained in part 60 of this chapter, cover the complete reporting year *(i.e.,* January 1 through December 31, inclusive), then submit as attachment(s) the applicable report(s). This report, or reports, must include all affected facilities or designated facilities that are located at the WEC applicable facility.


(4) If a report, or reports, prepared and submitted in accordance with part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan under part 62 of this chapter that implements the emission guidelines contained in part 60 of this chapter, does not cover the complete reporting year (*i.e.,* January 1 through December 31, inclusive), then submit as attachment(s) the applicable report(s). This report, or reports, must include all affected facilities or designated facilities that are located at the WEC applicable facility.


(5) For each report submitted under this section, provide an indication of whether the report indicates that at least one of the affected facilities subject to the requirements of part 60 of this chapter or designated facilities subject to the requirements of an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter that is contained within the WEC applicable facility does not meet the conditions of § 99.41(d)(1) or (2).


(6) For each report submitted under this section, indicate if the report includes one or more affected facilities or designated facilities that are not located at the WEC applicable facility. If so, indicate each such affected facility or designated facility. For each affected facility or designated facility, indicate if the affected or designated facility was part of the WEC applicable facility for part of the reporting year and transferred to another facility prior to December 31 of the reporting year or if the affected or designated facility was not part of the WEC applicable at any time during the reporting year.


(c) *Submission of incomplete or partial year reports.* If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, you are unable to provide an annual report covering the entire reporting year at the time of the initial submittal specified in § 99.5 for each affected facility or designated facility at the WEC applicable facility, you must provide a certification of the compliance status for each such affected facility or designated facility for the duration of time not covered by a report submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Additionally, you must provide a revised WEC filing within 30 calendar days of the date that an annual report covering the entire reporting year is required to be submitted under the applicable requirements of part 60 of this chapter or an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter. This requirement also applies in the case where the initial WEC filing contains an annual report covering only a portion of the reporting year. Within 30 calendar days of the date that an annual report is due under the applicable requirements of part 60 of this chapter or an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter for the portion of the reporting year for which a previously submitted report does not cover, you must provide a revised WEC filing including the subsequent annual report. The resubmission of the revised WEC filing shall be considered timely under this paragraph (c) if it is made within 30 calendar days of the date that the annual report is due under the applicable requirements of part 60 of this chapter or an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter. In such cases where a newly available report indicates that an affected facility or designated facility does not meet the conditions of § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) that were not previously indicated in the WEC filing for the reporting year (*i.e.,* the WEC applicable facility would no longer qualify for the regulatory compliance exemption for the given calendar quarter(s)), a WEC applicable facility would be required to complete the reporting requirements in § 99.42(d) and (e), as applicable, in the revised WEC filing and the emissions attributable to regulatory compliance exemption must be recalculated pursuant to § 99.43. The WEC obligated party must determine the WEC applicable emissions for the WEC applicable facility pursuant to subpart B of this part and follow the provisions of § 99.7(e) regarding WEC filing revisions and § 99.8(d) regarding resubmittals that result in a change in WEC obligation.


(d) *For reports that indicate a deviation or violation.* For each report submitted pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that indicates that at least one of the affected facilities subject to the requirements of part 60 of this chapter or designated facilities subject to the requirements of an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan in part 62 of this chapter that is contained within the WEC applicable facility does not meet the conditions for the exemption of all emissions in § 99.41(d)(1) and (2), report the following:


(1) The ICIS-AIR ID (or FRS ID if the ICIS-AIR ID is not available) and the EPA Registry ID from CEDRI associated with each affected facility and designated facility in the report that indicated a deviation or violation. For WEC applicable facilities in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segments, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, indicate the well-pad site ID(s) or gathering and boosting site ID(s), as reported to § 98.236 of this chapter, that is/are part of each affected facility and/or designated facility in the report that indicated a deviation or violation.


(2) For each calendar quarter during the reporting year report whether the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were met. For example, a report in which the only deviation indicated lasted from March 1 to April 30 in the reporting year would be reported as the first (*i.e.,* January to March) and second (*i.e.,* April to June) that the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were not met, and report for the third (*i.e.,* July to September) and fourth (*i.e.,* October to December) calendar quarters that the conditions were met.


(e) *Reporting for other large release events.* For a WEC applicable facility that reported one or more other large release events pursuant to § 98.236(y) of this chapter in the reporting year that occurred within or overlapped with a calendar quarter in which a deviation or violation was reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, for each other large release event that occurred within or overlapped a quarter in which the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were not met report the information specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) The unique release event identification number associated with the release event as reported pursuant to § 98.236(y)(2) of this chapter.


(2) The duration of the release event, based upon the start date and duration reported to § 98.236(y)(4) of this chapter, that occurred during calendar quarters in which the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were not met for any affected or designated facilities located at the WEC applicable facility, in days. For example, for a release event that lasted from March 1 to April 14 (*i.e.,* a total event duration of 45 days) at a WEC applicable facility in which there were reported deviations or violations in only the first calendar quarter (January through March, inclusive), the value reported under this paragraph would be 31 days.


(f) *Determination of compliance.* A WEC applicable facility's eligibility for the regulatory compliance exemption pursuant to this subpart does not constitute a determination of compliance for part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan under part 62 of this chapter that implements the emission guidelines contained in part 60 of this chapter, for any affected facility or designated facility present at the applicable facility.


(g) *Administrator or delegated authority determination of non-compliance.* A WEC applicable facility's eligibility for the regulatory compliance exemption during a given reporting year does not preclude reassessment of applicable WEC obligation for that applicable facility upon any determination by the Administrator or a delegated authority of any noncompliance with respect to any applicable methane requirements pursuant to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable approved State, Tribal, or Federal plan under part 62 of this chapter that implements the emission guidelines contained in part 60 of this chapter, for the affected facilities or designated facilities present at the applicable facility.


(h) *Reporting of quantification parameters.* Report the following information used to quantify methane emissions to be exempted due to the regulatory compliance exemption as specified in § 99.43.


(1) For a WEC applicable facility in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, report:


(i) The quantity of methane emissions at the WEC applicable facility qualifying for regulatory compliance exemption, in mt CH_4_, as determined using equation D-1A of § 99.43(b)(1) (E_RCE,CH4_)


(ii) The total quantity of methane emissions that qualified for exemption under both the regulatory compliance exemption and another exemption, in mt CH_4_, as determined using equation D-2A of § 99.43(c)(1) (E_OtherExempt_)


(iii) For each well-pad site or gathering and boosting site, as applicable, that was reported pursuant to § 98.236(aa)(1)(iv) or (aa)(10)(v) of this chapter, as applicable, for the reporting year, report:


(A) The well-pad site ID(s) or gathering and boosting site ID(s), as reported to § 98.236(aa)(1)(iv)(A) or (aa)(10)(v)(A) of this chapter, as applicable.


(B) An indication of whether any affected facilities or designated facilities at the site did not meet the conditions for the exemption of all emissions in § 99.41(d)(1) and (2) during the reporting year.


(C) If you report to paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(B) of this section that there were periods of time during which any affected facilities or designated facilities at the site did not meet the conditions for the exemption of all emissions in § 99.41(d)(1) and (2), for each calendar quarter in the reporting year report whether the conditions for the exemption of all emissions in § 99.41(d)(1) and (2) were met. For example, if the only deviation for any affected facilities or designated facilities at the site lasted from March 1 to April 30 report for the first (*i.e.,* January to March) and second (*i.e.,* April to June) that the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were not met, and report for the third (*i.e.,* July to September) and fourth (*i.e.,* October to December) calendar quarters that the conditions were met.


(D) If there were multiple reports submitted pursuant to paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section for an individual well-pad site (for the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment) or individual gathering and boosting site (for the onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment), the calendar quarters reported pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(C) of this section must reflect the periods of time in which the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were met for the well-pad site or gathering and boosting site, as applicable, in its entirety. For example, if two reports were submitted that together represent all of the affected and designated facilities at a well-pad site, and one report indicates deviation during only the first calendar quarter (*i.e.,* January to March) while the other report indicates deviation during only the second calendar quarter (*i.e.,* April to June), the information reported would be that for the first (*i.e.,* January to March) and second (*i.e.,* April to June) calendar quarters the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were not met, and for the third (*i.e.,* July to September) and fourth (*i.e.,* October to December) calendar quarters that the conditions were met.


(2) For a WEC applicable facility in an industry segment other than the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, report:


(i) The quantity of methane emissions at the WEC applicable facility qualifying for regulatory compliance exemption, in mt CH_4_, as determined using equation D-1B of § 99.43(b)(2) (E_RCE,CH4_)


(ii) The total quantity of methane emissions that qualified for exemption under both the regulatory compliance exemption and another exemption, in mt CH_4_, as determined using equation D-2B of § 99.43(c)(2) (E_OtherExempt_).


(iii) An indication of whether any affected facilities or designated facilities at the facility did not meet the conditions for the exemption of all emissions in § 99.41(d)(1) and (2) during the reporting year.


(iv) If you report to paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section that there were periods of time during which any affected facilities or designated facilities at the site did not meet the conditions for the exemption of all emissions in § 99.41(d)(1) and (2), for each calendar quarter in the reporting year report whether the conditions for the exemption of all emissions in § 99.41(d)(1) and (2) were met. For example, if the only deviation for any affected facilities or designated facilities at the facility lasted from March 1 to April 30 report for the first (*i.e.,* January to March) and second (*i.e.,* April to June) that the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were not met, and report for the third (*i.e.,* July to September) and fourth (*i.e.,* October to December) calendar quarters that the conditions were met.


(v) If there were multiple reports submitted pursuant to paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section for the WEC applicable facility, the calendar quarters reported pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(C) must reflect the periods of time in which the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were met for the WEC applicable facility in its entirety. For example, if two reports were submitted that together represent all of the affected and designated facilities at a well-pad site, and one report indicates deviation during only the first calendar quarter (*i.e.,* January to March) while the other report indicates deviation during only the second calendar quarter (*i.e.,* April to June), the information reported would be that for the first (*i.e.,* January to March) and second (*i.e.,* April to June) calendar quarters the conditions in § 99.41(d)(1) or (2) were not met, and for the third (*i.e.,* July to September) and fourth (*i.e.,* October to December) calendar quarters that the conditions were met.
