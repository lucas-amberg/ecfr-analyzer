The Administrator may provide official recognition to industrial organizations and political subdivisions of States which during the preceding year demonstrated an outstanding technological achievement or an innovative process, method or device in their waste treatment and pollution abatement programs. The wastewater management programs can generally be characterized as waste treatment and/or pollution abatement programs. Individual EPA Regional Administrators (and Regional officials they may designate) also may conduct Regional CWA Recognition Awards Programs according to and consistent with the provisions of this part.
