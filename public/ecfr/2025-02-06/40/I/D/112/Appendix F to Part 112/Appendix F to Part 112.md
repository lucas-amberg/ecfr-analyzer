# Appendix F to Part 112—Facility-Specific Response Plan


(A) Owners or operators of facilities regulated under this part which pose a threat of substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on navigable waters or adjoining shorelines are required to prepare and submit facility-specific response plans to EPA in accordance with the provisions in this appendix. This appendix further describes the required elements in § 112.20(h). 


(B) Response plans must be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional office. Figure F-1 of this Appendix lists each EPA Regional office and the address where owners or operators must submit their response plans. Those facilities deemed by the Regional Administrator (RA) to pose a threat of significant and substantial harm to the environment will have their plans reviewed and approved by EPA. In certain cases, information required in the model response plan is similar to information currently maintained in the facility's Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan as required by 40 CFR 112.3. In these cases, owners or operators may reproduce the information and include a photocopy in the response plan. 


(C) A complex may develop a single response plan with a set of core elements for all regulating agencies and separate sections for the non-transportation-related and transportation-related components, as described in § 112.20(h). Owners or operators of large facilities that handle, store, or transport oil at more than one geographically distinct location (e.g., oil storage areas at opposite ends of a single, continuous parcel of property) shall, as appropriate, develop separate sections of the response plan for each storage area. 


Several sections of the response plan shall be co-located for easy access by response personnel during an actual emergency or oil discharge. This collection of sections shall be called the Emergency Response Action Plan. The Agency intends that the Action Plan contain only as much information as is necessary to combat the discharge and be arranged so response actions are not delayed. The Action Plan may be arranged in a number of ways. For example, the sections of the Emergency Response Action Plan may be photocopies or condensed versions of the forms included in the associated sections of the response plan. Each Emergency Response Action Plan section may be tabbed for quick reference. The Action Plan shall be maintained in the front of the same binder that contains the complete response plan or it shall be contained in a separate binder. In the latter case, both binders shall be kept together so that the entire plan can be accessed by the qualified individual and appropriate spill response personnel. The Emergency Response Action Plan shall be made up of the following sections:


The facility information form is designed to provide an overview of the site and a description of past activities at the facility. Much of the information required by this section may be obtained from the facility's existing SPCC Plan. 


1.2.1 *Facility name and location:* Enter facility name and street address. Enter the address of corporate headquarters only if corporate headquarters are physically located at the facility. Include city, county, state, zip code, and phone number. 


1.2.2 *Latitude and Longitude:* Enter the latitude and longitude of the facility. Include degrees, minutes, and seconds of the main entrance of the facility. 


1.2.3 *Wellhead Protection Area:* Indicate if the facility is located in or drains into a wellhead protection area as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1986 (SDWA). 
1 The response plan requirements in the Wellhead Protection Program are outlined by the State or Territory in which the facility resides.


1.2.4 *Owner/operator:* Write the name of the company or person operating the facility and the name of the person or company that owns the facility, if the two are different. List the address of the owner, if the two are different. 


1.2.5 *Qualified Individual:* Write the name of the qualified individual for the entire facility. If more than one person is listed, each individual indicated in this section shall have full authority to implement the facility response plan. For each individual, list: name, position, home and work addresses (street addresses, not P.O. boxes), emergency phone number, and specific response training experience. 


1.2.6 *Date of Oil Storage Start-up:* Enter the year which the present facility first started storing oil. 


1.2.7 *Current Operation:* Briefly describe the facility's operations and include the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code. 


1.2.8 *Dates and Type of Substantial Expansion:* Include information on expansions that have occurred at the facility. Examples of such expansions include, but are not limited to: Throughput expansion, addition of a product line, change of a product line, and installation of additional oil storage capacity. The data provided shall include all facility historical information and detail the expansion of the facility. An example of substantial expansion is any material alteration of the facility which causes the owner or operator of the facility to re-evaluate and increase the response equipment necessary to adequately respond to a worst case discharge from the facility. 


  (if different from Facility Address)


(A) The information provided in this section shall describe what will be needed in an actual emergency involving the discharge of oil or a combination of hazardous substances and oil discharge. The Emergency Response Information section of the plan must include the following components:


(1) The information provided in the Emergency Notification Phone List in section 1.3.1 identifies and prioritizes the names and phone numbers of the organizations and personnel that need to be notified immediately in the event of an emergency. This section shall include all the appropriate phone numbers for the facility. These numbers must be verified each time the plan is updated. The contact list must be accessible to all facility employees to ensure that, in case of a discharge, any employee on site could immediately notify the appropriate parties.


(2) The Spill Response Notification Form in section 1.3.1 creates a checklist of information that shall be provided to the National Response Center (NRC) and other response personnel. All information on this checklist must be known at the time of notification, or be in the process of being collected. This notification form is based on a similar form used by the NRC. Note: Do not delay spill notification to collect the information on the list.


(3) Section 1.3.2 provides a description of the facility's list of emergency response equipment and location of the response equipment. When appropriate, the amount of oil that emergency response equipment can handle and any limitations (e.g., launching sites) must be described.


(4) Section 1.3.3 provides information regarding response equipment tests and deployment drills. Response equipment deployment exercises shall be conducted to ensure that response equipment is operational and the personnel who would operate the equipment in a spill response are capable of deploying and operating it. Only a representative sample of each type of response equipment needs to be deployed and operated, as long as the remainder is properly maintained. If appropriate, testing of response equipment may be conducted while it is being deployed. Facilities without facility-owned response equipment must ensure that the oil spill removal organization that is identified in the response plan to provide this response equipment certifies that the deployment exercises have been met. Refer to the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) Guidelines (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability), which satisfy Oil Pollution Act (OPA) response exercise requirements.


(5) Section 1.3.4 lists the facility response personnel, including those employed by the facility and those under contract to the facility for response activities, the amount of time needed for personnel to respond, their responsibility in the case of an emergency, and their level of response training. Three different forms are included in this section. The Emergency Response Personnel List shall be composed of all personnel employed by the facility whose duties involve responding to emergencies, including oil discharges, even when they are not physically present at the site. An example of this type of person would be the Building Engineer-in-Charge or Plant Fire Chief. The second form is a list of the Emergency Response Contractors (both primary and secondary) retained by the facility. Any changes in contractor status must be reflected in updates to the response plan. Evidence of contracts with response contractors shall be included in this section so that the availability of resources can be verified. The last form is the Facility Response Team List, which shall be composed of both emergency response personnel (referenced by job title/position) and emergency response contractors, included in one of the two lists described above, that will respond immediately upon discovery of an oil discharge or other emergency (i.e., the first people to respond). These are to be persons normally on the facility premises or primary response contractors. Examples of these personnel would be the Facility Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Spill Team 1, Facility Fire Engine Company 1, Production Supervisor, or Transfer Supervisor. Company personnel must be able to respond immediately and adequately if contractor support is not available. 


(6) Section 1.3.5 lists factors that must, as appropriate, be considered when preparing an evacuation plan. 


(7) Section 1.3.6 references the responsibilities of the qualified individual for the facility in the event of an emergency.


(B) The information provided in the emergency response section will aid in the assessment of the facility's ability to respond to a worst case discharge and will identify additional assistance that may be needed. In addition, the facility owner or operator may want to produce a wallet-size card containing a checklist of the immediate response and notification steps to be taken in the event of an oil discharge.

1.3.5.1 Based on the analysis of the facility, as discussed elsewhere in the plan, a facility-wide evacuation plan shall be developed. In addition, plans to evacuate parts of the facility that are at a high risk of exposure in the event of a discharge or other release must be developed. Evacuation routes must be shown on a diagram of the facility (see section 1.9 of this appendix). When developing evacuation plans, consideration must be given to the following factors, as appropriate:


(1) Location of stored materials; 


(2) Hazard imposed by discharged material; 


(3) Discharge flow direction; 


(4) Prevailing wind direction and speed; 


(5) Water currents, tides, or wave conditions (if applicable); 


(6) Arrival route of emergency response personnel and response equipment; 


(7) Evacuation routes; 


(8) Alternative routes of evacuation; 


(9) Transportation of injured personnel to nearest emergency medical facility; 


(10) Location of alarm/notification systems; 


(11) The need for a centralized check-in area for evacuation validation (roll call); 


(12) Selection of a mitigation command center; and 


(13) Location of shelter at the facility as an alternative to evacuation. 


1.3.5.2 One resource that may be helpful to owners or operators in preparing this section of the response plan is The *Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures* by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Transportation (DOT), and EPA. *The Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures* is available from: FEMA , Publication Office, 500 C. Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646-3484.


1.3.5.3 As specified in § 112.20(h)(1)(vi), the facility owner or operator must reference existing community evacuation plans, as appropriate. 


The duties of the designated qualified individual are specified in § 112.20(h)(3)(ix). The qualified individual's duties must be described and be consistent with the minimum requirements in § 112.20(h)(3)(ix). In addition, the qualified individual must be identified with the Facility Information in section 1.2 of the response plan. 


This section requires the facility owner or operator to examine the facility's operations closely and to predict where discharges could occur. Hazard evaluation is a widely used industry practice that allows facility owners or operators to develop a complete understanding of potential hazards and the response actions necessary to address these hazards. *The Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures,* prepared by the EPA, DOT, and the FEMA and the *Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning Guide* (NRT-1), prepared by the National Response Team are good references for conducting a hazard analysis. Hazard identification and evaluation will assist facility owners or operators in planning for potential discharges, thereby reducing the severity of discharge impacts that may occur in the future. The evaluation also may help the operator identify and correct potential sources of discharges. In addition, special hazards to workers and emergency response personnel's health and safety shall be evaluated, as well as the facility's oil spill history. 


The Tank and Surface Impoundment (SI) forms, or their equivalent, that are part of this section must be completed according to the directions below. (“Surface Impoundment” means a facility or part of a facility which is a natural topographic depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquid wastes or wastes containing free liquids, and which is not an injection well or a seepage facility.) Similar worksheets, or their equivalent, must be developed for any other type of storage containers. 


(1) List each tank at the facility with a separate and distinct identifier. Begin aboveground tank identifiers with an “A” and belowground tank identifiers with a “B”, or submit multiple sheets with the aboveground tanks and belowground tanks on separate sheets. 


(2) Use gallons for the maximum capacity of a tank; and use square feet for the area. 


(3) Using the appropriate identifiers and the following instructions, fill in the appropriate forms: 


(a) Tank or SI number—Using the aforementioned identifiers (A or B) or multiple reporting sheets, identify each tank or SI at the facility that stores oil or hazardous materials. 


(b) Substance Stored—For each tank or SI identified, record the material that is stored therein. If the tank or SI is used to store more than one material, list all of the stored materials. 


(c) Quantity Stored—For each material stored in each tank or SI, report the average volume of material stored on any given day. 


(d) Tank Type or Surface Area/Year—For each tank, report the type of tank (e.g., floating top), and the year the tank was originally installed. If the tank has been refabricated, the year that the latest refabrication was completed must be recorded in parentheses next to the year installed. For each SI, record the surface area of the impoundment and the year it went into service. 


(e) Maximum Capacity—Record the operational maximum capacity for each tank and SI. If the maximum capacity varies with the season, record the upper and lower limits. 


(f) Failure/Cause—Record the cause and date of any tank or SI failure which has resulted in a loss of tank or SI contents. 


(4) Using the numbers from the tank and SI forms, label a schematic drawing of the facility. This drawing shall be identical to any schematic drawings included in the SPCC Plan. 


(5) Using knowledge of the facility and its operations, describe the following in writing: 


(a) The loading and unloading of transportation vehicles that risk the discharge of oil or release of hazardous substances during transport processes. These operations may include loading and unloading of trucks, railroad cars, or vessels. Estimate the volume of material involved in transfer operations, if the exact volume cannot be determined. 


(b) Day-to-day operations that may present a risk of discharging oil or releasing a hazardous substance. These activities include scheduled venting, piping repair or replacement, valve maintenance, transfer of tank contents from one tank to another, etc. (not including transportation-related activities). Estimate the volume of material involved in these operations, if the exact volume cannot be determined. 


(c) The secondary containment volume associated with each tank and/or transfer point at the facility. The numbering scheme developed on the tables, or an equivalent system, must be used to identify each containment area. Capacities must be listed for each individual unit (tanks, slumps, drainage traps, and ponds), as well as the facility total. 


(d) Normal daily throughput for the facility and any effect on potential discharge volumes that a negative or positive change in that throughput may cause.


The vulnerability analysis shall address the potential effects (i.e., to human health, property, or the environment) of an oil discharge. Attachment C-III to Appendix C to this part provides a method that owners or operators shall use to determine appropriate distances from the facility to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. Owners or operators can use a comparable formula that is considered acceptable by the RA. If a comparable formula is used, documentation of the reliability and analytical soundness of the formula must be attached to the response plan cover sheet. This analysis must be prepared for each facility and, as appropriate, must discuss the vulnerability of: 


(1) Water intakes (drinking, cooling, or other); 


(2) Schools; 


(3) Medical facilities; 


(4) Residential areas; 


(5) Businesses; 


(6) Wetlands or other sensitive environments; 
2

(7) Fish and wildlife;


(8) Lakes and streams; 


(9) Endangered flora and fauna; 


(10) Recreational areas; 


(11) Transportation routes (air, land, and water); 


(12) Utilities; and 


(13) Other areas of economic importance (e.g., beaches, marinas) including terrestrially sensitive environments, aquatic environments, and unique habitats. 


Each owner or operator shall analyze the probability of a discharge occurring at the facility. This analysis shall incorporate factors such as oil discharge history, horizontal range of a potential discharge, and vulnerability to natural disaster, and shall, as appropriate, incorporate other factors such as tank age. This analysis will provide information for developing discharge scenarios for a worst case discharge and small and medium discharges and aid in the development of techniques to reduce the size and frequency of discharges. The owner or operator may need to research the age of the tanks the oil discharge history at the facility.


Briefly describe the facility's reportable oil spill 
3 history for the entire life of the facility to the extent that such information is reasonably identifiable, including:


(1) Date of discharge(s); 


(2) List of discharge causes; 


(3) Material(s) discharged; 


(4) Amount discharged in gallons; 


(5) Amount of discharge that reached navigable waters, if applicable; 


(6) Effectiveness and capacity of secondary containment; 


(7) Clean-up actions taken; 


(8) Steps taken to reduce possibility of recurrence; 


(9) Total oil storage capacity of the tank(s) or impoundment(s) from which the material discharged; 


(10) Enforcement actions; 


(11) Effectiveness of monitoring equipment; and 


(12) Description(s) of how each oil discharge was detected.


In this section, the owner or operator is required to provide a description of the facility's worst case discharge, as well as a small and medium discharge, as appropriate. A multi-level planning approach has been chosen because the response actions to a discharge (*i.e.*, necessary response equipment, products, and personnel) are dependent on the magnitude of the discharge. Planning for lesser discharges is necessary because the nature of the response may be qualitatively different depending on the quantity of the discharge. The facility owner or operator shall discuss the potential direction of the discharge pathway. 


1.5.1.1 To address multi-level planning requirements, the owner or operator must consider types of facility-specific discharge scenarios that may contribute to a small or medium discharge. The scenarios shall account for all the operations that take place at the facility, including but not limited to: 


(1) Loading and unloading of surface transportation; 


(2) Facility maintenance; 


(3) Facility piping; 


(4) Pumping stations and sumps; 


(5) Oil storage tanks; 


(6) Vehicle refueling; and 


(7) Age and condition of facility and components. 


1.5.1.2 The scenarios shall also consider factors that affect the response efforts required by the facility. These include but are not limited to: 


(1) Size of the discharge; 


(2) Proximity to downgradient wells, waterways, and drinking water intakes;


(3) Proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments; 


(4) Likelihood that the discharge will travel offsite (*i.e.,* topography, drainage); 


(5) Location of the material discharged (*i.e.,* on a concrete pad or directly on the soil); 


(6) Material discharged; 


(7) Weather or aquatic conditions (*i.e.,* river flow); 


(8) Available remediation equipment; 


(9) Probability of a chain reaction of failures; and


(10) Direction of discharge pathway. 


1.5.2.1 In this section, the owner or operator must identify the worst case discharge volume at the facility. Worksheets for production and non-production facility owners or operators to use when calculating worst case discharge are presented in appendix D to this part. When planning for the worst case discharge response, all of the aforementioned factors listed in the small and medium discharge section of the response plan shall be addressed.


1.5.2.2 For onshore storage facilities and production facilities, permanently manifolded oil storage tanks are defined as tanks that are designed, installed, and/or operated in such a manner that the multiple tanks function as one storage unit (i.e., multiple tank volumes are equalized). In this section of the response plan, owners or operators must provide evidence that oil storage tanks with common piping or piping systems are not operated as one unit. If such evidence is provided and is acceptable to the RA, the worst case discharge volume shall be based on the combined oil storage capacity of all manifold tanks or the oil storage capacity of the largest single oil storage tank within the secondary containment area, whichever is greater. For permanently manifolded oil storage tanks that function as one storage unit, the worst case discharge shall be based on the combined oil storage capacity of all manifolded tanks or the oil storage capacity of the largest single tank within a secondary containment area, whichever is greater. For purposes of the worst case discharge calculation, permanently manifolded oil storage tanks that are separated by internal divisions for each tank are considered to be single tanks and individual manifolded tank volumes are not combined.


In this section, the facility owner or operator shall provide a detailed description of the procedures and equipment used to detect discharges. A section on discharge detection by personnel and a discussion of automated discharge detection, if applicable, shall be included for both regular operations and after hours operations. In addition, the facility owner or operator shall discuss how the reliability of any automated system will be checked and how frequently the system will be inspected.


In this section, facility owners or operators shall describe the procedures and personnel that will detect any discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance. A thorough discussion of facility inspections must be included. In addition, a description of initial response actions shall be addressed. This section shall reference section 1.3.1 of the response plan for emergency response information.


In this section, facility owners or operators must describe any automated discharge detection equipment that the facility has in place. This section shall include a discussion of overfill alarms, secondary containment sensors, etc. A discussion of the plans to verify an automated alarm and the actions to be taken once verified must also be included.


In this section, facility owners or operators must explain in detail how to implement the facility's emergency response plan by describing response actions to be carried out under the plan to ensure the safety of the facility and to mitigate or prevent discharges described in section 1.5 of the response plan. This section shall include the identification of response resources for small, medium, and worst case discharges; disposal plans; and containment and drainage planning. A list of those personnel who would be involved in the cleanup shall be identified. Procedures that the facility will use, where appropriate or necessary, to update their plan after an oil discharge event and the time frame to update the plan must be described.


1.7.1.1 Once the discharge scenarios have been identified in section 1.5 of the response plan, the facility owner or operator shall identify and describe implementation of the response actions. The facility owner or operator shall demonstrate accessibility to the proper response personnel and equipment to effectively respond to all of the identified discharge scenarios. The determination and demonstration of adequate response capability are presented in appendix E to this part. In addition, steps to expedite the cleanup of oil discharges must be discussed. At a minimum, the following items must be addressed:


(1) Emergency plans for spill response;


(2) Additional response training;


(3) Additional contracted help;


(4) Access to additional response equipment/experts; and


(5) Ability to implement the plan including response training and practice drills.


1.7.1.2A recommended form detailing immediate actions follows.


1.7.2.1 Facility owners or operators must describe how and where the facility intends to recover, reuse, decontaminate, or dispose of materials after a discharge has taken place. The appropriate permits required to transport or dispose of recovered materials according to local, State, and Federal requirements must be addressed. Materials that must be accounted for in the disposal plan, as appropriate, include: 


(1) Recovered product; 


(2) Contaminated soil; 


(3) Contaminated equipment and materials, including drums, tank parts, valves, and shovels; 


(4) Personnel protective equipment; 


(5) Decontamination solutions; 


(6) Adsorbents; and 


(7) Spent chemicals. 


1.7.2.2 These plans must be prepared in accordance with Federal (e.g., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act [RCRA]), State, and local regulations, where applicable. A copy of the disposal plans from the facility's SPCC Plan may be inserted with this section, including any diagrams in those plans. 


A proper plan to contain and control a discharge through drainage may limit the threat of harm to human health and the environment. This section shall describe how to contain and control a discharge through drainage, including: 


(1) The available volume of containment (use the information presented in section 1.4.1 of the response plan); 


(2) The route of drainage from oil storage and transfer areas; 


(3) The construction materials used in drainage troughs; 


(4) The type and number of valves and separators used in the drainage system; 


(5) Sump pump capacities; 


(6) The containment capacity of weirs and booms that might be used and their location (see section 1.3.2 of this appendix); and 


(7) Other cleanup materials. 


In addition, a facility owner or operator must meet the inspection and monitoring requirements for drainage contained in 40 CFR part 112, subparts A through C. A copy of the containment and drainage plans that are required in 40 CFR part 112, subparts A through C may be inserted in this section, including any diagrams in those plans. 


The owner or operator must develop programs for facility response training and for drills/exercises according to the requirements of 40 CFR 112.21. Logs must be kept for facility drills/exercises, personnel response training, and spill prevention meetings. Much of the recordkeeping information required by this section is also contained in the SPCC Plan required by 40 CFR 112.3. These logs may be included in the facility response plan or kept as an annex to the facility response plan. 


Under 40 CFR 112.7(e), you must include the written procedures and records of inspections for each facility in the SPCC Plan. You must include the inspection records for each container, secondary containment, and item of response equipment at the facility. You must cross-reference the records of inspections of each container and secondary containment required by 40 CFR 112.7(e) in the facility response plan. The inspection record of response equipment is a new requirement in this plan. Facility self-inspection requires two-steps: (1) a checklist of things to inspect; and (2) a method of recording the actual inspection and its findings. You must note the date of each inspection. You must keep facility response plan records for five years. You must keep SPCC records for three years. 


The tank inspection checklist presented below has been included as guidance during inspections and monitoring. Similar requirements exist in 40 CFR part 112, subparts A through C. Duplicate information from the SPCC Plan may be photocopied and inserted in this section. The inspection checklist consists of the following items: 


Using the Emergency Response Equipment List provided in section 1.3.2 of the response plan, describe each type of response equipment, checking for the following: 


1. Inventory (item and quantity); 


2. Storage location; 


3. Accessibility (time to access and respond); 


4. Operational status/condition; 


5. Actual use/testing (last test date and frequency of testing); and 


6. Shelf life (present age, expected replacement date).


Inspect the secondary containment (as described in sections 1.4.1 and 1.7.2 of the response plan), checking the following: 


(A) CWA section 311(j)(5), as amended by OPA, requires the response plan to contain a description of facility drills/exercises. According to 40 CFR 112.21(c), the facility owner or operator shall develop a program of facility response drills/exercises, including evaluation procedures. Following the PREP guidelines (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability) would satisfy a facility's requirements for drills/exercises under this part. Alternately, under § 112.21(c), a facility owner or operator may develop a program that is not based on the PREP guidelines. Such a program is subject to approval by the Regional Administrator based on the description of the program provided in the response plan. 


(B) The PREP Guidelines specify that the facility conduct internal and external drills/exercises. The internal exercises include: qualified individual notification drills, spill management team tabletop exercises, equipment deployment exercises, and unannounced exercises. External exercises include Area Exercises. Credit for an Area or Facility-specific Exercise will be given to the facility for an actual response to a discharge in the area if the plan was utilized for response to the discharge and the objectives of the Exercise were met and were properly evaluated, documented, and self-certified.


(C) Section 112.20(h)(8)(ii) requires the facility owner or operator to provide a description of the drill/exercise program to be carried out under the response plan. Qualified Individual Notification Drill and Spill Management Team Tabletop Drill logs shall be provided in sections 1.8.2.1 and 1.8.2.2, respectively. These logs may be included in the facility response plan or kept as an annex to the facility response plan. See section 1.3.3 of this appendix for Equipment Deployment Drill Logs. 


Section 112.21(a) requires facility owners or operators to develop programs for facility response training. Facility owners or operators are required by § 112.20(h)(8)(iii) to provide a description of the response training program to be carried out under the response plan. A facility's training program can be based on the USCG's Training Elements for Oil Spill Response, to the extent applicable to facility operations, or another response training program acceptable to the RA. The training elements are available from the USCG Office of Response (G-MOR) at (202) 267-0518 or fax (202) 267-4085. Personnel response training logs and discharge prevention meeting logs shall be included in sections 1.8.3.1 and 1.8.3.2 of the response plan respectively. These logs may be included in the facility response plan or kept as an annex to the facility response plan. 


The facility-specific response plan shall include the following diagrams. Additional diagrams that would aid in the development of response plan sections may also be included.


According to 40 CFR 112.7(g) facilities are required to maintain a certain level of security, as appropriate. In this section, a description of the facility security shall be provided and include, as appropriate:


A three-page form has been developed to be completed and submitted to the RA by owners or operators who are required to prepare and submit a facility-specific response plan.
