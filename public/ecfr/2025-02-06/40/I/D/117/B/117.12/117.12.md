(a) This regulation does not apply to: 


(1) Discharges in compliance with a permit under section 402 of this Act; 


(2) Discharges resulting from circumstances identified, reviewed and made a part of the public record with respect to a permit issued or modified under section 402 of this Act, and subject to a condition in such permit; 


(3) Continuous or anticipated intermittent discharges from a point source, identified in a permit or permit application under section 402 of this Act, which are caused by events occurring within the scope of the relevant operating or treatment systems; or 


(b) A discharge is “in compliance with a permit issued under section 402 of this Act” if the permit contains an effluent limitation specifically applicable to the substance discharged or an effluent limitation applicable to another waste parameter which has been specifically identified in the permit as intended to limit such substance, and the discharge is in compliance with the effluent limitation. 


(c) A discharge results “from circumstances identified, reviewed and made a part of the public record with respect to a permit issued or modified under section 402 of the Act, and subject to a condition in such permit,” whether or not the discharge is in compliance with the permit, where: 


(1) The permit application, the permit, or another portion of the public record contains documents that specifically identify: 


(i) The substance and the amount of the substance; and 


(ii) The origin and source of the substance; and 


(iii) The treatment which is to be provided for the discharge either by: 


(A) An on-site treatment system separate from any treatment system treating the permittee's normal discharge; or 


(B) A treatment system designed to treat the permittee's normal discharge and which is additionally capable of treating the identified amount of the identified substance; or 


(C) Any combination of the above; and 


(2) The permit contains a requirement that the substance and amounts of the substance, as identified in § 117.12(c)(1)(i) and § 117.12(c)(1)(ii) be treated pursuant to § 117.12(c)(1)(iii) in the event of an on-site release; and 


(3) The treatment to be provided is in place. 


(d) A discharge is a “continuous or anticipated intermittent discharge from a point source, identified in a permit or permit application under section 402 of this Act, and caused by events occurring within the scope of the relevant operating or treatment systems,” whether or not the discharge is in compliance with the permit, if: 


(1) The hazardous substance is discharged from a point source for which a valid permit exists or for which a permit application has been submitted; and 


(2) The discharge of the hazardous substance results from: 


(i) The contamination of noncontact cooling water or storm water, provided that such cooling water or storm water is not contaminated by an on-site spill of a hazardous substance; or 


(ii) A continuous or anticipated intermittent discharge of process waste water, and the discharge originates within the manufacturing or treatment systems; or 


(iii) An upset or failure of a treatment system or of a process producing a continuous or anticipated intermittent discharge where the upset or failure results from a control problem, an operator error, a system failure or malfunction, an equipment or system startup or shutdown, an equipment wash, or a production schedule change, provided that such upset or failure is not caused by an on-site spill of a hazardous substance.
