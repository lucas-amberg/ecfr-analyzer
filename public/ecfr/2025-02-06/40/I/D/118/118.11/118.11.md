# § 118.11   Facility response plan requirements.

(a) *General requirements.* A written plan that complies with other Federal contingency plan regulations or is consistent with the approach in the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (“One Plan”) and that includes the elements provided in this section shall satisfy the requirements. The owner or operator may augment an existing plan with these required elements. All facility response plans must include the following:

(i) The owner or operator shall review relevant portions of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan and applicable Area Contingency Plan annually and, if necessary, revise the facility response plan to ensure consistency with these plans;


(ii) Include a signed affirmation that the owner or operator has reviewed relevant plans during facility response plan development and resubmission and;


(iii) Include a list of area plans and sub-area plans reviewed.


(2) *Qualified individual.* Identify the qualified individual or documented management system having full authority to implement response actions and require immediate communications between that individual and the appropriate Federal official and the persons providing personnel and equipment, with a description of duties including:


(i) Activate internal alarms and hazard communication systems to notify all facility personnel;


(ii) Notify all response personnel, as needed;


(iii) Identify the character, exact source, amount, and extent of the discharge, as well as the other items needed for notification;

(v) Notify and provide necessary information to public water systems that may be impacted by a discharge;


(vi) Assess the interaction of the discharged CWA hazardous substance with water, solutes in water, water treatment chemicals, and/or other substances stored at the facility and notify response personnel at the scene of that assessment;


(vii) Assess the possible hazards to human health and the environment due to the worst case discharge. This assessment must consider both the direct and indirect effects of the discharge (*i.e.,* the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that may be generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water runoffs from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosion) and initiate appropriate monitoring;


(viii) Implement prompt response actions to contain and respond, to the maximum extent practicable, the CWA hazardous substance discharged;


(ix) Coordinate rescue and response actions as previously arranged with response personnel;


(x) Use authority to immediately access company funding to initiate cleanup activities;


(xi) Direct cleanup activities until properly relieved of this responsibility; and


(xii) Acquire and maintain incident commander training requirements consistent with 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(6)(v).


(3) *Response resources.* Identify, and ensure by contract or other approved means, the availability of private personnel and equipment necessary to respond to the maximum extent practicable to a worst case discharge of CWA hazardous substances (including a discharge resulting from fire or explosion), and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge;


(4) *Training, testing, and drills.* Describe the training, equipment testing, periodic unannounced drills, and response actions of persons at the facility to be carried out under the plan to ensure facility safety and to mitigate or prevent the discharge, or the substantial threat of a discharge; and,


(5) *Plan updates.* Review and update facility response plan periodically and resubmit to the Regional Administrator for approval of each significant change as required by 118.4(a)(6) and (b)(1).


(b) *Emergency response information.* The facility response plan shall include:


(1) *Facility information.* Facility details including the facility name; latitude and longitude; street address, with city, State, and zip code; telephone number; facility location information described in a manner that would aid a reviewer and a responder in locating the facility, EPA identification numbers, and indication if the facility is located in or drains into a wellhead protection area as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1986;


(2) *Owner or operator information.* Contact information to include name and preferred contact method;


(3) *Hazard evaluation.* Hazard evaluation for worst case discharge into or on the navigable waters or a conveyance to navigable waters and risk-based decision support system shall include:


(i) Chemical-specific information, including the response considerations, health hazards, fire hazards, chemical reactivity, hazard classifications, and physical and chemical properties; potential effects of a CWA hazardous substance worst case discharge as per 118.10; impacts to communities with environmental justice concerns; and impacts of climate change, including but not limited to the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, temperature fluctuations, rising seas, storm surges, inland and coastal flooding, drought, wildfires, and permafrost melt in northern areas. Illustrative diagrams of the hazard evaluation should be included.


(ii) This section of the plan must outline processes that will help responders make decisions relating to the identification, evaluation, and control of risks to human health and the environment following a CWA hazardous substance discharge.

The owner or operator of a facility that does not have adequate firefighting resources located at the facility or that cannot rely on sufficient local firefighting resources through mutual aid agreements must identify adequate firefighting resources, including contracted resources. The response plan must also identify an individual located at the facility to work with the fire department in a response. This individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained firefighting resources are available within a reasonable response time to a worst case scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual identified in the response plan or another appropriate individual located at the facility;
