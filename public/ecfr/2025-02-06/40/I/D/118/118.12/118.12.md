Upon request, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the facility response plan to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Tribal Emergency Planning Committee, State Emergency Response Commission, Tribal Emergency Response Commission or other local emergency planning and response organizations. The owner or operator shall coordinate response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations to determine how the facility is addressed in the community emergency response plan and to ensure that local response organizations are aware of the CWA hazardous substances at the facility, their quantities, the risks presented, and the resources and capabilities provided by the facility to respond to a worst case discharge of a CWA hazardous substance into or on the navigable waters or a conveyance to navigable waters.


(a) Coordination shall occur at least annually, and more frequently, if necessary, to address changes at the facility, in the facility response plan, and/or in the community emergency response plan.


(b) Coordination shall include providing to the appropriate State, local, or Tribal emergency planning and response organizations the facility response plan, updated emergency contact information, and other information necessary for developing and implementing the local emergency response plan.


(c) Coordination shall include consulting with appropriate State, local, or Tribal emergency response officials to establish appropriate schedules and plans for drills and exercises required under ยง  118.13. The owner or operator shall request an opportunity to meet with the Local Emergency Planning Committee or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (or equivalent) and/or local fire department as appropriate to review and discuss those materials.


(d) The owner or operator shall document coordination with appropriate State, local, or Tribal authorities and retain that documentation for the life of the facility, including:


(1) The names of individuals involved and their contact information (phone number, email address, and organizational affiliations), dates of coordination activities, and nature of coordination activities; and


(2) Signed agreements on activities and resources, identified by the facility, in the facility response plan to be performed by the appropriate State, local, or Tribal emergency response organizations.


(3) If a facility owner or operator is unable to coordinate with their State Emergency Response Commission or Tribal Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee or Tribal Emergency Planning Committee, and/or local fire department, documentation must show a good faith effort to contact, coordinate, and consult with those bodies in the frequency described in this section.
