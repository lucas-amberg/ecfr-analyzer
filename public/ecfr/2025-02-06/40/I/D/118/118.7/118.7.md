# ยง 118.7   Petitions.

Any person, including a member of the public or any representative from a Federal, State, or local agency who has a reasonable basis to believe that a non-transportation-related onshore facility subject to this section could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by a discharge, or substantial threat of a discharge, of CWA hazardous substance into or on the navigable waters or a conveyance to navigable waters may petition the Regional Administrator to determine whether the facility meets the criteria in ยง 118.3. Such a petition shall include a discussion of how the factors in ยง 118.3 apply to the non-transportation-related onshore facility and EPA shall make the petition available to the owner or operator in question and provide an opportunity to respond. The Regional Administrator shall consider such petitions and respond as soon as practicable in writing including the basis for the determination. The Regional Administrator may render a decision based solely on the information in the petition but may also gather additional information before rendering a decision.
