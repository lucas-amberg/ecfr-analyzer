1. Does the facility have a maximum quantity onsite of a CWA hazardous substance greater than or equal to the CWA Reportable Quantity (RQ)x 1,000?


If Yes, list names, CAS no., and maximum quantities (lbs) onsite for each CWA hazardous substance:


If No, you do not need to proceed.


2. Is the facility within one-half mile of navigable waters or a conveyance to navigable waters?


If Yes, list navigable waters and a description of conveyance(s).


If No, you do not need to proceed.


If the answers to both 1 and 2 are Yes, answer questions 3-6.


3. Is the facility located at a distance such that a worst case discharge from the facility could cause injury to fish, wildlife, and sensitive environments? For further description of fish, wildlife, and sensitive environments (FWSE), see the applicable Area Contingency Plan (ACP). Attach documentation of the formulas, assumptions, ACP(s) consulted, and distances calculated.


4. Is the facility located at a distance such that a worst case discharge from the facility could cause injury to public receptors? Attach documentation of the formulas and distances calculated.


5. Would a worst case discharge from the facility cause substantial harm to a public water system by causing any one, or any combination of more than one, of the adverse impacts listed below?


(i) Violates any National Primary Drinking Water Standard or State Drinking Water Regulation, such as exceedance of a Maximum Contaminant Level;


(ii) Compromises the ability of the public water system to produce water that complies with any National Primary Drinking Water Standard or State Drinking Water Regulation;


(iii) Results in adverse health impacts in people exposed to the maximum concentration that could enter a drinking water distribution system;


(iv) Contaminates public water system infrastructure, including but not limited to intake structures, treatment facilities, and distribution systems, or premise plumbing systems to a degree that requires remediation to restore system components to acceptable performance; or


(v) Impairs the taste, odor, or other aesthetic characteristic of the water entering a drinking water distribution system to a degree that could make the water unacceptable to consumers and that could prompt the public water system to issue use restrictions.


Attach documentation of the methodology and assumptions used to evaluate the potential of a worst case discharge to cause each of the adverse impacts (i-v).


*For each worst case discharge scenario list:*

Attach documentation attesting to the required consultation with the applicable downstream public water system, including name of public water system, point of contact, and date of consultation for each potentially impacted public water system. If efforts to coordinate with the applicable downstream public water systems were unsuccessful, provide documentation to demonstrate the efforts to coordinate and provide the distance to the first downstream public water system intake.


6. Has the facility experienced a reportable CWA hazardous substance discharge to navigable waters within the last five years?


Attach relevant documentation of past reportable discharges.


*For each reportable discharge identify:*

Name of CWA hazardous substance, CAS no.


Date of discharge:


Duration of discharge (minutes):


Quantity discharged (lbs):


Navigable water(s) reached:


Injury caused to FWSE:


Injury caused to public receptors:


Adverse impacts to public water systems:
