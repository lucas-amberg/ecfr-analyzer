# § 122.61   Transfer of permits (applicable to State programs, see § 123.25).

(a) *Transfers by modification.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a permit may be transferred by the permittee to a new owner or operator only if the permit has been modified or revoked and reissued (under § 122.62(b)(2)), or a minor modification made (under § 122.63(d)), to identify the new permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary under CWA.


(b) *Automatic transfers.* As an alternative to transfers under paragraph (a) of this section, any NPDES permit may be automatically transferred to a new permittee if:


(1) The current permittee notifies the Director at least 30 days in advance of the proposed transfer date in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;


(2) The notice includes a written agreement between the existing and new permittees containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between them; and


(3) The Director does not notify the existing permittee and the proposed new permittee of his or her intent to modify or revoke and reissue the permit. A modification under this subparagraph may also be a minor modification under § 122.63. If this notice is not received, the transfer is effective on the date specified in the agreement mentioned in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
