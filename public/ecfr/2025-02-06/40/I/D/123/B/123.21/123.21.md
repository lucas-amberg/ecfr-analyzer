# § 123.21   Elements of a program submission.

(a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part shall submit to the Administrator at least three copies of a program submission. The submission shall contain the following: 


(1) A letter from the Governor of the State (or in the case of an Indian Tribe in accordance with § 123.33(b), the Tribal authority exercising powers substantially similar to those of a State Governor) requesting program approval;


(2) A complete program description, as required by § 123.22, describing how the State intends to carry out its responsibilities under this part; 


(3) An Attorney General's statement as required by § 123.23; 


(4) A Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator as required by § 123.24; 


(5) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations, including those governing State administrative procedures; 


(b)(1) Within 30 days of receipt by EPA of a State program submission, EPA will notify the State whether its submission is complete. If EPA finds that a State's submission is complete, the statutory review period (i.e., the period of time allotted for formal EPA review of a proposed State program under CWA) shall be deemed to have begun on the date of receipt of the State's submission. If EPA finds that a State's submission is incomplete, the statutory review period shall not begin until all the necessary information is received by EPA. 


(2) In the case of an Indian Tribe eligible under § 123.33(b), EPA shall take into consideration the contents of the Tribe's request submitted under § 123.32, in determining if the program submission required by § 123.21(a) is complete.


(c) If the State's submission is materially changed during the statutory review period, the statutory review period shall begin again upon receipt of the revised submission. 


(d) The State and EPA may extend the statutory review period by agreement.
