# § 124.6   Draft permits.

(a) (*Applicable to State programs, see 40 CFR 123.25 (NPDES), 145.11 (UIC), and 271.14 (RCRA).*) Once an application is complete, the Director shall tentatively decide whether to prepare a draft permit or to deny the application.




(b) If the Director tentatively decides to deny the permit application, he or she shall issue a notice of intent to deny.
