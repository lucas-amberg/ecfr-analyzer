# ยง 124.209   What are the requirements for responding to comments?

(a) At the time you issue a final standardized permit, you must also respond to comments received during the public comment period on the draft permit. Your response must:


(1) Specify which additional conditions (*i.e.*, those in the supplemental portion), if any, you changed in the final permit, and the reasons for the change.


(2) Briefly describe and respond to all significant comments on the facility's ability to meet the general requirements (*i.e.*, those terms and conditions in the uniform portion) and on any additional conditions necessary to protect human health and the environment raised during the public comment period or during the hearing.


(3) Make the comments and responses accessible to the public.


(b) You may request additional information from the facility owner or operator or inspect the facility if you need additional information to adequately respond to significant comments or to make decisions about conditions you may need to add to the supplemental portion of the standardized permit.


(c) If you are the Director of an EPA permitting agency, you must include in the administrative record for your final permit decision any documents cited in the response to comments. If new points are raised or new material supplied during the public comment period, you may document your response to those matters by adding new materials to the administrative record.
