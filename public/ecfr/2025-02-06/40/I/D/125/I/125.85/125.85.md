# ยง 125.85   May alternative requirements be authorized?

(a) Any interested person may request that alternative requirements less stringent than those specified in ยง 125.84(a) through (e) be imposed in the permit. The Director may establish alternative requirements less stringent than the requirements of ยง 125.84(a) through (e) only if:


(1) There is an applicable requirement under ยง 125.84(a) through (e);


(2) The Director determines that data specific to the facility indicate that compliance with the requirement at issue would result in compliance costs wholly out of proportion to the costs EPA considered in establishing the requirement at issue or would result in significant adverse impacts on local air quality, significant adverse impacts on local water resources other than impingement or entrainment, or significant adverse impacts on local energy markets;


(3) The alternative requirement requested is no less stringent than justified by the wholly out of proportion cost or the significant adverse impacts on local air quality, significant adverse impacts on local water resources other than impingement or entrainment, or significant adverse impacts on local energy markets; and 


(4) The alternative requirement will ensure compliance with other applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act and any applicable requirement of state law.


(b) The burden is on the person requesting the alternative requirement to demonstrate that alternative requirements should be authorized.
