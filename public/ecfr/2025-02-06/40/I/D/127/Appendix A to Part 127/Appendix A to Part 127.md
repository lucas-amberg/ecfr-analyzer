# Appendix A to Part 127—Minimum Set of NPDES Data






The following two tables identify the minimum set of NPDES data that authorized states, tribes, territories must enter or transfer to EPA's national NPDES data system as well as what NPDES-regulated entities must electronically report to the designated initial recipient (authorized NPDES program or EPA) [see 40 CFR 127.2(b)]. Authorized NPDES programs will be the data provider in the event the regulated entity is covered by a waiver from electronic reporting. Use of these two tables ensures that there is consistent and complete reporting nationwide, and expeditious collection and processing of the data, thereby making it more accurate and timely. Taken together, these data standardizations and the corresponding electronic reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 3, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 403, and 503 are designed to save the NPDES authorized programs considerable resources, make reporting easier for NPDES-regulated entities, streamline permit renewals (as permit writers typically review previous noncompliance events during permit renewal), ensure full exchange of NPDES program data between states and EPA to the public, improve environmental decision-making, and protect human health and the environment.


Authorized NPDES programs may also require NPDES regulated entities to submit more data than what is listed in this appendix. The authorized NPDES program can require NPDES regulated entities to submit these “non-appendix A” data on paper, electronically, or attachments to electronic notices and reports filed in compliance with this part.


Instructions: Table 1 of this appendix provides the list of data sources and minimum submission frequencies for the ten different NPDES Data Groups. Table 2 of this appendix provides the data that must be electronically reported for each of these NPDES Data Groups. The use of each data element is determined by identifying the number(s) in the column labeled “NPDES Data Group Number” in Table 2 and finding the corresponding “NPDES Data Group Number” in Table 1. For example, a value of “1” in Table 2 means that this data element is required in the electronic transmission of data from the NPDES program to EPA (Core NPDES Permitting, Compliance, and Enforcement Data). Likewise, a value of “1 through 10” in Table 2 means that this data element is required in all ten NPDES data groups. NPDES regulated entities that have no historical record (*e.g.,* “greenfield” facilities) do not need to provide data elements that rely on historical data elements. For the purposes of this appendix, the term `sewage sludge' [see 40 CFR 503.9(w)] also refers to the material that is commonly referred to as `biosolids.' EPA does not have a regulatory definition for biosolids but this material is commonly referred to as sewage sludge that is placed on, or applied to the land to use the beneficial properties of the material as a soil amendment, conditioner, or fertilizer. EPA's use of the term `biosolids' in this appendix is to confirm that information about beneficially used sewage sludge (a.k.a. biosolids) is part of the data collected in this appendix.
