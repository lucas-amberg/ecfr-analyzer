This part is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of this part, the permittee may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.

(c) *Initial recipient.* NPDES permittees, facilities, and entities subject to this part [see § 127.1(a)] must electronically submit the information listed in Table 1 in § 127.16(a) to the Director, Control Authority, Approval Authority, or initial recipient [as identified in § 127.27, and as defined in § 127.2(b)]. EPA must identify and publish the initial recipient on an EPA Web site and in the _Federal Register,_ by state and by NPDES data group [see § 127.2(c)].


(d) *Standards for NPDES regulated entities with electronic reporting waivers.* NPDES permittees, facilities, and entities subject to this part [see § 127.1(a)] that have received a waiver from electronic reporting must continue to provide the minimum set of NPDES data (as well as other required information in compliance with statutes, regulations, the NPDES permit, another control mechanism, or an enforcement order) to the authorized NPDES program or initial recipient (see § 127.15).
