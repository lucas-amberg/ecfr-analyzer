# § 127.26   Implementation plan (authorized states, tribes, and territories).

(a) *Initial recipient designation procedure.* EPA and authorized state, tribe, and territory NPDES programs must follow the procedure in § 127.27 for determining the initial recipient of electronic NPDES information from NPDES-regulated facilities (see § 127.2(b)).


(b) *NPDES data system requirements.* Authorized state, tribe, and territory NPDES programs must update their electronic data system to electronically collect the minimum set of NPDES data and facilitate compliance with this part (including §§ 127.22 and 127.23) and 40 CFR part 3. The authorized NPDES program's electronic data system must facilitate electronic reporting from NPDES permittees, facilities, and entities subject to this part [see § 127.1(a)] in compliance with the start dates in Table 1 in § 127.16(a). Authorized NPDES programs may elect to use EPA's national NPDES data system (and related Internet services and applications) for their electronic data system.


(c) *Preparatory actions for electronic reporting.* Authorized state, tribe, and territory NPDES programs must electronically transfer all NPDES data that supports electronic reporting (*e.g.,* permitting, compliance monitoring, compliance determinations, and enforcement activities) to EPA's national NPDES data system three months prior to the electronic reporting start dates in Table 1 in § 127.16(a) and maintain updates thereafter. These electronic data transfers must be timely, accurate, complete, and consistent (see § 127.23).


(d) *Transfer of NPDES program data to EPA.* A state, tribe, or territory that is designated by EPA as the initial recipient [see §§ 127.2(b) and 127.27] for an NPDES data group [as defined in § 127.2(c)] must electronically collect and maintain the minimum set of NPDES data (as specified in appendix A to this part) and electronically transfer these data to EPA's national NPDES data system through timely, accurate, complete, and consistent electronic data transfers in compliance with this part (including §§ 127.22 and 127.23) and 40 CFR part 3.


(e) *Updating state statutes and regulations.* Authorized state, tribe, or territory NPDES programs must update their NPDES programs to implement this part. See 40 CFR 123.62(e).


(f) *Inclusion of electronic reporting requirements in NPDES permits.* All permits issued by the EPA and the authorized states, tribes, or territory NPDES program must contain permit conditions requiring compliance with the electronic reporting requirements in this part, 40 CFR part 3, and 40 CFR 122.22. NPDES-regulated facilities which already have electronic reporting requirements in their permits that meet the requirements in this part, 40 CFR part 3, and 40 CFR 122.22 must continue their electronic reporting to the initial recipient [see §§ 127.2(b) and 127.27].


(g) *Hybrid approach.* Authorized state, tribe, or territory NPDES programs may elect to use the Hybrid Approach [as defined in § 127.2(g)] for the collection of the minimum set of NPDES data contained in construction stormwater general permit reports [see Table 1 in § 127.16(a)].


(h) *Authorized NPDES program implementation plans.* A state, tribe, or territory that is designated by EPA as the initial recipient [see §§ 127.2(b) and 127.27] for an NPDES data group [as defined in § 127.2(c)] must submit an implementation plan to EPA for review. EPA will inform the authorized NPDES program if the implementation plan is adequate. This plan must provide enough details (*e.g.,* tasks, milestones, roles and responsibilities, necessary resources) to clearly describe how the program will successfully implement this part (including a description of their electronic reporting waiver approval process); however, this plan does not include electronic reporting of Discharge Monitoring Reports or Forms Provided or Specified by the Director (DMRs) [40 CFR 122.41(l)(4)]. These implementation plans must be submitted to EPA by December 21, 2016 for EPA review.


(i) *Updating waiver approval process.* A state, tribe, or territory that is designated by EPA as the initial recipient [see §§ 127.2(b) and 127.27] for an NPDES data group [as defined in § 127.2(c)] must submit an updated waiver approval process to EPA every five years. EPA will inform the authorized NPDES program if the waiver approval process adequate.


(j) *Electronic participation rates assessment.* EPA will assess the electronic reporting participation rate of NPDES permittees, facilities, and entities subject to this part [see § 127.1(a)] for each authorized NPDES program and by each NPDES data group to determine the appropriateness of using use its authority to increase the electronic reporting percentage rate.


(1) EPA will separately calculate the electronic reporting participation rate for each authorized NPDES program and for each NPDES data group six months after the deadline for conversion from paper to electronic submissions [see the start dates for electronic reporting in Table 1 in § 127.16(a)]. EPA will assess the electronic reporting participation rate for individually permitted facilities separate from the electronic reporting participation rate for general permit covered facilities for Discharge Monitoring Reports [NPDES Data Group Number 3].


(2) As appropriate, EPA will contact the facilities and entities that are not electronically reporting their reports, notices, waivers, and certifications after the start dates for electronic reporting [see Table 1 in § 127.16(a)]. EPA will not contact facilities and entities with waivers from electronic reporting (see § 127.15). EPA will direct these facilities and entities to use the electronic reporting system of the initial recipient [as identified in § 127.27, and as defined in § 127.2(b)].


(3) EPA will annually repeat its review of the electronic reporting participation rate for each authorized NPDES program and for each NPDES group as appropriate and contact facilities and entities as appropriate to use the electronic reporting system of the initial recipient [as identified in § 127.27, and as defined in § 127.2(b)].
