(a) *Specialized definitions.* (1) *Aldrin/Dieldrin manufacturer* means a manufacturer, excluding any source which is exclusively an aldrin/dieldrin formulator, who produces, prepares or processes technical aldrin or dieldrin or who uses aldrin or dieldrin as a material in the production, preparation or processing of another synthetic organic substance. 


(2) *Aldrin/Dieldrin formulator* means a person who produces, prepares or processes a formulated product comprising a mixture of either aldrin or dieldrin and inert materials or other diluents, into a product intended for application in any use registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 135, *et seq.*). 


(3) The ambient water criterion for aldrin/dieldrin in navigable waters is 0.003 µg/l. 


(b) *Aldrin/dieldrin manufacturer*—(1) *Applicability.* (i) These standards or prohibitions apply to: 


(A) All discharges of process wastes; and 


(B) All discharges from the manufacturing areas, loading and unloading areas, storage areas and other areas which are subject to direct contamination by aldrin/dieldrin as a result of the manufacturing process, including but not limited to: 


(*1*) Stormwater and other runoff except as hereinafter provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; and 


(*2*) Water used for routine cleanup or cleanup of spills. 


(ii) These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff or other discharges from areas subject to contamination solely by fallout from air emissions of aldrin/dieldrin; or to stormwater runoff that exceeds that from the ten year 24-hour rainfall event. 


(2) *Analytical method acceptable.* Environmental Protection Agency method specified in 40 CFR part 136, except that a 1-liter sample size is required to increase the analytical sensitivity. 


(3) *Effluent standard*—(i) *Existing sources.* Aldrin or dieldrin is prohibited in any discharge from any aldrin/dieldrin manufacturer. 


(ii) *New Sources.* Aldrin or dieldrin is prohibited in any discharge from any aldrin/dieldrin manufacturer. 


(c) *Aldrin/dieldrin formulator*—(1) *Applicability.* (i) These standards or prohibitions apply to: 


(A) All discharges of process wastes; and 


(B) All discharges from the formulating areas, loading and unloading areas, storage areas and other areas which are subject to direct contamination by aldrin/dieldrin as a result of the formulating process, including but not limited to: 


(*1*) Stormwater and other runoff except as hereinafter provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section; and 


(*2*) Water used for routine cleanup or cleanup of spills. 


(ii) These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff or other discharges from areas subject to contamination solely by fallout from air emissions of aldrin/dieldrin; or to stormwater runoff that exceeds that from the ten year 24-hour rainfall event. 


(2) *Analytical method acceptable.* Environmental Protection Agency method specified in 40 CFR part 136, except that a 1-liter sample size is required to increase the analytical sensitivity. 


(3) *Effluent standard*—(i) *Existing sources.* Aldrin or dieldrin is prohibited in any discharge from any aldrin/dieldrin formulator. 


(ii) *New sources.* Aldrin or dieldrin is prohibited in any discharge from any aldrin/dieldrin formulator.
