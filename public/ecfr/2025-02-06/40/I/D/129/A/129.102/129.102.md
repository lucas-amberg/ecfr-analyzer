# § 129.102   Endrin.

(a) *Specialized definitions.* (1) *Endrin Manufacturer* means a manufacturer, excluding any source which is exclusively an endrin formulator, who produces, prepares or processes technical endrin or who uses endrin as a material in the production, preparation or processing of another synthetic organic substance. 


(2) *Endrin Formulator* means a person who produces, prepares or processes a formulated product comprising a mixture of endrin and inert materials or other diluents into a product intended for application in any use registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 135 *et seq.*). 


(3) The ambient water criterion for endrin in navigable waters is 0.004 µg/l. 


(b) *Endrin manufacturer*—(1) *Applicability.* (i) These standards or prohibitions apply to: 


(A) All discharges of process wastes; and 


(B) All discharges from the manufacturing areas, loading and unloading areas, storage areas and other areas which are subject to direct contamination by endrin as a result of the manufacturing process, including but not limited to:


(*1*) Stormwater and other runoff except as hereinafter provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; and


(*2*) Water used for routine cleanup or cleanup of spills. 


(ii) These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff or other discharges from areas subject to contamination solely by fallout from air emissions of endrin; or to stormwater runoff that exceeds that from the ten year 24-hour rainfall event. 


(2) *Analytical method acceptable*—Environmental Protection Agency method specified in 40 CFR part 136. 


(3) *Effluent standard*—(i) *Existing sources.* Discharges from an endrin manufacturer shall not contain endrin concentrations exceeding an average per working day of 1.5 µg/l calculated over any calendar month; and shall not exceed a monthly average daily loading of 0.0006 kg/kkg of endrin produced; and shall not exceed 7.5 µg/l in a sample(s) representing any working day. 


(ii) *New sources.* Discharges from an endrin manufacturer shall not contain endrin concentrations exceeding an average per working day of 0.1 µg/l calculated over any calendar month; and shall not exceed a monthly average daily loading of 0.00004 kg/kkg of endrin produced; and shall not exceed 0.5 µg/l in a sample(s) representing any working day. 


(iii) *Mass emission standard during shutdown of production.* In computing the allowable monthly average daily loading figure required under the preceding paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, for any calendar month for which there is no endrin being manufactured at any plant or facility which normally contributes to the discharge which is subject to these standards, the applicable production value shall be deemed to be the average monthly production level for the most recent preceding 360 days of actual operation of the plant or facility. 


(c) *Endrin formulator*—(1) *Applicability.* (i) These standards or prohibitions apply to: 


(A) All discharges of process wastes; and 


(B) All discharges from the formulating areas, loading and unloading areas, storage areas and other areas which are subject to direct contamination by endrin as a result of the formulating process, including but not limited to: (*1*) Stormwater and other runoff except as hereinafter provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section; and (*2*) water used for routine cleanup or cleanup of spills. 


(ii) These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff or other discharges from areas subject to contamination solely by fallout from air emissions of endrin; or to storm-water runoff that exceeds that from the ten year 24-hour rainfall event. 


(2) *Analytical method acceptable*—Environmental Protection Agency method specified in 40 CFR part 136, except that a 1-liter sample size is required to increase the analytical sensitivity. 


(3) *Effluent standard*—(i) *Existing sources.* Endrin is prohibited in any discharge from any endrin formulator. 


(ii) New sources—Endrin is prohibited in any discharge from any endrin formulator. 


(d) The standards set forth in this section shall apply to the total combined weight or concentration of endrin, excluding any associated element or compound.
