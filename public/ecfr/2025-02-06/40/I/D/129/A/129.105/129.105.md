# § 129.105   Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

(a) *Specialized definitions.* (1) *PCB Manufacturer* means a manufacturer who produces polychlorinated biphenyls. 


(2) *Electrical capacitor manufacturer* means a manufacturer who produces or assembles electrical capacitors in which PCB or PCB-containing compounds are part of the dielectric. 


(3) *Electrical transformer manufacturer* means a manufacturer who produces or assembles electrical transformers in which PCB or PCB-containing compounds are part of the dielectric. 


(4) The ambient water criterion for PCBs in navigable waters is 0.001 µg/l. 


(b) *PCB manufacturer*—(1) *Applicability.* (i) These standards or prohibitions apply to: 


(A) All discharges of process wastes; 


(B) All discharges from the manufacturing or incinerator areas, loading and unloading areas, storage areas, and other areas which are subject to direct contamination by PCBs as a result of the manufacturing process, including but not limited to: 


(*1*) Stormwater and other runoff except as hereinafter provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; and 


(*2*) Water used for routine cleanup or cleanup of spills. 


(ii) These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff or other discharges from areas subject to contamination solely by fallout from air emissions of PCBs; or to stormwater runoff that exceeds that from the ten-year 24-hour rainfall event. 


(2) Analytical Method Acceptable—Environmental Protection Agency method specified in 40 CFR part 136 except that a 1-liter sample size is required to increase analytical sensitivity. 


(3) *Effluent standards*—(i) *Existing sources.* PCBs are prohibited in any discharge from any PCB manufacturer;


(ii) *New sources.* PCBs are prohibited in any discharge from any PCB manufacturer. 


(c) *Electrical capacitor manufacturer*—(1) *Applicability.* (i) These standards or prohibitions apply to: 


(A) All discharges of process wastes; and 


(B) All discharges from the manufacturing or incineration areas, loading and unloading areas, storage areas and other areas which are subject to direct contamination by PCBs as a result of the manufacturing process, including but not limited to: 


(*1*) Stormwater and other runoff except as hereinafter provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section; and 


(*2*) Water used for routine cleanup or cleanup of spills. 


(ii) These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff or other discharges from areas subject to contamination solely by fallout from air emissions of PCBs; or to stormwater runoff that exceeds that from the ten-year 24-hour rainfall event. 


(2) *Analytical method acceptable.* Environmental Protection Agency method specified in 40 CFR part 136, except that a 1-liter sample size is required to increase analytical sensitivity. 


(3) *Effluent standards*—(i) *Existing sources.* PCBs are prohibited in any discharge from any electrical capacitor manufacturer;


(ii) *New sources.* PCBs are prohibited in any discharge from any electrical capacitor manufacturer. 


(d) *Electrical transformer manufacturer*—(1) *Applicability.* (i) These standards or prohibitions apply to: 


(A) All discharges of process wastes; and 


(B) All discharges from the manufacturing or incineration areas, loading and unloading areas, storage areas, and other areas which are subject to direct contamination by PCBs as a result of the manufacturing process, including but not limited to:


(*1*) Stormwater and other runoff except as hereinafter provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; and


(*2*) Water used for routine cleanup or cleanup of spills. 


(ii) These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff or other discharges from areas subject to contamination solely by fallout from air emissions of PCBs; or to stormwater runoff that exceeds that from the ten-year 24-hour rainfall event. 


(2) *Analytical method acceptable.* Environmental Protection Agency method specified in 40 CFR part 136, except that a 1-liter sample size is required to increase analytical sensitivity. 


(3) *Effluent standards*—(i) *Existing sources.* PCBs are prohibited in any discharge from any electrical transformer manufacturer;


(ii) *New sources.* PCBs are prohibited in any discharge from any electrical transformer manufacturer. 


(e) *Adjustment of effluent standard for presence of PCBs in intake water.* Whenever a facility which is subject to these standards has PCBs in its effluent which result from the presence of PCBs in its intake waters, the owner may apply to the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate), for a credit pursuant to the provisions of § 129.6, where the source of the water supply is the same body of water into which the discharge is made. The requirement of paragraph (1) of § 129.6(a), relating to the source of the water supply, shall be waived, and such facility shall be eligible to apply for a credit under § 129.6, upon a showing by the owner or operator of such facility to the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) that the concentration of PCBs in the intake water supply of such facility does not exceed the concentration of PCBs in the receiving water body to which the plant discharges its effluent.
