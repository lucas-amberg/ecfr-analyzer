# § 131.36   Toxics criteria for those states not complying with Clean Water Act section 303(c)(2)(B).

(a) *Scope.* This section is not a general promulgation of the section 304(a) criteria for priority toxic pollutants but is restricted to specific pollutants in specific States.


(b)(1) EPA's Section 304(a) criteria for Priority Toxic Pollutants.


(iii) If a State does not have such a low flow value for numeric standards compliance, then none shall apply and the criteria included in paragraph (d) of this section herein apply at all flows.


(3) The aquatic life criteria in the matrix in paragraph (b) of this section apply as follows:


(i) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or less than 1 part per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are the freshwater criteria in Column B;


(ii) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or greater than 10 parts per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are the saltwater criteria in Column C; and


(iii) For waters in which the salinity is between 1 and 10 parts per thousand as defined in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, the applicable criteria are the more stringent of the freshwater or saltwater criteria. However, the Regional Administrator may approve the use of the alternative freshwater or saltwater criteria if scientifically defensible information and data demonstrate that on a site-specific basis the biology of the waterbody is dominated by freshwater aquatic life and that freshwater criteria are more appropriate; or conversely, the biology of the waterbody is dominated by saltwater aquatic life and that saltwater criteria are more appropriate.


(4) *Application of metals criteria.* (i) For purposes of calculating freshwater aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the minimum hardness allowed for use in those equations shall not be less than 25 mg/l, as calcium carbonate, even if the actual ambient hardness is less than 25 mg/l as calcium carbonate. The maximum hardness value for use in those equations shall not exceed 400 mg/l as calcium carbonate, even if the actual ambient hardness is greater than 400 mg/l as calcium carbonate. The same provisions apply for calculating the metals criteria for the comparisons provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.


(ii) The hardness values used shall be consistent with the design discharge conditions established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for flows and mixing zones.


(iii) Except where otherwise noted, the criteria for metals (compounds #2, #4-# 11, and #13, in paragraph (b) of this section) are expressed as dissolved metal. For purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnote m. in the criteria matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the equations in paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, the water-effect ratio is computed as a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxicity values measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respective acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory dilution water. 


(d) *Criteria for Specific Jurisdictions*—(1) *Rhode Island, EPA Region 1.* (i) All waters assigned to the following use classifications in the Water Quality Regulations for Water Pollution Control adopted under Chapters 46-12, 42-17.1, and 42-35 of the General Laws of Rhode Island are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, without exception:


(ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the use classifications identified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section:


(iii) The human health criteria shall be applied at the 10_−5_ risk level, consistent with the State policy. To determine appropriate value for carcinogens, see footnote c in the criteria matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(2) *Vermont, EPA Region 1.* (i) All waters assigned to the following use classifications in the Vermont Water Quality Standards adopted under the authority of the Vermont Water Pollution Control Act (10 V.S.A., Chapter 47) are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, without exception:


(ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the use classifications identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section:


(iii) The human health criteria shall be applied at the State-proposed 10_−6_ risk level.


(3)-(4) Reserved]


(5) *District of Columbia, EPA Region 3.* (i) All waters assigned to the following use classifications in chapter 11 Title 21 DCMR, Water Quality Standards of the District of Columbia are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, without exception:


(ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the use classification identified in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section:


(iii) The human health criteria shall be applied at the State-adopted 10_−6_ risk level.


(6) *Florida, EPA Region 4.* (i) All waters assigned to the following use classifications in Chapter 17-301 of the Florida Administrative Code (*i.e.*, identified in Section 17-302.600) are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section, without exception:


(ii) The following criteria from the matrix paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the use classifications identified in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section:


(iii) The human health criteria shall be applied at the State-adopted 10_−6_ risk level.


(7)-(8) [Reserved]


(9) *Kansas, EPA Region 7.* (i) All waters assigned to the following use classification in the Kansas Department of Health and Environment regulations, K.A.R. 28-16-28b through K.A.R. 28-16-28f, are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of this section, without exception.


(ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the use classifications identified in paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this section:


(iii) The human health criteria shall be applied at the State-adopted 10_−6_ risk level.


(10) *California, EPA Region 9.* (i) All waters assigned any aquatic life or human health use classifications in the Water Quality Control Plans for the various Basins of the State (“Basin Plans”), as amended, adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), except for ocean waters covered by the Water Quality Control Plan for Ocean Waters of California (“Ocean Plan”) adopted by the SWRCB with resolution Number 90-27 on March 22, 1990, are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section, without exception. These criteria amend the portions of the existing State standards contained in the Basin Plans. More particularly these criteria amend water quality criteria contained in the Basin Plan Chapters specifying water quality objectives (the State equivalent of federal water quality criteria) for the toxic pollutants identified in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section. Although the State has adopted several use designations for each of these waters, for purposes of this action, the specific standards to be applied in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section are based on the presence in all waters of some aquatic life designation and the presence or absence of the MUN use designation (Municipal and domestic supply). (See Basin Plans for more detailed use definitions.) 


(ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the water and use classifications defined in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section and identified below:
