# § 133.102   Secondary treatment.

The following paragraphs describe the minimum level of effluent quality attainable by secondary treatment in terms of the parameters—BOD_5_, SS and pH. All requirements for each parameter shall be achieved except as provided for in §§ 133.103 and 133.105. 


(a) *BOD*_5_.


(1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 30 mg/l.


(2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.


(3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 85 percent. 


(4) At the option of the NPDES permitting authority, in lieu of the parameter BOD_5_ and the levels of the effluent quality specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3), the parameter CBOD_5_ may be substituted with the following levels of the CBOD_5_ effluent quality provided: 


(i) The 30-day average shall not exceed 25 mg/l.


(ii) The 7-day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.


(iii) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 85 percent.


(b) *SS.* (1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 30 mg/l.


(2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.


(3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 85 percent.


(c) *pH.* The effluent values for pH shall be maintained within the limits of 6.0 to 9.0 unless the publicly owned treatment works demonstrates that: (1) Inorganic chemicals are not added to the waste stream as part of the treatment process; and (2) contributions from industrial sources do not cause the pH of the effluent to be less than 6.0 or greater than 9.0.
