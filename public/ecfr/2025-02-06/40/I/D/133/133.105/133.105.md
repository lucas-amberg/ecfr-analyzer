# § 133.105   Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment.

This section describes the minimum level of effluent quality attainable by facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment (§ 133.101(g)) in terms of the parameters—BOD_5_, SS and pH. All requirements for the specified parameters in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall be achieved except as provided for in § 133.103, or paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this section.


(a) *BOD*_5_. (1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.


(2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.


(3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.


(b) *SS.* Except where SS values have been adjusted in accordance with § 133.103(c):


(1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.


(2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.


(3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.


(c) *pH.* The requirements of § 133.102(c) shall be met.


(d) *Alternative State requirements.* Except as limited by paragraph (f) of this section, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Regional Administrator, or, if appropriate, State Director subject to EPA approval, is authorized to adjust the minimum levels of effluent quality set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for trickling filter facilities and in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for waste stabilization pond facilities, to conform to the BOD_5_ and SS effluent concentrations consistently achievable through proper operation and maintenance (§ 133.101(f)) by the median (50th percentile) facility in a representative sample of facilities within a State or appropriate contiguous geographical area that meet the definition of facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment (§ 133.101(g)).


(e) *CBOD*_5_ limitations:


(1) Where data are available to establish CBOD_5_ limitations for a treatment works subject to this section, the NPDES permitting authority may substitute the parameter CBOD_5_ for the parameter BOD_5_ In §§ 133.105(a)(1), 133.105(a)(2) and 133.105(a)(3), on a case-by-case basis provided that the levels of CBOD_5_ effluent quality are not less stringent than the following:


(i) The 30-day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.


(ii) The 7-days average shall not exceed 60 mg/l.


(iii) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.


(2) Where data are available, the parameter CBOD_5_ may be used for effluent quality limitations established under paragraph (d) of this section. Where concurrent BOD effluent data are available, they must be submitted with the CBOD data as a part of the approval process outlined in paragraph (d) of this section.


(f) *Permit adjustments.* Any permit adjustment made pursuant to this part may not be any less stringent than the limitations required pursuant to § 133.105(a)-(e). Furthermore, permitting authorities shall require more stringent limitations when adjusting permits if: (1) For existing facilities the permitting authority determines that the 30-day average and 7-day average BOD_5_ and SS effluent values that could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment works, based on an analysis of the past performance of the treatment works, would enable the treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations, or 


(2) For new facilities, the permitting authority determines that the 30-day average and 7-day average BOD_5_ and SS effluent values that could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment works, considering the design capability of the treatment process and geographical and climatic conditions, would enable the treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations.
