# § 136.3   Identification of test procedures.

(a) Parameters or pollutants, for which methods are approved, are listed together with test procedure descriptions and references in Tables IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, IG, and IH of this section. The methods listed in Tables IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, IG, and IH are incorporated by reference, see paragraph (b) of this section, with the exception of EPA Methods 200.7, 601-613, 624.1, 625.1, 1613, 1624, and 1625. The full texts of Methods 601-613, 624.1, 625.1, 1613, 1624, and 1625 are printed in appendix A of this part, and the full text of Method 200.7 is printed in appendix C of this part. The full text for determining the method detection limit when using the test procedures is given in appendix B of this part. In the event of a conflict between the reporting requirements of 40 CFR parts 122 and 125 and any reporting requirements associated with the methods listed in these tables, the provisions of 40 CFR parts 122 and 125 are controlling and will determine a permittee's reporting requirements. The full texts of the referenced test procedures are incorporated by reference into Tables IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, IG, and IH. The date after the method number indicates the latest editorial change of the method. The discharge parameter values for which reports are required must be determined by one of the standard analytical test procedures incorporated by reference and described in Tables IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, IG, and IH or by any alternate test procedure which has been approved by the Administrator under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section and §§ 136.4 and 136.5. Under certain circumstances (paragraph (c) of this section, § 136.5(a) through (d) or 40 CFR 401.13,) other additional or alternate test procedures may be used.




(b) The material listed in this paragraph (b) is incorporated by reference into this section with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. All approved incorporation by reference (IBR) material is available for inspection at the EPA and at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(c) Under certain circumstances, the Director may establish limitations on the discharge of a parameter for which there is no test procedure in this part or in 40 CFR parts 405 through 499. In these instances the test procedure shall be specified by the Director.


(d) Under certain circumstances, the Administrator may approve additional alternate test procedures for nationwide use, upon recommendation by the Alternate Test Procedure Program Coordinator, Washington, DC.


(e) Sample preservation procedures, container materials, and maximum allowable holding times for parameters are cited in Tables IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, IG, and IH are prescribed in Table II. Information in the table takes precedence over information in specific methods or elsewhere. Any person may apply for a change from the prescribed preservation techniques, container materials, and maximum holding times applicable to samples taken from a specific discharge. Applications for such limited use changes may be made by letters to the Regional Alternative Test Procedure (ATP) Program Coordinator or the permitting authority in the Region in which the discharge will occur. Sufficient data should be provided to assure such changes in sample preservation, containers or holding times do not adversely affect the integrity of the sample. The Regional ATP Coordinator or permitting authority will review the application and then notify the applicant and the appropriate State agency of approval or rejection of the use of the alternate test procedure. A decision to approve or deny any request on deviations from the prescribed Table II requirements will be made within 90 days of receipt of the application by the Regional Administrator. An analyst may not modify any sample preservation and/or holding time requirements of an approved method unless the requirements of this section are met.
