# § 139.5   Biofouling management.

(a) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section apply to any vessel subject to regulation under this part.


(b) A biofouling management plan must be developed to minimize the discharge of biofouling organisms. The plan elements must prioritize procedures and strategies to prevent macrofouling, thereby minimizing the potential for the introduction and spread of ANS. The plan must describe the vessel-specific anti-fouling systems and biofouling management practices necessary to comply with the requirements in this section. See §§ 139.13, 139.14, 139.22, 139.28, and 139.29 for additional biofouling management requirements.
