# ยง 139.6   Oil management.

(a) The requirements in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section apply to vessel equipment and operations that use or discharge oil or oily mixtures.


(b) The discharge of used or spent oil no longer being used for its intended purpose is prohibited.


(c) The discharge of oil in such quantities as may be harmful is prohibited.


(d) During fueling, maintenance, and other vessel operations, control and response measures must be used to prevent, minimize, and contain spills and overflows.


(e) An environmentally acceptable lubricant (EAL) must be used in any oil-to-sea interface unless such use is technically infeasible. Operators of new build vessels should endeavor to use seawater-based systems for stern tube lubrication to eliminate the discharge of oil from these interfaces to the aquatic environment.
