(a) The requirements in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section apply to accumulated biological organisms, sediment, precipitation, and seawater that is emptied from the compartment used to store the anchor chain on a vessel and are intended to prevent the discharge of accumulated biological organisms, sediment, precipitation, and seawater when deploying the anchor in a new port or place of destination.


(b) Anchors and anchor chains must be rinsed of biofouling organisms and sediment when the anchor is retrieved.


(c) The discharge of biological organisms, sediment, precipitation, and seawater from any chain locker is prohibited in port.


(d) Anchors and anchor chains used beyond waters of the contiguous zone must be rinsed of biofouling organisms and sediment prior to entering the waters of the contiguous zone. This requirement may be satisfied by rinsing when the anchor is retrieved at the commencement of the voyage or when the anchor was last retrieved on a previous voyage, so long as the rinsing occurs after the last use of the anchor beyond waters of the contiguous zone.


(e) Additional standards applicable to a discharge from chain lockers when a vessel is operating in federally-protected waters are contained in ยง 139.40(e).
