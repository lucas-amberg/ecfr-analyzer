# ยง 139.28   Seawater piping.

(a) The requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section apply to discharges from seawater piping systems, including while a vessel is in port or in layup.


(b) Seawater piping systems must be inspected, maintained, and cleaned as necessary to minimize the accumulation and discharge of biofouling organisms.


(c) Seawater piping systems that accumulate macrofouling must be fitted with a Marine Growth Prevention System (MGPS).


(1) An MGPS must be selected to address:


(i) The level, frequency, and type of expected biofouling; and


(ii) The design, location, and area in which the system will be used.


(2) An MGPS must include one, or some combination of the following:


(i) Chemical injection;


(ii) Electrolysis, ultrasound, ultraviolet radiation, or electrochlorination;


(iii) Application of an antifouling coating;


(iv) Use of cupro-nickel piping; or


(v) Use of glass-reinforced/filament-wound epoxy-based composite piping.


(3) Upon identification of macrofouling in a seawater piping system, reactive measures to manage the macrofouling must be used. Discharges resulting from reactive measures to remove macrofouling are prohibited in port.


(d) Additional standards applicable to discharges from seawater piping systems when a vessel is operating in federally-protected waters are contained in ยง 139.40(l).
