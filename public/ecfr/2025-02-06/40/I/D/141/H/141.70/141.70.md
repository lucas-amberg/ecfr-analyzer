# § 141.70   General requirements.

(a) The requirements of this subpart H constitute national primary drinking water regulations. These regulations establish criteria under which filtration is required as a treatment technique for public water systems supplied by a surface water source and public water systems supplied by a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water. In addition, these regulations establish treatment technique requirements in lieu of maximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants: *Giardia lamblia,* viruses, heterotrophic plate count bacteria, *Legionella,* and turbidity. Each public water system with a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water must provide treatment of that source water that complies with these treatment technique requirements. The treatment technique requirements consist of installing and properly operating water treatment processes which reliably achieve: 


(1) At least 99.9 percent (3-log) removal and/or inactivation of *Giardia lamblia* cysts between a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer; and 


(2) At least 99.99 percent (4-log) removal and/or inactivation of viruses between a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer. 


(b) A public water system using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water is considered to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if: 


(1) It meets the requirements for avoiding filtration in § 141.71 and the disinfection requirements in § 141.72(a); or 


(2) It meets the filtration requirements in § 141.73 and the disinfection requirements in § 141.72(b). 


(c) Each public water system using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water must be operated by qualified personnel who meet the requirements specified by the State.


(d) *Additional requirements for systems serving at least 10,000 people.* In addition to complying with requirements in this subpart, systems serving at least 10,000 people must also comply with the requirements in subpart P of this part.


(e) *Additional requirements for systems serving fewer than 10,000 people.* In addition to complying with requirements in this subpart, systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must also comply with the requirements in subpart T of this part.
