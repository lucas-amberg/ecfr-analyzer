(i) *Important information about lead in your drinking water.*

[INSERT NAME OF WATER SYSTEM] found elevated levels of lead in drinking water in some homes/buildings. Lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant people and young children. Please read this information closely to see what you can do to reduce lead in your drinking water.


(ii) *Health effects of lead.*

There is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Exposure to lead in drinking water can cause serious health effects in all age groups, especially pregnant people, infants (both formula-fed and breastfed), and young children. Some of the health effects to infants and children include decreases in IQ and attention span. Lead exposure can also result in new or worsened learning and behavior problems. The children of persons who are exposed to lead before or during pregnancy may be at increased risk of these harmful health effects. Adults have increased risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or nervous system problems. Contact your health care provider for more information about your risks.


(iii) *Sources of lead.* (A) Explain what lead is.


(B) Explain possible sources of lead in drinking water and how lead enters drinking water. Include information on home/building plumbing materials, service lines, and connectors that may contain lead and include information about the definition of lead free as provided in Safe Drinking Water Act section 1417 of 1986 and as subsequently revised in 2011. Explain that lead levels may vary and therefore lead exposure is possible even when tap sampling results do not detect lead at one point in time.


(C) Discuss other important sources of lead exposure in addition to drinking water (*e.g.,* paint).


(iv) *Consumer steps to reduce lead exposure.* Discuss the steps the consumer can take to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water.


(A) Explain that using a filter, certified by an American National Standards Institute accredited certifier to reduce lead, is effective in reducing lead exposures. If the system makes filters available in accordance with paragraph (j)(2) of this section, also include information on how the consumer can obtain a filter.


(B) Encourage running the water to flush out the lead. Explain that lead levels increase over time as water sits in lead-containing plumbing materials and regular water usage in the building can reduce lead levels in drinking water. Advise consumers served by lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines that they may need to flush the water for longer periods.


(C) Explain concerns with using hot water from the tap and specifically caution against the use of hot water for preparing baby formula.


(D) Explain that boiling water does not reduce lead levels.


(E) Encourage regular cleaning of faucet aerators.


(F) Discuss other steps consumers can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water, especially for pregnant persons, infants, and young children, such as using alternative sources of water.


(G) Suggest that parents have their child's blood tested for lead. Provide contact information for the State and/or local health department.


(H) Tell consumers how to get their water tested, including information in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(v) *Levels of lead in drinking water.* Explain why there are elevated levels of lead in the system's drinking water (if known) and what the water system is doing to reduce the lead levels in homes/buildings in this area.


(vi) *Information on lead, galvanized requiring replacement, and unknown service lines.* For systems with lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines in the system's inventory pursuant to § 141.84(a) and (b), public education materials must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) through (G) of this section. For systems with lead connectors or connectors of unknown material in the system's inventory pursuant to § 141.84(a) and (b), public education materials must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(vi)(C) of this section:


(A) Discuss opportunities to replace lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines;


(B) Discuss opportunities to have the material of a lead status unknown service line identified;

(v) Use another method approved by the State.


(5) A water system that is already conducting an outreach activity listed in paragraph (j)(4) of this section in order to meet the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section may conduct one activity that meets the requirements of paragraphs (j)(4) and (h), unless otherwise directed by the State.


(6) A water system may discontinue the requirements of this paragraph (j) when the system no longer has at least three lead action level exceedances in a rolling five-year period, based on tap water samples collected in accordance with § 141.86. A calculated 90th percentile level at or below the lead action level based on fewer than the minimum number of required samples under § 141.86 cannot be used to meet the requirements of this paragraph (j)(6). States have the discretion to allow a water system to discontinue the requirements of this paragraph (j) earlier if the system has taken actions to reduce lead levels (e.g., re-optimized optimal corrosion control treatment or completed the service line replacement program) and the system is at or below the lead action level for two consecutive tap monitoring periods.
