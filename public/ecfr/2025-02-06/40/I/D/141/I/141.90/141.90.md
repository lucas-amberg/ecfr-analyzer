# § 141.90   Reporting requirements.

All water systems shall report all of the following information to the State in accordance with this section. 


(a) *Reporting requirements for tap monitoring for lead and copper and for distribution system and entry point monitoring for water quality parameters.* (1) By the start of a system's first lead and copper tap monitoring period in § 141.86(c) and (d), water systems must submit the following to the State:


(i) A site sample plan, including a list of tap sample site locations for lead and copper sampling identified from the inventory in § 141.84(a), and a list of tap sampling sites and entry point to the distribution system sites for water quality parameter monitoring selected under § 141.87(a)(1) and (2). Changes to the site sample plan require systems to submit an updated site sample plan to the State before the start of the next tap sampling period conducted by the system. The State may require modifications to the site sample plan as necessary.


(A) Water systems with lead, galvanized requiring replacement, and/or lead status unknown service lines in the service line inventory conducted under § 141.84(a) and (b) must evaluate the tap sampling locations for lead and copper used in their sampling pool prior to the start of each tap sampling period, beginning with the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3). Evaluations that result in changes to the site sample plan require systems to submit an updated site sample plan to the State prior to each tap sampling period conducted by the system.


(B) A water system that cannot identify enough sampling sites with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by lead service lines to meet the minimum number of sample sites required in § 141.86(c)(1) or (d)(1), as required under § 141.86(a)(3), must submit documentation, including documentation of applicable customer refusals for sampling, in support of the conclusion that there are an insufficient number of available sites with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by lead service lines, prior to the next tap sampling period.


(ii) A copy of the sample collection instructions that are provided to individuals who are sampling, which meets the requirements of § 141.86(b). If the water system seeks to modify its sample collection instructions specified in this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), it must submit the updated version of the instructions to the State for review prior to the next tap sampling period.


(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 141.31(a), a water system must report the information specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section, for all lead and copper tap samples specified in § 141.86 and for all water quality parameter distribution system and entry point samples specified in § 141.87, within the first 10 days following the end of each applicable sampling period specified in §§ 141.86 and 141.87, unless the State has specified an earlier reporting requirement. For tap sampling periods with a duration less than six months, the end of the sampling period is the last date samples can be collected as specified in § 141.86.


(i) The results of all tap samples for lead and copper collected during the tap sampling period, including results for both first- and fifth-liter samples collected at lead service line sites, the location of each site, and the site selection criteria under § 141.86(a)(3) and (4) used as the basis for which the site was selected for the water system's sampling pool;


(ii) Documentation for each tap water lead or copper sample for which the water system requests invalidation pursuant to § 141.86(f);


(iii) With the exception of initial tap sampling conducted pursuant to § 141.86(c)(2)(i), a certification that the results of monitoring from the tap monitoring period before the applicable tap monitoring period described in this paragraph (a)(2) were made publicly accessible, as specified in § 141.86(h);


(iv) The 90th percentile lead and copper concentrations calculated from lead and copper tap water samples collected during each tap sampling period in accordance with § 141.80(c)(3), unless the State calculates the water system's 90th percentile lead and copper levels under paragraph (h) of this section;


(v) With the exception of initial tap sampling conducted pursuant to § 141.86(c)(2)(i), the water system must identify any site which was not sampled during the tap monitoring period previous to the applicable tap monitoring period described in this paragraph (a)(2), and include an explanation of why sampling sites have changed;


(vi) The results of all tap samples for water quality parameters that are required to be collected under § 141.87(b) through (d);


(vii) The results of all samples collected at the entry point(s) to the distribution system for applicable water quality parameters under § 141.87(b) through (d); and


(viii) The number of sites from which the system requested customer participation for sampling during the tap sampling period and the customer was either non-responsive after two attempts or refused to participate.


(3) For a non-transient non-community water system, or a community water system meeting the criteria of § 141.85(b)(8), that does not have enough taps that can provide first liter or first-and fifth-liter paired samples meeting the six-hour minimum stagnation time, the water system must either:


(i) Provide written documentation identifying standing times and locations for samples that do not meet the six-hour minimum stagnation time to make up a system's sampling pool in order to meet the minimum number of sites to sample as required in § 141.86(b)(3) by the start of the system's first applicable tap monitoring period under § 141.86(c), or if there are changes to the documentation, prior to the next tap sampling period, unless the State has waived prior approval of sample sites not meeting the six-hour stagnation time selected by the water system pursuant to § 141.86(b)(3); or


(ii) If the State has waived prior approval of sample sites not meeting the six-hour stagnation time selected by the system, identify, in writing, each site that did not meet the six-hour minimum stagnation time and the length of standing time for that particular substitute sample collected pursuant to § 141.86(b)(3) and include this information with the lead and copper tap sample results required to be submitted pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.


(4) At a time specified by the State, or if no specific time is designated, as early as possible but no later than six months prior to the addition of a new source or any long-term change in water treatment, a water system must submit written documentation describing the addition of a new source or long-term change in treatment to the State. Systems may not implement the addition of a new source or long-term treatment change without State approval. The State must review and approve the addition of a new source or a long-term change in water treatment before it can be implemented by the water system. The State may require any such water system to take actions before or after the addition of a new source or long-term treatment change to ensure that the water system will operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment, such as additional water quality parameter monitoring, additional lead or copper tap sampling, and re-evaluating corrosion control treatment. Examples of long-term treatment changes include but are not limited to the addition of a new treatment process or modification of an existing treatment process. Examples of modifications include switching secondary disinfectants, switching coagulants (*e.g.,* alum to ferric chloride), and switching corrosion inhibitor products (*e.g.,* orthophosphate to blended phosphate). Long-term treatment changes can also include dose changes to existing chemicals if the system is planning long-term changes to its finished water pH or residual inhibitor concentration. Long-term treatment changes would not include chemical dose fluctuations associated with daily raw water quality changes where a new source has not been added.


(5) Any system serving 3,300 or fewer persons applying for a monitoring waiver under § 141.86(g), or subject to a waiver granted pursuant to § 141.86(g)(3), must provide the following information to the State in writing by the specified deadline:
