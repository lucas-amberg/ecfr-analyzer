# § 141.153   Content of the reports.

(a) Each community water system must provide to its customers a report(s) that contains the information specified in this section, § 141.154, and include a summary as specified in § 141.156.


(b) Information on the source of the water delivered:


(1) Each report must identify the source(s) of the water delivered by the community water system by providing information on:


(i) The type of the water: e.g., surface water, ground water; and


(ii) The commonly used name (if any) and location of the body (or bodies) of water.


(2) If a source water assessment has been completed, the report must notify consumers of the availability of this information, the year it was completed or most recently updated, and the means to obtain it. In addition, systems are encouraged to highlight in the report significant sources of contamination in the source water area if they have readily available information. Where a system has received a source water assessment from the primacy agency, the report must include a brief summary of the system's susceptibility to potential sources of contamination, using language provided by the primacy agency or written by the operator.


(c) *Definitions.* (1) Each report must include the following definitions:


(i) *Maximum Contaminant Level Goal or MCLG:* The level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety.


(ii) *Maximum Contaminant Level or MCL:* The highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to the MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment technology.


(iii) *Contaminant:* Any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter in water.




(2) A report for a community water system operating under a variance or an exemption issued under § 1415 or 1416 of SDWA must include the following definition: *Variances and Exemptions:* State or EPA permission not to meet an MCL or a treatment technique under certain conditions.


(3) A report that contains data on contaminants that EPA regulates using any of the following terms must include the applicable definitions: 


(i) *Treatment Technique:* A required process intended to reduce the level of a contaminant in drinking water.


(ii) *Action Level:* The concentration of a contaminant which, if exceeded, triggers treatment or other requirements which a water system must follow.


(iii) *Maximum residual disinfectant level goal or MRDLG:* The level of a drinking water disinfectant below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MRDLGs do not reflect the benefits of the use of disinfectants to control microbial contaminants. 


(iv) *Maximum residual disinfectant level or MRDL:* The highest level of a disinfectant allowed in drinking water. There is convincing evidence that addition of a disinfectant is necessary for control of microbial contaminants. 


(v) *Hazard Index or HI.* The Hazard Index is an approach that determines the health concerns associated with mixtures of certain PFAS in finished drinking water. Low levels of multiple PFAS that individually would not likely result in adverse health effects may pose health concerns when combined in a mixture. The Hazard Index MCL represents the maximum level for mixtures of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and/or PFBS allowed in water delivered by a public water system. A Hazard Index greater than 1 requires a system to take action.


(4) A report that contains information regarding a Level 1 or Level 2 Assessment required under Subpart Y of this part must include the applicable definitions:


(i) *Level 1 Assessment:* A Level 1 assessment is a study of the water system to identify potential problems and determine (if possible) why total coliform bacteria have been found in our water system.


(ii) *Level 2 Assessment:* A Level 2 assessment is a very detailed study of the water system to identify potential problems and determine (if possible) why an *E. coli* MCL violation has occurred and/or why total coliform bacteria have been found in our water system on multiple occasions.


(5) Systems must use the following definitions for the terms listed below if the terms are used in the report unless the system obtains written approval from the state to use an alternate definition:


(i) *Pesticide:* Generally, any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.


(ii) *Herbicide:* Any chemical(s) used to control undesirable vegetation.




(d) *Information on detected contaminants.* (1) This sub-section specifies the requirements for information to be included in each report for contaminants subject to mandatory monitoring (except *Cryptosporidium*). It applies to:


(i) Contaminants subject to a MCL, action level, maximum residual disinfectant level, or treatment technique (regulated contaminants); and 


(ii) Contaminants for which monitoring is required by § 141.40 (unregulated contaminants).


(2) The data relating to these contaminants must be presented in the reports in a manner that is clear and understandable for consumers. For example, the data may be displayed in one table or in several adjacent tables. Any additional monitoring results which a community water system chooses to include in its report must be displayed separately.


(3) The data must be derived from data collected to comply with EPA and State monitoring and analytical requirements during the previous calendar year, or the most recent calendar year before the previous calendar year except that:


(i) Where a system is allowed to monitor for regulated contaminants less often than once a year, the contaminant data section must include the date and results of the most recent sampling and the report must include a brief statement indicating that the data presented in the report are from the most recent testing done in accordance with the regulations. No data older than 5 years need be included.


(ii) [Reserved]


(4) For each detected regulated contaminant (listed in appendix A to this subpart), the contaminant data section(s) must contain:


(i) The MCL for that contaminant expressed as a number equal to or greater than 1.0 (as provided in appendix A to this subpart);


(ii) The MCLG for that contaminant expressed in the same units as the MCL;


(iii) If there is no MCL for a detected contaminant, the contaminant data section(s) must indicate that there is a treatment technique, or specify the action level, applicable to that contaminant, and the report must include the definitions for treatment technique and/or action level, as appropriate, specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;


(iv) For contaminants subject to an MCL, except turbidity and *E. coli,* the contaminant data section(s) must contain the highest contaminant level used to determine compliance with an NPDWR and the range of detected levels, as follows:


(A) When compliance with the MCL is determined annually or less frequently: The highest detected level at any sampling point and the range of detected levels expressed in the same units as the MCL.


(B) When compliance with the MCL is determined by calculating a running annual average of all samples taken at a monitoring location: the highest average of any of the monitoring locations and the range of individual sample results for all monitoring locations expressed in the same units as the MCL. For the MCLs for TTHM and HAA5 in § 141.64(b)(2), systems must include the highest locational running annual average for TTHM and HAA5 and the range of individual sample results for all monitoring locations expressed in the same units as the MCL. If more than one location exceeds the TTHM or HAA5 MCL, the system must include the locational running annual averages for all locations that exceed the MCL.


(v) For turbidity.


(A) When it is reported pursuant to § 141.13: The highest average monthly value.


(B) When it is reported pursuant to the requirements of § 141.71: the highest monthly value. The report should include an explanation of the reasons for measuring turbidity.


(C) When it is reported pursuant to § 141.73 or § 141.173 or § 141.551: the highest single measurement and the lowest monthly percentage of samples meeting the turbidity limits specified in § 141.73 or § 141.173, or § 141.551 for the filtration technology being used. The report should include an explanation of the reasons for measuring turbidity;


(vi) For lead and copper: the 90th percentile concentration of the most recent round(s) of sampling, the number of sampling sites exceeding the action level, and the range of tap sampling results;


(vii)-(viii) [Reserved]


(ix) The likely source(s) of detected contaminants to the best of the operator's knowledge. Specific information regarding contaminants may be available in sanitary surveys and source water assessments, and should be used when available to the operator. If the operator lacks specific information on the likely source, the report must include one or more of the typical sources for that contaminant listed in appendix A to this subpart that is most applicable to the system; and


(x) For *E. coli* analytical results under subpart Y: The total number of *E. coli* positive samples;


(5) If a community water system distributes water to its customers from multiple hydraulically independent distribution systems that are fed by different raw water sources, the contaminant data section(s) should differentiate contaminant data for each service area and the report should identify each separate distribution system. For example, if displayed in a table, it should contain a separate column for each service area. Alternatively, systems could produce separate reports tailored to include data for each service area.


(6) The detected contaminant data section(s) must clearly identify any data indicating violations of MCLs, MRDLs, or treatment techniques, and the report must contain a clear and readily understandable explanation of the violation including: the length of the violation, the potential adverse health effects, and actions taken by the system to address the violation. To describe the potential health effects, the system must use the relevant language of appendix A to this subpart.


(7) For detected unregulated contaminants for which monitoring is required, the reports must present the average and range at which the contaminant was detected. The report must include a brief explanation of the reasons for monitoring for unregulated contaminants such as:


(i) Unregulated contaminant monitoring helps EPA to determine where certain contaminants occur and whether the Agency should consider regulating those contaminants in the future.


(ii) May use an alternative educational statement in the CCR if approved by the Primacy Agency.


(8) For systems that exceeded the lead action level in § 141.80(c), the detected contaminant data section must clearly identify the exceedance if any corrective action has been required by the Administrator or the State during the monitoring period covered by the report. The report must include a clear and readily understandable explanation of the exceedance, the steps consumers can take to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water, and a description of any corrective actions the system has or will take to address the exceedance.




(e) Information on *Cryptosporidium,* radon, and other contaminants:


(1) If the system has performed any monitoring for *Cryptosporidium* which indicates that *Cryptosporidium* may be present in the source water or the finished water, the report must include:


(i) A summary of the results of the monitoring; and


(ii) An explanation of the significance of the results.


(2) If the system has performed any monitoring for radon which indicates that radon may be present in the finished water, the report must include:


(i) The results of the monitoring; and


(ii) An explanation of the significance of the results.


(3) If the system has performed additional monitoring which indicates the presence of other contaminants in the finished water, EPA strongly encourages systems to report any results which may indicate a health concern. To determine if results may indicate a health concern, EPA recommends that systems find out if EPA has proposed an NPDWR or issued a health advisory for that contaminant by contacting the Agency by calling the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) or an alternative method identified on the website *epa.gov/safewater.* EPA considers detects above a proposed MCL or health advisory level to indicate possible health concerns. For such contaminants, EPA recommends that the report include:


(i) The results of the monitoring; and


(ii) An explanation of the significance of the results noting the existence of a health advisory or a proposed regulation.


(f) Compliance with NPDWR. In addition to the requirements of paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the report must note any violation that occurred during the period covered by the report of a requirement listed below, and include a clear and readily understandable explanation of the violation, any potential adverse health effects, and the steps the system has taken to correct the violation.


(1) Monitoring and reporting of compliance data;


(2) Filtration and disinfection prescribed by subpart H of this part. For systems which have failed to install adequate filtration or disinfection equipment or processes, or have had a failure of such equipment or processes which constitutes a violation, the report must include the following language as part of the explanation of potential adverse health effects: Inadequately treated water may contain disease-causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites which can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches.


(3) Lead and copper control requirements prescribed by subpart I of this part. For systems that fail to take one or more actions prescribed by §§ 141.80 through 141.93, the report must include the applicable language of appendix A to this subpart for lead, copper, or both.




(4) Treatment techniques for Acrylamide and Epichlorohydrin prescribed by subpart K of this part. For systems that violate the requirements of subpart K of this part, the report must include the relevant language from appendix A to this subpart. 


(5) Recordkeeping of compliance data.


(6) Special monitoring requirements prescribed by §§ 141.40 and 141.41; and


(7) Violation of the terms of a variance, an exemption, or an administrative or judicial order.


(g) Variances and Exemptions. If a system is operating under the terms of a variance or an exemption issued under § 1415 or 1416 of SDWA, the report must contain:


(1) An explanation of the reasons for the variance or exemption;


(2) The date on which the variance or exemption was issued;


(3) A brief status report on the steps the system is taking to install treatment, find alternative sources of water, or otherwise comply with the terms and schedules of the variance or exemption; and


(4) A notice of any opportunity for public input in the review, or renewal, of the variance or exemption.


(h) Additional information:


(1) The report must contain a brief explanation regarding contaminants which may reasonably be expected to be found in drinking water including bottled water. This explanation may include the language of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section or systems may use their own comparable language. The report also must include the language of paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.


(i) Both tap water and bottled water come from rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material. The water can also pick up and transport substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. These substances are also called contaminants.


(ii) Contaminants are any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter in water. Contaminants that may be present in source water include:


(A) *Microbial contaminants,* such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.


(B) *Inorganic contaminants,* such as salts and metals, which can occur naturally in the soil or groundwater or may result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming.


(C) *Pesticides and herbicides,* which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.


(D) *Organic chemical contaminants,* including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, and septic systems.


(E) *Radioactive contaminants,* which can occur naturally or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.


(iii) To protect public health, the Environmental Protection Agency prescribes regulations which limit the amount of certain contaminants in tap water provided by public water systems. The Food and Drug Administration regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water which must provide the same protection for public health.


(iv) Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily mean that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by contacting the Environmental Protection Agency by calling the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) or visiting the website *epa.gov/safewater.*

(2) The report must include the telephone number of the owner, operator, or designee of the community water system as a source of additional information concerning the report. If a system uses a website or social media to share additional information, EPA recommends including information about how to access such media platforms in the report.


(3) In communities with a large proportion of consumers with limited English proficiency, as determined by the Primacy Agency, the report must contain information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the importance of the report and either contain information where such consumers may obtain a translated copy of the report, or assistance in the appropriate language(s), or the report must be in the appropriate language(s).


(4) The report must include information (e.g., time and place of regularly scheduled board meetings) about opportunities for public participation in decisions that may affect the quality of the water.


(5) The systems may include such additional information as they deem necessary for public education consistent with, and not detracting from, the purpose of the report.


(6) Systems required to comply with subpart S of this part.


(i) Any ground water system that receives notice from the State of a significant deficiency or notice from a laboratory of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample that is not invalidated by the State under § 141.402(d) must inform its customers of any significant deficiency that is uncorrected at the time of the next reporting period or of any fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample in the next report or 6-month update according to § 141.155. The system must continue to inform the public annually until the State determines that particular significant deficiency is corrected or the fecal contamination in the ground water source is addressed under § 141.403(a). Each report must include the following elements:


(A) The nature of the particular significant deficiency or the source of the fecal contamination (if the source is known) and the date the significant deficiency was identified by the State or the dates of the fecal indicator-positive ground water source samples;


(B) If the fecal contamination in the ground water source has been addressed under § 141.403(a) and the date of such action;


(C) For each significant deficiency or fecal contamination in the ground water source that has not been addressed under § 141.403(a), the State-approved plan and schedule for correction, including interim measures, progress to date, and any interim measures completed; and


(D) If the system receives notice of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample that is not invalidated by the State under § 141.402(d), the potential health effects using the health effects language of appendix A to this subpart.

Systems may use an alternative statement with equivalent information for paragraphs (h)(7)(i)(B) and (C) of this section if approved by the primacy agency.


(A) Coliforms are bacteria that occur naturally in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentially harmful, waterborne organisms may be present or that a potential pathway exists through which contamination may enter the drinking water distribution system. We found coliforms indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution. When this occurs, we are required to conduct assessment(s) to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found during these assessments.


(B) Because we found coliforms during sampling, we were required to conduct [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 1 ASSESSMENTS] assessment(s) of the system, also known as a Level 1 assessment, to identify possible sources of contamination. [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 1 ASSESSMENTS] Level 1 assessment(s) were completed. In addition, we were required to take [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] of these actions.


(C) Because we found coliforms during sampling, we were required to conduct [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 2 ASSESSMENTS] detailed assessments, also known as a Level 2 assessment, to identify possible sources of contamination. [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 2 ASSESSMENTS] Level 2 assessments were completed. In addition, we were required to take [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] of these actions.


(D) Any system that has failed to complete all the required assessments or correct all identified sanitary defects, is in violation of the treatment technique requirement and must also include one or both of the following statements, as appropriate:


(*1*) During the past year we failed to conduct all the required assessment(s).


(*2*) During the past year we failed to correct all identified defects that were found during the assessment.


(ii) Any system required to conduct a Level 2 assessment due to an *E. coli* MCL violation must include in the report the text found in paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, and health effects language in appendix A to this subpart, filling in the blanks accordingly and the text found in paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(C)(1) and (2) of this section, if appropriate. Systems may use an alternative statement with equivalent information for paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, if approved by the primacy agency.


(A) We found *E. coli* bacteria, indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution. When this occurs, we are required to conduct assessment(s), also known as a Level 2 assessment, to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found during these assessments.


(B) We were required to complete a detailed assessment of our water system, also known as a Level 2 assessment, because we found *E. coli* in our water system. In addition, we were required to take [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] of these actions.


(C) Any system that has failed to complete the required assessment or correct all identified sanitary defects, is in violation of the treatment technique requirement and must also include one or both of the following statements, as appropriate:


(*1*) We failed to conduct the required assessment.


(*2*) We failed to correct all defects that were identified during the assessment that we conducted.


(iii) If a system detects *E. coli* and has violated the *E. coli MCL,* in addition to completing the table as required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the system must include one or more of the following statements to describe any noncompliance, as applicable:


(A) We had an *E. coli*-positive repeat sample following a total coliform-positive routine sample.


(B) We had a total coliform-positive repeat sample following an *E. coli*-positive routine sample.


(C) We failed to take all required repeat samples following an *E. coli*-positive routine sample.


(D) We failed to test for *E. coli* when any repeat sample tested positive for total coliform.


(iv) If a system detects *E. coli* and has not violated the *E. coli MCL,* in addition to completing the table as required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the system may include a statement that explains that although they have detected *E. coli,* they are not in violation of the *E. coli* MCL.


(8) Systems required to comply with subpart I of this part.


(i) The report must notify consumers that complete lead tap sampling data are available for review and must include information on how to access the data.


(ii) The report must include a statement that a service line inventory (including inventories where the publicly accessible inventory consists of a written statement that there are no lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines, known lead connectors or connectors of unknown material) has been prepared and include instructions to access the publicly accessible service line inventory. If the service line inventory is available online, the report must include the direct link to the inventory.


(iii) For systems with lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines in the system's inventory pursuant to § 141.84(a) and (b), the report must include information on how to obtain a copy of the service line replacement plan or a direct link to the plan if the system is required to make the service line replacement plan available online.


(iv) The report must contain a plainly worded explanation of the corrosion control efforts the system is taking in accordance with subpart I of this part. Corrosion control efforts consist of treatment (*e.g.,* pH adjustment, alkalinity adjustment, or corrosion inhibitor addition) and other efforts contributing to the control of the corrosivity of water (*e.g.,* monitoring to assess the corrosivity of water). The system may use one of the following templates or use their own explanation that includes equivalent information.


(A) For systems with State or EPA-designated Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment:


(*1*) Corrosion of pipes, plumbing fittings, and fixtures may cause lead and copper to enter drinking water. To assess corrosion of lead and copper, [name of system] conducts tap sampling for lead and copper at selected sites [insert frequency at which system conducts tap sampling]. [Name of system] treats water using [identify treatment method] to control corrosion, which was designated as the optimal corrosion control treatment by [the State or EPA, as applicable]. To ensure the treatment is operating effectively, [name of system] monitors water quality parameters set by the [the State or EPA, as applicable] [insert frequency at which system conducts water quality parameter monitoring].


(*2*) If applicable add: [Name of system] is currently conducting a study of corrosion control to determine if any changes to treatment methods are needed to minimize the corrosivity of the water.


(B) For systems without State or EPA designated Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment:


(*1*) Corrosion of pipes, plumbing fittings and fixtures may cause metals, including lead and copper, to enter drinking water. To assess corrosion of lead and copper, [name of system] conducts tap sampling for lead and copper at selected sites [insert frequency at which system conducts tap sampling].
