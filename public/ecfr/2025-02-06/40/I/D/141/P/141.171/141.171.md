# § 141.171   Criteria for avoiding filtration.

In addition to the requirements of § 141.71, a public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that does not provide filtration must meet all of the conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(a) *Site-specific conditions.* In addition to site-specific conditions in § 141.71(b), systems must maintain the watershed control program under § 141.71(b)(2) to minimize the potential for contamination by *Cryptosporidium* oocysts in the source water. The watershed control program must, for *Cryptosporidium*:


(1) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality; and 


(2) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.


(b) During the onsite inspection conducted under the provisions of § 141.71(b)(3), the State must determine whether the watershed control program established under § 141.71(b)(2) is adequate to limit potential contamination by *Cryptosporidium* oocysts. The adequacy of the program must be based on the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of the system's program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which the water system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed.
