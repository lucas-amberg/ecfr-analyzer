# § 141.533   What data must my system collect to calculate a disinfection profile?

Your system must monitor the following parameters to determine the total log inactivation using the analytical methods in § 141.74 (a), once per week on the same calendar day, over 12 consecutive months: 


(a) The temperature of the disinfected water at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow; 


(b) If your system uses chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow; 


(c) The disinfectant contact time(s) (“T”) during peak hourly flow; and 


(d) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (“C”) of the water before or at the first customer and prior to each additional point of disinfection during peak hourly flow.
