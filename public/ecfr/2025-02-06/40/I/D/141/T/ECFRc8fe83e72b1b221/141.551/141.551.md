# § 141.551   What strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits must my system meet?

Your system must meet two strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits. 


(a) The first combined filter effluent turbidity limit is a “95th percentile” turbidity limit that your system must meet in at least 95 percent of the turbidity measurements taken each month. Measurements must continue to be taken as described in § 141.74(a) and (c). Monthly reporting must be completed according to § 141.570. The following table describes the required limits for specific filtration technologies.

Measurements must continue to be taken as described in § 141.74(a) and (c). Monthly reporting must be completed according to § 141.570.
