# § 141.602   System specific studies.

(a) *System specific study plan.* Your system specific study plan must be based on either existing monitoring results as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or modeling as required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. You must prepare and submit your system specific study plan to the State according to the schedule in § 141.600(c).


(1) *Existing monitoring results.* You may comply by submitting monitoring results collected before you are required to begin monitoring under § 141.600(c). The monitoring results and analysis must meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section.


(i) *Minimum requirements.* (A) TTHM and HAA5 results must be based on samples collected and analyzed in accordance with § 141.131. Samples must be collected no earlier than five years prior to the study plan submission date.


(B) The monitoring locations and frequency must meet the conditions identified in this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B). Each location must be sampled once during the peak historical month for TTHM levels or HAA5 levels or the month of warmest water temperature for every 12 months of data submitted for that location. Monitoring results must include all subpart L compliance monitoring results plus additional monitoring results as necessary to meet minimum sample requirements.


(ii) *Reporting monitoring results.* You must report the information in this paragraph (a)(1)(ii).


(A) You must report previously collected monitoring results and certify that the reported monitoring results include all compliance and non-compliance results generated during the time period beginning with the first reported result and ending with the most recent subpart L results.


(B) You must certify that the samples were representative of the entire distribution system and that treatment, and distribution system have not changed significantly since the samples were collected.


(C) Your study monitoring plan must include a schematic of your distribution system (including distribution system entry points and their sources, and storage facilities), with notes indicating the locations and dates of all completed or planned system specific study monitoring.


(D) Your system specific study plan must specify the population served and system type (subpart H or ground water).


(E) You must retain a complete copy of your system specific study plan submitted under this paragraph (a)(1), including any State modification of your system specific study plan, for as long as you are required to retain your IDSE report under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.


(F) If you submit previously collected data that fully meet the number of samples required under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section and the State rejects some of the data, you must either conduct additional monitoring to replace rejected data on a schedule the State approves or conduct standard monitoring under § 141.601.


(2) *Modeling.* You may comply through analysis of an extended period simulation hydraulic model. The extended period simulation hydraulic model and analysis must meet the criteria in this paragraph (a)(2).


(i) *Minimum requirements.* (A) The model must simulate 24 hour variation in demand and show a consistently repeating 24 hour pattern of residence time.


(B) The model must represent the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (9) of this section.


(1) 75% of pipe volume;


(2) 50% of pipe length;


(3) All pressure zones;


(4) All 12-inch diameter and larger pipes;


(5) All 8-inch and larger pipes that connect pressure zones, influence zones from different sources, storage facilities, major demand areas, pumps, and control valves, or are known or expected to be significant conveyors of water;


(6) All 6-inch and larger pipes that connect remote areas of a distribution system to the main portion of the system;


(7) All storage facilities with standard operations represented in the model; and


(8) All active pump stations with controls represented in the model; and


(9) All active control valves.


(C) The model must be calibrated, or have calibration plans, for the current configuration of the distribution system during the period of high TTHM formation potential. All storage facilities must be evaluated as part of the calibration process. All required calibration must be completed no later than 12 months after plan submission.


(ii) *Reporting modeling.* Your system specific study plan must include the information in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii).


(A) Tabular or spreadsheet data demonstrating that the model meets requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section.


(B) A description of all calibration activities undertaken, and if calibration is complete, a graph of predicted tank levels versus measured tank levels for the storage facility with the highest residence time in each pressure zone, and a time series graph of the residence time at the longest residence time storage facility in the distribution system showing the predictions for the entire simulation period (*i.e.*, from time zero until the time it takes to for the model to reach a consistently repeating pattern of residence time).


(C) Model output showing preliminary 24 hour average residence time predictions throughout the distribution system.


(D) Timing and number of samples representative of the distribution system planned for at least one monitoring period of TTHM and HAA5 dual sample monitoring at a number of locations no less than would be required for the system under standard monitoring in § 141.601 during the historical month of high TTHM. These samples must be taken at locations other than existing subpart L compliance monitoring locations.


(E) Description of how all requirements will be completed no later than 12 months after you submit your system specific study plan.


(F) Schematic of your distribution system (including distribution system entry points and their sources, and storage facilities), with notes indicating the locations and dates of all completed system specific study monitoring (if calibration is complete) and all subpart L compliance monitoring.


(G) Population served and system type (subpart H or ground water).


(H) You must retain a complete copy of your system specific study plan submitted under this paragraph (a)(2), including any State modification of your system specific study plan, for as long as you are required to retain your IDSE report under paragraph (b)(7) of this section.


(iii) If you submit a model that does not fully meet the requirements under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must correct the deficiencies and respond to State inquiries concerning the model. If you fail to correct deficiencies or respond to inquiries to the State's satisfaction, you must conduct standard monitoring under § 141.601.


(b) *IDSE report.* Your IDSE report must include the elements required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section. You must submit your IDSE report according to the schedule in § 141.600(c).


(1) Your IDSE report must include all TTHM and HAA5 analytical results from subpart L compliance monitoring and all system specific study monitoring conducted during the period of the system specific study presented in a tabular or spreadsheet format acceptable to the State. If changed from your system specific study plan submitted under paragraph (a) of this section, your IDSE report must also include a schematic of your distribution system, the population served, and system type (subpart H or ground water).


(2) If you used the modeling provision under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must include final information for the elements described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, and a 24-hour time series graph of residence time for each subpart V compliance monitoring location selected.


(3) You must recommend and justify subpart V compliance monitoring locations and timing based on the protocol in § 141.605.


(4) Your IDSE report must include an explanation of any deviations from your approved system specific study plan.


(5) Your IDSE report must include the basis (analytical and modeling results) and justification you used to select the recommended subpart V monitoring locations.


(6) You may submit your IDSE report in lieu of your system specific study plan on the schedule identified in § 141.600(c) for submission of the system specific study plan if you believe that you have the necessary information by the time that the system specific study plan is due. If you elect this approach, your IDSE report must also include all information required under paragraph (a) of this section.


(7) You must retain a complete copy of your IDSE report submitted under this section for 10 years after the date that you submitted your IDSE report. If the State modifies the subpart V monitoring requirements that you recommended in your IDSE report or if the State approves alternative monitoring locations, you must keep a copy of the State's notification on file for 10 years after the date of the State's notification. You must make the IDSE report and any State notification available for review by the State or the public.
