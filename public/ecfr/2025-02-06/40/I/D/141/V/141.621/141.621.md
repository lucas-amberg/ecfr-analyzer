# § 141.621   Routine monitoring.

(a) *Monitoring.* (1) If you submitted an IDSE report, you must begin monitoring at the locations and months you have recommended in your IDSE report submitted under § 141.605 following the schedule in § 141.620(c), unless the State requires other locations or additional locations after its review. If you submitted a 40/30 certification under § 141.603 or you qualified for a very small system waiver under § 141.604 or you are a nontransient noncommunity water system serving <10,000, you must monitor at the location(s) and dates identified in your monitoring plan in § 141.132(f), updated as required by § 141.622.


(2) You must monitor at no fewer than the number of locations identified in this paragraph (a)(2).


(3) If you are an undisinfected system that begins using a disinfectant other than UV light after the dates in subpart U of this part for complying with the Initial Distribution System Evaluation requirements, you must consult with the State to identify compliance monitoring locations for this subpart. You must then develop a monitoring plan under § 141.622 that includes those monitoring locations.


(b) *Analytical methods.* You must use an approved method listed in § 141.131 for TTHM and HAA5 analyses in this subpart. Analyses must be conducted by laboratories that have received certification by EPA or the State as specified in § 141.131.
