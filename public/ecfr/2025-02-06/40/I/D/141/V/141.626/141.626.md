# ยง 141.626   Operational evaluation levels.

(a) You have exceeded the operational evaluation level at any monitoring location where the sum of the two previous quarters' TTHM results plus twice the current quarter's TTHM result, divided by 4 to determine an average, exceeds 0.080 mg/L, or where the sum of the two previous quarters' HAA5 results plus twice the current quarter's HAA5 result, divided by 4 to determine an average, exceeds 0.060 mg/L.


(b)(1) If you exceed the operational evaluation level, you must conduct an operational evaluation and submit a written report of the evaluation to the State no later than 90 days after being notified of the analytical result that causes you to exceed the operational evaluation level. The written report must be made available to the public upon request.


(2) Your operational evaluation must include an examination of system treatment and distribution operational practices, including storage tank operations, excess storage capacity, distribution system flushing, changes in sources or source water quality, and treatment changes or problems that may contribute to TTHM and HAA5 formation and what steps could be considered to minimize future exceedances.


(i) You may request and the State may allow you to limit the scope of your evaluation if you are able to identify the cause of the operational evaluation level exceedance.


(ii) Your request to limit the scope of the evaluation does not extend the schedule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for submitting the written report. The State must approve this limited scope of evaluation in writing and you must keep that approval with the completed report.
