# § 141.852   Analytical methods and laboratory certification.

(a) *Analytical methodology.* (1) The standard sample volume required for analysis, regardless of analytical method used, is 100 ml.


(2) Systems need only determine the presence or absence of total coliforms and *E. coli;* a determination of density is not required.


(3) The time from sample collection to initiation of test medium incubation may not exceed 30 hours. Systems are encouraged but not required to hold samples below 10 deg. C during transit.


(4) If water having residual chlorine (measured as free, combined, or total chlorine) is to be analyzed, sufficient sodium thiosulfate (Na_2_S_2_O_3_) must be added to the sample bottle before sterilization to neutralize any residual chlorine in the water sample. Dechlorination procedures are addressed in Section 9060A.2 of *Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater* (20th and 21st editions).


(5) Systems must conduct total coliform and *E. coli* analyses in accordance with one of the analytical methods in the following table or one of the alternative methods listed in Appendix A to subpart C of part 141.


(b) *Laboratory certification.* Systems must have all compliance samples required under this subpart analyzed by a laboratory certified by the EPA or a primacy State to analyze drinking water samples. The laboratory used by the system must be certified for each method (and associated contaminant(s)) used for compliance monitoring analyses under this rule.


(c) *Incorporation by reference.* The standards required in this section are incorporated by reference into this section with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. To enforce any edition other than that specified in this section, EPA must publish notice of change in the _Federal Register_ and the material must be available to the public. All approved material is available for inspection either electronically at *www.regulations.gov,* in hard copy at the Water Docket, or from the sources indicated below. The Docket ID is EPA-HQ-OW-2008-0878. Hard copies of these documents may be viewed at the Water Docket in the EPA Docket Center, (EPA/DC) EPA West, Room 3334, 1301 Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC.
