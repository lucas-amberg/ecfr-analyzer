# § 142.15   Reports by States.

Each State which has primary enforcement responsibility shall submit to the Administrator the following information: 


(a) Each State which has primary enforcement responsibility shall submit quarterly reports to the Administrator on a schedule and in a format prescribed by the Administrator, consisting of the following information:


(1) New violations by public water systems in the State during the previous quarter of State regulations adopted to incorporate the requirements of national primary drinking water regulations, including violations of the public notification requirements under subpart Q of part 141 of this chapter; 


(2) New enforcement actions taken by the State during the previous quarter against public water systems with respect to State regulations adopted to incorporate the requirements of national primary drinking water regulations;


(3) Notification of any new variance or exemption granted during the previous quarter. The notice shall include a statement of reasons for the granting of the variance or exemption, including documentation of the need for the variance or exemption and the finding that the granting of the variance or exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to health. The State may use a single notification statement to report two or more similar variances or exemptions.


(b) Each State which has primary enforcement responsibility must submit annual reports to the Administrator on a schedule and in a format prescribed by the Administrator, consisting of the following information:


(1) All additions or corrections to the State's inventory of public water systems;


(2) A summary of the status of each variance and exemption currently in effect; and


(3) No earlier than May 24, 2027, compliance monitoring data and related monitoring data necessary for determining compliance for all National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs) in 40 CFR part 141.




(c) *Special reports*—(1) *Surface Water Treatment Rule.* (i)(A) A list identifying the name, PWS identification number and date of the determination for each public water system supplied by a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water, which the State has determined is not required to provide filtration treatment.


(B) A list identifying the name and PWS identification number of each public water system supplied by a surface water source or ground water source under the direct influence of surface water, which the State has determined, based on an evaluation of site-specific considerations, has no means of having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and temperature conditions specified in § 141.74(a)(3) and is providing adequate disinfection in the distribution system, regardless of whether the system is in compliance with the criteria of § 141.72 (a)(4)(i) or (b)(3)(i) of this chapter, as allowed by § 141.72 (a)(4)(ii) and (b)(3)(ii). The list must include the effective date of each determination.


(ii) Notification within 60 days of the end of the calendar quarter of any determination that a public water system using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water is not required to provide filtration treatment. The notification must include a statement describing the system's compliance with each requirement of the State's regulations that implement § 141.71 and a summary of comments, if any, received from the public on the determination. A single notification may be used to report two or more such determinations.

(B) For each water system, regardless of size, the 90th percentile copper level calculated during each tap sampling period specified in § 141.86 of this chapter, in which the system exceeds the copper action level, and the first and last days of each tap sampling period in which an exceedance occurred.


(C) For each water system for which the State has designated optimal water quality parameters under § 141.82(f) of this chapter, the specific corrosion control treatment designated, the date of the determination, and the paragraph(s) under § 141.82(f) which the State made its determination, the water system's optimal water quality parameters.


(D) For each water system the total number of lead service lines, galvanized requiring replacement service lines, lead status unknown service lines, non-lead service lines, lead connectors, and connectors of unknown material in its inventory, reported separately.


(E) For each water system required to conduct mandatory replacement of lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines as specified in § 141.84(d) of this chapter, the total number and type of service lines replaced, the applicable deadline for the system to complete replacement of all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines, and the expected date of completion of mandatory service line replacement.


(F) For each water system that has implemented optimal corrosion control pursuant to § 141.82 of this chapter, completed applicable source water treatment requirements pursuant to § 141.83 of this chapter, and/or completed mandatory service line replacement requirements pursuant to § 141.84(d) of this chapter, and the date of the State's determination that these requirements have been met.
