(1) Proper and effective installation, operation and maintenance of the applicable small system variance technology in accordance with guidance published by the Administrator pursuant to section 1412(b)(15) of the Act, taking into consideration any relevant source water characteristics and any other site-specific conditions that may affect proper and effective operation and maintenance of the technology;


(2) Monitoring requirements, for the contaminant for which a small system variance is sought, as specified in 40 CFR part 141; and


(3) Any other terms or conditions that are necessary to ensure adequate protection of public health, which may include:


(i) Public education requirements; and


(ii) Source water protection requirements.


(c) The State or the Administrator must establish a schedule for the public water system to comply with the terms and conditions of the small system variance which must include, at a minimum, the following requirements:


(1) Increments of progress, such as milestone dates for the public water system to apply for financial assistance and begin capital improvements;


(2) Quarterly reporting to the State or Administrator of the public water system's compliance with the terms and conditions of the small system variance;


(3) Schedule for the State or the Administrator to review the small system variance under paragraph (d) of this section; and


(4) Compliance with the terms and conditions of the small system variance as soon as practicable but not later than 3 years after the date on which the small system variance is granted. The Administrator or State may allow up to 2 additional years if the Administrator or State determines that additional time is necessary for the public water system to:


(i) Complete necessary capital improvements to comply with the small system variance technology, secure an alternative source of water, or restructure or consolidate; or


(ii) Obtain financial assistance provided pursuant to section 1452 of the Act or any other Federal or State program.


(d) The State or the Administrator must review each small system variance granted not less often than every 5 years after the compliance date established in the small system variance to determine whether the public water system continues to meet the eligibility criteria and remains eligible for the small system variance and is complying with the terms and conditions of the small system variance. If the public water system would no longer be eligible for a small system variance, the State or the Administrator must determine whether continuing the variance is in the public interest. If the State or the Administrator finds that continuing the variance is not in the public interest, the variance must be withdrawn.
