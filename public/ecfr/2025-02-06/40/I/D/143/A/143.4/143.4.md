(a) It is recommended that the parameters in these regulations should be monitored at intervals no less frequent than the monitoring performed for inorganic chemical contaminants listed in the National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulations as applicable to community water systems. More frequent monitoring would be appropriate for specific parameters such as pH, color, odor or others under certain circumstances as directed by the State.


(b) Measurement of pH, copper and fluoride to determine compliance under ยง 143.3 may be conducted with one of the methods in ยง 141.23(k)(1). Analyses of aluminum, chloride, foaming agents, iron, manganese, odor, silver, sulfate, total dissolved solids (TDS) and zinc to determine compliance under ยง 143.3 may be conducted with the methods in the following table or alternative methods listed in appendix A to subpart C of part 141. Criteria for analyzing aluminum, copper, iron, manganese, silver and zinc samples with digestion or directly without digestion, and other analytical test procedures are contained in *Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods,* EPA-600/R-94-173, October 1994.
