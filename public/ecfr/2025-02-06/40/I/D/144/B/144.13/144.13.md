(b) The owner or operator of a Class IV well shall comply with the requirements of § 144.14, and with the requirements of § 144.23 regarding closure of Class IV wells.


(c) Wells used to inject contaminated ground water that has been treated and is being reinjected into the same formation from which it was drawn are not prohibited by this section if such injection is approved by EPA, or a State, pursuant to provisions for cleanup of releases under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601-9657, or pursuant to requirements and provisions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6901 through 6987. 


(d) *Clarification.* The following wells are not prohibited by this action:


(1) Wells used to inject hazardous waste into aquifers or portions thereof that have been exempted pursuant to § 146.4, if the exempted aquifer into which waste is injected underlies the lowermost formation containing a USDW. Such wells are Class I wells as specified in § 144.6(a)(1), and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements applicable to Class I wells.


(2) Wells used to inject hazardous waste where no USDW exists within one quarter mile of the well bore in any underground formation, provided that the Director determines that such injection is into a formation sufficiently isolated to ensure that injected fluids do not migrate from the injection zone. Such wells are Class I wells as specified in § 144.6(a)(1), and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements applicable to Class I wells.
