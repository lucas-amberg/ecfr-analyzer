# § 144.16   Waiver of requirement by Director.

(a) *When injection does not occur into, through or above an underground source of drinking water,* the Director may authorize a well or project with less stringent requirements for area of review, construction, mechanical integrity, operation, monitoring, and reporting than required in 40 CFR part 146 or § 144.52 to the extent that the reduction in requirements will not result in an increased risk of movement of fluids into an underground source of drinking water. 


(b) When injection occurs through or above an underground source of drinking water, but the radius of endangering influence when computed under § 146.06(a) is smaller or equal to the radius of the well, the Director may authorize a well or project with less stringent requirements for operation, monitoring, and reporting than required in 40 CFR part 146 or § 144.52 to the extent that the reduction in requirements will not result in an increased risk of movement of fluids into an underground source of drinking water. 


(c) When reducing requirements under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Director shall prepare a fact sheet under § 124.8 explaining the reasons for the action.
