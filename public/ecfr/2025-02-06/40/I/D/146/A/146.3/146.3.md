# § 146.3   Definitions.

The following definitions apply to the underground injection control program.


*Abandoned well* means a well whose use has been permanently discontinued or which is in a state of disrepair such that it cannot be used for its intended purpose or for observation purposes.


*Administrator* means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.


*Application* means the EPA standard national forms for applying for a permit, including any additions, revisions or modifications to the forms; or forms approved by EPA for use in approved States, including any approved modifications or revisions. For RCRA, application also includes the information required by the Director under § 122.25 (contents of Part B of the RCRA application).


*Aquifer* means a geological formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is capable of yielding a significant amount of water to a well or spring.


*Area of review* means the area surrounding an injection well described according to the criteria set forth in § 146.06 or in the case of an area permit, the project area plus a circumscribing area the width of which is either 
1/4 of a mile or a number calculated according to the criteria set forth in § 146.06.


*Casing* means a pipe or tubing of appropriate material, of varying diameter and weight, lowered into a borehole during or after drilling in order to support the sides of the hole and thus prevent the walls from caving, to prevent loss of drilling mud into porous ground, or to prevent water, gas, or other fluid from entering or leaving the hole.


*Catastrophic collapse* means the sudden and utter failure of overlying “strata” caused by removal of underlying materials.


*Cementing* means the operation whereby a cement slurry is pumped into a drilled hole and/or forced behind the casing.


*Cesspool* means a “drywell” that receives untreated sanitary waste containing human excreta, and which sometimes has an open bottom and/or perforated sides.


*Confining bed* means a body of impermeable or distinctly less permeable material stratigraphically adjacent to one or more aquifers.


*Confining zone* means a geological formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is capable of limiting fluid movement above an injection zone.


*Contaminant* means any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter in water. 


*Conventional mine* means an open pit or underground excavation for the production of minerals.


*Director* means the Regional Administrator, the State director or the Tribal director as the context requires, or an authorized representative. When there is no approved State or Tribal program, and there is an EPA administered program, “Director” means the Regional Administrator. When there is an approved State or Tribal program, “Director” normally means the State or Tribal director. In some circumstances, however, EPA retains the authority to take certain actions even when there is an approved State or Tribal program. (For example, when EPA has issued an NPDES permit prior to the approval of a State program, EPA may retain jurisdiction over that permit after program approval; see § 123.69). In such cases, the term *Director* means the Regional Administrator and not the State or Tribal director. 


*Disposal well* means a well used for the disposal of waste into a subsurface stratum.


*Drywell* means a well, other than an improved sinkhole or subsurface fluid distribution system, completed above the water table so that its bottom and sides are typically dry except when receiving fluids.


*Effective date of a UIC program* means the date that a State UIC program is approved or established by the Administrator.


*Environmental Protection Agency* (“EPA”) means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.


*EPA* means the United States “Environmental Protection Agency.”


*Exempted aquifer* means an aquifer or its portion that meets the criteria in the definition of “underground source of drinking water” but which has been exempted according to the procedures of § 144.8(b).

*Fault* means a surface or zone of rock fracture along which there has been displacement.


*Flow rate* means the volume per time unit given to the flow of gases or other fluid substance which emerges from an orifice, pump, turbine or passes along a conduit or channel.


*Fluid* means material or substance which flows or moves whether in a semisolid, liquid, sludge, gas, or any other form or state.


*Formation* means a body of rock characterized by a degree of lithologic homogeneity which is prevailingly, but not necessarily, tabular and is mappable on the earth's surface or traceable in the subsurface.


*Formation fluid* means “fluid” present in a “formation” under natural conditions as opposed to introduced fluids, such as drilling mud.


*Generator* means any person, by site location, whose act or process produces hazardous waste identified or listed in 40 CFR part 261.


*Ground water* means water below the land surface in a zone of saturation.


*Hazardous waste* means a hazardous waste as defined in 40 CFR 261.3.

*Permit* means an authorization, license, or equivalent control document issued by EPA or an “approved State” to implement the requirements of this part and parts 124, 144, and 145. Permit does not include RCRA interim status (§ 122.23), UIC authorization by rule (§§ 144.21 to 144.26 and 144.15), or any permit which has not yet been the subject of final agency action, such as a “draft permit” or a “proposed permit.”
