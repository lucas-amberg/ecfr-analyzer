(a) Monitoring of annulus pressure conducted pursuant to ยง 146.8(b)(1) shall be preceded by an initial pressure test. A positive gauge pressure on the casing/tubing annulus (filled with liquid) shall be maintained continuously. The pressure shall be monitored monthly. 


(b) Pressure tests conducted pursuant to ยง 146.8(b)(2) of this chapter shall be performed with a pressure on the casing/tubing annulus of at least 200 p.s.i. unless otherwise specified by the Director. In addition, pressure tests conducted during well operation shall maintain an injection/annulus pressure differential of at least 100 p.s.i. throughout the tubing length. 


(c) Monitoring of enhanced recovery wells conducted pursuant to ยง 146.8(b)(3), must be preceded by an initial pressure test that was conducted no more than 90 days prior to the commencement of monitoring.
