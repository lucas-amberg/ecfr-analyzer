# § 148.1   Purpose, scope and applicability.

(a) This part identifies wastes that are restricted from disposal into Class I wells and defines those circumstances under which a waste, otherwise prohibited from injection, may be injected. 


(b) The requirements of this part apply to owners or operators of Class I hazardous waste injection wells used to inject hazardous waste.


(c) Wastes otherwise prohibited from injection may continue to be injected:


(1) If an extension from the effective date of a prohibition has been granted pursuant to § 148.4 with respect to such wastes; or


(2) If an exemption from a prohibition has been granted in response to a petition filed under § 148.20 to allow injection of restricted wastes with respect to those wastes and wells covered by the exemption; or


(3) If the waste is generated by a conditionally exempt small quantity generator, as defined in § 261.5; or


(d) Wastes that are hazardous only because they exhibit a hazardous characteristic, and which are otherwise prohibited under this part, or part 268 of this chapter, are not prohibited if the wastes:
