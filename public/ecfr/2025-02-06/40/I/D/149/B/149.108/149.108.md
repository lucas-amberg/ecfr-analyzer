If there is significant public interest, the Regional Administrator may hold a public hearing with respect to any project or projects to be reviewed if he finds that such a hearing is necessary and would be helpful in clarifying the issues. Public hearings held under this section should be coordinated, if possible, with other Federal public hearings held pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. Any such hearing shall be conducted by the Regional Administrator or designee in an informal, orderly and expeditious manner. Where appropriate, limits may be placed upon the time allowed for oral statements, and statements may be required to be submitted in writing. The record will be held open for further public comment for seven (7) days following the close of the public hearing.
