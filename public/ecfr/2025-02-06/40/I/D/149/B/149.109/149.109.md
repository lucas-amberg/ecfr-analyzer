(a) As soon as practicable after the submission of public comments under section 1424(e) and information requested by the Environmental Protection Agency from the originating Federal agency, on the basis of such information as is available to him, the Regional Administrator shall review the project taking all relevant factors into account including:

(3) The extent and effectiveness of State or local control over possible contaminant releases to the aquifer;


(4) The cumulative and secondary impacts of the proposed project; and


(5) The expected environmental benefits of the proposed project.

(c) After receiving the available information forwarded by the Regional Administrator, the Administrator shall:


(1) Determine that the risk of contamination of the aquifer through the recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health is not sufficiently great so as to prevent commitment of Federal funding to the project; or
