(a) Whether the use of a pesticide product satisfies any of the § 154.7 risk criteria, with respect to the composition, labeling, packaging, and restrictions on use of the product as currently registered.

For further information see § 154.27(b).


(c) Whether any risks posed by the use or proposed use of the product that satisfy the § 154.7 risk criteria are unreasonable, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the product.


(d) What regulatory action, if any, the Agency should take with respect to the use of the product.
