# ยง 155.46   Deciding that a registration review is complete and additional review is not needed.

The Agency may determine that there is no need to reconsider a previous decision that a pesticide satisfies the standard of registration in FIFRA. In such cases, instead of establishing a pesticide registration review case docket as described in ยง 155.50, the Agency may propose that, based on its determination that a pesticide meets the FIFRA standard for registration, no further review will be necessary. In such circumstances, the Agency will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ announcing the availability of the proposed decision and provide a comment period of at least 60 calendar days. The Agency will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ announcing the availability of a final version of the decision, an explanation of any changes to the proposed decision and its response to any comments. The date of the final notice of availability would be used as the date of the latest registration review for the purpose of scheduling subsequent registration reviews.
