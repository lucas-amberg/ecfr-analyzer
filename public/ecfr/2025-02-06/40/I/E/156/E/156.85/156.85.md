# § 156.85   Non-target organisms.

(a) *Requirement.* Where a hazard exists to non-target organisms, EPA may require precautionary statements of the nature of the hazard and the appropriate precautions to avoid potential accident, injury, or damage.


(b) *Examples.* The statements in this paragraph illustrate the types of hazard statements that EPA may require and the circumstances under which they are typically required. These statements are not comprehensive; other statements may be required if more appropriate to the formulation or use.


(1) If a pesticide intended for outdoor use contains an active ingredient with a mammalian acute oral LD_50_ of 100 mg/kg or less, the statement, “This pesticide is toxic to wildlife” is required.


(2) If a pesticide intended for outdoor use contains an active ingredient with a fish acute LC_50_ of 1 ppm or less, the statement, “This pesticide is toxic to fish” is required.


(3) If a pesticide intended for outdoor use contains an active ingredient with an avian acute oral LD_50_ of 100 mg/kg or less, or a subacute dietary LC_50_ of 500 ppm or less, the statement, “This pesticide is toxic to wildlife” is required. 


(4) If either accident history or field studies demonstrate that the use of the pesticide may result in fatality to birds, fish or mammals, the statement, “This pesticide is extremely toxic to wildlife (fish)” is required. 


(5) If a product is intended for or involves foliar application to agricultural crops, forests or shade trees, or mosquito abatement treatments, and contains a pesticide toxic to pollinating insects, the label must bear appropriate label cautions. 


(6) If a product is intended for outdoor use other than aquatic applications, the label must bear the caution, “Keep out of lakes, ponds or streams. Do not contaminate water by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes.”
