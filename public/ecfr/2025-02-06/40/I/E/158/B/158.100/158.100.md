# ยง 158.100   Pesticide use patterns.

(a) *General use patterns for conventional, biochemical, and microbial pesticides.* There are six broad use categories used in the data tables. The six broad categories include terrestrial outdoor uses, aquatic outdoor uses, greenhouse uses, forestry uses, residential outdoor uses, and indoor uses of all types. The 6 broad use categories are further subdivided into 12 general use patterns which are the bases for data requirements established by use pattern. Within the data tables, general use patterns have been combined into single columns when the data requirements are the same for the combined uses. If there are no data requirements for a specific use, the column for that use is not included in the table. The 12 general use pattern groups used in the data table in this part are:


(1) Terrestrial food crop use.


(2) Terrestrial feed crop use.


(3) Terrestrial nonfood crop use.


(4) Aquatic food crop use.


(5) Aquatic nonfood use.


(6) Greenhouse food crop use.


(7) Greenhouse nonfood crop use.


(8) Forestry use.


(9) Residential outdoor use.


(10) Residential indoor use.


(11) Indoor food use.


(12) Indoor nonfood use.


(b) *Pesticide use site index for conventional, biochemical, and microbial pesticides.* The Pesticide Use Site Index for Conventional, Biochemical, and Microbial Pesticides is a comprehensive list of specific pesticide use sites. The index is alphabetized separately by site for all agricultural and all nonagricultural uses. The Pesticide Use Site Index associates each pesticide use site with one or more of the 12 general use patterns. It may be used in conjunction with the data tables to determine the applicability of data requirements to specific uses. The Pesticide Use Site Index for Conventional, Biochemical, and Microbial Pesticides will be updated periodically, and is available from the Agency or may be obtained from the Agency's Web site at *http://www.epa.gov/pesticides.*

(c) *Antimicrobial pesticide use patterns.* The general use patterns for antimicrobial pesticides are described in ยง 158.2201.


(d) *Pesticide use site index for antimicrobial pesticides.* The Pesticide Use Site Index for Antimicrobial Pesticides is a comprehensive list of specific antimicrobial use sites. The index is alphabetized by antimicrobial use sites, and associates each antimicrobial use site with one or more of the antimicrobial use patterns. It may be used in conjunction with the data tables to determine the applicability of data requirements to specific uses. The Pesticide Use Site Index for Antimicrobial Pesticides will be updated periodically, and is available from the Agency or may be obtained from the Agency's Web site at *http://www.epa.gov/pesticides.*

(e) *Determination of use pattern.* Applicants unsure of the correct use pattern for their particular product should consult the Agency.
