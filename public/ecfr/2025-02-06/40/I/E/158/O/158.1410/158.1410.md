# ยง 158.1410   Residue chemistry data requirements table.

(a) *General.* Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the residue chemistry data requirements for a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.


(b) *Use patterns.* (1) Data are required or conditionally required for all pesticides used in or on food and for residential outdoor uses where food crops are grown. Food use patterns include products classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop use, terrestrial feed crop use, aquatic food crop use, greenhouse food crop use, and indoor food use.


(2) Data may be required for nonfood uses if pesticide residues may occur in food or feed as a result of the use. Data requirements for these nonfood uses will be determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, most products used in or near kitchens require residue data for risk assessment purposes even though tolerances may not be necessary in all cases.


(c) *Key.* R = Required; CR = Conditionally required; NR = Not required; TGAI = Technical grade of the active ingredient; PAI = Pure active ingredient; PAIRA = Pure active ingredient radio-labeled; Residue of concern= the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and impurities of toxicological concern; TEP = Typical end-use product.


(d) *Table.* The following table list the data requirements for residue chemistry related to food uses. The table notes are shown in paragraph (e) of this section.


(e) *Test notes.* The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section.
