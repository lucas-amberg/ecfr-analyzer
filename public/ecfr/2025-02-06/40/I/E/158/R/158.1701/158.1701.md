# ยง 158.1701   Definitions.

*Definitions.* The following terms are defined for purposes of this subpart.


*Complete protection time (CPT)* means the time from application of a skin-applied insect repellent until efficacy failure, which is described in Product Performance Test Guideline 810.3700.


*Introduction* means the intentional or unintentional escape, release, dissemination, or placement of a species into an ecosystem as a result of human activity.


*Invasive species* means with respect to a particular ecosystem, any species that is not native to that ecosystem, and whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.


*Performance standard* means a benchmark or reference against which the efficacy of the pesticide is compared (including, but not limited to, the ability of the pesticide product to control, kill, or repel an invertebrate pest species).


*Pest group labeling claim* means a claim or statement on the labeling of the pesticide product that the product is effective against a group of related species or taxa demonstrating adequate similarity in basic biology and life history characteristics to permit identification of representative test species for the entire assemblage of taxa.


*Pest-specific labeling claim* means a claim or statement on the labeling of the pesticide product that the product is effective against a particular arthropod species, such as German cockroach or house fly.


*Pest sub-group labeling claim* means a claim or statement on the labeling of the pesticide product that the product is effective against a set of related species or taxa demonstrating adequate similarity in basic biology and life history characteristics to permit identification of representative test species and part of a larger identified taxonomic grouping (e.g., Biting flies) that includes other pest species, which may or may not have a specified pest group.


*Skin-applied insect repellent* means a product intended to disrupt the host-seeking behavior of insects or other arthropods, driving or keeping them away from treated human skin. The repellent product, such as a liquid, lotion, or spray, is intended to be applied directly to human skin. Efficacy of skin-applied insect repellents is expressed as complete protection time.


*Species* means a group of organisms all of which have a high degree of physical and genetic similarity, generally breed only among themselves, and show persistent differences from members of allied groups of organisms.


*Wood-destroying* applies to pests that feed on or nest in wood, and therefore are highly destructive to wood buildings or structures, and stored lumber.


*Vector* means any organism capable of transmitting the causative agent of human and/or animal disease, including but not limited to mosquitoes and ticks.
