# § 158.1718   Ticks.

(a) *General.* The table and test notes in this section apply to hard ticks (including cattle ticks) and soft ticks. The claim stated on the pesticide product labeling determines the required test species. The required test species for a specific type of tick claim appear in paragraph (b) of this section. Specific parameters that apply to individual tests appear in paragraph (c) of this section. For a claim against any specific species of “ticks,” that individual species and all the listed representative species for “ticks” must be tested, but not the representative species for cattle ticks or soft ticks. Claims against ticks in association with tick borne diseases are also subject to the requirements in § 158.1709.


(b) *Test species.* For pesticide products making a claim against ticks, the required test species appear in the following table.


(c) *Specific parameters.* The following parameters are required.


1. For products applied to dogs, testing is required on three species: Blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), and Brown dog tick (*Rhipicephalus sanguineus*).


2. For products applied to cats, testing is required on three species: Blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), Lone star tick (*Amblyomma americanum*), and American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).
