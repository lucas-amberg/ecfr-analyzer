(a) *General.* The table in this section applies to bees, wasps, yellowjackets, and hornets. The labeling claim determines the required test species. The required test species for labeling claims appear in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Test species.* For products making a claim against bees, wasps, yellowjackets, and hornets, the required test species for a labeling claim appear in the following table, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Colony claims.* For colony claims, except *Vespula* spp., testing must be specific to the species listed. Acceptable data for any *Vespula* species may support a yellowjacket colony claim for ground nesting *Vespula* species; however, species-specific claims need to be supported by data from testing of the specific species. Colony claims have a performance standard of 100%.
