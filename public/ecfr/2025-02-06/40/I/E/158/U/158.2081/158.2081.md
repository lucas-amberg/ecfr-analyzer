(a) *General.* (1) Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the product chemistry data requirements for a particular biochemical pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of the section.


(2) Depending on the results of the required product chemistry studies, appropriate use restrictions, labeling requirements, or special packaging requirements may be imposed.


(b) *Use patterns.* Product chemistry data are required for all pesticide products and are not use specific.


(c) *Key.* R = Required; CR = Conditionally required; NR = Not required; MP = Manufacturing-use product; EP = End-use product; TEP = Typical end-use product; TGAI = Technical grade of the active ingredient; Residue of concern = the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and impurities of toxicological concern; All = All of the above. Specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test procedures appear in paragraph (e) of this section, and apply to the individual tests in the following table:


(d) *Table.* The following table shows the data requirements for experimental use permit biochemical pesticides product chemistry. The test notes are shown in paragraph (e) of this section.


(e) *Test notes.* The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for experimental use permit biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are referenced in the last column of the table in paragraph (d) of this section.
