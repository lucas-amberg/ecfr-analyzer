(h) The term *Expedited Hearing* means a hearing commenced as the result of the issuance of a notice of intention to suspend or the suspension of a registration of a pesticide by an emergency order, and is limited to a consideration as to whether a pesticide presents an imminent hazard which justifies such suspension.

Such judicial officer shall not be employed by the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention or have any connection with the preparation or presentation of evidence for a hearing.


(3) *Functions.* The Administrator may delegate any or part of his authority to act in a given case under subparts B and C of this part to a judicial officer.
