# ยง 164.133   Emergency waiver of hearing.

(a) In the case of an application subject to this subpart D which is filed under section 18 of FIFRA, and regulations thereunder, and for which a hearing is required pursuant to ยง 164.131, the Administrator may dispense with the requirement of convening such a hearing in any case in which he determines:


(1) That the application presents a situation involving need to use the pesticide to prevent an unacceptable risk: (i) To human health, or (ii) to fish or wildlife populations when such use would not pose a human health hazard; and


(2) That there is no other feasible solution to such risk; and


(3) That the time available to avert the risk to human health or fish and wildlife is insufficient to permit convening a hearing as required by ยง 164.131; and


(4) That the public interest requires the granting of the requested use as soon as possible.


(b) Notice of any determination made by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be published in the _Federal Register_ as soon as practicable after granting the requested use and shall set forth the basis for the Administrator's determination.
