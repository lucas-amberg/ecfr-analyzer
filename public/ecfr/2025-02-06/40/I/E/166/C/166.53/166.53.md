# § 166.53   EPA review of crisis exemption and revocation of authority.

(a) *Review.* When a crisis exemption is about to be or has already been declared by a State or Federal agency, EPA will undertake an expedited review of the pesticide to determine if use of the pesticide may result in such unreasonable health or environmental risks that the crisis authority should not be exercised or the crisis exemption should be revoked.


(b) *Revocation*—(1) *Individual crisis exemptions.* A crisis exemption for the use of a specific pesticide may be revoked if the Administrator determines that:


(i) There are insufficient data to determine the risks posed from the use;


(ii) Such action is necessary to protect man or the environment; or


(iii) The State or Federal agency is not complying with the requirements of this subpart C.


(2) *State or Federal agency authority.* The Administrator may revoke the authority of a State or Federal agency to issue crisis exemptions for any pesticide if he determines that:


(i) Such action is necessary to protect man or the environment; or


(ii) The State or Federal agency is not complying with the requirements of this subpart C.


(c) *Reason for revocation.* The Agency shall provide the specific reasons for revoking an agency's authority to issue a crisis exemption and for revoking an issued crisis exemption.
