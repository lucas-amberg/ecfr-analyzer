# § 170.607   Exceptions to personal protective equipment requirements specified on pesticide product labeling.

(a) *Body protection.* (1) A chemical-resistant suit may be substituted for coveralls. If a chemical-resistant suit is substituted for coveralls, any labeling requirement for an additional layer of clothing beneath the coveralls is waived.


(2) A chemical-resistant suit may be substituted for coveralls and a chemical-resistant apron.


(b) *Boots.* If chemical-resistant footwear with sufficient durability and a tread appropriate for wear in rough terrain is not obtainable, then leather boots may be worn in such terrain.


(c) *Gloves.* If chemical-resistant gloves with sufficient durability and suppleness are not obtainable, then during activities with plants with sharp thorns, leather gloves may be worn over chemical-resistant glove liners. However, once leather gloves are worn for this use, thereafter they must be worn only with chemical-resistant liners and they must not be worn for any other use.


(d) *Closed systems.*(1) When pesticides are being mixed or loaded using a closed system that meets all of the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the handler employer meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the following exceptions to labeling-specified personal protective equipment are permitted:


(i) Handlers using a closed system to mix or load pesticides with a signal word of “DANGER” or “WARNING” may substitute a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, shoes and socks, chemical-resistant apron, protective eyewear, and any protective gloves specified on the labeling for handlers for the labeling-specified personal protective equipment.


(ii) Handlers using a closed system to mix or load pesticides other than those specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may substitute protective eyewear, long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and shoes and socks for the labeling-specified personal protective equipment.


(2) The exceptions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply only in the following situations:


(i) Where the closed system removes the pesticide from its original container and transfers the pesticide product through connecting hoses, pipes and couplings that are sufficiently tight to prevent exposure of handlers to the pesticide product, except for the negligible escape associated with normal operation of the system.


(ii) When loading intact, sealed, water soluble packaging into a mixing tank or system. If the integrity of a water soluble packaging is compromised (for example, if the packaging is dissolved, broken, punctured, torn, or in any way allows its contents to escape), it is no longer a closed system and the labeling-specified personal protective equipment must be worn.


(3) The exceptions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply only where the handler employer has satisfied the requirements of § 170.313 and all of the following conditions:


(i) Each closed system must have written operating instructions that are clearly legible and include: Operating procedures for use, including the safe removal of a probe; maintenance, cleaning and repair; known restrictions or limitations relating to the system, such as incompatible pesticides, sizes (or types) of containers or closures that cannot be handled by the system; any limits on the ability to measure a pesticide; and special procedures or limitations regarding partially-filled containers.


(ii) The written operating instructions for the closed system must be available at the mixing or loading site and must be made available to any handlers who use the system.


(iii) Any handler operating the closed system must be trained in its use and operate the closed system in accordance with its written operating instructions.


(iv) The closed system must be cleaned and maintained as specified in the written operating instructions and as needed to make sure the system functions properly.


(v) All personal protective equipment specified in the pesticide product labeling is immediately available to the handler for use in an emergency.


(vi) Protective eyewear must be worn when using closed systems operating under pressure.


(e) *Enclosed cabs.* (1) If a handler applies a pesticide from inside a vehicle's enclosed cab, and if the conditions listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section are met, exceptions to the personal protective equipment requirements specified on the product labeling for applicators are permitted as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(2) All of the personal protective equipment required by the pesticide product labeling for applicators must be immediately available and stored in a sealed container to prevent contamination. Handlers must wear the applicator personal protective equipment required by the pesticide product labeling if they exit the cab within a treated area during application or when a restricted-entry interval is in effect. Once personal protective equipment is worn in a treated area, it must be removed before reentering the cab to prevent contamination of the cab.


(3) Handlers may substitute a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, shoes and socks for the labeling-specified personal protective equipment for skin and eye protection. If a filtering facepiece respirator (NIOSH approval number prefix TC-84A) or dust/mist filtering respirator is required by the pesticide product labeling for applicators, then that respirator need not be worn inside the enclosed cab if the enclosed cab has a properly functioning air ventilation system which is used and maintained in accordance with the manufacture's written operating instructions. If any other type of respirator is required by the pesticide labeling for applicators, then that respirator must be worn.


(f) *Aerial applications*—(1) *Use of gloves.* The wearing of chemical-resistant gloves when entering or leaving an aircraft used to apply pesticides is optional, unless such gloves are required on the pesticide product labeling. If gloves are brought into the cockpit of an aircraft that has been used to apply pesticides, the gloves shall be kept in an enclosed container to prevent contamination of the inside of the cockpit.


(2) *Open cockpit.* Handlers applying pesticides from an open cockpit aircraft must use the personal protective equipment specified in the pesticide product labeling for use during application, except that chemical-resistant footwear need not be worn. A helmet may be substituted for chemical-resistant headgear. A helmet with a face shield lowered to cover the face may be substituted for protective eyewear.


(3) *Enclosed cockpit.* Persons occupying an enclosed cockpit may substitute a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, shoes, and socks for labeling-specified personal protective equipment.


(g) *Crop advisors.* (1) Provided the conditions of paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(4) of this section are met, crop advisors and their employees entering treated areas to perform crop advising tasks while a restricted-entry interval is in effect may substitute either of the following sets of personal protective equipment for the personal protective equipment specified on the pesticide labeling for handler activities:


(i) The personal protective equipment specified on the pesticide product labeling for early entry.


(ii) Coveralls, shoes plus socks and chemical-resistant gloves made of any waterproof material, and eye protection if the pesticide product labeling applied requires protective eyewear for handlers.


(2) The application has been complete for at least four hours.


(3) No such entry is allowed until any inhalation exposure level listed in the pesticide product labeling has been reached or any ventilation criteria required by § 170.405(b)(3) or the pesticide product labeling have been met.


(4) The crop advisor or crop advisor employee who enters a treated area during a restricted-entry interval only performs crop advising tasks while in the treated area.
