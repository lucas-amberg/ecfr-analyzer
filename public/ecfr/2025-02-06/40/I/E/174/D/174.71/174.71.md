# ยง 174.71   Submission of information regarding adverse effects.

(a) Any person who produces, for sale or distribution, a plant-incorporated protectant exempt under subpart B of this part, who obtains any information regarding adverse effects on human health or the environment alleged to have been caused by the plant-incorporated protectant must submit such information to EPA.

EPA must receive the report within 30 calendar days of the date the producer first possesses or knows of the information.

(1) The producer is aware, or has been informed, that a person or nontarget organism allegedly suffered a toxic or adverse effect due to exposure to (e.g., ingestion of) a plant-incorporated protectant. 


(2) The producer has or could reasonably obtain information concerning where the incident occurred.
