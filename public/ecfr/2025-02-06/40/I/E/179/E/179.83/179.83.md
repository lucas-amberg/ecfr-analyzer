(c) Submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval of the presiding officer, upon a showing that the material contained in the supplement was not reasonably known by or available to the party when the submission was made or that the relevance of the material contained in the supplement could not reasonably have been foreseen.


(d) If a party fails to comply substantially and in good faith with this section, the presiding officer may infer that such failure was for the purpose of withholding information that is unfavorable to the party's position, and may make such further adverse inferences and findings with respect to such failure as are warranted.


(e) Parties may reference each other's submissions. To reduce duplicative submissions, parties are encouraged to exchange and consolidate lists of documentary evidence. If a particular document is bulky or in limited supply and cannot reasonably be reproduced, and it constitutes relevant evidence, the presiding officer may authorize submission of a reduced number of copies.


(f) The presiding officer will rule on questions relating to this section.
