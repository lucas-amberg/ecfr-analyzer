(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of a metiram (a mixture of 5.2 parts by weight of ammoniates of [ethylenebis (dithiocarbamato)] zinc with 1 part by weight ethylenebis [dithiocarbamic acid] bimolecular and trimolecular cyclic anhydrosulfides and disulfides), including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only those metiram residues convertible to and expressed in terms of the degradate carbon disulfide.
