# ยง 180.355   Bentazon; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of bentazon, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring for only the sum of bentazon (3-(1-methylethyl)-1*H*-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3*H*)-one 2,2-dioxide), 6-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-1*H*-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3*H*)-one 2,2-dioxide, and 8-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-1*H*-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3*H*)-one 2,2-dioxide calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of bentazon.


(2) Tolerances are established for the combined residues of the herbicide bentazon (3-isopropyl-1*H*-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3*H*)-one-2,2-dioxide) and its metabolite 2-amino-*N*-isopropyl benzamide (AIBA) in or on the following food commodities: 


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* Tolerances with regional registration as defined in ยง 180.1(m), are established for combined residues of the herbicide, bentazon (3-isopropyl-1H-2, 1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide) and its 6- and 8-hydroxy metabolites in or on the following food commodities:


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
