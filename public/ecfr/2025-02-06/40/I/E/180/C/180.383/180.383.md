# ยง 180.383   Sodium salt of acifluorfen; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for combined residues of the herbicide sodium salt of acifluorfen, sodium 5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoate, and its metabolites (the corresponding acid, methyl ester, and amino analogues) in or on the following raw agricultural commodities:




(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* Time-limited tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide sodium salt of acifluorfen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the specified agricultural commodities in the following table, resulting from use of the pesticide pursuant to FIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of acifluorfen acid, (5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoate), acifluorfen amine methyl ester (methyl 5-[2-chloro-4(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-aminobenzoate), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of acifluorfen acid in or on the commodities. The tolerances expire on the date specified in the table.




(c) *Tolerances with regional restrictions.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
