(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide cypermethrin (±)alpha cyano-(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl (±)cis,trans-3(2,2-dichloroethenyl-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate in or on the commodities in table 1 to paragraph (a)(1).


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of zeta-cypermethrin, (*S*-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl) methyl (±))(cis-trans 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate), including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only total cypermethrin, cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate, in or on the commodity.


(3) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide, alpha-cypermethrin, (*R*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl (1*S,*3*S*)-rel-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only total cypermethrin, cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate, in or on the commodity.
