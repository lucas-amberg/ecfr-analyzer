# § 180.438   Lambda-cyhalothrin and an isomer gamma-cyhalothrin; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for the combined residues of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin, 1:1 mixture of (*S*)-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(*Z*)-(1*R*,3*R*)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (*R*)-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(*Z*)-(1*S*,3*S*)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and its epimer expressed as epimer of lambda-cyhalothrin, a 1:1 mixture of (*S*)-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(*Z*)-(1*S*,3*S*)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (*R*)-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(*Z*)-(1*R*,3*R*)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, on plants and livestocks, as indicated in the following table.


(2) Tolerances 
1 are established for the combined residues of the pyrethroid [gamma-cyhalothrin (the isolated active isomer of lambda-cyhalothrin) (*S*)-′-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (*Z*)-(1*R*,3*R*)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate)) and its epimer (*R*)-′-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (*Z*)-(1*R*,3*R*)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate in/on the following commodities:


(3) A tolerance of 0.01 part per million is established for residues of the insecticide lamba-cyhalothrin and an isomer gamma-cyhalothrin in or on all food commodities (other than those already covered by a higher tolerance as a result of use on growing crops) in food-handling establishments where food products are held, processed, or prepared.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved] 


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
