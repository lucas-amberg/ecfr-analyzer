# ยง 180.448   Hexythiazox; tolerance for residues.

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of hexythiazox, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only hexythiazox and its metabolites containing the (4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-2-oxo-3-thiazolidine moiety, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of hexythiazox.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* Tolerances with regional registrations as defined by ยง 180.1(l), are established for residues of hexythiazox, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only hexythiazox and its metabolites containing the (4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-2-oxo-3-thiazolidine moiety, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of hexythiazox.


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
