(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of difenoconazole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only difenoconazole, 1-[2-[2-chloro-4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl]-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole, in or on the following raw agricultural commodities:


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of difenoconazole, including its metabolites and degradates, in the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring the sum of difenoconazole, 1-[2-[2-chloro-4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl]-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl]-1*H*-1,2,4-triazole, and its metabolite, CGA-205375, 1-[2-chloro-4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)phenyl]-2-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl-ethanol, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of difenoconazole, in the following commodities:


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
