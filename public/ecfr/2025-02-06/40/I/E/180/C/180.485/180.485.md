# § 180.485   Cyproconazole; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the free and conjugated forms of the fungicide cyproconazole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the proposed tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only cyproconazole (α-(4-chlorophenyl)-α-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-1*H*-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) in or on the following commodities:


(2) A tolerance is established for the combined residues of the free and conjugated forms of the fungicide cyproconazole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodity in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance level specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of cyproconazole (α-(4-chlorophenyl)-α-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-1*H*-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) and its metabolite δ-(4-chlorophenyl)-β,δ-dihydroxy-γ-methyl-1*H*-1,2,4-triazole-1-hexenoic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of cyproconazole, in or on the following commodity:


(3) Tolerances are established for the combined residues of the free and conjugated forms of the fungicide cyproconazole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance level specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of cyproconazole (α-(4-chlorophenyl)-α-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-1*H*-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) and its metabolite 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl-butane-2,3-diol, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of cyproconazole, in or on the following commodities:


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
