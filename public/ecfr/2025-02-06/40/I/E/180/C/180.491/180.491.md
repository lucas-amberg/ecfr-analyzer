# ยง 180.491   Propylene oxide; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fumigant propylene oxide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only propylene oxide, when used as a postharvest fumigant, in or on the commodity.


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the reaction product, propylene chlorohydrin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of propylene chlorohydrin (1-chloro-2-propanol), and its isomer 2-chloro-1-propanol, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of propylene chlorohydrin (1-chloro-2-propanol), that results from the use of propylene oxide as a postharvest fumigant, in or on the commodity.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved] 


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved] 


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
