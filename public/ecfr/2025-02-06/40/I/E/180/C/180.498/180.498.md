# ยง 180.498   Sulfentrazone; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for the combined residues of the free and conjugated forms of sulfentrazone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of sulfentrazone (*N*-[2,4-dichloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide) and its metabolite HMS (*N*-(2,4-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of sulfentrazone in or on the following commodities.


(2) Tolerances are established for the combined residues of the free and conjugated forms of sulfentrazone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of sulfentrazone (*N*-[2,4-dichloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide) and its metabolites HMS (*N*-(2,4-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide) and DMS (*N*-(2,4-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of sulfentrazone in or on the following commodities.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* Tolerances with regional registration are established for the combined residues of the free and conjugated forms of sulfentrazone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of sulfentrazone (*N*-[2,4-dichloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide) and its metabolites HMS (*N*-(2,4-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide) and DMS (*N*-(2,4-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of sulfentrazone in or on the following commodities.


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* Tolerances are established for inadvertent and indirect combined residues of the free and conjugated forms of sulfentrazone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of sulfentrazone (*N*-[2,4-dichloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide) and its metabolites HMS (*N*-(2,4-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide) and DMS (*N*-(2,4-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1*H*-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of sulfentrazone in or on the following commodities when present therein as a result of the application of sulfentrazone to growing crops.
