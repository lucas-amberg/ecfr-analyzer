# § 180.505   Emamectin; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for emamectin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of emamectin (a mixture of a minimum of 90% 4′-epi-methylamino-4′-deoxyavermectin B_1a_ and maximum of 10% 4′-epi-methylamino-4′-deoxyavermectin B_1b_) and its metabolites 8,9-isomer of the B_1a_ and B_1b_ component of the parent (8,9-ZMA), or 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-amino-avermectin B_1a_ and 4'-deoxy-4′-epi-amino-avermectin B_1b_; 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-amino avermectin B_1a_ (AB_1a_); 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-(*N*-formyl-*N*-methyl)amino-avermectin (MFB_1a_); and 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-(*N*-formyl)amino-avermectin B_1a_ (FAB_1a_), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of emamectin.


(2) Tolerances are established for emamectin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of emamectin (MAB_1a_ + MAB_1b_ isomers) and the associated 8,9-Z isomers (8,9-ZB_1a_ and 8,9-ZB_1b_).


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect and inadvertant residues.* [Reserved]
