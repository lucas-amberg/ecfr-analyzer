# ยง 180.518   Pyrimethanil; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide pyrimethanil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only pyrimethanil (4,6-dimethyl-*N*-phenyl-2-pyrimidinamine).


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide pyrimethanil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of pyrimethanil and its metabolite 4-[4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidinyl)amino]phenol, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of pyrimethanil.


(3) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide pyrimethanil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of pyrimethanil and its metabolite 4,6-dimethyl-2-(phenylamino)-5-pyrimidinol, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of pyrimethanil.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
