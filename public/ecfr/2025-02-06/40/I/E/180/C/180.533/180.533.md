(2) A tolerance of 0.05 ppm on raw agricultural food commodities (other than those food commodities already covered by a higher tolerance as a result of use on growing crops) is established for the combined residues of the insecticide esfenvalerate, (*S*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*S*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate, its non-racemic isomer, (*R*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*R*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate and its diastereomers (*S*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*R*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate and (*R*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*S*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate as a result of the use of esfenvalerate in food-handling establishments.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* Tolerances with regional registration are established for the combined residues of the insecticide esfenvalerate, (*S*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*S*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate, its non-racemic isomer, (*R*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*R*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate and its diastereomers (*S*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*R*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate and (*R*)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-(*S*)-4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetate, in or on food commodities as follows:
