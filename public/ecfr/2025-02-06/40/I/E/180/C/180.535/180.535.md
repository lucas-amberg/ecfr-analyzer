# ยง 180.535   Fluroxypyr 1-methylheptyl ester; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for combined residues of fluroxypyr 1-methylheptyl ester [1-methylheptyl ((4-amino-3,5-dichloro-6-fluoro-2-pyridinyl)oxy)acetate] and its metabolite fluroxypyr [((4-amino-3,5-dichloro-6-fluoro-2-pyridinyl)oxy)acetic acid] in or on the following raw agricultural commodities. Compliance with the established tolerance levels is determined by measuring only the sum of fluroxypyr 1-methylheptyl ester [1-methylheptyl ((4-amino-3, 5-dichloro-6-fluoro-2-pyridinyl)oxy)acetate] and its metabolite fluroxypyr [((4-amino-3,5-dichloro-6-fluoro-2-pyridinyl)oxy)acetic acid] calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fluroxypyr.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
