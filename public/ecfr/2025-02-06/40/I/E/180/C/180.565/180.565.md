# § 180.565   Thiamethoxam; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide thiamethoxam, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only thiamethoxam 3-[(2-chloro-5-thiazolyl)methyl]tetrahydro-5-methyl-N-nitro-4H-1,3,5-oxadiazin-4-imine and its metabolite CGA-322704 N-[(2-chloro-thiazol-5-yl)methyl]-N′-methyl-N″-nitro-guanidine, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of thiamethoxam, in or on the following commodities:


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* Time-limited tolerances specified in the table are established for residues of the insecticide thiamethoxam, including its metabolites and degradates. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only thiamethoxam 3-[(2-chloro-5-thiazolyl)methyl]tetrahydro-5-methyl-N-nitro-4H-1,3,5-oxadiazin-4-imine and its metabolite CGA-322704 N-[(2-chloro-thiazol-5-yl)methyl]-N′-methyl-N″-nitro-guanidine, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of thiamethoxam, in or on the specified agricultural commodities, resulting from use of the pesticide pursuant to FFIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions. The tolerances expire on the date specified in the table.






(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
