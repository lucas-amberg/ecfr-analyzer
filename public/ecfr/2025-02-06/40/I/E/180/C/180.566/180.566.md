# ยง 180.566   Fenpyroximate; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide fenpyroximate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fenpyroximate, (*E*)-1,1-dimethylethyl 4-[[[[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxy-1*H*-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene]amino]oxy]methyl]benzoate and its Z-isomer, (*Z*)-1,1-dimethylethyl 4-[[[[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxy-1*H*-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene]amino]oxy]methyl]benzoate, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fenpyroximate.


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide fenpyroximate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fenpyroximate, (*E*)-1,1-dimethylethyl 4-[[[[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxy-1*H*-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene]amino]oxy]methyl]benzoate and its metabolites (*E*)-4-[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxypyrazol-4-yl)-methyleneaminooxymethyl]benzoic acid and (*E*)-1,1-dimethylethyl-2-hydroxyethyl 4-[[[[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxy-1*H*-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene]amino]oxy]methyl]benzoate, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fenpyroximate.


(3) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide fenpyroximate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fenpyroximate, (*E*)-1,1-dimethylethyl 4-[[[[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxy-1*H*-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene]amino]oxy]methyl]benzoate and its metabolite (*E*)-4-[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxypyrazol-4-yl)-methyleneaminooxymethyl]benzoic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fenpyroximate.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved] 


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved] 


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
