# § 180.574   Fluazinam; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of fluazinam (3-chloro-*N*-[3-chloro-2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinamine), including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only fluazinam.


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of fluazinam, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only fluazinam and its metabolite AMGT (3-[[4-amino-3-[[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]amino]-2-nitro-6-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]thio]-2-(beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy) propionic acid).


(3) Tolerances are established for residues of fluazinam (3-chloro-*N*-[3-chloro-2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinamine), including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only fluazinam, AMPA (2-(6-amino-3-chloro-α,α,α-trifluoro-2-nitro-p-toluidino)-3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl) pyridine), DAPA (3-chloro-2-(2,6-diamino-3-chloro-α,α,α.-trifluoro-p-toluidino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine), and their sulfamate conjugates.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved] 


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
