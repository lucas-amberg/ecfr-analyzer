# ยง 180.579   Fenamidone; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide, fenamidone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only fenamidone (4H-Imidazol-4-one, 3,5-dihydro-5-methyl-2-(methylthio)-5-phenyl-3 (phenylamino)-,(S)-), in or on the commodities:


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide fenamidone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring fenamidone (4H-Imidazol-4-one, 3,5-dihydro-5-methyl-2-(methylthio)-5-phenyl-3 (phenylamino)-,(S)-), and its metabolite RPA 717879 (2,4-imidazolidinedione, 5-methyl-5-phenyl), in or on the commodities:


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* A tolerance with regional registration as defined in ยง 180.1(l) is established for residues of the fungicide fenamidone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only fenamidone (4H-Imidazol-4-one, 3,5-dihydro-5-methyl-2-(methylthio)-5-phenyl-3 (phenylam-ino)-,(S)-), in or on the commodity:


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide fenamidone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring fenamidone (4H-Imidazol-4-one, 3,5-dihydro-5-methyl-2-(methylthio)-5-phenyl-3 (phenylamino)-,(S)-), and its metabolite RPA 717879 (2,4-imidazolidinedione, 5-methyl-5-phenyl), in or on the following commodities when present therein as a result of application of fenamidone to the crops in paragraph (a)(1).
