# ยง 180.603   Dinotefuran; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of dinotefuran, (*RS*)-1-methyl-2-nitro-3-((tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl)guanidine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of dinotefuran and its metabolites DN, 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)guanidine, and UF, 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)urea, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of dinotefuran, in or on the commodities listed in the table below:


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of dinotefuran, (*RS*)-1-methyl-2-nitro-3-((tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl)guanidine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of dinotefuran, (*RS*)-1-methyl-2-nitro-3-((tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl)guanidine in or on the commodities listed in the table below:


(3) A tolerance of 0.01 parts per million is established for residues of the insecticide dinotefuran, (*RS*)-1-methyl-2-nitro-3-((tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl)guanidine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on all food and/or feed commodities (other than those covered by a higher tolerance as a result of use on growing crops or inadvertent residues) when residues result from application of dinotefuran in food and/or feed handling establishments where food and/or feed products are held, stored, processed, prepared, or served. Compliance with the tolerance level is to be determined by measuring only dinotefuran.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* Time-limited tolerances are established for residues of dinotefuran, (*RS*)-1-methyl-2-nitro-3-((tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl)guanidine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below resulting from use of the pesticide pursuant to FIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of dinotefuran and its metabolites DN, 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)guanidine, and UF, 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)urea, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of dinotefuran, in or on the commodities listed in the table below. The tolerances expire and are revoked on the dates specified in the table.


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
