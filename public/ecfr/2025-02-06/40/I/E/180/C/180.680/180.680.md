# ยง 180.680   Fluensulfone; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the nematicide fluensulfone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table 1 to ยง 180.680. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fluensulfone, 5-chloro-2-[(3,4,4-trifluoro-3-buten-1-yl)sulfonyl]thiazole and its metabolite, 3,4,4-trifluoro-but-3-ene-1-sulfonic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fluensulfone, in or on the commodity.


(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]


(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]


(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* Tolerances are established for residues of the nematicide fluensulfone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 2 to ยง 180.680. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fluensulfone, 5-chloro-2-[(3,4,4-trifluoro-3-buten-1-yl)sulfonyl]thiazole and its metabolite, 3,4,4-trifluoro-but-3-ene-1-sulfonic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fluensulfone, in or on the commodity.
