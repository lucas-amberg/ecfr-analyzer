# § 180.712   Inpyrfluxam; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide inpyrfluxam, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 1 to this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 to this section is to be determined by measuring only inpyrfluxam (3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-[(3*R*)-2,3-dihydro-1,1,3-trimethyl-1*H*-inden-4-yl]-1-methyl-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide), in or on the following commodities:


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of inpyrfluxam, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 2 to this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 2 to this section is to be determined by measuring the free and conjugated forms of the sum of inpyrfluxam (3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-[(3*R*)-2,3-dihydro-1,1,3-trimethyl-1*H*-inden-4-yl]-1-methyl-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, and its metabolites 3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-[1′-(hydroxymethyl)-(1′*S,*3′*R*)-1′,3′-dimethyl-2′,3′-dihydro-1′*H*-inden-4′-yl]-1-methyl-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide and 3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-[1′-(hydroxymethyl)-(1′*R,*3′*S*)-1′,3′-dimethyl-2′,3′-dihydro-1′*H*-inden-4′-yl]-1-methyl-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of inpyrfluxam, in or on the commodity:
