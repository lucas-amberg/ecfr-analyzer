# ยง 180.714   Broflanilide; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of broflanilide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities to Table 1 of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 is to be determined by measuring only broflanilide, 3-(benzoylmethylamino)-*N*-[2-bromo-4-[1,2,2,2-tetrafluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl)ethyl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-fluorobenzamide, in or on the commodity.


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of broflanilide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities to Table 2 of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 2 is to be determined by measuring the sum of broflanilide, 3-(benzoylmethylamino)-*N*-[2-bromo-4-[1,2,2,2-tetrafluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl)ethyl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-fluorobenzamide, and its metabolite 3-benzamido-*N*-[2-bromo-4-(perfluoropropan-2-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-fluorobenzamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of broflanilide, in or on the commodity.
