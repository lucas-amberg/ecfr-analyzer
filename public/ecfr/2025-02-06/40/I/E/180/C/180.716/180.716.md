# ยง 180.716   Fluindapyr; tolerances for residues.

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide fluindapyr, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 1 of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 is to be determined by measuring only fluindapyr, 3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-(7-fluoro-1,1,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1*H*-inden-4-yl)-1-methyl-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, in or on the commodity.


(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide fluindapyr, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 2 of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 2 is to be determined by measuring the sum of fluindapyr, 3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-(7-fluoro-1,1,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1*H*-inden-4-yl)-1-methyl-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, and 3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-(7-fluoro-1-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-l*H*-inden-4-yl)-1-methyl-l*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fluindapyr, in or on the commodity.
