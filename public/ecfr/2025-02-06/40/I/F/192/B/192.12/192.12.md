# § 192.12   Standards.

Remedial actions shall be conducted so as to provide reasonable assurance that, *as a result of residual radioactive materials from any designated processing site:*

(a) The concentration of radium-226 in land averaged over any area of 100 square meters shall not exceed the background level by more than—


(1) 5 pCi/g, averaged over the first 15 cm of soil below the surface, and


(2) 15 pCi/g, averaged over 15 cm thick layers of soil more than 15 cm below the surface.


(b) In any occupied or habitable building—


(1) The objective of remedial action shall be, and reasonable effort shall be made to achieve, an annual average (or equivalent) radon decay product concentration (including background) not to exceed 0.02 WL. In any case, the radon decay product concentration (including background) shall not exceed 0.03 WL, and


(2) The level of gamma radiation shall not exceed the background level by more than 20 microroentgens per hour.


(c) The Secretary shall comply with conditions specified in a plan for remedial action which provides that contamination of groundwater by listed constituents from residual radioactive material at any designated processing site (§ 192.01(1)) shall be brought into compliance as promptly as is reasonably achievable with the provisions of § 192.02(c)(3) or any supplemental standards established under § 192.22. For the purposes of this subpart: 


(1) A monitoring program shall be carried out that is adequate to define backgroundwater quality and the areal extent and magnitude of groundwater contamination by listed constituents from residual radioactive materials (§ 192.02(c)(1)) and to monitor compliance with this subpart. The Secretary shall determine which of the constituents listed in Appendix I to part 192 are present in or could reasonably be derived from residual radioactive material at the site, and concentration limits shall be established in accordance with § 192.02(c)(3). 


(2) (i) If the Secretary determines that sole reliance on active remedial procedures is not appropriate and that cleanup of the groundwater can be more reasonably accomplished in full or in part through natural flushing, then the period for remedial procedures may be extended. Such an extended period may extend to a term not to exceed 100 years if: 


(A) The concentration limits established under this subpart are projected to be satisfied at the end of this extended period, 


(B) Institutional control, having a high degree of permanence and which will effectively protect public health and the environment and satisfy beneficial uses of groundwater during the extended period and which is enforceable by the administrative or judicial branches of government entities, is instituted and maintained, as part of the remedial action, at the processing site and wherever contamination by listed constituents from residual radioactive materials is found in groundwater, or is projected to be found, and 


(C) The groundwater is not currently and is not now projected to become a source for a public water system subject to provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act during the extended period. 


(ii) Remedial actions on groundwater conducted under this subpart may occur before or after actions under Section 104(f)(2) of the Act are initiated. 


(3) Compliance with this subpart shall be demonstrated through the monitoring program established under paragraph (c)(1) of this section at those locations not beneath a disposal site and its cover where groundwater contains listed constituents from residual radioactive material.
