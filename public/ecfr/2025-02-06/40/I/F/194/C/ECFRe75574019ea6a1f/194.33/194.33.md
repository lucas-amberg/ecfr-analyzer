# ยง 194.33   Consideration of drilling events in performance assessments.

(a) Performance assessments shall examine deep drilling and shallow drilling that may potentially affect the disposal system during the regulatory time frame. 


(b) The following assumptions and process shall be used in assessing the likelihood and consequences of drilling events, and the results of such process shall be documented in any compliance application: 


(1) Inadvertent and intermittent intrusion by drilling for resources (other than those resources provided by the waste in the disposal system or engineered barriers designed to isolate such waste) is the most severe human intrusion scenario. 


(2) In performance assessments, drilling events shall be assumed to occur in the Delaware Basin at random intervals in time and space during the regulatory time frame. 


(3) The frequency of deep drilling shall be calculated in the following manner: 


(i) Identify deep drilling that has occurred for each resource in the Delaware Basin over the past 100 years prior to the time at which a compliance application is prepared. 


(ii) The total rate of deep drilling shall be the sum of the rates of deep drilling for each resource. 


(4) The frequency of shallow drilling shall be calculated in the following manner: 


(i) Identify shallow drilling that has occurred for each resource in the Delaware Basin over the past 100 years prior to the time at which a compliance application is prepared. 


(ii) The total rate of shallow drilling shall be the sum of the rates of shallow drilling for each resource. 


(iii) In considering the historical rate of all shallow drilling, the Department may, if justified, consider only the historical rate of shallow drilling for resources of similar type and quality to those in the controlled area. 


(c) Performance assessments shall document that in analyzing the consequences of drilling events, the Department assumed that: 


(1) Future drilling practices and technology will remain consistent with practices in the Delaware Basin at the time a compliance application is prepared. Such future drilling practices shall include, but shall not be limited to: The types and amounts of drilling fluids; borehole depths, diameters, and seals; and the fraction of such boreholes that are sealed by humans; and 


(2) Natural processes will degrade or otherwise affect the capability of boreholes to transmit fluids over the regulatory time frame. 


(d) With respect to future drilling events, performance assessments need not analyze the effects of techniques used for resource recovery subsequent to the drilling of the borehole.
