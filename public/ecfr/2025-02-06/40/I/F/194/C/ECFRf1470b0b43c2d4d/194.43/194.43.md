# ยง 194.43   Passive institutional controls.

(a) Any compliance application shall include detailed descriptions of the measures that will be employed to preserve knowledge about the location, design, and contents of the disposal system. Such measures shall include: 


(1) Identification of the controlled area by markers that have been designed and will be fabricated and emplaced to be as permanent as practicable; 


(2) Placement of records in the archives and land record systems of local, State, and Federal governments, and international archives, that would likely be consulted by individuals in search of unexploited resources. Such records shall identify: 


(i) The location of the controlled area and the disposal system; 


(ii) The design of the disposal system; 


(iii) The nature and hazard of the waste; 


(iv) Geologic, geochemical, hydrologic, and other site data pertinent to the containment of waste in the disposal system, or the location of such information; and 


(v) The results of tests, experiments, and other analyses relating to backfill of excavated areas, shaft sealing, waste interaction with the disposal system, and other tests, experiments, or analyses pertinent to the containment of waste in the disposal system, or the location of such information. 


(3) Other passive institutional controls practicable to indicate the dangers of the waste and its location. 


(b) Any compliance application shall include the period of time passive institutional controls are expected to endure and be understood. 


(c) The Administrator may allow the Department to assume passive institutional control credit, in the form of reduced likelihood of human intrusion, if the Department demonstrates in the compliance application that such credit is justified because the passive institutional controls are expected to endure and be understood by potential intruders for the time period approved by the Administrator. Such credit, or a smaller credit as determined by the Administrator, cannot be used for more than several hundred years and may decrease over time. In no case, however, shall passive institutional controls be assumed to eliminate the likelihood of human intrusion entirely.
