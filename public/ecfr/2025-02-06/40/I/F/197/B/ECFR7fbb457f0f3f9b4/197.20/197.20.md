# ยง 197.20   What standard must DOE meet?

(a) The DOE must demonstrate, using performance assessment, that there is a reasonable expectation that the reasonably maximally exposed individual receives no more than the following annual committed effective dose equivalent from releases from the undisturbed Yucca Mountain disposal system:


(1) 150 microsieverts (15 millirems) for 10,000 years following disposal; and


(2) 1 millisievert (100 millirems) after 10,000 years, but within the period of geologic stability.


(b) The DOE's performance assessment must include all potential pathways of radionuclide transport and exposure.
