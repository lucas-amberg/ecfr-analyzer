# ยง 197.25   What standard must DOE meet?

(a) The DOE must determine the earliest time after disposal that the waste package would degrade sufficiently that a human intrusion (see ยง 197.26) could occur without recognition by the drillers.


(b) The DOE must demonstrate that there is a reasonable expectation that the reasonably maximally exposed individual will receive an annual committed effective dose equivalent, as a result of the human intrusion, of no more than:


(1) 150 microsieverts (15 millirems) for 10,000 years following disposal; and


(2) 1 millisievert (100 millirems) after 10,000 years, but within the period of geologic stability.


(c) The analysis must include all potential environmental pathways of radionuclide transport and exposure.
