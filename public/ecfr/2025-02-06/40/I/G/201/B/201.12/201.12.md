# ยง 201.12   Standard for locomotive operation under moving conditions.

(a) Commencing December 31, 1976, no carrier subject to this regulation may operate any locomotive or combination of locomotives to which this regulation is applicable, and of which manufacture is completed on or before December 31, 1979, which produces A-weighted sound levels in excess of 96 dB when moving at any time or under any condition of grade, load, acceleration, or deceleration, when measured in accordance with the criteria specified in Subpart C of this regulation with fast meter response at 30 meters (100 feet) from the centerline of any section of track having less than a two (2) degree curve (or a radius of curvature greater than 873 meters (2865 feet)). 


(b) No carrier subject to this regulation may operate any locomotive or combination of locomotives to which this regulation is applicable, and of which manufacture is completed after December 31, 1979, which produce A-weighted sound levels in excess of 90 dB when moving at any time or under any condition of grade, load, acceleration, or deceleration, when measured in accordance with the criteria specified in Subpart C of this part with fast meter response at 30 meters (100 feet) from the centerline of any section of track having less than a two (2) degree curve (or a radius of curvature greater than 873 meters (2,865 feet)). 


(c) Commencing January 15, 1984, no carrier subject to this regulation may operate any switcher locomotive or a combination of switcher locomotives to which this regulation is applicable, and of which manufacture is completed on or before December 31, 1979 which produce A-weighted sound levels in excess of 90 dB when moving at any time or under any condition of grade, load, acceleration or deceleration, and when measured in accordance with the criteria in Subpart C of this part with fast meter response at 30 meters (100 feet) from the centerline of any section of track having less than a two (2) degree curve (or a radius of curvature greater than 873 meters (2,865 feet)). All switcher locomotives that operate in a particular railroad facility are deemed to be in compliance with this standard if the A-weighted sound level from stationary switcher locomotives, singly or in combination with other stationary locomotives, does not exceed 65 dB when measured with fast meter response at any receiving property measurement location near that particular railyard facility and when measured in accordance with Subpart C of this regulation.
