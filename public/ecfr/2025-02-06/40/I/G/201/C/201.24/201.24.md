# ยง 201.24   Procedures for measurement at a 30 meter (100 feet) distance of the noise from locomotive and rail car operations and locomotive load cell test stands.

(a) *Microphone positions.* (1) The microphone shall be located within the test site according to the specifications given in the test procedures of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, and shall be positioned 1.2 meters (4 feet) above the ground. It shall be oriented with respect to the source in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 


(2) The observer shall not stand between the microphone and the source whose sound level is being measured. 


(b) *Stationary locomotive and locomotive load cell test stand tests.* (1) For stationary locomotive and locomotive load cell test stand tests, the microphone shall be positioned on a line perpendicular to the track at a point 30 meters (100 feet) from the track centerline at the longitudinal midpoint of the locomotive. 


(2) The sound level meter shall be observed for thirty seconds after the test throttle setting is established to assure operating stability. The maximum sound level observed during that time shall be utilized for compliance purposes. 


(3) Measurement of stationary locomotive and locomotive load cell test stand noise shall be made with all cooling fans operating. 


(c) *Rail car pass-by test.* (1) For rail car pass-by tests, the microphone shall be positioned on a line perpendicular to the track 30 meters (100 feet) from the track centerline. 


(2) Rail car noise measurements shall be made when the locomotives have passed a distance 152.4 meters (500 feet) or 10 rail cars beyond the point at the intersection of the track and the line which extends perpendicularly from the track to the microphone location, providing any other locomotives are also at least 152.4 meters (500 feet) or 10 rail car lengths away from the measuring point. The maximum sound level observed in this manner which exceeds the noise levels specified in ยง 201.13 shall be utilized for compliance purposes. 


(3) Measurements shall be taken on reasonably well maintained tracks.


(4) Noise levels shall not be recorded if brake squeal is present during the test measurement. 


(d) *Locomotive pass-by test.* (1) For locomotive pass-by tests, the microphone shall be positioned on a line perpendicular to the track at a point 30 meters (100 feet) from the track centerline. 


(2) The noise level shall be measured as the locomotive approaches and passes by the microphone location. The maximum noise level observed during this period shall be utilized for compliance purposes. 


(3) Measurements shall be taken on reasonably well maintained tracks.
