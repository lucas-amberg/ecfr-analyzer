# ยง 204.5-3   Export exemptions.

(a) A new product intended solely for export, and so labeled or marked on the outside of the container and on the product itself, shall be exempt from the prohibitions of section 10(a), (1), (2), (3), and (4) of the Act. 


(b) No request for an export exemption is required. 


(c) For purposes of section 11(d) of the Noise Control Act, any export exemption under section 10(b)(2) shall be void ab initio with respect to each new product intended solely for export which is distributed in commerce for use in any state. 


(d) The Administrator will not institute proceedings against any manufacturer pursuant to section 11(d)(1) of the Noise Control Act with respect to any product, originally intended for export, but distributed in commerce for use in any state, if it is demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction that: 


(1) The manufacturer had no knowledge that such product would be distributed in commerce for use in any state; and 


(2) The manufacturer made reasonable efforts to ensure that such product would not be distributed in commerce for use in any state. Such reasonable efforts would include consideration of prior dealings with any person which resulted in introduction into commerce of a product manufactured for export only, investigation of prior instances known to the manufacturer of introduction into commerce of a product manufactured for export only, and contract provisions which minimize the probability of introduction into commerce of a product manufactured for export only.
