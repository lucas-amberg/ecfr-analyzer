(2) That the information to be obtained is not obtainable voluntarily; and


(3) That such information is relevant to the subject matter of the hearing.


(b) The administrative law judge shall order depositions upon oral questions only upon a showing of good cause and a finding that:

(2) There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a witness at the hearing.


(c) Any party to the proceeding may make a motion or motions for an order of discovery. The motion shall set forth:


(1) The circumstances which require the discovery;


(2) The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and
