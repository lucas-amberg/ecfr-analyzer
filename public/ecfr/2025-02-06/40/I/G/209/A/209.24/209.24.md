# ยง 209.24   Default order.

(a) *Default.* Respondent may be found to be in default upon failure to comply with a prehearing or hearing ruling of the Administrator or the administrative law judge. A respondent's default shall constitute an admission of all facts alleged in the complaint and a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing on such factual allegations. The remedial order proposed is binding on respondent without further proceedings upon the issuance by the Environmental Appeals Board of a final order issued upon default. 


(b) *Proposed default order.* Where the administrative law judge finds a default has occurred after a request for a hearing has been filed, the administrative law judge may render a proposed default order to be issued against the defaulting party. For the purpose of appeal pursuant to ยง 209.31 this order shall be deemed to be the initial decision of the administrative law judge.


(c) *Contents of a final order issued upon default.* A final order issued upon default shall include findings of fact, conclusions regarding all material issues of law, fact, or discretion, and the remedial order which is issued. An order issued by the Environmental Appeals Board upon default of respondent shall constitute a final order in accordance with the terms of ยง 209.33.
