(a) Upon appeal from or review of the administrative law judge's decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall consider such parts of the record as are cited or as may be necessary to resolve the issues presented and, in addition shall to the extent necessary or desirable exercise all the powers which the Environmental Appeals Board could have exercised if it had presided at the hearing. 


(b) The Environmental Appeals Board shall render a decision as expeditiously as possible. The Environmental Appeals Board shall adopt, modify, or set aside the findings, conclusions, and rule or order contained in the decision of the administrative law judge and shall set forth in its decision a statement of the reasons or bases for its action. The Environmental Appeals Board's decision shall be the final order in the proceeding. 


(c) In those cases where the Environmental Appeals Board determines that it should have further information or additional views of the parties as to the form and content of the rule or order to be issued, the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, may withhold final action pending the receipt of such additional information or views, or may remand the case to the administrative law judge.
