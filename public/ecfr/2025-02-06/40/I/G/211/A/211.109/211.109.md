(3) Whether products that are being produced and distributed into commerce comply with the provisions of those regulations. 


(b) The Director of the Noise Enforcement Division may request that a manufacturer who is subject to this part admit an EPA Enforcement Officer during operating hours to any of the following: 


(1) Any facility or site where any product to be distributed into commerce is manufactured, assembled, or stored;

(3) Any facility or site where any test product is located.


(c)(1) Once an EPA Enforcement Officer has been admitted to a facility or site, that officer will not be authorized to do more than the following: 


(i) Inspect and monitor the manufacture and assembly, selection, storage, preconditioning, noise testing, and maintenance of test products, and to verify the correlation or calibration of test equipment; 


(ii) Inspect products before they are distributed in commerce; 


(iii) Inspect and make copies of any records, reports, documents, or information that the manufacturer must maintain or provide to the Administrator under the Act or under any provision of this part;

(d) For the purposes of this section: 


(1) An “EPA Enforcement Officer” is an employee of the EPA Office of Enforcement. When he arrives at a facility or site, he must display the credentials that identify him as an employee of the EPA and a letter signed by the Director of the Noise Enforcement Division designating him to make the inspection. 


(2) Where test product storage areas or facilities are concerned, “operating hours” means all times during which personnel, other than custodial personnel, are at work in the vicinity of the area or facility and have access to it. 


(3) Where other facilities or areas are concerned, “operating hours” means all times during which products are being manufactured or assembled; or all times during which products are being tested or maintained; or records are being compiled; or when any other procedure or activity related to labeling, selective enforcement auditing, or product manufacture or assembly being carried out.

(e) The manufacturer must admit an EPA Enforcement Officer who presents a warrant authorizing entry to a facility or site. If the EPA officer does not have the warrant, he may enter a facility or site only if the manufacturer consents. 


(1) It is not a violation of this regulation or the Act if anyone refuses to allow an officer without a warrant to enter the site. 


(2) The Administrator or his designee may proceed *ex parte* (without the other party's knowledge) to obtain a warrant whether or not the manufacturer has refused entry to an EPA Enforcement Officer.
