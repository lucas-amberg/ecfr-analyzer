# § 211.204-4   Supporting information.

The following minimum supporting information must accompany the device in a manner that insures its availability to the prospective user. In the case of bulk packaging and dispensing, such supporting information must be affixed to the bulk container or dispenser in the same manner as the label, and in a readily visible location. 


(a) The mean attenuation and standard deviation values obtained for each test frequency according to § 211.206, and the NRR calculated from those values. For “muff” type protectors with various use positions, the positions providing higher NRR values shall be identified, and their associated NRR values listed in bold type. 


(b) The following statement, example and cautionary note: “The level of noise entering a person's ear, when hearing protector is worn as directed, is closely approximated by the difference between the A-weighted environmental noise level and the NRR.


(c) The month and year of production, which may be in the form of a serial number or a code in those instances where the records specified in § 211.209(a)(1)(iv) are maintained; 


(d) The following statement: “Improper fit of this device will reduce its effectiveness in attenuating noise. Consult the enclosed instructions for proper fit”; 


(e) Instructions as to the proper insertion or placement of the device; and 


(f) The following statement: “Although hearing protectors can be recommended for protection against the harmful effects of impulsive noise, the Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) is based on the attenuation of *continuous* noise and may not be an accurate indicator of the protection attainable against *impulsive* noise such as gunfire.”
