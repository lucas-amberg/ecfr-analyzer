# § 211.211   Compliance with labeling requirement.

(a) All hearing protective devices manufactured after the effective date of this regulation, and meeting the applicability requirements of § 211.201, must be labeled according to this subpart, and must comply with the Labeled Values of mean attenuation.


(b) A manufacturer must take into account both product variability and test-to-test variability when labeling his devices in order to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. A specific category is considered when the attenuation value at the tested one-third octave band is equal to or greater than the Labeled Value, or mean attenuation value, stated in the supporting information required by § 211.204-4, for that tested frequency. The attenuation value must be determined according to the test procedures of § 211.206. The Noise Reduction Rating for the label must be calculated using the Labeled Values of mean attenuation that will be included in the supporting information required by § 211.204-4.
