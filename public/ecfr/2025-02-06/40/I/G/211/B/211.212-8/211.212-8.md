# § 211.212-8   Relabeling requirements.

(a) Any manufacturer who is found to not conform with § 211.212-6, and who has met the requirement of § 211.212-7, must relabel all protectors of the specified category already in his possession according to § 211.211 before distributing them in commerce. The manufacturer shall relabel at values no greater than any mean attenuation values received from Compliance Audit Testing. Any manufacturer who proceeds with § 211.212-7(a) or (b) must relabel his product line with the lowest mean attenuation value at each octave band received from testing; or he may take into account product variability under § 211.211(b) and label with a lower mean attenuation value than the worst case values obtained from Compliance Audit Testing.
