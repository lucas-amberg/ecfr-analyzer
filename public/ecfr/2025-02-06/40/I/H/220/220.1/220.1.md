# § 220.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) *General.* This subchapter H establishes procedures and criteria for the issuance of permits by EPA pursuant to section 102 of the Act. This subchapter H also establishes the criteria to be applied by the Corps of Engineers in its review of activities involving the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters pursuant to section 103 of the Act. Except as may be authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this subchapter H, or pursuant to section 103 of the Act, and subject to other applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to section 108 of the Act: 


(1) No person shall transport from the United States any material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters; 


(2) In the case of a vessel or aircraft registered in the United States or flying the United States flag or in the case of a United States department, agency, or instrumentality, no person shall transport from any location any material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters; and 


(3) No person shall dump any material transported from a location outside the United States: 


(i) Into the territorial sea of the United States; or 


(ii) Into a zone contiguous to the territorial sea of the United States, extending to a line twelve nautical miles seaward from the base line from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, to the extent that it may affect the territorial sea or the territory of the United States. 


(b) *Relationship to international agreements.* In accordance with section 102(a) of the Act, the regulations and criteria included in this subchapter H apply the standards and criteria binding upon the United States under the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter to the extent that application of such standards and criteria do not relax the requirements of the Act. 


(c) *Exclusions*—(1) *Fish wastes.* This subchapter H does not apply to, and no permit hereunder shall be required for, the transportation for the purpose of dumping or the dumping in ocean waters of fish wastes unless such dumping occurs in: 


(i) Harbors or other protected or enclosed coastal waters; or 


(ii) Any other location where the Administrator finds that such dumping may reasonably be anticipated to endanger health, the environment or ecological systems. 


(2) *Fisheries resources.* This subchapter H does not apply to, and no permit hereunder shall be required for, the placement or deposit of oyster shells or other materials for the purpose of developing, maintaining or harvesting fisheries resources; provided, such placement or deposit is regulated under or is a part of an authorized State or Federal program certified to EPA by the agency authorized to enforce the regulation, or to administer the program, as the case may be; and provided further, that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concur in such placement or deposit as it may affect their responsibilities and such concurrence is evidenced by letters of concurrence from these agencies. 


(3) *Vessel propulsion and fixed structures.* This subchapter H does not apply to, and no permit hereunder shall be required for: 


(i) Routine discharges of effluent incidental to the propulsion of vessels or the operation of motor-driven equipment on vessels; or 


(ii) Construction of any fixed structure or artificial island, or the intentional placement of any device in ocean waters or on or in the submerged land beneath such waters, for a purpose other than disposal when such construction or such placement is otherwise regulated by Federal or State law or made pursuant to an authorized Federal or State program certified to EPA by the agency authorized to enforce the regulations or to administer the program, as the case may be. 


(4) *Emergency to safeguard life at sea.* This subchapter H does not apply to, and no permit hereunder shall be required for, the dumping of material into ocean waters from a vessel or aircraft in an emergency to safeguard life at sea to the extent that the person owning or operating such vessel or aircraft files timely reports required by § 224.2(b).
