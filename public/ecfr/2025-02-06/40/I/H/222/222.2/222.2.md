(a) Within 30 days of the receipt of his initial application, an applicant shall be issued notification of whether his application is complete and what, if any, additional information is required.

(b) Within 30 days after receipt of a completed permit application, the Administrator or the Regional Administrator, as the case may be, shall publish notice of such application including a tentative determination with respect to issuance or denial of the permit. If such tentative determination is to issue the permit, the following additional tentative determinations will be made: 


(1) Proposed time limitations, if any; 


(2) Proposed rate of discharge from the barge or vessel transporting the waste; 


(3) Proposed dumping site; and 


(4) A brief description of any other proposed conditions determined to be appropriate for inclusion in the permit in question.
