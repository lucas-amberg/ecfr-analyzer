# ยง 222.7   Conduct of public hearing.

The Presiding Officer shall be responsible for the expeditious conduct of the hearing. The hearing shall be an informal public hearing, not an adversary proceeding, and shall be conducted so as to allow the presentation of public comments. When the Presiding Officer determines that it is necessary or appropriate, he shall cause a suitable record, which may include a verbatim transcript, of the proceedings to be made. Any person may appear at a public hearing convened pursuant to ยง 222.5 whether or not he requested the hearing, and may be represented by counsel or any other authorized representative. The Presiding Officer is authorized to set forth reasonable restrictions on the nature or amount of documentary material or testimony presented at a public hearing, giving due regard to the relevancy of any such information, and to the avoidance of undue repetitiveness of information presented.
