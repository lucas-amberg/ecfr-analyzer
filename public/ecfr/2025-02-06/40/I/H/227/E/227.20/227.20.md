(a) Based on current state of the art, consideration must be given to any possible long-range effects of even the most innocuous substances when dumped in the ocean on a continuing basis. Such a consideration is made in evaluating the relationship of each proposed disposal activity in relationship to its potential for long-range impact on other uses of the ocean.

The factors to be considered in this evaluation include those stated in subpart D, but the evaluation of this subpart E will be based on the impact of the proposed dumping on specific uses of the ocean rather than on overall esthetic, recreational and economic values.
