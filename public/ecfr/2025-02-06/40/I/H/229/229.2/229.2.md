(a) The U.S. Navy is hereby granted a general permit to transport vessels from the United States or from any other location for the purpose of sinking such vessels in ocean waters in testing ordnance and providing related data subject to the following conditions: 


(1) Such vessels may be sunk at times determined by the appropriate Navy official; 


(2) Necessary measures shall be taken to insure that the vessel sinks to the bottom rapidly and permanently, and that marine navigation is not otherwise impaired by the sunk vessel; 


(3) All such vessel sinkings shall be conducted in water at least 1,000 fathoms (6,000 feet) deep and at least 50 nautical miles from land, as defined in ยง 229.1(b); and 


(4) Before sinking, appropriate measures shall be taken by qualified personnel at a Navy or other certified facility to remove to the maximum extent practicable all materials which may degrade the marine environment, including without limitation (i) emptying of all fuel tanks and fuel lines to the lowest point practicable, flushing of such tanks and lines with water, and again emptying such tanks and lines to the lowest point practicable so that such tanks and lines are essentially free of petroleum, and (ii) removing from the hulls other pollutants and all readily detachable material capable of creating debris or contributing to chemical pollution. 


(b) An annual report will be made to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency setting forth the name of each vessel used as a target vessel, its approximate tonnage, and the location and date of sinking.
