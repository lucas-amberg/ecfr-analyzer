# ยง 230.72   Actions controlling the material after discharge.

The effects of the dredged or fill material after discharge may be controlled by:


(a) Selecting discharge methods and disposal sites where the potential for erosion, slumping or leaching of materials into the surrounding aquatic ecosystem will be reduced. These sites or methods include, but are not limited to:


(1) Using containment levees, sediment basins, and cover crops to reduce erosion;


(2) Using lined containment areas to reduce leaching where leaching of chemical constituents from the discharged material is expected to be a problem;


(b) Capping in-place contaminated material with clean material or selectively discharging the most contaminated material first to be capped with the remaining material;


(c) Maintaining and containing discharged material properly to prevent point and nonpoint sources of pollution;


(d) Timing the discharge to minimize impact, for instance during periods of unusual high water flows, wind, wave, and tidal actions.
