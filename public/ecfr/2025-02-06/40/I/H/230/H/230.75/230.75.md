# ยง 230.75   Actions affecting plant and animal populations.

Minimization of adverse effects on populations of plants and animals can be achieved by:


(a) Avoiding changes in water current and circulation patterns which would interfere with the movement of animals;


(b) Selecting sites or managing discharges to prevent or avoid creating habitat conducive to the development of undesirable predators or species which have a competitive edge ecologically over indigenous plants or animals;


(c) Avoiding sites having unique habitat or other value, including habitat of threatened or endangered species;


(d) Using planning and construction practices to institute habitat development and restoration to produce a new or modified environmental state of higher ecological value by displacement of some or all of the existing environmental characteristics. Habitat development and restoration techniques can be used to minimize adverse impacts and to compensate for destroyed habitat. Additional criteria for compensation measures are provided in subpart J of this part. Use techniques that have been demonstrated to be effective in circumstances similar to those under consideration wherever possible. Where proposed development and restoration techniques have not yet advanced to the pilot demonstration stage, initiate their use on a small scale to allow corrective action if unanticipated adverse impacts occur;


(e) Timing discharge to avoid spawning or migration seasons and other biologically critical time periods;


(f) Avoiding the destruction of remnant natural sites within areas already affected by development.
