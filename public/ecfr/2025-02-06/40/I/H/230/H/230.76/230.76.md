(b) Selecting disposal sites which are not valuable as natural aquatic areas;


(c) Timing the discharge to avoid the seasons or periods when human recreational activity associated with the aquatic site is most important;


(d) Following discharge procedures which avoid or minimize the disturbance of aesthetic features of an aquatic site or ecosystem;


(e) Selecting sites that will not be detrimental or increase incompatible human activity, or require the need for frequent dredge or fill maintenance activity in remote fish and wildlife areas;


(f) Locating the disposal site outside of the vicinity of a public water supply intake.
