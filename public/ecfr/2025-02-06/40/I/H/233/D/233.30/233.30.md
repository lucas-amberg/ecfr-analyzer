# ยง 233.30   Application for a permit.

(a) Except when an activity is authorized by a general permit issued pursuant to ยง 233.21 or is exempt from the requirements to obtain a permit under ยง 232.3, any person who proposes to discharge dredged or fill material into State regulated waters shall complete, sign, and submit a permit application to the Director. Applicants for projects that take more than five years to complete must submit a complete application for each five-year permit, and an applicant seeking a new five-year permit must apply for the new permit at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the current permit. The Tribe or State may grant permission to submit an application less than 180 days prior to the expiration of the current permit but no later than the permit expiration date. Persons proposing to discharge dredged or fill material under the authorization of a general permit must comply with any reporting requirements of the general permit.




(b) A complete application shall include:


(1) Name, address, telephone number of the applicant and name(s) and address(es) of adjoining property owners.


(2) A complete description of the proposed activity including necessary drawings, sketches or plans sufficient for public notice (the applicant is not generally expected to submit detailed engineering plans and specifications); the location, purpose and intended use of the proposed activity; scheduling of the activity; the location and dimensions of adjacent structures; and a list of authorizations required by other Federal, interstate, State or local agencies for the work, including all approvals received or denials already made.


(3) The application must include a description of the type, composition, source and quantity of the material to be discharged, the method of discharge, and the site and plans for disposal of the dredged or fill material. 


(4) A certification that all information contained in the application is true and accurate and acknowledging awareness of penalties for submitting false information.


(5) All activities which the applicant plans to undertake which are reasonably related to the same project must be included in the same permit application. For projects for which the planned schedule extends beyond five years at the time of the initial five-year permit application, the application for both the first and subsequent five-year permits must include an analysis demonstrating that each element of the 404(b)(1) Guidelines is met, consistent with 40 CFR part 230, for the full term of the project. Applicants for subsequent five-year permits must update the 404(b)(1) Guidelines analysis if there has been a change in circumstance related to the project following approval of the previous five-year permit, and clearly indicate whether the 404(b)(1) Guidelines analysis has been updated.




(c) In addition to the information indicated in ยง 233.30(b), the applicant will be required to furnish such additional information as the Director deems appropriate to assist in the evaluation of the application. Such additional information may include environmental data and information on alternate methods and sites as may be necessary for the preparation of the required environmental documentation.


(d) The level of detail shall be reasonably commensurate with the type and size of discharge, proximity to critical areas, likelihood of long-lived toxic chemical substances, and potential level of environmental degradation.
