# § 233.36   Modification, suspension or revocation of permits.

(a) *General.* The Director may reevaluate the circumstances and conditions of a permit either on the Director's own motion or at the request of the permittee or of a third party and initiate action to modify, suspend, or revoke a permit if the Director determines that sufficient cause exists. Among the factors to be considered are:


(1) Permittee's noncompliance with any of the terms or conditions of the permit;


(2) Permittee's failure in the application or during the permit issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts or the permittee's misrepresentation of any relevant facts at the time;


(3) Information that activities authorized by a general permit are having more than minimal individual or cumulative adverse effect on the environment, or that the permitted activities are more appropriately regulated by individual permits; 


(4) Circumstances relating to the authorized activity have changed since the permit was issued and justify changed permit conditions or temporary or permanent cessation of any discharge controlled by the permit;


(5) Any significant information relating to the activity authorized by the permit if such information was not available at the time the permit was issued and would have justified the imposition of different permit conditions or denial at the time of issuance;


(6) Revisions to applicable statutory or regulatory authority, including toxic effluent standards or prohibitions or water quality standards.


(b) *Limitations.* Permit modifications shall be in compliance with § 233.20.


(c) *Procedures.* (1) The Director shall develop procedures to modify, suspend, or revoke permits if the Director determines cause exists for such action (§ 233.36(a)). Such procedures shall provide opportunity for public comment (§ 233.32), coordination with the Federal review agencies (§ 233.50), and opportunity for public hearing (§ 233.33) following notification of the permittee. When permit modification is proposed, only the conditions subject to modification need be reopened.


(2) Minor modification of permits. The Director may, upon the consent of the permittee, use abbreviated procedures to modify a permit to make the following corrections or allowance for changes in the permitted activity:


(i) Correct typographical errors;


(ii) Require more frequent monitoring or reporting by permittee;


(iii) Allow for a change in ownership or operational control of a project or activity where the Director determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittees has been submitted to the Director;


(iv) Provide for minor modification of project plans that do not significantly change the character, scope, and/or purpose of the project or result in significant change in environmental impact;


(v) Extend the term of a permit, so long as the modification does not extend the term of the permit beyond 5 years from its original effective date and does not result in any increase in the amount of dredged or fill material allowed to be discharged.
