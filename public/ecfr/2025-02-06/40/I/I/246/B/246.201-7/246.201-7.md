# ยง 246.201-7   Recommended procedures: Cost analysis.

After potential markets have been located (but prior to initiation of formal bidding procedures), preliminary determinations of various separation methods, storage and transportation costs have been made, and estimated tonnages of both recoverable materials and residual solid waste have been established, an analysis should be conducted which compares the costs of the present waste collection and disposal system with the proposed segregated systems. At a minimum this study should include all capital, operating and overhead costs and take into account credits for revenue from paper sales and savings from diverting recycled materials from disposal. Potential costs to upgrade collection and disposal practices to comply with EPA's Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial and Institutional Solid Wastes (40 CFR part 243) and Thermal Processing and Land Disposal Guidelines (40 CFR parts 240 and 241) should be included in the analysis. In formulating a separate collection system and evaluating its costs, every effort should be made to use idle equipment and underutilized collection manpower to reduce separate collection costs. This cost analysis should enable the facility to determine the most cost effective method if implementing the requirements of this part.
