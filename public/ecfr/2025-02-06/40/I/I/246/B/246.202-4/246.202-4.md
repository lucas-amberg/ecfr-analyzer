# ยง 246.202-4   Recommended procedures: Methods of separation and storage.

The method selected will depend upon such variables as the physical layout of the individual generating facility, the rate at which the corrugated accumulates, the storage capacity of the facility, and the projected cost-effectiveness of using the various methods. All of the following suggested modes of separation and storage presuppose that the corrugated boxes will be accumulated at a central location in the facility after their contents are removed and that the boxes are flattened. 


(a) Balers of various sizes: Corrugated boxes are placed in balers and compacted into bales. These bales may be stored inside or outside of the facility. The bales should be protected from fire, inclement weather, theft, and vandalism. 


(b) Stationary compactors or bulk containers: Corrugated boxes are placed in a stationary compactor or bulk containers outside of the facility. The containers should be protected from fire, inclement weather, theft and vandalism.
