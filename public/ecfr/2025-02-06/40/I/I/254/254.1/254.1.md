Section 7002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, authorizes suit by any person to enforce the Act. These suits may be brought where there is alleged to be a violation by any person (including (a) the United States, and (b) any other governmental instrumentality or agency, to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the Constitution) of any permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, or order which has become effective under the Act, or a failure of the Administrator to perform any act or duty under the Act, which is not discretionary with the Administrator. These actions are to be filed in accordance with the rules of the district court in which the action is instituted. The purpose of this part is to prescribe procedures governing the notice requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of section 7002 as a prerequisite to the commencement of such actions.
