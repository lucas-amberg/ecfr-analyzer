# ยง 255.41   Procedure for revision.

The procedure for revising regional identifications or agency responsibilities should be specified by the notification. 


(a) The State should review and, if appropriate, revise or modify the identification of regions and the responsibilities of local and regional agencies at intervals of less than 3 years. Review and modification should include, but not be limited to, the following areas: 


(1) Whether new regions should be identified, or whether present boundaries should be modified. 


(2) Whether responsibilities of an agency should be expanded or reduced due to changes in the needs for solid waste functions in the region. 


(b) Revisions or adjustments to the State plan may require minor boundary or agency changes from time to time. The appropriate EPA Regional Administrator should be notified of such revisions by the State solid waste agency. 


(c) Major revisions or adjustments in agencies or boundaries should be made in consultation with local officials and be subject to the same procedures used in the original identification process. Notification of such revisions should be submitted with State plan updates.
