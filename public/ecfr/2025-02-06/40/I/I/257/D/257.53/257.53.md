An off-site disposal facility is in operation if it is accepting or managing CCR on or after October 19, 2015.






*Active life* or *in operation* means the period of operation beginning with the initial placement of CCR in the CCR unit and ending at completion of closure activities in accordance with § 257.102.


*Active portion* means that part of the CCR unit that has received or is receiving CCR or non-CCR waste and that has not completed closure in accordance with § 257.102.


*Aquifer* means a geologic formation, group of formations, or portion of a formation capable of yielding usable quantities of groundwater to wells or springs.

*Areas susceptible to mass movement* means those areas of influence (*i.e.,* areas characterized as having an active or substantial possibility of mass movement) where, because of natural or human-induced events, the movement of earthen material at, beneath, or adjacent to the CCR unit results in the downslope transport of soil and rock material by means of gravitational influence. Areas of mass movement include, but are not limited to, landslides, avalanches, debris slides and flows, soil fluctuation, block sliding, and rock fall.


*Beneficial use of CCR* means the CCR meet all of the following conditions:


(1) The CCR must provide a functional benefit;


(2) The CCR must substitute for the use of a virgin material, conserving natural resources that would otherwise need to be obtained through practices, such as extraction;
