# § 257.74   Structural integrity criteria for new CCR surface impoundments and any lateral expansion of a CCR surface impoundment.

(a) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section apply to all new CCR surface impoundments and any lateral expansion of a CCR surface impoundment, except for those new CCR surface impoundments that are incised CCR units. If an incised CCR surface impoundment is subsequently modified (e.g., a dike is constructed) such that the CCR unit no longer meets the definition of an incised CCR unit, the CCR unit is subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) No later than the initial receipt of CCR, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must place on or immediately adjacent to the CCR unit a permanent identification marker, at least six feet high showing the identification number of the CCR unit, if one has been assigned by the state, the name associated with the CCR unit and the name of the owner or operator of the CCR unit.


(2) *Periodic hazard potential classification assessments.* (i) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must conduct initial and periodic hazard potential classification assessments of the CCR unit according to the timeframes specified in paragraph (f) of this section. The owner or operator must document the hazard potential classification of each CCR unit as either a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, or a low hazard potential CCR surface impoundment. The owner or operator must also document the basis for each hazard potential classification.


(ii) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer stating that the initial hazard potential classification and each subsequent periodic classification specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section was conducted in accordance with the requirements of this section.


(3) *Emergency Action Plan (EAP)*—(i) *Development of the plan.* Prior to the initial receipt of CCR in the CCR unit, the owner or operator of a CCR unit determined to be either a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment or a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must prepare and maintain a written EAP. At a minimum, the EAP must:


(A) Define the events or circumstances involving the CCR unit that represent a safety emergency, along with a description of the procedures that will be followed to detect a safety emergency in a timely manner;


(B) Define responsible persons, their respective responsibilities, and notification procedures in the event of a safety emergency involving the CCR unit;


(C) Provide contact information of emergency responders;


(D) Include a map which delineates the downstream area which would be affected in the event of a CCR unit failure and a physical description of the CCR unit; and


(E) Include provisions for an annual face-to-face meeting or exercise between representatives of the owner or operator of the CCR unit and the local emergency responders.


(ii) *Amendment of the plan.* (A) The owner or operator of a CCR unit subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section may amend the written EAP at any time provided the revised plan is placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(f)(6). The owner or operator must amend the written EAP whenever there is a change in conditions that would substantially affect the EAP in effect.


(B) The written EAP must be evaluated, at a minimum, every five years to ensure the information required in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is accurate. As necessary, the EAP must be updated and a revised EAP placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(f)(6).


(iii) *Changes in hazard potential classification.* (A) If the owner or operator of a CCR unit determines during a periodic hazard potential assessment that the CCR unit is no longer classified as either a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment or a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, then the owner or operator of the CCR unit is no longer subject to the requirement to prepare and maintain a written EAP beginning on the date the periodic hazard potential assessment documentation is placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(f)(5).


(B) If the owner or operator of a CCR unit classified as a low hazard potential CCR surface impoundment subsequently determines that the CCR unit is properly re-classified as either a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment or a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, then the owner or operator of the CCR unit must prepare a written EAP for the CCR unit as required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section within six months of completing such periodic hazard potential assessment.


(iv) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer stating that the written EAP, and any subsequent amendment of the EAP, meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(v) *Activation of the EAP.* The EAP must be implemented once events or circumstances involving the CCR unit that represent a safety emergency are detected, including conditions identified during periodic structural stability assessments, annual inspections, and inspections by a qualified person.


(4) The CCR unit and surrounding areas must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained with vegetated slopes of dikes not to exceed a height of six inches above the slope of the dike, except for slopes which are protected with an alternate form(s) of slope protection.


(b) The requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section apply to an owner or operator of a new CCR surface impoundment and any lateral expansion of a CCR surface impoundment that either:


(1) Has a height of five feet or more and a storage volume of 20 acre-feet or more; or


(2) Has a height of 20 feet or more.


(c)(1) No later than the initial receipt of CCR in the CCR unit, the owner or operator unit must compile the design and construction plans for the CCR unit, which must include, to the extent feasible, the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (xi) of this section.


(i) The name and address of the person(s) owning or operating the CCR unit; the name associated with the CCR unit; and the identification number of the CCR unit if one has been assigned by the state.

(iii) Dikes mechanically compacted to a density sufficient to withstand the range of loading conditions in the CCR unit;


(iv) Vegetated slopes of dikes and surrounding areas not to exceed a height of six inches above the slope of the dike, except for slopes which have an alternate form or forms of slope protection;


(v) A single spillway or a combination of spillways configured as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section. The combined capacity of all spillways must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to adequately manage flow during and following the peak discharge from the event specified in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section.


(A) All spillways must be either:


(*1*) Of non-erodible construction and designed to carry sustained flows; or


(*2*) Earth- or grass-lined and designed to carry short-term, infrequent flows at non-erosive velocities where sustained flows are not expected.


(B) The combined capacity of all spillways must adequately manage flow during and following the peak discharge from a:


(*1*) Probable maximum flood (PMF) for a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment; or


(*2*) 1000-year flood for a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment; or


(*3*) 100-year flood for a low hazard potential CCR surface impoundment.


(vi) Hydraulic structures underlying the base of the CCR unit or passing through the dike of the CCR unit that maintain structural integrity and are free of significant deterioration, deformation, distortion, bedding deficiencies, sedimentation, and debris which may negatively affect the operation of the hydraulic structure; and


(vii) For CCR units with downstream slopes which can be inundated by the pool of an adjacent water body, such as a river, stream or lake, downstream slopes that maintain structural stability during low pool of the adjacent water body or sudden drawdown of the adjacent water body.


(2) The periodic assessment described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must identify any structural stability deficiencies associated with the CCR unit in addition to recommending corrective measures. If a deficiency or a release is identified during the periodic assessment, the owner or operator unit must remedy the deficiency or release as soon as feasible and prepare documentation detailing the corrective measures taken.


(3) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer stating that the initial assessment and each subsequent periodic assessment was conducted in accordance with the requirements of this section.


(e) *Periodic safety factor assessments.* (1) The owner or operator must conduct an initial and periodic safety factor assessments for each CCR unit and document whether the calculated factors of safety for each CCR unit achieve the minimum safety factors specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (v) of this section for the critical cross section of the embankment. The critical cross section is the cross section anticipated to be the most susceptible of all cross sections to structural failure based on appropriate engineering considerations, including loading conditions. The safety factor assessments must be supported by appropriate engineering calculations.


(i) The calculated static factor of safety under the end-of-construction loading condition must equal or exceed 1.30. The assessment of this loading condition is only required for the initial safety factor assessment and is not required for subsequent assessments.


(ii) The calculated static factor of safety under the long-term, maximum storage pool loading condition must equal or exceed 1.50.


(iii) The calculated static factor of safety under the maximum surcharge pool loading condition must equal or exceed 1.40.


(iv) The calculated seismic factor of safety must equal or exceed 1.00.


(v) For dikes constructed of soils that have susceptibility to liquefaction, the calculated liquefaction factor of safety must equal or exceed 1.20.


(2) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer stating that the initial assessment and each subsequent periodic assessment specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section meets the requirements of this section.


(f) *Timeframes for periodic assessments*—(1) *Initial assessments.* Except as provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must complete the initial assessments required by paragraphs (a)(2), (d), and (e) of this section prior to the initial receipt of CCR in the unit. The owner or operator has completed an initial assessment when the owner or operator has placed the assessment required by paragraphs (a)(2), (d), and (e) of this section in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(f)(5), (10), and (12).


(2) *Frequency for conducting periodic assessments.* The owner or operator of the CCR unit must conduct and complete the assessments required by paragraphs (a)(2), (d), and (e) of this section every five years. The date of completing the initial assessment is the basis for establishing the deadline to complete the first subsequent assessment. The owner or operator may complete any required assessment prior to the required deadline provided the owner or operator places the completed assessment(s) into the facility's operating record within a reasonable amount of time. In all cases, the deadline for completing subsequent assessments is based on the date of completing the previous assessment. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the owner or operator has completed an assessment when the relevant assessment(s) required by paragraphs (a)(2), (d), and (e) of this section has been placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(f)(5), (10), and (12).


(3) *Failure to document minimum safety factors during the initial assessment.* Until the date an owner or operator of a CCR unit documents that the calculated factors of safety achieve the minimum safety factors specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, the owner or operator is prohibited from placing CCR in such unit.


(4) *Closure of the CCR unit.* An owner or operator of a CCR unit who either fails to complete a timely periodic safety factor assessment or fails to demonstrate minimum safety factors as required by paragraph (e) of this section is subject to the requirements of § 257.101(c).


(g) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 257.105(f), the notification requirements specified in § 257.106(f), and the internet requirements specified in § 257.107(f).
