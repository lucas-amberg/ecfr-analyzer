# § 257.80   Air criteria.

(a) The owner or operator of a CCR unit must adopt measures that will effectively minimize CCR from becoming airborne at the facility, including CCR fugitive dust originating from CCR units, roads, and other CCR management and material handling activities.




(b) *CCR fugitive dust control plan.* The owner or operator of the CCR unit must prepare and operate in accordance with a CCR fugitive dust control plan as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section. This requirement applies in addition to, not in place of, any applicable standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.


(1) The CCR fugitive dust control plan must identify and describe the CCR fugitive dust control measures the owner or operator will use to minimize CCR from becoming airborne at the facility. The owner or operator must select, and include in the CCR fugitive dust control plan, the CCR fugitive dust control measures that are most appropriate for site conditions, along with an explanation of how the measures selected are applicable and appropriate for site conditions. Examples of control measures that may be appropriate include: Locating CCR inside an enclosure or partial enclosure; operating a water spray or fogging system; reducing fall distances at material drop points; using wind barriers, compaction, or vegetative covers; establishing and enforcing reduced vehicle speed limits; paving and sweeping roads; covering trucks transporting CCR; reducing or halting operations during high wind events; or applying a daily cover.


(2) If the owner or operator operates a CCR landfill or any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill, the CCR fugitive dust control plan must include procedures to emplace CCR as conditioned CCR. Conditioned CCR means wetting CCR with water to a moisture content that will prevent wind dispersal, but will not result in free liquids. In lieu of water, CCR conditioning may be accomplished with an appropriate chemical dust suppression agent.


(3) The CCR fugitive dust control plan must include procedures to log citizen complaints received by the owner or operator involving CCR fugitive dust events at the facility.


(4) The CCR fugitive dust control plan must include a description of the procedures the owner or operator will follow to periodically assess the effectiveness of the control plan.


(5) The owner or operator of a CCR unit must prepare an initial CCR fugitive dust control plan for the facility no later than October 19, 2015, or by initial receipt of CCR in any CCR unit at the facility if the owner or operator becomes subject to this subpart after October 19, 2015. The owner or operator has completed the initial CCR fugitive dust control plan when the plan has been placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(g)(1).


(6) *Amendment of the plan.* The owner or operator subject to the requirements of this section may amend the written CCR fugitive dust control plan at any time provided the revised plan is placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(g)(1). The owner or operator must amend the written plan no later than 30 days whenever there is a change in conditions that would substantially affect the written plan in effect, such as the construction and operation of a new CCR unit.










(7) The owner or operator must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer or approval from the Participating State Director or approval from EPA where EPA is the permitting authority that the initial CCR fugitive dust control plan, or any subsequent amendment of it, meets the requirements of this section.


(c) *Annual CCR fugitive dust control report.* The owner or operator of a CCR unit must prepare an annual CCR fugitive dust control report that includes a description of the actions taken by the owner or operator to control CCR fugitive dust, a record of all citizen complaints, and a summary of any corrective measures taken. The initial annual report must be completed no later than 14 months after placing the initial CCR fugitive dust control plan in the facility's operating record. The deadline for completing a subsequent report is one year after the date of completing the previous report. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the owner or operator has completed the annual CCR fugitive dust control report when the plan has been placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(g)(2).


(d) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 257.105(g), the notification requirements specified in § 257.106(g), and the internet requirements specified in § 257.107(g).
