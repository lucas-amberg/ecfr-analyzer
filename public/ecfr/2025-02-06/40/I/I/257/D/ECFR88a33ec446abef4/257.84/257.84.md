# § 257.84   Inspection requirements for CCR landfills.

(a) *Inspections by a qualified person.* (1) All CCR landfills and any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill must be examined by a qualified person as follows:


(i) At intervals not exceeding seven days, inspect for any appearances of actual or potential structural weakness and other conditions which are disrupting or have the potential to disrupt the operation or safety of the CCR unit; and


(ii) The results of the inspection by a qualified person must be recorded in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(g)(8).


(2) *Timeframes for inspections by a qualified person*—(i) *Existing CCR landfills.* The owner or operator of the CCR unit must initiate the inspections required under paragraph (a) of this section no later than October 19, 2015.


(ii) *New CCR landfills and any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill.* The owner or operator of the CCR unit must initiate the inspections required under paragraph (a) of this section upon initial receipt of CCR by the CCR unit.


(b) *Annual inspections by a qualified professional engineer.* (1) Existing and new CCR landfills and any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill must be inspected on a periodic basis by a qualified professional engineer to ensure that the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the CCR unit is consistent with recognized and generally accepted good engineering standards. The inspection must, at a minimum, include:


(i) A review of available information regarding the status and condition of the CCR unit, including, but not limited to, files available in the operating record (e.g., the results of inspections by a qualified person, and results of previous annual inspections); and


(ii) A visual inspection of the CCR unit to identify signs of distress or malfunction of the CCR unit.


(2) *Inspection report.* The qualified professional engineer must prepare a report following each inspection that addresses the following:


(i) Any changes in geometry of the structure since the previous annual inspection;


(ii) The approximate volume of CCR contained in the unit at the time of the inspection;


(iii) Any appearances of an actual or potential structural weakness of the CCR unit, in addition to any existing conditions that are disrupting or have the potential to disrupt the operation and safety of the CCR unit; and


(iv) Any other change(s) which may have affected the stability or operation of the CCR unit since the previous annual inspection.


(3) *Timeframes for conducting the initial inspection*—(i) *Existing CCR landfills.* The owner or operator of the CCR unit must complete the initial inspection required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section no later than January 19, 2016.


(ii) *New CCR landfills and any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill.* The owner or operator of the CCR unit must complete the initial annual inspection required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section no later than 14 months following the date of initial receipt of CCR in the CCR unit.


(4) *Frequency of inspections.* The owner or operator of the CCR unit must conduct the inspection required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section on an annual basis. The date of completing the initial inspection report is the basis for establishing the deadline to complete the first subsequent inspection. Any required inspection may be conducted prior to the required deadline provided the owner or operator places the completed inspection report into the facility's operating record within a reasonable amount of time. In all cases, the deadline for completing subsequent inspection reports is based on the date of completing the previous inspection report. For purposes of this section, the owner or operator has completed an inspection when the inspection report has been placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(g)(9).


(5) If a deficiency or release is identified during an inspection, the owner or operator must remedy the deficiency or release as soon as feasible and prepare documentation detailing the corrective measures taken.


(c) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 257.105(g), the notification requirements specified in § 257.106(g), and the internet requirements specified in § 257.107(g).
