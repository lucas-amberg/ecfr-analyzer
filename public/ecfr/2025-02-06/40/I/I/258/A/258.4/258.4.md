(5) Require compliance with all criteria in this part, except as permitted under this section.

(e) Any permit issued under this section shall not exceed three years and each renewal of a permit may not exceed three years. 


(1) The total term for a permit for a project including renewals may not exceed twenty-one (21) years; and


(2) During permit renewal, the applicant shall provide a detailed assessment of the project showing the status with respect to achieving project goals, a list of problems and status with respect to problem resolutions, and other any other requirements that the Director determines necessary for permit renewal.
