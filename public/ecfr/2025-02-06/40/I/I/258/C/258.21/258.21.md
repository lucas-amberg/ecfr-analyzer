# ยง 258.21   Cover material requirements.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owners or operators of all MSWLF units must cover disposed solid waste with six inches of earthen material at the end of each operating day, or at more frequent intervals if necessary, to control disease vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging. 


(b) Alternative materials of an alternative thickness (other than at least six inches of earthen material) may be approved by the Director of an approved State if the owner or operator demonstrates that the alternative material and thickness control disease vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging without presenting a threat to human health and the environment. 


(c) The Director of an approved State may grant a temporary waiver from the requirement of paragraph (a) and (b) of this section if the owner or operator demonstrates that there are extreme seasonal climatic conditions that make meeting such requirements impractical.


(d) The Director of an Approved State may establish alternative frequencies for cover requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, after public review and comment, for any owners or operators of MSWLFs that dispose of 20 tons of municipal solid waste per day or less, based on an annual average. Any alternative requirements established under this paragraph must: 


(1) Consider the unique characteristics of small communities; 


(2) Take into account climatic and hydrogeologic conditions; and 


(3) Be protective of human health and the environment.
