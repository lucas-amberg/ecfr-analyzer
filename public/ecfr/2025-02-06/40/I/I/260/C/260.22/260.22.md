# § 260.22   Petitions to amend part 261 to exclude a waste produced at a particular facility.

(a) Any person seeking to exclude a waste at a particular generating facility from the lists in subpart D of part 261 may petition for a regulatory amendment under this section and § 260.20. To be successful:


(1) The petitioner must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the waste produced by a particular generating facility does not meet any of the criteria under which the waste was listed as a hazardous or an acutely hazardous waste; and


(2) Based on a complete application, the Administrator must determine, where he has a reasonable basis to believe that factors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed could cause the waste to be a hazardous waste, that such factors do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste. A waste which is so excluded, however, still may be a hazardous waste by operation of subpart C of part 261.


(b) The procedures in this Section and § 260.20 may also be used to petition the Administrator for a regulatory amendment to exclude from § 261.3(a)(2)(ii) or (c), a waste which is described in these Sections and is either a waste listed in subpart D, or is derived from a waste listed in subpart D. This exclusion may only be issued for a particular generating, storage, treatment, or disposal facility. The petitioner must make the same demonstration as required by paragraph (a) of this section. Where the waste is a mixture of solid waste and one or more listed hazardous wastes or is derived from one or more hazardous wastes, his demonstration must be made with respect to the waste mixture as a whole; analyses must be conducted for not only those constituents for which the listed waste contained in the mixture was listed as hazardous, but also for factors (including additional constituents) that could cause the waste mixture to be a hazardous waste. A waste which is so excluded may still be a hazardous waste by operation of subpart C of part 261.


(c) If the waste is listed with codes “I”, “C”, “R”, or “E”, in subpart D,


(1) The petitioner must show that the waste does not exhibit the relevant characteristic for which the waste was listed as defined in § 261.21, § 261.22, § 261.23, or § 261.24 using any applicable methods prescribed therein. The petitioner also must show that the waste does not exhibit any of the other characteristics defined in § 261.21, § 261.22, § 261.23, or § 261.24 using any applicable methods prescribed therein;


(2) Based on a complete application, the Administrator must determine, where he has a reasonable basis to believe that factors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed could cause the waste to be hazardous waste, that such factors do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste. A waste which is so excluded, however, still may be a hazardous waste by operation of subpart C of part 261.


(d) If the waste is listed with code “T” in subpart D,


(1) The petitioner must demonstrate that the waste:


(i) Does not contain the constituent or constituents (as defined in appendix VII of part 261 of this chapter) that caused the Administrator to list the waste; or


(ii) Although containing one or more of the hazardous constituents (as defined in appendix VII of part 261) that caused the Administrator to list the waste, does not meet the criterion of § 261.11(a)(3) when considering the factors used by the Administrator in § 261.11(a)(3) (i) through (xi) under which the waste was listed as hazardous; and


(2) Based on a complete application, the Administrator must determine, where he has a reasonable basis to believe that factors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed could cause the waste to be a hazardous waste, that such factors do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste; and


(3) The petitioner must demonstrate that the waste does not exhibit any of the characteristics defined in § 261.21, § 261.22, § 261.23, and § 261.24 using any applicable methods prescribed therein;


(4) A waste which is so excluded, however, still may be a hazardous waste by operation of subpart C of part 261.


(e) If the waste is listed with the code “H” in subpart D,


(1) The petitioner must demonstrate that the waste does not meet the criterion of § 261.11(a)(2); and


(2) Based on a complete application, the Administrator must determine, where he has a reasonable basis to believe that additional factors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed could cause the waste to be a hazardous waste, that such factors do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste; and


(3) The petitioner must demonstrate that the waste does not exhibit any of the characteristics defined in § 261.21, § 261.22, § 261.23, and § 261.24 using any applicable methods prescribed therein;


(4) A waste which is so excluded, however, still may be a hazardous waste by operation of subpart C of part 261.


(f) [Reserved for listing radioactive wastes.] 


(g) [Reserved for listing infectious wastes.] 


(h) Demonstration samples must consist of enough representative samples, but in no case less than four samples, taken over a period of time sufficient to represent the variability or the uniformity of the waste. 


(i) Each petition must include, in addition to the information required by § 260.20(b): 


(1) The name and address of the laboratory facility performing the sampling or tests of the waste; 


(2) The names and qualifications of the persons sampling and testing the waste; 


(3) The dates of sampling and testing; 


(4) The location of the generating facility; 


(5) A description of the manufacturing processes or other operations and feed materials producing the waste and an assessment of whether such processes, operations, or feed materials can or might produce a waste that is not covered by the demonstration; 


(6) A description of the waste and an estimate of the average and maximum monthly and annual quantities of waste covered by the demonstration; 


(7) Pertinent data on and discussion of the factors delineated in the respective criterion for listing a hazardous waste, where the demonstration is based on the factors in § 261.11(a)(3); 


(8) A description of the methodologies and equipment used to obtain the representative samples; 


(9) A description of the sample handling and preparation techniques, including techniques used for extraction, containerization and preservation of the samples; 


(10) A description of the tests performed (including results); 


(11) The names and model numbers of the instruments used in performing the tests; and 


(12) The following statement signed by the generator of the waste or his authorized representative:


(j) After receiving a petition for an exclusion, the Administrator may request any additional information which he may reasonably require to evaluate the petition. 


(k) An exclusion will only apply to the waste generated at the individual facility covered by the demonstration and will not apply to waste from any other facility. 


(l) The Administrator may exclude only part of the waste for which the demonstration is submitted where he has reason to believe that variability of the waste justifies a partial exclusion.
