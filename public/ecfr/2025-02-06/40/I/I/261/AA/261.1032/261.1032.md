# ยง 261.1032   Standards: Process vents.

(a) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats hazardous secondary materials in hazardous secondary material management units with process vents associated with distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operations managing hazardous secondary material with organic concentrations of at least 10 ppmw shall either:


(1) Reduce total organic emissions from all affected process vents at the facility below 1.4 kg/h (3 lb/h) and 2.8 Mg/yr (3.1 tons/yr), or


(2) Reduce, by use of a control device, total organic emissions from all affected process vents at the facility by 95 weight percent.


(b) If the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material installs a closed-vent system and control device to comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section the closed-vent system and control device must meet the requirements of ยง 261.1033.


(c) Determinations of vent emissions and emission reductions or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on control devices may be based on engineering calculations or performance tests. If performance tests are used to determine vent emissions, emission reductions, or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on control devices, the performance tests must conform with the requirements of ยง 261.1034(c).


(d) When a remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material and the Regional Administrator do not agree on determinations of vent emissions and/or emission reductions or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on control devices based on engineering calculations, the procedures in ยง 261.1034(c) shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
