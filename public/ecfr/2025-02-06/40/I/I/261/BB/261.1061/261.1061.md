(c) Performance tests shall be conducted in the following manner:

(2) If an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured, a leak is detected.


(3) The leak percentage shall be determined by dividing the number of valves subject to the requirements in § 261.1057 for which leaks are detected by the total number of valves subject to the requirements in § 261.1057 within the hazardous secondary material management unit.
