(f) For a control device other than a thermal vapor incinerator, catalytic vapor incinerator, flare, boiler, process heater, condenser, or carbon adsorption system, the Regional Administrator will specify the appropriate recordkeeping requirements.


(g) The following information pertaining to all equipment subject to the requirements in §§ 261.1052 through 261.1060 shall be recorded in a log that is kept at the facility:


(1) A list of identification numbers for equipment (except welded fittings) subject to the requirements of this subpart.


(2)(i) A list of identification numbers for equipment that the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material elects to designate for no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, under the provisions of §§ 261.1052(e), 261.1053(i), and 261.1057(f).


(ii) The designation of this equipment as subject to the requirements of §§ 261.1052(e), 261.1053(i), or 261.1057(f) shall be signed by the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material.

If the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material takes any action (*e.g.,* changing the process that produced the material) that could result in an increase in the total organic content of the material contained in or contacted by equipment determined not to be subject to the requirements in §§ 261.1052 through 261.1060, then a new determination is required.

The documentation of compliance under regulations at 40 CFR part 60, part 61, or part 63 shall be kept with or made readily available at the facility.
