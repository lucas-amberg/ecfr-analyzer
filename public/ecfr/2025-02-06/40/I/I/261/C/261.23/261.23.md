(4) When mixed with water, it generates toxic gases, vapors or fumes in a quantity sufficient to present a danger to human health or the environment. 


(5) It is a cyanide or sulfide bearing waste which, when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5, can generate toxic gases, vapors or fumes in a quantity sufficient to present a danger to human health or the environment. 


(6) It is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if heated under confinement. 


(7) It is readily capable of detonation or explosive decomposition or reaction at standard temperature and pressure. 


(8) It is a forbidden explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.54, or is a Division 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.50 and 173.53.
