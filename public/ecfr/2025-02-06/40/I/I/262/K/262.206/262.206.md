# § 262.206   Labeling and management standards for containers of unwanted material in the laboratory.

An eligible academic entity must manage containers of unwanted material while in the laboratory in accordance with the requirements in this section.


(a) Labeling: Label unwanted material as follows:


(1) The following information must be affixed or attached to the container:


(i) The words “unwanted material” or another equally effective term that is to be used consistently by the eligible academic entity and that is identified in Part I of the Laboratory Management Plan, and


(ii) Sufficient information to alert emergency responders to the contents of the container. Examples of information that would be sufficient to alert emergency responders to the contents of the container include, but are not limited to:


(A) The name of the chemical(s),


(B) The type or class of chemical, such as organic solvents or halogenated organic solvents.


(2) The following information may be affixed or attached to the container, but must at a minimum be associated with the container:


(i) The date that the unwanted material first began accumulating in the container, and


(ii) Information sufficient to allow a trained professional to properly identify whether an unwanted material is a solid and hazardous waste and to assign the proper hazardous waste code(s), pursuant to § 262.11. Examples of information that would allow a trained professional to properly identify whether an unwanted material is a solid or hazardous waste include, but are not limited to:


(A) The name and/or description of the chemical contents or composition of the unwanted material, or, if known, the product of the chemical reaction,


(B) Whether the unwanted material has been used or is unused,


(C) A description of the manner in which the chemical was produced or processed, if applicable.


(b) Management of Containers in the Laboratory: An eligible academic entity must properly manage containers of unwanted material in the laboratory to assure safe storage of the unwanted material, to prevent leaks, spills, emissions to the air, adverse chemical reactions, and dangerous situations that may result in harm to human health or the environment. Proper container management must include the following:


(1) Containers are maintained and kept in good condition and damaged containers are replaced, overpacked, or repaired, and


(2) Containers are compatible with their contents to avoid reactions between the contents and the container; and are made of, or lined with, material that is compatible with the unwanted material so that the container's integrity is not impaired, and


(3) Containers must be kept closed at all times, except:


(i) When adding, removing or bulking unwanted material, or


(ii) A working container may be open until the end of the procedure or work shift, or until it is full, whichever comes first, at which time the working container must either be closed or the contents emptied into a separate container that is then closed, or


(iii) When venting of a container is necessary:


(A) For the proper operation of laboratory equipment, such as with in-line collection of unwanted materials from high performance liquid chromatographs, or


(B) To prevent dangerous situations, such as build-up of extreme pressure.
