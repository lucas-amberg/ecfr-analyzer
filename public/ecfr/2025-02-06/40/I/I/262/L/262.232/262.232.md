# § 262.232   Conditions for a generator managing hazardous waste from an episodic event.

(a) *Very small quantity generator.* A very small quantity generator may maintain its existing generator category for hazardous waste generated during an episodic event provided that the generator complies with the following conditions:


(1) The very small quantity generator is limited to one episodic event per calendar year, unless a petition is granted under § 262.233;


(2) *Notification.* The very small quantity generator must notify EPA no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to initiating a planned episodic event using EPA Form 8700-12. In the event of an unplanned episodic event, the generator must notify EPA within 72 hours of the unplanned event via phone, email, or fax and subsequently submit EPA Form 8700-12. The generator shall include the start date and end date of the episodic event, the reason(s) for the event, types and estimated quantities of hazardous waste expected to be generated as a result of the episodic event, and shall identify a facility contact and emergency coordinator with 24-hour telephone access to discuss the notification submittal or respond to an emergency in compliance with § 262.16(b)(9)(i);


(3) *EPA ID Number.* The very small quantity generator must have an EPA identification number or obtain an EPA identification number using EPA Form 8700-12;


(4) *Accumulation.* A very small quantity generator is prohibited from accumulating hazardous waste generated from an episodic event on drip pads and in containment buildings. When accumulating hazardous waste in containers and tanks the following conditions apply:


(i) *Containers.* A very small quantity generator accumulating in containers must mark or label its containers with the following:


(A) The words “Episodic Hazardous Waste”;


(B) An indication of the hazards of the contents (examples include, but are not limited to, the applicable hazardous waste characteristic(s) (*i.e.,* ignitable, corrosive, reactive, toxic); hazard communication consistent with the Department of Transportation requirements at 49 CFR part 172 subpart E (labeling) or subpart F (placarding); a hazard statement or pictogram consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard at 29 CFR 1910.1200; or a chemical hazard label consistent with the National Fire Protection Association code 704); and


(C) The date upon which the episodic event began, clearly visible for inspection on each container.


(ii) *Tanks.* A very small quantity generator accumulating episodic hazardous waste in tanks must do the following:


(A) Mark or label the tank with the words “Episodic Hazardous Waste”;


(B) Mark or label its tanks with an indication of the hazards of the contents (examples include, but are not limited to, the applicable hazardous waste characteristic(s) (*i.e.,* ignitable, corrosive, reactive, toxic); hazard communication consistent with the Department of Transportation requirements at 49 CFR part 172 subpart E (labeling) or subpart F (placarding); a hazard statement or pictogram consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard at 29 CFR 1910.1200; or a chemical hazard label consistent with the National Fire Protection Association code 704);


(C) Use inventory logs, monitoring equipment or other records to identify the date upon which each episodic event begins; and


(D) Keep inventory logs or records with the above information on site and readily available for inspection.


(iii) Hazardous waste must be managed in a manner that minimizes the possibility of a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to the air, soil, or water;


(A) Containers must be in good condition and compatible with the hazardous waste being accumulated therein. Containers must be kept closed except to add or remove waste; and.


(B) Tanks must be in good condition and compatible with the hazardous waste accumulated therein. Tanks must have procedures in place to prevent the overflow (*e.g.,* be equipped with a means to stop inflow with systems such as a waste feed cutoff system or bypass system to a standby tank when hazardous waste is continuously fed into the tank). Tanks must be inspected at least once each operating day to ensure all applicable discharge control equipment, such as waste feed cutoff systems, bypass systems, and drainage systems are in good working order and to ensure the tank is operated according to its design by reviewing the data gathered from monitoring equipment such as pressure and temperature gauges from the inspection.


(5) The very small quantity generator must comply with the hazardous waste manifest provisions of subpart B of this part and the recordkeeping provisions for small quantity generators in § 262.44 when it sends its episodic event hazardous waste off site to a designated facility, as defined in § 260.10 of this subchapter.


(6) The very small quantity generator has up to sixty (60) calendar days from the start of the episodic event to manifest and send its hazardous waste generated from the episodic event to a designated facility, as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter.


(7) Very small quantity generators must maintain the following records for three (3) years from the end date of the episodic event:


(i) Beginning and end dates of the episodic event;


(ii) A description of the episodic event;


(iii) A description of the types and quantities of hazardous wastes generated during the event;


(iv) A description of how the hazardous waste was managed as well as the name of the RCRA-designated facility that received the hazardous waste;


(v) Name(s) of hazardous waste transporters; and


(vi) An approval letter from EPA if the generator petitioned to conduct one additional episodic event per calendar year.


(b) *Small quantity generators.* A small quantity generator may maintain its existing generator category during an episodic event provided that the generator complies with the following conditions:


(1) The small quantity generator is limited to one episodic event per calendar year unless a petition is granted under § 262.233;


(2) *Notification.* The small quantity generator must notify EPA no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to initiating a planned episodic event using EPA Form 8700-12. In the event of an unplanned episodic event, the small quantity generator must notify EPA within 72 hours of the unplanned event via phone, email, or fax, and subsequently submit EPA Form 8700-12. The small quantity generator shall include the start date and end date of the episodic event and the reason(s) for the event, types and estimated quantities of hazardous wastes expected to be generated as a result of the episodic event, and identify a facility contact and emergency coordinator with 24-hour telephone access to discuss the notification submittal or respond to emergency;


(3) *EPA ID Number.* The small quantity generator must have an EPA identification number or obtain an EPA identification number using EPA Form 8700-12; and


(4) *Accumulation by small quantity generators.* A small quantity generator is prohibited from accumulating hazardous wastes generated from an episodic event on drip pads and in containment buildings. When accumulating hazardous waste generated from an episodic event in containers and tanks, the following conditions apply:


(i) *Containers.* A small quantity generator accumulating episodic hazardous waste in containers must meet the standards at § 262.16(b)(2) of this chapter and must mark or label its containers with the following:
