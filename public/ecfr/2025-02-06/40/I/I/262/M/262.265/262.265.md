# ยง 262.265   Emergency procedures.

(a) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:


(1) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and


(2) Notify appropriate state or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.


(b) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. The emergency coordinator may do this by observation or review of the facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.


(c) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (*e.g.,* the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).


(d) If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, the emergency coordinator must report the findings as follows:


(1) If the assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, the emergency coordinator must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. The emergency coordinator must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and


(2) The emergency coordinator must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/424-8802). The report must include:


(i) Name and telephone number of reporter;


(ii) Name and address of the generator;


(iii) Time and type of incident (*e.g.,* release, fire);


(iv) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;


(v) The extent of injuries, if any; and


(vi) The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility.


(e) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the generator's facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released hazardous waste, and removing or isolating containers.


(f) If the generator stops operations in response to a fire, explosion or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.


(g) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility. Unless the generator can demonstrate, in accordance with ยง 261.3(c) or (d) of this chapter, that the recovered material is not a hazardous waste, then it is a newly generated hazardous waste that must be managed in accordance with all the applicable requirements and conditions for exemption in parts 262, 263, and 265 of this chapter.


(h) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:


(1) No hazardous waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and


(2) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.


(i) The generator must note in the operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, the generator must submit a written report on the incident to the Regional Administrator. The report must include:


(1) Name, address, and telephone number of the generator;


(2) Date, time, and type of incident (*e.g.,* fire, explosion);


(3) Name and quantity of material(s) involved;


(4) The extent of injuries, if any;


(5) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable; and


(6) Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.
