# § 264.119   Post-closure notices.

(a) No later than 60 days after certification of closure of each hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must submit to the local zoning authority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and to the Regional Administrator a record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other disposal unit of the facility. For hazardous wastes disposed of before January 12, 1981, the owner or operator must identify the type, location, and quantity of the hazardous wastes to the best of his knowledge and in accordance with any records he has kept.


(b) Within 60 days of certification of closure of the first hazardous waste disposal unit and within 60 days of certification of closure of the last hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must:


(1) Record, in accordance with State law, a notation on the deed to the facility property—or on some other instrument which is normally examined during title search—that will in perpetuity notify any potential purchaser of the property that:


(i) The land has been used to manage hazardous wastes; and


(ii) Its use is restricted under 40 CFR part 264, subpart G regulations; and


(iii) The survey plat and record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other hazardous waste disposal unit of the facility required by §§ 264.116 and 264.119(a) have been filed with the local zoning authority or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use and with the Regional Administrator; and 


(2) Submit a certification, signed by the owner or operator, that he has recorded the notation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including a copy of the document in which the notation has been placed, to the Regional Administrator.


(c) If the owner or operator or any subsequent owner or operator of the land upon which a hazardous waste disposal unit is located wishes to remove hazardous wastes and hazardous waste residues, the liner, if any, or contaminated soils, he must request a modification to the post-closure permit in accordance with the applicable requirements in parts 124 and 270. The owner or operator must demonstrate that the removal of hazardous wastes will satisfy the criteria of § 264.117(c). By removing hazardous waste, the owner or operator may become a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of this chapter. If he is granted a permit modification or otherwise granted approval to conduct such removal activities, the owner or operator may request that the Regional Administrator approve either:


(1) The removal of the notation on the deed to the facility property or other instrument normally examined during title search; or


(2) The addition of a notation to the deed or instrument indicating the removal of the hazardous waste.
