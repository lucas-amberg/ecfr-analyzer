# § 264.170   Applicability.

The regulations in this subpart apply to owners and operators of all hazardous waste facilities that store hazardous waste in containers, except as § 264.1 provides otherwise.


[*Comment:* Under § 261.7 and § 261.33(c) of this chapter, if a hazardous waste is emptied from a container the residue remaining in the container is not considered a hazardous waste if the container is “empty” as defined in § 261.7. In that event, management of the container is exempt from the requirements of this subpart.]
