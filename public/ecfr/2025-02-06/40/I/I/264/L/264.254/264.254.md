(a) During construction or installation, liners (except in the case of existing portions of piles exempt from ยง 264.251(a)) and cover systems (*e.g.,* membranes, sheets, or coatings) must be inspected for uniformity, damage, and imperfections (*e.g.,* holes, cracks, thin spots, or foreign materials). Immediately after construction or installation:


(1) Synthetic liners and covers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of tears, punctures, or blisters; and


(2) Soil-based and admixed liners and covers must be inspected for imperfections including lenses, cracks, channels, root holes, or other structural non-uniformities that may cause an increase in the permeability of the liner or cover.

(1) Deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of run-on and run-off control systems;


(2) Proper functioning of wind dispersal control systems, where present; and


(3) The presence of leachate in and proper functioning of leachate collection and removal systems, where present.
