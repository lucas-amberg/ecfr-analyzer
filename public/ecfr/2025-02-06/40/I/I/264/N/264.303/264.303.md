# § 264.303   Monitoring and inspection.

(a) During construction or installation, liners (except in the case of existing portions of landfills exempt from § 264.301(a)) and cover systems (e.g., membranes, sheets, or coatings) must be inspected for uniformity, damage, and imperfections (*e.g.,* holes, cracks, thin spots, or foreign materials). Immediately after construction or installation:


(1) Synthetic liners and covers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of tears, punctures, or blisters; and


(2) Soil-based and admixed liners and covers must be inspected for imperfections including lenses, cracks, channels, root holes, or other structural non-uniformities that may cause an increase in the permeability of the liner or cover.


(b) While a landfill is in operation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect evidence of any of the following:


(1) Deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of run-on and run-off control systems;


(2) Proper functioning of wind dispersal control systems, where present; and


(3) The presence of leachate in and proper functioning of leachate collection and removal systems, where present.


(c)(1) An owner or operator required to have a leak detection system under § 264.301(c) or (d) must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at least once each week during the active life and closure period.


(2) After the final cover is installed, the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump must be recorded at least monthly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least semi-annually. If at any time during the post-closure care period the pump operating level is exceeded at units on quarterly or semi-annual recording schedules, the owner or operator must return to monthly recording of amounts of liquids removed from each sump until the liquid level again stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months.


(3) “Pump operating level” is a liquid level proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the drainage layer and minimizes head in the sump.
