# ยง 264.312   Special requirements for ignitable or reactive waste.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, and in ยง 264.316, ignitable or reactive waste must not be placed in a landfill, unless the waste and landfill meet all applicable requirements of part 268, and:


(1) The resulting waste, mixture, or dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive waste under ยง 261.21 or ยง 261.23 of this chapter; and


(2) Section 264.17(b) is complied with.


(b) Except for prohibited wastes which remain subject to treatment standards in subpart D of part 268, ignitable wastes in containers may be landfilled without meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the wastes are disposed of in such a way that they are protected from any material or conditions which may cause them to ignite. At a minimum, ignitable wastes must be disposed of in non-leaking containers which are carefully handled and placed so as to avoid heat, sparks, rupture, or any other condition that might cause ignition of the wastes; must be covered daily with soil or other non-combustible material to minimize the potential for ignition of the wastes; and must not be disposed of in cells that contain or will contain other wastes which may generate heat sufficient to cause ignition of the waste.
