# ยง 265.1032   Standards: Process vents.

(a) The owner or operator of a facility with process vents associated with distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction or air or steam stripping operations managing hazardous wastes with organic concentrations at least 10 ppmw shall either: 


(1) Reduce total organic emissions from all affected process vents at the facility below 1.4 kg/h (3 lb/h) and 2.8 Mg/yr (3.1 tons/yr), or


(2) Reduce, by use of a control device, total organic emissions from all affected process vents at the facility by 95 weight percent. 


(b) If the owner or operator installs a closed-vent system and control device to comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the closed-vent system and control device must meet the requirements of ยง 265.1033. 


(c) Determinations of vent emissions and emission reductions or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on control devices may be based on engineering calculations or performance tests. If performance tests are used to determine vent emissions, emission reductions, or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on control devices, the performance tests must conform with the requirements of ยง 265.1034(c). 


(d) When an owner or operator and the Regional Administrator do not agree on determinations of vent emissions and/or emission reductions or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on control devices based on engineering calculations, the test methods in ยง 265.1034(c) shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
