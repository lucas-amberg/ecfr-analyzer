# Appendix V to Part 265—Examples of Potentially Incompatible Waste


Many hazardous wastes, when mixed with other waste or materials at a hazardous waste facility, can produce effects which are harmful to human health and the environment, such as (1) heat or pressure, (2) fire or explosion, (3) violent reaction, (4) toxic dusts, mists, fumes, or gases, or (5) flammable fumes or gases. 


Below are examples of potentially incompatible wastes, waste components, and materials, along with the harmful consequences which result from mixing materials in one group with materials in another group. The list is intended as a guide to owners or operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, and to enforcement and permit granting officials, to indicate the need for special precautions when managing these potentially incompatible waste materials or components. 


This list is not intended to be exhaustive. An owner or operator must, as the regulations require, adequately analyze his wastes so that he can avoid creating uncontrolled substances or reactions of the type listed below, whether they are listed below or not. 


It is possible for potentially incompatible wastes to be mixed in a way that precludes a reaction (e.g., adding acid to water rather than water to acid) or that neutralizes them (e.g., a strong acid mixed with a strong base), or that controls substances produced (e.g., by generating flammable gases in a closed tank equipped so that ignition cannot occur, and burning the gases in an incinerator). 


In the lists below, the mixing of a Group A material with a Group B material may have the potential consequence as noted.


Potential consequences: Heat generation; violent reaction.


Potential consequences: Fire or explosion; generation of flammable hydrogen gas.


Potential consequences: Fire, explosion, or heat generation; generation of flammable or toxic gases.


Potential consequences: Fire, explosion, or violent reaction.


Potential consequences: Generation of toxic hydrogen cyanide or hydrogen sulfide gas.


Potential consequences: Fire, explosion, or violent reaction.
