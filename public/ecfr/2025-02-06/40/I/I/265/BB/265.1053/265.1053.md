# § 265.1053   Standards: Compressors.

(a) Each compressor shall be equipped with a seal system that includes a barrier fluid system and that prevents leakage of total organic emissions to the atmosphere, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section. 


(b) Each compressor seal system as required in paragraph (a) of this section shall be: 


(1) Operated with the barrier fluid at a pressure that is at all times greater than the compressor stuffing box pressure, or 


(2) Equipped with a barrier fluid system that is connected by a closed-vent system to a control device that complies with the requirements of § 265.1060, or 


(3) Equipped with a system that purges the barrier fluid into a hazardous waste stream with no detectable emissions to atmosphere. 


(c) The barrier fluid must not be a hazardous waste with organic concentrations 10 percent or greater by weight. 


(d) Each barrier fluid system as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section shall be equipped with a sensor that will detect failure of the seal system, barrier fluid system, or both. 


(e)(1) Each sensor as required in paragraph (d) of this section shall be checked daily or shall be equipped with an audible alarm that must be checked monthly to ensure that it is functioning properly unless the compressor is located within the boundary of an unmanned plant site, in which case the sensor must be checked daily.


(2) The owner or operator shall determine, based on design considerations and operating experience, a criterion that indicates failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system or both. 


(f) If the sensor indicates failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system, or both based on the criterion determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a leak is detected. 


(g)(1) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in § 265.1059. 


(2) A first attempt at repair (e.g., tightening the packing gland) shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after each leak is detected. 


(h) A compressor is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if it is equipped with a closed-vent system capable of capturing and transporting any leakage from the seal to a control device that complies with the requirements of § 265.1060, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section. 


(i) Any compressor that is designated, as described in § 265.1064(g)(2), for no detectable emission as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section if the compressor: 


(1) Is determined to be operating with no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, as measured by the method specified in § 265.1063(c). 


(2) Is tested for compliance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section initially upon designation, annually, and at other times as requested by the Regional Administrator.
