# § 265.1063   Test methods and procedures.

(a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the test methods and procedures requirements provided in this section. 


(b) Leak detection monitoring, as required in §§ 265.1052 through 265.1062, shall comply with the following requirements:


(1) Monitoring shall comply with Reference Method 21 in 40 CFR part 60.


(2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Reference Method 21.


(3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Reference Method 21.


(4) Calibration gases shall be:


(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air).


(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane.


(5) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Reference Method 21.


(c) When equipment is tested for compliance with no detectable emissions, as required in §§ 265.1052(e), 265.1053(i), 265.1054, and 265.1057(f), the test shall comply with the following requirements:


(1) The requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section shall apply.


(2) The background level shall be determined, as set forth in Reference Method 21.


(3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Reference Method 21.


(4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 500 ppm for determining compliance.


(d) In accordance with the waste analysis plan required by § 265.13(b), an owner or operator of a facility must determine, for each piece of equipment, whether the equipment contains or contacts a hazardous waste with organic concentration that equals or exceeds 10 percent by weight using the following:


(1) Methods described in ASTM Methods D 2267-88, E 169-87, E 168-88, E 260-85 (incorporated by reference under § 260.11);


(2) Method 9060A (incorporated by reference under § 260.11 of this chapter) of “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste,” EPA Publication SW-846 or analyzed for its individual organic constituents; or 


(3) Application of the knowledge of the nature of the hazardous waste stream or the process by which it was produced. Documentation of a waste determination by knowledge is required. Examples of documentation that shall be used to support a determination under this provision include production process information documenting that no organic compounds are used, information that the waste is generated by a process that is identical to a process at the same or another facility that has previously been demonstrated by direct measurement to have a total organic content less than 10 percent, or prior speciation analysis results on the same waste stream where it can also be documented that no process changes have occurred since that analysis that could affect the waste total organic concentration.


(e) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment contains or contacts a hazardous waste with organic concentrations at least 10 percent by weight, the determination can be revised only after following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.


(f) When an owner or operator and the Regional Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment contains or contacts a hazardous waste with organic concentrations at least 10 percent by weight, the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section can be used to resolve the dispute. 


(g) Samples used in determining the percent organic content shall be representative of the highest total organic content hazardous waste that is expected to be contained in or contact the equipment. 


(h) To determine if pumps or valves are in light liquid service, the vapor pressures of constituents may be obtained from standard reference texts or may be determined by ASTM D-2879-86 (incorporated by reference under § 260.11). 


(i) Performance tests to determine if a control device achieves 95 weight percent organic emission reduction shall comply with the procedures of § 265.1034 (c)(1) through (c)(4).
