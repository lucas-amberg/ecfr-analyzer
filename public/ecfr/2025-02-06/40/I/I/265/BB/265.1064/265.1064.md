(e) Design documentation and monitoring, operating, and inspection information for each closed-vent system and control device required to comply with the provisions of § 265.1060 shall be recorded and kept up-to-date in the facility operating record as specified in § 265.1035(c). Design documentation is specified in § 265.1035 (c)(1) and (c)(2) and monitoring, operating, and inspection information in § 265.1035 (c)(3)-(c)(8). 


(f) For a control device other than a thermal vapor incinerator, catalytic vapor incinerator, flare, boiler, process heater, condenser, or carbon adsorption system, monitoring and inspection information indicating proper operation and maintenance of the control device must be recorded in the facility operating record. 


(g) The following information pertaining to all equipment subject to the requirements in §§ 265.1052 through 265.1060 shall be recorded in a log that is kept in the facility operating record: 


(1) A list of identification numbers for equipment (except welded fittings) subject to the requirements of this subpart. 


(2)(i) A list of identification numbers for equipment that the owner or operator elects to designate for no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, under the provisions of §§ 265.1052(e), 265.1053(i), and 265.1057(f). 


(ii) The designation of this equipment as subject to the requirements of §§ 265.1052(e), 265.1053(i), or 265.1057(f) shall be signed by the owner or operator. 


(3) A list of equipment identification numbers for pressure relief devices required to comply with § 265.1054(a).

The record shall include supporting documentation as required by § 265.1063(d)(3) when application of the knowledge of the nature of the hazardous waste stream or the process by which it was produced is used. If the owner or operator takes any action (e.g., changing the process that produced the waste) that could result in an increase in the total organic content of the waste contained in or contacted by equipment determined not to be subject to the requirements in §§ 265.1052 through 265.1060, then a new determination is required. 


(l) Records of the equipment leak information required by paragraph (d) of this section and the operating information required by paragraph (e) of this section need be kept only 3 years. 


(m) The owner or operator of any facility with equipment that is subject to this subpart and to leak detection, monitoring, and repair requirements under regulations at 40 CFR part 60, part 61, or part 63 may elect to determine compliance with this subpart either by documentation pursuant to § 265.1064 of this subpart, or by documentation of compliance with the regulations at 40 CFR part 60, part 61, or part 63 pursuant to the relevant provisions of the regulations at 40 part 60, part 61, or part 63. The documentation of compliance under regulation at 40 CFR part 60, part 61, or part 63 shall be kept with or made readily available with the facility operating record.
