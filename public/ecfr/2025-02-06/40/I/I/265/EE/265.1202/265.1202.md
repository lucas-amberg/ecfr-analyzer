# ยง 265.1202   Closure and post-closure care.

(a) At closure of a magazine or unit which stored hazardous waste under this subpart, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components, contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste, and manage them as hazardous waste unless ยง 261.3(d) of this chapter applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for closure, and financial responsibility for magazines or units must meet all of the requirements specified in subparts G and H of this part, except that the owner or operator may defer closure of the unit as long as it remains in service as a munitions or explosives magazine or storage unit.


(b) If, after removing or decontaminating all residues and making all reasonable efforts to effect removal or decontamination of contaminated components, subsoils, structures, and equipment as required in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator finds that not all contaminated subsoils can be practicably removed or decontaminated, he or she must close the facility and perform post-closure care in accordance with the closure and post-closure requirements that apply to landfills (40 CFR 264.310).
