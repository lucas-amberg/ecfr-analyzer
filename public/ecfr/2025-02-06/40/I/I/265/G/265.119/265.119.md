# § 265.119   Post-closure notices.

(a) No later than 60 days after certification of closure of each hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must submit to the local zoning authority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and to the Regional Administrator, a record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other disposal unit of the facility. For hazardous wastes disposed of before January 12, 1981, the owner or operator must identify the type, location and quantity of the hazardous wastes to the best of his knowledge and in accordance with any records he has kept. 


(b) Within 60 days of certification of closure of the first hazardous waste disposal unit and within 60 days of certification of closure of the last hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must: 


(1) Record, in accordance with State law, a notation on the deed to the facility property—or on some other instrument which is normally examined during title search—that will in perpetuity notify any potential purchaser of the property that: 


(i) The land has been used to manage hazardous wastes; and 


(ii) Its use is restricted under 40 CFR part 265, subpart G regulations; and 


(iii) The survey plat and record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other hazardous waste disposal unit of the facility required by §§ 265.116 and 265.119(a) have been filed with the local zoning authority or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use and with the Regional Administrator; and 


(2) Submit a certification signed by the owner or operator that he has recorded the notation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a copy of the document in which the notation has been placed, to the Regional Administrator. 


(c) If the owner or operator or any subsequent owner of the land upon which a hazardous waste disposal unit was located wishes to remove hazardous wastes and hazardous waste residues, the liner, if any, and all contaminated structures, equipment, and soils, he must request a modification to the approved post-closure plan in accordance with the requirements of § 265.118(g). The owner or operator must demonstrate that the removal of hazardous wastes will satisfy the criteria of § 265.117(c). By removing hazardous waste, the owner or operator may become a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of this chapter. If the owner or operator is granted approval to conduct the removal activities, the owner or operator may request that the Regional Administrator approve either:


(1) The removal of the notation on the deed to the facility property or other instrument normally examined during title search, or 


(2) The addition of a notation to the deed or instrument indicating the removal of the hazardous waste.
