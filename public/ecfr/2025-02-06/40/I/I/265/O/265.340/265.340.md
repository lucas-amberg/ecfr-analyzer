(b) *Integration of the MACT standards.* (1) Except as provided by paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the standards of this part no longer apply when an owner or operator demonstrates compliance with the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with the requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter.


(2) The MACT standards do not replace the closure requirements of § 264.351 or the applicable requirements of subparts A through H, BB and CC of this part.


(3) Section 265.345 generally prohibiting burning of hazardous waste during startup and shutdown remains in effect if you elect to comply with § 270.235(b)(1)(i) of this chapter to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup and shutdown.

(2) Listed as a hazardous waste in part 261, subpart D, of this chapter solely because it is reactive (Hazard Code R) for characteristics other than those listed in § 261.23(a) (4) and (5), and will not be burned when other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion zone; or


(3) A hazardous waste solely because it possesses the characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, or both, as determined by the tests for characteristics of hazardous wastes under part 261, subpart C, of this chapter; or


(4) A hazardous waste solely because it possesses the reactivity characteristics described by § 261.23(a) (1), (2), (3), (6), (7), or (8) of this chapter, and will not be burned when other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion zone.
