# ยง 265.341   Waste analysis.

In addition to the waste analyses required by ยง 265.13, the owner or operator must sufficiently analyze any waste which he has not previously burned in his incinerator to enable him to establish steady state (normal) operating conditions (including waste and auxiliary fuel feed and air flow) and to determine the type of pollutants which might be emitted. At a minimum, the analysis must determine:


(a) Heating value of the waste;


(b) Halogen content and sulfur content in the waste; and


(c) Concentrations in the waste of lead and mercury, unless the owner or operator has written, documented data that show that the element is not present.
