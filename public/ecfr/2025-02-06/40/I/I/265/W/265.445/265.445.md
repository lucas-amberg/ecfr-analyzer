# § 265.445   Closure.

(a) At closure, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components (pad, liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste and leakage, and manage them as hazardous waste. 


(b) If, after removing or decontaminating all residues and making all reasonable efforts to effect removal or decontamination of contaminated components, subsoils, structures, and equipment as required in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator finds that not all contaminated subsoils can be practically removed or decontaminated, he must close the facility and perform post-closure care in accordance with closure and post-closure care requirements that apply to landfills (§ 265.310). For permitted units, the requirement to have a permit continues throughout the post-closure period. 


(c)(1) The owner or operator of an existing drip pad, as defined in § 265.440 of this subpart, that does not comply with the liner requirements of § 265.443(b)(1) must: 


(i) Include in the closure plan for the drip pad under § 265.112 both a plan for complying with paragraph (a) of this section and a contingent plan for complying with paragraph (b) of this section in case not all contaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at closure; and


(ii) Prepare a contingent post-closure plan under § 265.118 of this part for complying with paragraph (b) of this section in case not all contaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at closure. 


(2) The cost estimates calculated under §§ 265.112 and 265.144 of this part for closure and post-closure care of a drip pad subject to this paragraph must include the cost of complying with the contingent closure plan and the contingent post-closure plan, but are not required to include the cost of expected closure under paragraph (a) of this section.
