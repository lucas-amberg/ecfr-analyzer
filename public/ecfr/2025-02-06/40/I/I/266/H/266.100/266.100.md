# § 266.100   Applicability.

(a) The regulations of this subpart apply to hazardous waste burned or processed in a boiler or industrial furnace (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) irrespective of the purpose of burning or processing, except as provided by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (g), and (h) of this section. In this subpart, the term “burn” means burning for energy recovery or destruction, or processing for materials recovery or as an ingredient. The emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 apply to facilities operating under interim status or under a RCRA permit as specified in §§ 266.102 and 266.103.


(b) *Integration of the MACT standards.* (1) Except as provided by paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, the standards of this part do not apply to a new hazardous waste boiler or industrial furnace unit that becomes subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005; or no longer apply when an owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste boiler or industrial furnace unit demonstrates compliance with the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with the requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter. Nevertheless, even after this demonstration of compliance with the MACT standards, RCRA permit conditions that were based on the standards of this part will continue to be in effect until they are removed from the permit or the permit is terminated or revoked, unless the permit expressly provides otherwise.


(2) The following standards continue to apply:


(i) If you elect to comply with § 270.235(a)(1)(i) of this chapter to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, § 266.102(e)(1) requiring operations in accordance with the operating requirements specified in the permit at all times that hazardous waste is in the unit, and § 266.102(e)(2)(iii) requiring compliance with the emission standards and operating requirements during startup and shutdown if hazardous waste is in the combustion chamber, except for particular hazardous wastes. These provisions apply only during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events;


(ii) The closure requirements of §§ 266.102(e)(11) and 266.103(l);


(iii) The standards for direct transfer of § 266.111;


(iv) The standards for regulation of residues of § 266.112; and


(v) The applicable requirements of subparts A through H, BB and CC of parts 264 and 265 of this chapter.


(3) If you own or operate a boiler or hydrochloric acid production furnace that is an area source under § 63.2 of this chapter and you elect not to comply with the emission standards under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, and 63.1218 of this chapter for particulate matter, semivolatile and low volatile metals, and total chlorine, you also remain subject to:


(i) Section 266.105—Standards to control particulate matter;


(ii) Section 266.106—Standards to control metals emissions, except for mercury; and


(iii) Section 266.107—Standards to control hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas.


(4) The particulate matter standard of § 266.105 remains in effect for boilers that elect to comply with the alternative to the particulate matter standard under §§ 63.1216(e) and 63.1217(e) of this chapter. 






(c) The following hazardous wastes and facilities are not subject to regulation under this subpart:


(1) Used oil burned for energy recovery that is also a hazardous waste solely because it exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter. Such used oil is subject to regulation under part 279 of this chapter;


(2) Gas recovered from hazardous or solid waste landfills when such gas is burned for energy recovery;


(3) Hazardous wastes that are exempt from regulation under §§ 261.4 and 261.6(a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this subchapter, and hazardous wastes that are subject to the conditions for exemption for very small quantity generators under § 262.14 of this subchapter; and








(4) Coke ovens, if the only hazardous waste burned is EPA Hazardous Waste No. K087, decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations.


(d) Owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces (including pyrometallurgical devices such as cupolas, sintering machines, roasters, and foundry furnaces, but not including cement kilns, aggregate kilns, or halogen acid furnaces burning hazardous waste) that process hazardous waste solely for metal recovery are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for §§ 266.101 and 266.112.


(1) To be exempt from §§ 266.102 through 266.111, an owner or operator of a metal recovery furnace or mercury recovery furnace must comply with the following requirements, except that an owner or operator of a lead or a nickel-chromium recovery furnace, or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces that are subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP must comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.


(i) Provide a one-time written notice to the Director indicating the following:


(A) The owner or operator claims exemption under this paragraph;


(B) The hazardous waste is burned solely for metal recovery consistent with the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section;


(C) The hazardous waste contains recoverable levels of metals; and


(D) The owner or operator will comply with the sampling and analysis and recordkeeping requirements of this paragraph;


(ii) Sample and analyze the hazardous waste and other feedstocks as necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph by using appropriate methods; and 


(iii) Maintain at the facility for at least three years records to document compliance with the provisions of this paragraph including limits on levels of toxic organic constituents and Btu value of the waste, and levels of recoverable metals in the hazardous waste compared to normal nonhazardous waste feedstocks.


(2) A hazardous waste meeting either of the following criteria is not processed solely for metal recovery:


(i) The hazardous waste has a total concentration of organic compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned for destruction. The concentration of organic compounds in a waste as-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by *bona fide* treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 500 ppm limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section; or 


(ii) The hazardous waste has a heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by *bona fide* treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. 


(3) To be exempt from §§ 266.102 through 266.111, an owner or operator of a lead or nickel-chromium or mercury recovery furnace (except for owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP) or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must provide a one-time written notice to the Director identifying each hazardous waste burned and specifying whether the owner or operator claims an exemption for each waste under this paragraph or paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owners or operator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section for those wastes claimed to be exempt under that paragraph and must comply with the requirements below for those wastes claimed to be exempt under this paragraph (d)(3). 


(i) The hazardous wastes listed in appendices XI, XII, and XIII, part 266, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, provided that:


(A) A waste listed in appendix XI of this part must contain recoverable levels of lead, a waste listed in appendix XII of this part must contain recoverable levels of nickel or chromium, a waste listed in appendix XIII of this part must contain recoverable levels of mercury and contain less than 500 ppm of 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII organic constituents, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing must contain recoverable levels of metal; and 


(B) The waste does not exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic of § 261.24 of this chapter for an organic constituent; and


(C) The waste is not a hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter because it is listed for an organic constituent as identified in appendix VII of part 261 of this chapter; and


(D) The owner or operator certifies in the one-time notice that hazardous waste is burned under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and that sampling and analysis will be conducted or other information will be obtained as necessary to ensure continued compliance with these requirements. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted according to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and records to document compliance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall be kept for at least three years.


(ii) The Director may decide on a case-by-case basis that the toxic organic constituents in a material listed in appendix XI, XII, or XIII of this part that contains a total concentration of more than 500 ppm toxic organic compounds listed in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, may pose a hazard to human health and the environment when burned in a metal recovery furnace exempt from the requirements of this subpart. In that situation, after adequate notice and opportunity for comment, the metal recovery furnace will become subject to the requirements of this subpart when burning that material. In making the hazard determination, the Director will consider the following factors: 


(A) The concentration and toxicity of organic constituents in the material; and


(B) The level of destruction of toxic organic constituents provided by the furnace; and


(C) Whether the acceptable ambient levels established in appendices IV or V of this part may be exceeded for any toxic organic compound that may be emitted based on dispersion modeling to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration.


(e) The standards for direct transfer operations under § 266.111 apply only to facilities subject to the permit standards of § 266.102 or the interim status standards of § 266.103.


(f) The management standards for residues under § 266.112 apply to any boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste.


(g) Owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces (including pyrometallurgical devices such as cupolas, sintering machines, roasters, and foundry furnaces) that process hazardous waste for recovery of economically significant amounts of the precious metals gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, or ruthenium, or any combination of these are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for § 266.112. To be exempt from §§ 266.101 through 266.111, an owner or operator must:


(1) Provide a one-time written notice to the Director indicating the following:


(i) The owner or operator claims exemption under this paragraph;


(ii) The hazardous waste is burned for legitimate recovery of precious metal; and


(iii) The owner or operator will comply with the sampling and analysis and recordkeeping requirements of this paragraph; and


(2) Sample and analyze the hazardous waste as necessary to document that the waste contains economically significant amounts of the metals and that the treatment recovers economically significant amounts of precious metal; and 


(3) Maintain at the facility for at least three years records to document that all hazardous wastes burned are burned for recovery of economically significant amounts of precious metal.


(h) Starting June 23, 1997, owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces that process hazardous waste for recovery of lead and that are subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP, are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for § 266.101. To be exempt, an owner or operator must provide a one-time notice to the Director identifying each hazardous waste burned and specifying that the owner or operator claims an exemption under this paragraph. The notice also must state that the waste burned has a total concentration of non-metal compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter of less than 500 ppm by weight, as fired and as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, or is listed in appendix XI to this part 266.
