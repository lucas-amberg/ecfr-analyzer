# § 266.103   Interim status standards for burners.

(a) *Purpose, scope, applicability*—(1) *General.* (i) The purpose of this section is to establish minimum national standards for owners and operators of “existing” boilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste where such standards define the acceptable management of hazardous waste during the period of interim status. The standards of this section apply to owners and operators of existing facilities until either a permit is issued under § 266.102(d) or until closure responsibilities identified in this section are fulfilled.


(ii) *Existing or in existence* means a boiler or industrial furnace that on or before August 21, 1991 is either in operation burning or processing hazardous waste or for which construction (including the ancillary facilities to burn or to process the hazardous waste) has commenced. A facility has commenced construction if the owner or operator has obtained the Federal, State, and local approvals or permits necessary to begin physical construction; and either:


(A) A continuous on-site, physical construction program has begun; or


(B) The owner or operator has entered into contractual obligations—which cannot be canceled or modified without substantial loss—for physical construction of the facility to be completed within a reasonable time.


(iii) If a boiler or industrial furnace is located at a facility that already has a permit or interim status, then the facility must comply with the applicable regulations dealing with permit modifications in § 270.42 or changes in interim status in § 270.72 of this chapter.


(2) *Exemptions.* The requirements of this section do not apply to hazardous waste and facilities exempt under §§ 266.100(b), or 266.108.


(3) *Prohibition on burning dioxin-listed wastes.* The following hazardous waste listed for dioxin and hazardous waste derived from any of these wastes may not be burned in a boiler or industrial furnace operating under interim status: F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027. 


(4) *Applicability of part 265 standards.* Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste and are operating under interim status are subject to the following provisions of part 265 of this chapter, except as provided otherwise by this section:


(i) In subpart A (General), § 265.4;


(ii) In subpart B (General facility standards), §§ 265.11-265.17;


(iii) In subpart C (Preparedness and prevention), §§ 265.31-265.37;


(iv) In subpart D (Contingency plan and emergency procedures), §§ 265.51-265.56;


(v) In subpart E (Manifest system, recordkeeping, and reporting), §§ 265.71-265.77, except that §§ 265.71, 265.72, and 265.76 do not apply to owners and operators of on-site facilities that do not receive any hazardous waste from off-site sources;


(vi) In subpart G (Closure and post-closure), §§ 265.111-265.115;


(vii) In subpart H (Financial requirements), §§ 265.141, 265.142, 265.143, and 265.147-265.150, except that States and the Federal government are exempt from the requirements of subpart H; and


(viii) Subpart BB (Air emission standards for equipment leaks), except § 265.1050(a).


(5) *Special requirements for furnaces.* The following controls apply during interim status to industrial furnaces (e.g., kilns, cupolas) that feed hazardous waste for a purpose other than solely as an ingredient (see paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section) at any location other than the hot end where products are normally discharged or where fuels are normally fired: 


(i) *Controls.* (A) The hazardous waste shall be fed at a location where combustion gas temperatures are at least 1800 °F;


(B) The owner or operator must determine that adequate oxygen is present in combustion gases to combust organic constituents in the waste and retain documentation of such determination in the facility record;


(C) For cement kiln systems, the hazardous waste shall be fed into the kiln; and


(D) The hydrocarbon controls of § 266.104(c) or paragraph (c)(5) of this section apply upon certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section irrespective of the CO level achieved during the compliance test.


(ii) *Burning hazardous waste solely as an ingredient.* A hazardous waste is burned for a purpose other than solely as an ingredient if it meets either of these criteria:


(A) The hazardous waste has a total concentration of nonmetal compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned for destruction. The concentration of nonmetal compounds in a waste as-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by *bona fide* treatment that removes or destroys nonmetal constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 500 ppm limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the facility record; or 


(B) The hazardous waste has a heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by *bona fide* treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly blended must be retained in the facility record. 


(6) *Restrictions on burning hazardous waste that is not a fuel.* Prior to certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, owners and operators shall not feed hazardous waste that has a heating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb, as-generated, (except that the heating value of a waste as-generated may be increased to above the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by *bona fide* treatment; however, blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and records must be kept to document that impermissible blending has not occurred) in a boiler or industrial furnace, except that: 


(i) Hazardous waste may be burned solely as an ingredient; or 


(ii) Hazardous waste may be burned for purposes of compliance testing (or testing prior to compliance testing) for a total period of time not to exceed 720 hours; or 


(iii) Such waste may be burned if the Director has documentation to show that, prior to August 21, 1991: 


(A) The boiler or industrial furnace is operating under the interim status standards for incinerators provided by subpart O of part 265 of this chapter, or the interim status standards for thermal treatment units provided by subpart P of part 265 of this chapter; and 


(B) The boiler or industrial furnace met the interim status eligibility requirements under § 270.70 of this chapter for subpart O or subpart P of part 265 of this chapter; and 


(C) Hazardous waste with a heating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb was burned prior to that date; or 


(iv) Such waste may be burned in a halogen acid furnace if the waste was burned as an excluded ingredient under § 261.2(e) of this chapter prior to February 21, 1991 and documentation is kept on file supporting this claim. 


(7) *Direct transfer to the burner.* If hazardous waste is directly transferred from a transport vehicle to a boiler or industrial furnace without the use of a storage unit, the owner and operator must comply with § 266.111.


(b) *Certification of precompliance*—(1) *General.* The owner or operator must provide complete and accurate information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the Director on or before August 21, 1991, and must establish limits for the operating parameters specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Such information is termed a “certification of precompliance” and constitutes a certification that the owner or operator has determined that, when the facility is operated within the limits specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the owner or operator believes that, using best engineering judgment, emissions of particulate matter, metals, and HCl and Cl_2_ are not likely to exceed the limits provided by §§ 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107. The facility may burn hazardous waste only under the operating conditions that the owner or operator establishes under paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the owner or operator submits a revised certification of precompliance under paragraph (b)(8) of this section or a certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, or until a permit is issued.


(2) *Information required.* The following information must be submitted with the certification of precompliance to support the determination that the limits established for the operating parameters identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are not likely to result in an exceedance of the allowable emission rates for particulate matter, metals, and HCl and Cl_2_.

During interim status, hazardous waste analysis for metals content must be sufficient for the owner or operator to determine if changes in metals content may affect the ability of the facility to meet the metals emissions standards established under § 266.106(c) or (d). Under this option, operating limits (under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) must be established during compliance testing under paragraph (c)(3) of this section only on the following parameters; 


(*1*) Feed rate of total hazardous waste;


(*2*) Total feed rate of chlorine and chloride in total feed streams; 


(*3*) Total feed rate of ash in total feed streams, except that the ash feed rate for cement kilns and light-weight aggregate kilns is not limited; 


(*4*) Carbon monoxide concentration, and where required, hydrocarbon concentration in stack gas; 


(*5*) Maximum production rate of the device in appropriate units when producing normal product; or 


(C) Conduct compliance testing to determine compliance with the metals standards to establish limits on the operating parameters of paragraph (c)(1) of this section only after the kiln system has been conditioned to enable it to reach equilibrium with respect to metals fed into the system and metals emissions. During conditioning, hazardous waste and raw materials having the same metals content as will be fed during the compliance test must be fed at the feed rates that will be fed during the compliance test. 


(iii) *Conduct of compliance testing.* (A) If compliance with all applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 is not demonstrated simultaneously during a set of test runs, the operating conditions of additional test runs required to demonstrate compliance with remaining emissions standards must be as close as possible to the original operating conditions. 


(B) Prior to obtaining test data for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 or establishing limits on operating parameters under this section, the facility must operate under compliance test conditions for a sufficient period to reach steady-state operations. Industrial furnaces that recycle collected particulate matter back into the furnace and that comply with paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, however, need not reach steady state conditions with respect to the flow of metals in the system prior to beginning compliance testing for metals. 


(C) Compliance test data on the level of an operating parameter for which a limit must be established in the certification of compliance must be obtained during emissions sampling for the pollutant(s) (*i.e.*, metals, PM, HCl/Cl_2_, organic compounds) for which the parameter must be established as specified by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 


(4) *Certification of compliance.* Within 90 days of completing compliance testing, the owner or operator must certify to the Director compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 (b), (c), and (e), 266.105, 266.106, 266.107, and paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D) of this section. The certification of compliance must include the following information: 


(i) General facility and testing information including: 


(A) EPA facility ID number; 


(B) Facility name, contact person, telephone number, and address; 


(C) Person responsible for conducting compliance testing, including company name, address, and telephone number, and a statement of qualifications; 


(D) Date(s) of each compliance test; 


(E) Description of boiler or industrial furnace tested; 


(F) Person responsible for quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), title, and telephone number, and statement that procedures prescribed in the QA/QC plan submitted under § 266.103(c)(2)(iii) have been followed, or a description of any changes and an explanation of why changes were necessary.


(G) Description of any changes in the unit configuration prior to or during testing that would alter any of the information submitted in the prior notice of compliance testing under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and an explanation of why the changes were necessary;


(H) Description of any changes in the planned test conditions prior to or during the testing that alter any of the information submitted in the prior notice of compliance testing under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and an explanation of why the changes were necessary; and


(I) The complete report on results of emissions testing.


(ii) Specific information on each test including:


(A) Purpose(s) of test (e.g., demonstrate conformance with the emissions limits for particulate matter, metals, HCl, Cl_2_, and CO)


(B) Summary of test results for each run and for each test including the following information:


(*1*) Date of run;


(*2*) Duration of run;


(*3*) Time-weighted average and highest hourly rolling average CO level for each run and for the test;


(*4*) Highest hourly rolling average HC level, if HC monitoring is required for each run and for the test;


(*5*) If dioxin and furan testing is required under § 266.104(e), time-weighted average emissions for each run and for the test of chlorinated dioxin and furan emissions, and the predicted maximum annual average ground level concentration of the toxicity equivalency factor;


(*6*) Time-weighted average particulate matter emissions for each run and for the test;


(*7*) Time-weighted average HCl and Cl_2_ emissions for each run and for the test;


(*8*) Time-weighted average emissions for the metals subject to regulation under § 266.106 for each run and for the test; and


(*9*) QA/QC results.


(iii) Comparison of the actual emissions during each test with the emissions limits prescribed by §§ 266.104 (b), (c), and (e), 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 and established for the facility in the certification of precompliance under paragraph (b) of this section.


(iv) Determination of operating limits based on all valid runs of the compliance test for each applicable parameter listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section using either of the following procedures:


(A) *Instantaneous limits.* A parameter may be measured and recorded on an instantaneous basis (*i.e.*, the value that occurs at any time) and the operating limit specified as the time-weighted average during all runs of the compliance test; or


(B) *Hourly rolling average basis.* (*1*) The limit for a parameter may be established and continuously monitored on an hourly rolling average basis defined as follows:


(*i*) A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds.


(*ii*) An hourly rolling average is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values recorded by the continuous monitoring system.


(*2*) The operating limit for the parameter shall be established based on compliance test data as the average over all test runs of the highest hourly rolling average value for each run.


(C) *Rolling average limits for carcinogenic metals and lead.* Feed rate limits for the carcinogenic metals (*i.e.*, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and chromium) and lead may be established either on an hourly rolling average basis as prescribed by paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(B) of this section or on (up to) a 24 hour rolling average basis. If the owner or operator elects to use an averaging period from 2 to 24 hours:


(*1*) The feed rate of each metal shall be limited at any time to ten times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly rolling average basis;


(*2*) The continuous monitor shall meet the following specifications:


(*i*) A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds.


(*ii*) The rolling average for the selected averaging period is defined as arithmetic mean of one hour block averages for the averaging period. A one hour block average is the arithmetic mean of the one minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period beginning at one minute after the beginning of preceding clock hour; and 


(*3*) The operating limit for the feed rate of each metal shall be established based on compliance test data as the average over all test runs of the highest hourly rolling average feed rate for each run. 


(D) *Feed rate limits for metals, total chloride and chlorine, and ash.* Feed rate limits for metals, total chlorine and chloride, and ash are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of the substance (*i.e.*, metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in each feedstream and the flow rate of the feedstream. To monitor the feed rate of these substances, the flow rate of each feedstream must be monitored under the continuous monitoring requirements of paragraphs (c)(4)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section. 


(v) *Certification of compliance statement.* The following statement shall accompany the certification of compliance: 


(5) *Special requirements for HC monitoring systems.* When an owner or operator is required to comply with the hydrocarbon (HC) controls provided by § 266.104(c) or paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D) of this section, a conditioned gas monitoring system may be used in conformance with specifications provided in appendix IX of this part provided that the owner or operator submits a certification of compliance without using extensions of time provided by paragraph (c)(7) of this section. 


(6) *Special operating requirements for industrial furnaces that recycle collected PM.* Owners and operators of industrial furnaces that recycle back into the furnace particulate matter (PM) from the air pollution control system must: 


(i) When complying with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, comply with the operating requirements prescribed in “Alternative Method to Implement the Metals Controls” in appendix IX of this part; and 


(ii) When complying with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, comply with the operating requirements prescribed by that paragraph. 


(7) *Extensions of time.* (i) If the owner or operator does not submit a complete certification of compliance for all of the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 by August 21, 1992, he/she must either: 


(A) Stop burning hazardous waste and begin closure activities under paragraph (l) of this section for the hazardous waste portion of the facility; or 


(B) Limit hazardous waste burning only for purposes of compliance testing (and pretesting to prepare for compliance testing) a total period of 720 hours for the period of time beginning August 21, 1992, submit a notification to the Director by August 21, 1992 stating that the facility is operating under restricted interim status and intends to resume burning hazardous waste, and submit a complete certification of compliance by August 23, 1993; or 


(C) Obtain a case-by-case extension of time under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section. 


(ii) The owner or operator may request a case-by-case extension of time to extend any time limit provided by paragraph (c) of this section if compliance with the time limit is not practicable for reasons beyond the control of the owner or operator. 


(A) In granting an extension, the Director may apply conditions as the facts warrant to ensure timely compliance with the requirements of this section and that the facility operates in a manner that does not pose a hazard to human health and the environment; 


(B) When an owner or operator requests an extension of time to enable the facility to comply with the alternative hydrocarbon provisions of § 266.104(f) and obtain a RCRA operating permit because the facility cannot meet the HC limit of § 266.104(c) of this chapter:


(*1*) The Director shall, in considering whether to grant the extension: 


(*i*) Determine whether the owner and operator have submitted in a timely manner a complete part B permit application that includes information required under § 270.22(b) of this chapter; and 


(*ii*) Consider whether the owner and operator have made a good faith effort to certify compliance with all other emission controls, including the controls on dioxins and furans of § 266.104(e) and the controls on PM, metals, and HCl/Cl_2_. 


(*2*) If an extension is granted, the Director shall, as a condition of the extension, require the facility to operate under flue gas concentration limits on CO and HC that, based on available information, including information in the part B permit application, are baseline CO and HC levels as defined by § 266.104(f)(1). 


(8) *Revised certification of compliance.* The owner or operator may submit at any time a revised certification of compliance (recertification of compliance) under the following procedures: 


(i) Prior to submittal of a revised certification of compliance, hazardous waste may not be burned for more than a total of 720 hours under operating conditions that exceed those established under a current certification of compliance, and such burning may be conducted only for purposes of determining whether the facility can operate under revised conditions and continue to meet the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107; 


(ii) At least 30 days prior to first burning hazardous waste under operating conditions that exceed those established under a current certification of compliance, the owner or operator shall notify the Director and submit the following information:


(A) EPA facility ID number, and facility name, contact person, telephone number, and address; 


(B) Operating conditions that the owner or operator is seeking to revise and description of the changes in facility design or operation that prompted the need to seek to revise the operating conditions; 


(C) A determination that when operating under the revised operating conditions, the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 are not likely to be exceeded. To document this determination, the owner or operator shall submit the applicable information required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and 


(D) Complete emissions testing protocol for any pretesting and for a new compliance test to determine compliance with the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 when operating under revised operating conditions. The protocol shall include a schedule of pre-testing and compliance testing. If the owner and operator revises the scheduled date for the compliance test, he/she shall notify the Director in writing at least 30 days prior to the revised date of the compliance test; 


(iii) Conduct a compliance test under the revised operating conditions and the protocol submitted to the Director to determine compliance with the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107; and 


(iv) Submit a revised certification of compliance under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. 


(d) *Periodic Recertifications.* The owner or operator must conduct compliance testing and submit to the Director a recertification of compliance under provisions of paragraph (c) of this section within five years from submitting the previous certification or recertification. If the owner or operator seeks to recertify compliance under new operating conditions, he/she must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(8) of this section. 


(e) *Noncompliance with certification schedule.* If the owner or operator does not comply with the interim status compliance schedule provided by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, hazardous waste burning must terminate on the date that the deadline is missed, closure activities must begin under paragraph (l) of this section, and hazardous waste burning may not resume except under an operating permit issued under § 270.66 of this chapter. For purposes of compliance with the closure provisions of paragraph (l) of this section and §§ 265.112(d)(2) and 265.113 of this chapter the boiler or industrial furnace has received “the known final volume of hazardous waste” on the date that the deadline is missed.


(f) *Start-up and shut-down.* Hazardous waste (except waste fed solely as an ingredient under the Tier I (or adjusted Tier I) feed rate screening limits for metals and chloride/chlorine) must not be fed into the device during start-up and shut-down of the boiler or industrial furnace, unless the device is operating within the conditions of operation specified in the certification of compliance. 


(g) *Automatic waste feed cutoff.* During the compliance test required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and upon certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, a boiler or industrial furnace must be operated with a functioning system that automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed when the applicable operating conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (v through xiii) of this section deviate from those established in the certification of compliance. In addition: 


(1) To minimize emissions of organic compounds, the minimum combustion chamber temperature (or the indicator of combustion chamber temperature) that occurred during the compliance test must be maintained while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber, with the minimum temperature during the compliance test defined as either: 


(i) If compliance with the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an hourly rolling average, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is considered to be the average over all runs of the lowest hourly rolling average for each run; or 


(ii) If compliance with the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an instantaneous temperature measurement, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is considered to be the time-weighted average temperature during all runs of the test; and 


(2) Operating parameters limited by the certification of compliance must continue to be monitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste feed shall not be restarted until the levels of those parameters comply with the limits established in the certification of compliance. 


(h) *Fugitive emissions.* Fugitive emissions must be controlled by: 


(1) Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or 


(2) Maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure; or 


(3) An alternate means of control that the owner or operator can demonstrate provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure. Support for such demonstration shall be included in the operating record. 


(i) *Changes.* A boiler or industrial furnace must cease burning hazardous waste when changes in combustion properties, or feed rates of the hazardous waste, other fuels, or industrial furnace feedstocks, or changes in the boiler or industrial furnace design or operating conditions deviate from the limits specified in the certification of compliance. 


(j) *Monitoring and Inspections.* (1) The owner or operator must monitor and record the following, at a minimum, while burning hazardous waste: 


(i) Feed rates and composition of hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks, and feed rates of ash, metals, and total chloride and chlorine as necessary to ensure conformance with the certification of precompliance or certification of compliance; 


(ii) Carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen, and if applicable, hydrocarbons (HC), on a continuous basis at a common point in the boiler or industrial furnace downstream of the combustion zone and prior to release of stack gases to the atmosphere in accordance with the operating limits specified in the certification of compliance. CO, HC, and oxygen monitors must be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with methods specified in appendix IX of this part. 


(iii) Upon the request of the Director, sampling and analysis of the hazardous waste (and other fuels and industrial furnace feed stocks as appropriate) and the stack gas emissions must be conducted to verify that the operating conditions established in the certification of precompliance or certification of compliance achieve the applicable standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107. 


(2) The boiler or industrial furnace and associated equipment (pumps, valves, pipes, fuel storage tanks, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection when they contain hazardous waste, at least daily for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and signs of tampering. 


(3) The automatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be tested at least once every 7 days when hazardous waste is burned to verify operability, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspections will be adequate. Support for such demonstration shall be included in the operating record. At a minimum, operational testing must be conducted at least once every 30 days. 


(4) These monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and the records must be placed in the operating log. 


(k) *Recordkeeping.* The owner or operator must keep in the operating record of the facility all information and data required by this section for five years. 


(l) *Closure.* At closure, the owner or operator must remove all hazardous waste and hazardous waste residues (including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and scrubber sludges) from the boiler or industrial furnace and must comply with §§ 265.111-265.115 of this chapter.
