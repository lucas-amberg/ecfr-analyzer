# § 266.502   Standards for healthcare facilities managing non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.

(a) *Notification and withdrawal from this subpart for healthcare facilities managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals*—(1) *Notification.* A healthcare facility must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a healthcare facility operating under this subpart. A healthcare facility is not required to fill out Box 10.B. (Waste Codes for Federally Regulated Hazardous Waste) of the Site Identification Form with respect to its hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility must submit a separate notification (Site Identification Form) for each site or EPA identification number.


(i) A healthcare facility that already has an EPA identification number must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a healthcare facility as part of its next Biennial Report, if it is required to submit one; or if not required to submit a Biennial Report, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.


(ii) A healthcare facility that does not have an EPA identification number must obtain one by notifying the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a healthcare facility as part of its next Biennial Report, if it is required to submit one; or if not required to submit a Biennial Report, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.


(iii) A healthcare facility must keep a copy of its notification on file for as long as the healthcare facility is subject to this subpart.


(2) *Withdrawal.* A healthcare facility that operated under this subpart but is no longer subject to this subpart, because it is a very small quantity generator under § 262.14, and elects to withdraw from this subpart, must notify the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12) that it is no longer operating under this subpart. A healthcare facility is not required to fill out Box 10.B. (Waste Codes for Federally Regulated Hazardous Waste) of the Site Identification Form with respect to its hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. A healthcare facility must submit a separate notification (Site Identification Form) for each EPA identification number.


(i) A healthcare facility must submit the Site Identification Form notifying that it is withdrawing from this subpart before it begins operating under the conditional exemption of § 262.14.


(ii) A healthcare facility must keep a copy of its withdrawal on file for three years from the date of signature on the notification of its withdrawal.


(b) *Training of personnel managing non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities.* A healthcare facility must ensure that all personnel that manage non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are thoroughly familiar with proper waste handling and emergency procedures relevant to their responsibilities during normal facility operations and emergencies.




(c) *Hazardous waste determination for non-creditable pharmaceuticals.* A healthcare facility that generates a solid waste that is a non-creditable pharmaceutical must determine whether that pharmaceutical is a hazardous waste pharmaceutical (*i.e.,* it exhibits a characteristic identified in 40 CFR part 261 subpart C or is listed in 40 CFR part 261 subpart D) in order to determine whether the waste is subject to this subpart. A healthcare facility may choose to manage its non-hazardous waste pharmaceuticals as non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under this subpart.




(d) *Standards for containers used to accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities.* (1) A healthcare facility must place non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a container that is structurally sound, compatible with its contents, and that lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.


(2) A healthcare facility that manages ignitable or reactive non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, or that mixes or commingles incompatible non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals must manage the container so that it does not have the potential to:


(i) Generate extreme heat or pressure, fire or explosion, or violent reaction;


(ii) Produce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts, or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health;


(iii) Produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions;


(iv) Damage the structural integrity of the container of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals; or


(v) Through other like means threaten human health or the environment.


(3) A healthcare facility must keep containers of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals closed and secured in a manner that prevents unauthorized access to its contents.




(4) A healthcare facility may accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and non-hazardous non-creditable waste pharmaceuticals in the same container, except that non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals prohibited from being combusted because of the dilution prohibition of § 268.3(c) of this subchapter (*i.e.,* metal-bearing waste codes listed in appendix XI of part 268 of this subchapter, unless one or more criteria in § 268.3(c)(1) through (6) are met), or because it is prohibited from being lab packed due to § 268.42(c) (*i.e.,* waste codes listed in appendix IV of part 268), must be accumulated in separate containers, and labeled with all applicable EPA hazardous waste numbers (*i.e.,* hazardous waste codes).




(e) *Labeling containers used to accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities.* A healthcare facility must label or clearly mark each container of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals with the phrase “Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals.”


(f) *Maximum accumulation time for non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at healthcare facilities.* (1) A healthcare facility may accumulate non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site for one year or less without a permit or having interim status.


(2) A healthcare facility that accumulates non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on-site must demonstrate the length of time that the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals have been accumulating, starting from the date it first becomes a waste. A healthcare facility may make this demonstration by any of the following methods:


(i) Marking or labeling the container of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals with the date that the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals became a waste;


(ii) Maintaining an inventory system that identifies the date the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals being accumulated first became a waste;


(iii) Placing the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a specific area and identifying the earliest date that any of the non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in the area became a waste.


(g) *Land disposal restrictions for non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.* The non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals generated by a healthcare facility are subject to the land disposal restrictions of 40 CFR part 268. A healthcare facility that generates non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals must comply with the land disposal restrictions in accordance with § 268.7(a) requirements, except that it is not required to identify the hazardous waste numbers (*i.e.,* hazardous waste codes) on the land disposal restrictions notification.


(h) *Procedures for healthcare facilities for managing rejected shipments of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.* A healthcare facility that sends a shipment of non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals to a designated facility with the understanding that the designated facility can accept and manage the waste, and later receives that shipment back as a rejected load in accordance with the manifest discrepancy provisions of § 264.72 or § 265.72 of this subchapter may accumulate the rejected non-creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site for up to an additional 90 calendar days provided the rejected shipment is managed in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
