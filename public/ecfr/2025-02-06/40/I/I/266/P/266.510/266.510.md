# § 266.510   Standards for the management of potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at reverse distributors.

A reverse distributor may accept potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals from off site and accumulate potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals or evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site without a hazardous waste permit or without having interim status, provided that it complies with the following conditions:


(a) *Standards for reverse distributors managing potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals*—(1) *Notification.* A reverse distributor must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a reverse distributor operating under this subpart.


(i) A reverse distributor that already has an EPA identification number must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a reverse distributor, as defined in § 266.500, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.


(ii) A reverse distributor that does not have an EPA identification number must obtain one by notifying the EPA Regional Administrator, using the Site Identification Form (EPA Form 8700-12), that it is a reverse distributor, as defined in § 266.500, within 60 days of the effective date of this subpart, or within 60 days of becoming subject to this subpart.


(2) *Inventory by the reverse distributor.* A reverse distributor must maintain a current inventory of all the potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are accumulated on site.


(i) A reverse distributor must inventory each potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical within 30 calendar days of each waste arriving at the reverse distributor.


(ii) The inventory must include the identity (*e.g.,* name or national drug code) and quantity of each potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical.


(iii) If the reverse distributor already meets the inventory requirements of this paragraph because of other regulatory requirements, such as State Board of Pharmacy regulations, the facility is not required to provide a separate inventory pursuant to this section.


(3) *Evaluation by a reverse distributor that is not a manufacturer.* A reverse distributor that is not a pharmaceutical manufacturer must evaluate a potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical within 30 calendar days of the waste arriving at the reverse distributor to establish whether it is destined for another reverse distributor for further evaluation or verification of manufacturer credit or for a permitted or interim status treatment, storage, or disposal facility.


(i) A potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical that is destined for another reverse distributor is still considered a “potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical” and must be managed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(ii) A potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical that is destined for a permitted or interim status treatment, storage or disposal facility is considered an “evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceutical” and must be managed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(4) *Evaluation by a reverse distributor that is a manufacturer.* A reverse distributor that is a pharmaceutical manufacturer must evaluate a potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical to verify manufacturer credit within 30 calendar days of the waste arriving at the facility and following the evaluation must manage the evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(5) *Maximum accumulation time for hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at a reverse distributor.* (i) A reverse distributor may accumulate potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals on site for 180 calendar days or less. The 180 days start after the potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical has been evaluated and applies to all hazardous waste pharmaceuticals accumulated on site, regardless of whether they are destined for another reverse distributor (*i.e.,* potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals) or a permitted or interim status treatment, storage, or disposal facility (*i.e.,* evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals).


(ii) *Aging pharmaceuticals.* Unexpired pharmaceuticals that are otherwise creditable but are awaiting their expiration date (*i.e.,* aging in a holding morgue) can be accumulated for up to 180 days after the expiration date, provided that the unexpired pharmaceuticals are managed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and the container labeling and management standards in 266.510(c)(4)(i) through (vi).


(6) *Security at the reverse distributor facility.* A reverse distributor must prevent unknowing entry and minimize the possibility for the unauthorized entry into the portion of the facility where potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are kept.


(i) Examples of methods that may be used to prevent unknowing entry and minimize the possibility for unauthorized entry include, but are not limited to:


(A) A 24-hour continuous monitoring surveillance system;


(B) An artificial barrier such as a fence; or


(C) A means to control entry, such as keycard access.


(ii) If the reverse distributor already meets the security requirements of this paragraph because of other regulatory requirements, such as Drug Enforcement Administration or State Board of Pharmacy regulations, the facility is not required to provide separate security measures pursuant to this section.


(7) *Contingency plan and emergency procedures at a reverse distributor.* A reverse distributor that accepts potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals from off site must prepare a contingency plan and comply with the other requirements of 40 CFR part 262 subpart M.


(8) *Closure of a reverse distributor.* When closing an area where a reverse distributor accumulates potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals or evaluated hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, the reverse distributor must comply with § 262.17(a)(8)(ii) and (iii).


(9) *Reporting by a reverse distributor*—(i) *Unauthorized waste report.* A reverse distributor must submit an unauthorized waste report if the reverse distributor receives waste from off site that it is not authorized to receive (*e.g.,* non-pharmaceutical hazardous waste, regulated medical waste). The reverse distributor must prepare and submit an unauthorized waste report to the EPA Regional Administrator within 45 calendar days after the unauthorized waste arrives at the reverse distributor and must send a copy of the unauthorized waste report to the healthcare facility (or other entity) that sent the unauthorized waste. The reverse distributor must manage the unauthorized waste in accordance with all applicable regulations. The unauthorized waste report must be signed by the owner or operator of the reverse distributor, or its authorized representative, and contain the following information:
