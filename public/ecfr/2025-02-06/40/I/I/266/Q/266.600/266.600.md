# ยง 266.600   Purpose and applicability.

(a) The purpose of this subpart is to reduce emissions of ignitable spent refrigerants to the lowest achievable level by maximizing the recovery and safe recycling for reuse of such refrigerants during the service, repair, and disposal of appliances.


(b) The requirements of this subpart operate in lieu of parts 260 through 270 of this chapter and apply to lower flammability spent refrigerants, as defined in ยง 266.601, where the refrigerant exhibits the hazardous waste characteristic of ignitability per ยง 261.21 of this chapter and is being recycled for reuse in the United States.


(c) These requirements do not apply to other ignitable spent refrigerants. Ignitable spent refrigerants not subject to this subpart are subject to all applicable requirements of parts 260 through 270 of this chapter when recovered (*i.e.,* removed from an appliance and stored in an external container) and/or disposed of.
