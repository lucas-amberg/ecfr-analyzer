# § 267.17   What are the requirements for managing ignitable, reactive, or incompatible wastes?

(a) You must take precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable or reactive waste by following these requirements:


(1) You must separate these wastes and protect them from sources of ignition or reaction such as: open flames, smoking, cutting and welding, hot surfaces, frictional heat, sparks (static, electrical, or mechanical), spontaneous ignition (for example, from heat-producing chemical reactions), and radiant heat.


(2) While ignitable or reactive waste is being handled, you must confine smoking and open flames to specially designated locations.


(3) “No Smoking” signs must be conspicuously placed wherever there is a hazard from ignitable or reactive waste.


(b) If you treat or store ignitable or reactive waste, or mix incompatible waste or incompatible wastes and other materials, you must take precautions to prevent reactions that:


(1) Generate extreme heat or pressure, fire or explosions, or violent reactions.


(2) Produce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts, or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health or the environment.


(3) Produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions.


(4) Damage the structural integrity of the device or facility.


(5) Threaten human health or the environment in any similar way.


(c) You must document compliance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. You may base this documentation on references to published scientific or engineering literature, data from trial tests (for example bench scale or pilot scale tests), waste analyses (as specified in § 267.13), or the results of the treatment of similar wastes by similar treatment processes and under similar operating conditions.
