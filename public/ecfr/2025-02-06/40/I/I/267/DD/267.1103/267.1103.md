# § 267.1103   What additional design and operating standards apply if liquids will be in my containment building?

If your containment building will be used to manage hazardous wastes containing free liquids or treated with free liquids, as determined by the paint filter test, by a visual examination, or by other appropriate means, you must include:


(a) A primary barrier designed and constructed of materials to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier (for example, a geomembrane covered by a concrete wear surface).


(b) A liquid collection and removal system to minimize the accumulation of liquid on the primary barrier of the containment building.


(1) The primary barrier must be sloped to drain liquids to the associated collection system; and


(2) You must collect and remove liquids and waste to minimize hydraulic head on the containment system at the earliest practicable time.


(c) A secondary containment system, including a secondary barrier designed and constructed to prevent migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier, and a leak detection system capable of detecting failure of the primary barrier and collecting accumulated hazardous wastes and liquids at the earliest practical time.


(1) You may meet the requirements of the leak detection component of the secondary containment system by installing a system that is, at a minimum:


(i) Constructed with a bottom slope of 1 percent or more; and


(ii) Constructed of a granular drainage material with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 × 10_−2_ cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more, or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3 × 10-5 m
2sec or more.


(2) If you will be conducting treatment in the building, you must design the area in which the treatment will be conducted to prevent the release of liquids, wet materials, or liquid aerosols to other portions of the building.


(3) You must construct the secondary containment system using materials that are chemically resistant to the waste and liquids managed in the containment building and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressure exerted by overlaying materials and by any equipment used in the containment building.
