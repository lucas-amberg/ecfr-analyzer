# § 267.71   Use of the manifest system.

(a) If a facility receives hazardous waste accompanied by a manifest, the owner or operator, or his agent, must:


(1) Sign and date each copy of the manifest to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest was received;


(2) Note any significant discrepancies in the manifest (as defined in § 267.72(a)) on each copy of the manifest;


(3) Immediately give the transporter at least one copy of the signed manifest;


(4) Within 30 days after the delivery, send a copy of the manifest to the generator;


(5) Retain at the facility a copy of each manifest for at least three years from the date of delivery; and


(6) If a facility receives hazardous waste subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H from a foreign source, the receiving facility must:


(i) Additionally, list the relevant waste stream consent number from consent documentation supplied by the EPA to the facility for each waste listed on the manifest in the International Shipments block on the Continuation Sheet (EPA Form 8700-22A), matched to the relevant list number for the waste from block 9b. If additional space is needed, the receiving facility should use an additional Continuation Sheet(s) (EPA Form 8700-22A); and


(ii) Submit a copy of the manifest to the e-Manifest system per 40 CFR 264.71(a)(2)(v) or 265.71(a)(2)(v).


(b) If a facility receives, from a rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter, hazardous waste which is accompanied by a shipping paper containing all the information required on the manifest (excluding the EPA identification numbers, generator's certification, and signatures), the owner or operator, or his agent, must:


(1) Sign and date each copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest or shipping paper was received;


(2) Note any significant discrepancies (as defined in § 267.72(a)) in the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) on each copy of the manifest or shipping paper. Note that the Agency does not intend that the owner or operator of a facility whose procedures under § 267.13(c) include waste analysis must perform that analysis before signing the shipping paper and giving it to the transporter. Section 267.72(b), however, requires reporting an unreconciled discrepancy discovered during later analysis.


(3) Immediately give the rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter at least one copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received);


(4) Within 30 days after the delivery, send a copy of the signed and dated manifest to the generator; however, if the manifest has not been received within 30 days after delivery, the owner or operator, or his agent, must send a copy of the shipping paper signed and dated to the generator. Note that § 262.23(c) of this chapter requires the generator to send three copies of the manifest to the facility when hazardous waste is sent by rail or water (bulk shipment); and


(5) Retain at the facility a copy of the manifest and shipping paper (if signed in lieu of the manifest at the time of delivery) for at least three years from the date of delivery.


(c) Whenever a shipment of hazardous waste is initiated from a facility, the owner or operator of that facility must comply with the requirements of part 262 of this chapter. The Agency notes that the provisions of § 262.16 or 262.17 are applicable to the on-site accumulation of hazardous wastes by generators. Therefore, the provisions of § 262.16 or 262.17 only apply to owners or operators who are shipping hazardous waste which they generated at that facility.


(d) As per 40 CFR 262.84(d)(2)(xv), within three (3) working days of the receipt of a shipment subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H, the owner or operator of a facility must provide a copy of the movement document bearing all required signatures to the foreign exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit that control the shipment as an export and transit shipment of hazardous waste respectively. For shipments received on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, the receiving facility must close out the movement document to confirm receipt within three working days of shipment delivery using the EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. For shipments sent from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS, or its successor system, to send movement document confirmation data back through the electronic exchange to the foreign exporter and the country of export. The original copy of the movement document must be maintained at the facility for at least three (3) years from the date of signature. The owner or operator of a facility may satisfy this recordkeeping requirement by retaining electronically submitted documents in the facility's account on the EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any the EPA or authorized State inspector. No owner or operator of a facility may be held liable for the inability to produce the documents for inspection under this section if the owner or operator of a facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with the EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, for which the owner or operator of a facility bears no responsibility.
