(f) The following terms are used in the specifications for the financial tests for closure and liability coverage. The definitions are intended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to limit the meanings of terms in a way that conflicts with generally accepted accounting practices:


*Assets* means all existing and all probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity.


*Current plugging and abandonment cost estimate* means the most recent of the estimates prepared in accordance with § 144.62(a), (b), and (c) of this chapter.

*Liabilities* means probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events.


*Tangible net worth* means the tangible assets that remain after deducting liabilities; such assets would not include intangibles such as goodwill and rights to patents or royalties.


(g) In the liability insurance requirements, the terms *bodily injury and property damage* shall have the meanings given these terms by applicable State law. However, these terms do not include those liabilities which, consistent with standard industry practices, are excluded from coverage in liability policies for bodily injury and property damage. The Agency intends the meanings of other terms used in the liability insurance requirements to be consistent with their common meanings within the insurance industry. The definitions given below of several of the terms are intended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to limit their meanings in a way that conflicts with general insurance industry usage.


*Accidental occurrence* means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.


*Legal defense costs* means any expenses that an insurer incurs in defending against claims of third parties brought under the terms and conditions of an insurance policy.


*Sudden accidental occurrence* means an occurrence which is not continuous or repeated in nature.


(h) *Substantial business relationship* means the extent of a business relationship necessary under applicable State law to make a guarantee contract issued incident to that relationship valid and enforceable. A “substantial business relationship” must arise from a pattern of recent or ongoing business transactions, in addition to the guarantee itself, such that a currently existing business relationship between the guarantor and the owner or operator is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the applicable EPA Regional Administrator.
