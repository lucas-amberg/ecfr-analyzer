# ยง 267.171   What standards apply to the containers?

Standards apply to the condition of the containers, to the compatibility of waste with the containers, and to the management of the containers.


(a) Condition of containers. If a container holding hazardous waste is not in good condition (for example, it exhibits severe rusting or apparent structural defects) or if it begins to leak, you must either:


(1) Transfer the hazardous waste from this container to a container that is in good condition; or


(2) Manage the waste in some other way that complies with the requirements of this part.


(b) Compatibility of waste with containers. To ensure that the ability of the container to contain the waste is not impaired, you must use a container made of or lined with materials that are compatible and will not react with the hazardous waste to be stored.


(c) Management of containers. (1) You must always keep a container holding hazardous waste closed during storage, except when you add or remove waste.


(2) You must never open, handle, or store a container holding hazardous waste in a manner that may rupture the container or cause it to leak.
