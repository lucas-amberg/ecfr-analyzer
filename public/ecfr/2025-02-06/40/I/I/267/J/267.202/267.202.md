# § 267.202   What special requirements must I meet for ignitable or reactive wastes?

(a) You may not place ignitable or reactive waste in tank systems, unless:


(1) You treat, render, or mix the waste before or immediately after placement in the tank system so that:


(i) You comply with § 267.17(b); and


(ii) The resulting waste, mixture, or dissolved material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive waste under § 261.21 or § 261.23 of this chapter; or


(2) You store or treat the waste in such a way that it is protected from any material or conditions that may cause the waste to ignite or react; or


(3) You use the tank system solely for emergencies.


(b) If you store or treat ignitable or reactive waste in a tank, you must comply with the requirements for the maintenance of protective distances between the waste management area and any public ways, streets, alleys, or an adjoining property line that can be built upon as required in Tables 2-1 through 2-6 of the National Fire Protection Association's “Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code,” (1977 or 1981), (incorporated by reference, see 40 CFR 260.11).
