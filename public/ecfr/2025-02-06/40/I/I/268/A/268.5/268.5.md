# § 268.5   Procedures for case-by-case extensions to an effective date.

(a) Any person who generates, treats, stores, or disposes of a hazardous waste may submit an application to the Administrator for an extension to the effective date of any applicable restriction established under subpart C of this part. The applicant must demonstrate the following: 


(1) He has made a good-faith effort to locate and contract with treatment, recovery, or disposal facilities nationwide to manage his waste in accordance with the effective date of the applicable restriction established under subpart C of this part; 


(2) He has entered into a binding contractual commitment to construct or otherwise provide alternative treatment, recovery (e.g., recycling), or disposal capacity that meets the treatment standards specified in subpart D or, where treatment standards have not been specified, such treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity is protective of human health and the environment. 


(3) Due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, such alternative capacity cannot reasonably be made available by the applicable effective date. This demonstration may include a showing that the technical and practical difficulties associated with providing the alternative capacity will result in the capacity not being available by the applicable effective date; 


(4) The capacity being constructed or otherwise provided by the applicant will be sufficient to manage the entire quantity of waste that is the subject of the application; 


(5) He provides a detailed schedule for obtaining required operating and construction permits or an outline of how and when alternative capacity will be available; 


(6) He has arranged for adequate capacity to manage his waste during an extension and has documented in the application the location of all sites at which the waste will be managed; and 


(7) Any waste managed in a surface impoundment or landfill during the extension period will meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section. 


(b) An authorized representative signing an application described under paragraph (a) of this section shall make the following certification:


(c) After receiving an application for an extension, the Administrator may request any additional information which he deems as necessary to evaluate the application. 


(d) An extension will apply only to the waste generated at the individual facility covered by the application and will not apply to restricted waste from any other facility. 


(e) On the basis of the information referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, after notice and opportunity for comment, and after consultation with appropriate State agencies in all affected States, the Administrator may grant an extension of up to 1 year from the effective date. The Administrator may renew this extension for up to 1 additional year upon the request of the applicant if the demonstration required in paragraph (a) of this section can still be made. In no event will an extension extend beyond 24 months from the applicable effective date specified in subpart C of part 268. The length of any extension authorized will be determined by the Administrator based on the time required to construct or obtain the type of capacity needed by the applicant as described in the completion schedule discussed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The Administrator will give public notice of the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public comment. The final decision on a petition will be published in the _Federal Register._

(f) Any person granted an extension under this section must immediately notify the Administrator as soon as he has knowledge of any change in the conditions certified to in the application.


(g) Any person granted an extension under this section shall submit written progress reports at intervals designated by the Administrator. Such reports must describe the overall progress made toward constructing or otherwise providing alternative treatment, recovery or disposal capacity; must identify any event which may cause or has caused a delay in the development of the capacity; and must summarize the steps taken to mitigate the delay. The Administrator can revoke the extension at any time if the applicant does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to meet the schedule for completion, if the Agency denies or revokes any required permit, if conditions certified in the application change, or for any violation of this chapter.


(h) Whenever the Administrator establishes an extension to an effective date under this section, during the period for which such extension is in effect:


(1) The storage restrictions under § 268.50(a) do not apply; and 


(2) Such hazardous waste may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only if such unit is in compliance with the technical requirements of the following provisions regardless of whether such unit is existing, new, or a replacement or lateral expansion.


(i) The landfill, if in interim status, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 and § 265.301 (a), (c), and (d) of this chapter; or,


(ii) The landfill, if permitted, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 264 and § 264.301 (c), (d) and (e) of this chapter; or


(iii) The surface impoundment, if in interim status, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265, § 265.221 (a), (c), and (d) of this chapter, and RCRA section 3005(j)(1); or 


(iv) The surface impoundment, if permitted, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 264 and § 264.221 (c), (d) and (e) of this chapter; or 


(v) The surface impoundment, if newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) due to the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics for the identification of hazardous waste, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 of this chapter within 12 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, and with the requirements of § 265.221 (a), (c) and (d) of this chapter within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste. If a national capacity variance is granted, during the period the variance is in effect, the surface impoundment, if newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) due to the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 of this chapter within 12 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, and with the requirements of § 265.221 (a), (c) and (d) of this chapter within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste; or


(vi) The landfill, if disposing of containerized liquid hazardous wastes containing PCBs at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm but less than 500 ppm, is also in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR 761.75 and parts 264 and 265. 


(i) Pending a decision on the application the applicant is required to comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.
