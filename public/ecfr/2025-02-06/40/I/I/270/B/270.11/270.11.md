(a) *Applications.* All permit applications shall be signed as follows:

For the purpose of this section, a responsible corporate officer means (i) A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy- or decisionmaking functions for the corporation, or (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operating facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second-quarter 1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.


(2) *For a partnership or sole proprietorship;* by a general partner or the proprietor, respectively; or


(3) *For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency:* by either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official.
