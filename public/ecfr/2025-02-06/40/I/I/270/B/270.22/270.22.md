# § 270.22   Specific part B information requirements for boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste.

When an owner or operator of a cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace becomes subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005, or when an owner or operator of an existing cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace demonstrates compliance with the air emission standards and limitations in part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter (*i.e.*, by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with all applicable requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter), the requirements of this section do not apply. The requirements of this section do apply, however, if the Director determines certain provisions are necessary to ensure compliance with §§ 266.102(e)(1) and 266.102(e)(2)(iii) of this chapter if you elect to comply with § 270.235(a)(1)(i) to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events; or if you are an area source and elect to comply with the §§ 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 standards and associated requirements for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas, and non-mercury metals; or the Director determines certain provisions apply, on a case-by-case basis, for purposes of information collection in accordance with §§ 270.10(k), 270.10(l), 270.32(b)(2), and 270.32(b)(3).


(a) *Trial burns*—(1) *General.* Except as provided below, owners and operators that are subject to the standards to control organic emissions provided by § 266.104 of this chapter, standards to control particulate matter provided by § 266.105 of this chapter, standards to control metals emissions provided by § 266.106 of this chapter, or standards to control hydrogen chloride or chlorine gas emissions provided by § 266.107 of this chapter must conduct a trial burn to demonstrate conformance with those standards and must submit a trial burn plan or the results of a trial burn, including all required determinations, in accordance with § 270.66.


(i) A trial burn to demonstrate conformance with a particular emission standard may be waived under provisions of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section; and

(6) *Data in lieu of trial burn.* The owner or operator may seek an exemption from the trial burn requirements to demonstrate conformance with §§ 266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and § 270.66 by providing the information required by § 270.66 from previous compliance testing of the device in conformance with § 266.103 of this chapter, or from compliance testing or trial or operational burns of similar boilers or industrial furnaces burning similar hazardous wastes under similar conditions. If data from a similar device is used to support a trial burn waiver, the design and operating information required by § 270.66 must be provided for both the similar device and the device to which the data is to be applied, and a comparison of the design and operating information must be provided. The Director shall approve a permit application without a trial burn if he finds that the hazardous wastes are sufficiently similar, the devices are sufficiently similar, the operating conditions are sufficiently similar, and the data from other compliance tests, trial burns, or operational burns are adequate to specify (under § 266.102 of this chapter) operating conditions that will ensure conformance with § 266.102(c) of this chapter. In addition, the following information shall be submitted:


(i) For a waiver from any trial burn:


(A) A description and analysis of the hazardous waste to be burned compared with the hazardous waste for which data from compliance testing, or operational or trial burns are provided to support the contention that a trial burn is not needed;


(B) The design and operating conditions of the boiler or industrial furnace to be used, compared with that for which comparative burn data are available; and


(C) Such supplemental information as the Director finds necessary to achieve the purposes of this paragraph.


(ii) For a waiver of the DRE trial burn, the basis for selection of POHCs used in the other trial or operational burns which demonstrate compliance with the DRE performance standard in § 266.104(a) of this chapter. This analysis should specify the constituents in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, that the applicant has identified in the hazardous waste for which a permit is sought, and any differences from the POHCs in the hazardous waste for which burn data are provided.


(b) *Alternative HC limit for industrial furnaces with organic matter in raw materials.* Owners and operators of industrial furnaces requesting an alternative HC limit under § 266.104(f) of this chapter shall submit the following information at a minimum:


(1) Documentation that the furnace is designed and operated to minimize HC emissions from fuels and raw materials;


(2) Documentation of the proposed baseline flue gas HC (and CO) concentration, including data on HC (and CO) levels during tests when the facility produced normal products under normal operating conditions from normal raw materials while burning normal fuels and when not burning hazardous waste;


(3) Test burn protocol to confirm the baseline HC (and CO) level including information on the type and flow rate of all feedstreams, point of introduction of all feedstreams, total organic carbon content (or other appropriate measure of organic content) of all nonfuel feedstreams, and operating conditions that affect combustion of fuel(s) and destruction of hydrocarbon emissions from nonfuel sources;


(4) Trial burn plan to:


(i) Demonstrate that flue gas HC (and CO) concentrations when burning hazardous waste do not exceed the baseline HC (and CO) level; and


(ii) Identify the types and concentrations of organic compounds listed in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, that are emitted when burning hazardous waste in conformance with procedures prescribed by the Director;


(5) Implementation plan to monitor over time changes in the operation of the facility that could reduce the baseline HC level and procedures to periodically confirm the baseline HC level; and


(6) Such other information as the Director finds necessary to achieve the purposes of this paragraph.


(c) *Alternative metals implementation approach.* When seeking to be permitted under an alternative metals implementation approach under § 266.106(f) of this chapter, the owner or operator must submit documentation specifying how the approach ensures compliance with the metals emissions standards of § 266.106(c) or (d) and how the approach can be effectively implemented and monitored. Further, the owner or operator shall provide such other information that the Director finds necessary to achieve the purposes of this paragraph.


(d) *Automatic waste feed cutoff system.* Owners and operators shall submit information describing the automatic waste feed cutoff system, including any pre-alarm systems that may be used.


(e) *Direct transfer.* Owners and operators that use direct transfer operations to feed hazardous waste from transport vehicles (containers, as defined in § 266.111 of this chapter) directly to the boiler or industrial furnace shall submit information supporting conformance with the standards for direct transfer provided by § 266.111 of this chapter.


(f) *Residues.* Owners and operators that claim that their residues are excluded from regulation under the provisions of § 266.112 of this chapter must submit information adequate to demonstrate conformance with those provisions.
