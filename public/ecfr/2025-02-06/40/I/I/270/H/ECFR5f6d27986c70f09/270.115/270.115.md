# § 270.115   What if I want to keep this information confidential?

Part 2 (Public Information) of this chapter allows you to claim as confidential any or all of the information you submit to EPA under this subpart. You must assert any such claim at the time that you submit your RAP application or other submissions by stamping the words “confidential business information” on each page containing such information. If you do assert a claim at the time you submit the information, EPA will treat the information according to the procedures in part 2 of this chapter. If you do not assert a claim at the time you submit the information, EPA may make the information available to the public without further notice to you. EPA will deny any requests for confidentiality of your name and/or address.
