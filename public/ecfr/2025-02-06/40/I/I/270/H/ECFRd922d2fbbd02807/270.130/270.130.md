# § 270.130   What is the process for approving or denying my application for a RAP?

(a) If the Director tentatively finds that your RAP application includes all of the information required by § 270.110 and that your proposed remediation waste management activities meet the regulatory standards, the Director will make a tentative decision to approve your RAP application. The Director will then prepare a draft RAP and provide an opportunity for public comment before making a final decision on your RAP application, according to this subpart.


(b) If the Director tentatively finds that your RAP application does not include all of the information required by § 270.110 or that your proposed remediation waste management activities do not meet the regulatory standards, the Director may request additional information from you or ask you to correct deficiencies in your application. If you fail or refuse to provide any additional information the Director requests, or to correct any deficiencies in your RAP application, the Director may make a tentative decision to deny your RAP application. After making this tentative decision, the Director will prepare a notice of intent to deny your RAP application (“notice of intent to deny”) and provide an opportunity for public comment before making a final decision on your RAP application, according to the requirements in this Subpart. The Director may deny the RAP application either in its entirety or in part.
