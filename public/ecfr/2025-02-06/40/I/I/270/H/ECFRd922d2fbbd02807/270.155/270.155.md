# ยง 270.155   May the decision to approve or deny my RAP application be administratively appealed?

(a) Any commenter on the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny, or any participant in any public hearing(s) on the draft RAP, may appeal the Director's decision to approve or deny your RAP application to EPA's Environmental Appeals Board under ยง 124.19 of this chapter. Any person who did not file comments, or did not participate in any public hearing(s) on the draft RAP, may petition for administrative review only to the extent of the changes from the draft to the final RAP decision. Appeals of RAPs may be made to the same extent as for final permit decisions under ยง 124.15 of this chapter (or a decision under ยง 270.29 to deny a permit for the active life of a RCRA hazardous waste management facility or unit).


(b) This appeal is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of these EPA actions.
