You must notify the Director of such changes within five days of making such changes. You must identify in the notification recommended revisions to permit conditions necessary as a result of the changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during these events. 


(*2*) The Director may revise permit conditions as a result of these changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents either: 


(*i*) Upon permit renewal, or, if warranted; 


(*ii*) By modifying the permit under §§ 270.41(a) or 270.42. 


(iii) *Remove permit conditions.* Under this option: 


(A) The owner or operator must document that the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required under § 63.1206(c)(2) of this chapter has been approved by the Administrator under § 63.1206(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter; and 


(B) The Director will remove permit conditions that are no longer applicable according to §§ 264.340(b) and 266.100(b) of this chapter. 


(2) *Addressing permit conditions upon permit reissuance.* The owner or operator of an incinerator, cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace that has conducted a comprehensive performance test and submitted to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance with the standards of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter may request in the application to reissue the permit for the combustion unit that the Director control emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events under any of the following options: 


(i) *RCRA option A.* (A) Under this option, the Director will: 


(*1*) Include, in the permit, conditions that ensure compliance with §§ 264.345(a) and 264.345(c) or §§ 266.102(e)(1) and 266.102(e)(2)(iii) of this chapter to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents; and 


(*2*) Specify that these permit requirements apply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.; or 


(ii) *RCRA option B.* (A) Under this option, the Director will: 


(*1*) Include, in the permit conditions, that ensure emissions of toxic compounds are minimized from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents, based on review of information including the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, design, and operating history; and 


(*2*) Specify that these permit requirements apply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. 


(B) *Changes that may significantly increase emissions.* (*1*) You must notify the Director in writing of changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan or changes to the design of the source that may significantly increase emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents. You must notify the Director of such changes within five days of making such changes. You must identify in the notification recommended revisions to permit conditions necessary as a result of the changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during these events. 


(*2*) The Director may revise permit conditions as a result of these changes to ensure that emissions of toxic compounds are minimized during startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents either: 


(*i*) Upon permit renewal, or, if warranted; 


(*ii*) By modifying the permit under §§ 270.41(a) or 270.42; or 


(iii) *CAA option.* Under this option: 


(A) The owner or operator must document that the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required under § 63.1206(c)(2) of this chapter has been approved by the Administrator under § 63.1206(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter; and 


(B) The Director will omit from the permit conditions that are not applicable under §§ 264.340(b) and 266.100(b) of this chapter. 


(b) *Interim status facilities*—(1) *Interim status operations.* In compliance with §§ 265.340 and 266.100(b), the owner or operator of an incinerator, cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace that is operating under the interim status standards of part 265 or 266 of this chapter may control emissions of toxic compounds during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events under either of the following options after conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance with the standards of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter.


(i) *RCRA option.* Under this option, the owner or operator continues to comply with the interim status emission standards and operating requirements of part 265 or 266 of this chapter relevant to control of emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events. Those standards and requirements apply only during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events; or 


(ii) *CAA option.* Under this option, the owner or operator is exempt from the interim status standards of part 265 or 266 of this chapter relevant to control of emissions of toxic compounds during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events upon submission of written notification and documentation to the Director that the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required under § 63.1206(c)(2) of this chapter has been approved by the Administrator under § 63.1206(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this chapter. 


(2) *Operations under a subsequent RCRA permit.* When an owner or operator of an incinerator, cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace that is operating under the interim status standards of parts 265 or 266 of this chapter submits a RCRA permit application, the owner or operator may request that the Director control emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events under any of the options provided by paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), or (a)(2)(iii) of this section.


(c) *New units.* Hazardous waste incinerator, cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace units that become subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005 must control emissions of toxic compounds during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events under either of the following options:


(1) Comply with the requirements specified in § 63.1206(c)(2) of this chapter; or
