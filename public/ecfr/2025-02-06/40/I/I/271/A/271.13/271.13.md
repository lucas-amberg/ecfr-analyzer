# ยง 271.13   Requirements with respect to permits and permit applications.

(a) State law must require permits for owners and operators of all hazardous waste management facilities required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 270 and prohibit the operation of any hazardous waste management facility without such a permit, except that States may, if adequate legal authority exists, authorize owners and operators of any facility which would qualify for interim status under the Federal program to remain in operation until a final decision is made on the permit application, or until interim status terminates pursuant to 40 CFR 270.73 (b) through (f). When State law authorizes such continued operation it shall require compliance by owners and operators of such facilities with standards at least as stringent as EPA's interim status standards at 40 CFR part 265. 


(b) The State must require all new HWM facilities to contact the State and obtain an EPA identification number before commencing treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.


(c) All permits issued by the State shall require compliance with the standards adopted by the State under ยง 271.12.


(d) All permits issued under State law prior to the date of approval of final authorization shall be reviewed by the State Director and modified or revoked and reissued to require compliance with the requirements of this part.
