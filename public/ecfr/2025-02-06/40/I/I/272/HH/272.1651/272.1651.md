(2) *Statutes and regulations that are not incorporated.* EPA considered the following statutes and regulations in evaluating the State program but is not incorporating them herein for enforcement purposes:


(i) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2004 Cumulative Pocket Part: Sections 1-0303(18), 3-0301(1) (introductory paragraph); 3-0301(1)(a), (b), (m), (o), (w), (x) and (cc); 3-0301(2) introductory paragraph; 3-0301(2)(a), (b), (d) through (j), (l), (m), (q) and (z); 3-0301(4); 19-0301(1) (except 19-0301(c), (e) and (f)); 19-0303(1) through (3); 19-0304; 23-2305; 23-2307; 27-0105; 27-0701; 27-0703; 27-0705; 27-0707 (except 27-0707(2-c)); 27-0711; 27-0900 through 27-0908; 27-0909 (except 27-0909(5)); 27-0910 through 27-0922; 27-1105; 70-0101; 70-0103; 70-0105 (except 70-0105(3) and 70-0105(6)); 70-0107(1) and (2); 70-0107(3) introductory paragraph; 70-0107(3)(l); 70-0109; 70-0113; 70-0115 (except (2)(c) and (d)); 70-0117 (except 70-0117(5) through (7); 70-0119; 70-0121; 71-0301; 71-1719; 71-2705; 71-2707; 71-2709 through 71-2715; 71-2717; 71-2720; and 71-2727.


(ii) McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 1, Executive Law (EL), Article 6: Section 102.


(iii) McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 46, Public Officers Law (POL), as amended through 2004: Sections 87 and 89.


(iv) McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 7B, Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), as amended through 2004: Sections 1013, 6301; 6311; and 6313.


(v) Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA) State Technology Law (STL), Article 3, as amended effective August 17, 2009: Sections 305 and 306.


(vi) Title 6, New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (6 NYCRR), Volume A-2A, as amended effective through September 5, 2006: Sections 372.1(f); 373-1.1(f) and (g); 373-1.4(b); 373-1.4(d) through (f); 373-1.6(c); 621.1 through 621.4; 621.5 (except (d)(5), (d)(6)(i), (d)(7)(i)(a), (d)(7)(i)(c) and (d)(9)); 621.6 (except (b), (d)(4) and (d)(5)); 621.7; 621.8; 621.9 (except (a)(5), (c)(2) and (e)(2)); 621.10; 621.11 (except (d)); 621.12 through 621.15; and 621.16 (except (b), (d) and (e)).


(vii) Title 9, New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (9 NYCRR), Part 540, Electronics Signature and Records Act, as amended effective May 7, 2003: Sections 540.1 through 540.6.


(3) *Statutes and regulations that are broader in scope.* The following statutory and regulatory provisions are broader in scope than the Federal program, are not part of the authorized program, are not incorporated by reference and are not federally enforceable:


(i) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2004 Cumulative Pocket Part: Sections 27-0301; 27-0303; 27-0305; 27-0307; 27-0909(5); 27-0923; 27-0925 and 27-0926.


(ii) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2006 Cumulative Pocket Part: Section 27-1109(6).


(iii) The following New York provisions are broader in scope because the State implements a Household Hazardous Waste program, whereas the Federal program excludes household waste from regulation as hazardous waste at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1): Title 6, New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (6 NYCRR), as amended effective through September 5, 2006: Sections 370.2(b)(92) “Household hazardous waste”; 370.2(b)(93) “Household hazardous waste collection facility”; and 373-4.


(iv) At 371.4(c), New York retains K064, K065, K066, K090 and K091 as hazardous wastes while EPA has removed them from the table at 40 CFR 261.32 and no longer regulates them as hazardous wastes (64 FR 56469; October 20, 1999).


(v) In the following provisions of New York's hazardous waste regulations, the State cross-references Part 364 “Waste Transporter Permits” requirements, which sets forth transporter requirements regarding permit and financial liability requirements: 372.2(b)(5)(ii), 372.3(a)(1), 372.3(a)(4), 372.3(b)(6)(iv), 372.3(d)(3), 373-2.5(b)(3)(ii)(d) and (e), 373-1.7(h)(3), 373-3.5(b)(3)(ii)(d) and (e), 374-3.4(a)(2), and Appendix 30 Instructions for Generators/Item 8. These provisions referencing the Part 364 transporter permit and financial liability requirements are broader in scope than the Federal program.


(vi) New York did not adopt an analog to 40 CFR 261.4(g) that excludes certain dredged materials from the State definition of hazardous waste. Instead, the State subjects these materials to full regulation as hazardous wastes.


(vii) New York State regulations do not incorporate the Mineral Processing Secondary Materials Exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(17) and the related changes affecting 40 CFR 261.2(c)(3) and (c)(4)/Table, and 40 CFR 261.2(e)(1)(iii). Since New York did not adopt the exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(17) the State has a broader in scope program because the effect is to include materials that are not considered solid waste by EPA.


(viii) The following New York provisions are broader in scope because they include requirements associated with the regulation of PCB waste as a state-only hazardous waste: 371.4(e), 372.1(e)(9), 373-1.1(d)(1)(x), 374-2.2(a)(9), 374-2.2(b) Table 1 and Footnote 2, 374-2.5(e)(4), 374-2.6(d)(4), 374-2.7(d)(4), 376.1(g)(1)(i), and 376.4(f). PCB wastes are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) at 40 CFR part 761 rather than under the Federal RCRA program.


(ix) The New York provision at 373-1.4(c) is broader in scope because it includes siting certificate requirements which are not part of the Federal program.


(x) The New York provision at 373-2.15(a)(2) is broader in scope because it subjects incinerators to not just limited portions of the State's Air regulations in the same manner as the Federal rules, but entire programs including air program-specific permits and registrations.


(xi) The New York provisions at 374-2.5(a)(2) and 374-2.6(a)(2) cross-reference 360-14.1(a)(4), which sets forth transfer facility and processor/re-refiner requirements for these types of facilities co-located at hazardous waste management facilities. These provisions referencing the Part 360 requirements are broader in scope than the Federal program because section 360-14.1(a)(4) may require used oil transfer facilities and processors/re-refiners managing non-hazardous used oil to be subject to State-only Part 360 provisions including permit requirements. The Federal program does not have an analogous permitting requirement for these types of facilities.


(4) *Vacated Federal rule.* New York provisions at 371.1(e)(1)(xvi) and 371.4(i) are no longer considered to be part of New York's authorized program because the equivalent federal requirements were vacated by a federal court. The Federal Requirements ((Hazardous Waste Combustors; Revised Standards (HSWA) (40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 only) were published on June 19, 1998. The New York regulations were authorized on January 11, 2005 (effective March 14, 2005). The State's authorized program was subsequently codified in 40 CFR part 272 on March 26, 2007 (effective May 25, 2007). However, the corresponding Federal rules were later vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 98-1379; June 27, 2014). Consistent with the Court's vacatur, EPA issued a new final rule removing 40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 from the Federal CFR (published on April 8, 2015)


(5) *Memorandum of Agreement.* The Memorandum of Agreement between EPA Region 2 and the State of New York, signed by the Commissioner of the State of New York Department of Environmental Conservation on July 20, 2001, and by the EPA Regional Administrator on January 16, 2002, although not incorporated by reference, is referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 *et seq.*

(6) *Statement of Legal Authority.* “Attorney General's Statement for Final Authorization”, signed by the Attorney General of New York in 1985 and revisions, supplements, and addenda to that Statement dated August 18, 1988, July 26, 1989, August 15, 1991, October 11, 1991, July 28, 1994, May 30, 1997, February 5, 2001, April 2, 2004, June 13, 2008 (including three certifications), August 17, 2009, and May 22, 2012, although not incorporated by reference, are referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 *et seq.*

(7) *Program Description.* The Program Description and any other materials submitted as supplements thereto, although not incorporated by reference, are referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 *et seq.*
