(4) *Unauthorized state amendments and provisions.* (i) The following authorized provisions of the Texas regulations include amendments published in the Texas Register that are not approved by EPA. Such unauthorized amendments are not part of the State's authorized program and are, therefore, not Federally enforceable. Thus, notwithstanding the language in the Texas hazardous waste regulations incorporated by reference at paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, EPA will enforce the State provisions that are actually authorized by EPA. The effective dates of the State's authorized provisions are listed in the Table below. The actual State regulatory text authorized by EPA (*i.e.,* without the unauthorized amendments) is available as a separate document, *Addendum to the EPA-Approved Texas Regulatory and Statutory Requirements Applicable to the Hazardous Waste Management Program, dated March 2021.* Copies of the document can be obtained from EPA Region 6, 1201 Elm Street, Suite 500, Dallas, TX 75270.


(ii) Texas has partially or fully adopted, but is not authorized to implement, the Federal rules that are listed in the following table. The EPA will continue to implement the Federal HSWA requirements for which Texas is not authorized until the State receives specific authorization for those requirements. The EPA will not enforce the non-HSWA Federal rules although they may be enforceable under State law. For those Federal rules that contain both HSWA and non-HSWA requirements, the EPA will enforce only the HSWA portions of the rules.


(iii) The Federal rules listed in the table below are not delegable to States. Texas has adopted these provisions and left the authority to the EPA for implementation and enforcement.


(iv) Texas has chosen not to adopt, and is not authorized to implement, the following optional Federal rules:


(5) *Vacated Federal rules.* (i) Texas adopted and was authorized for the following Federal rules which have since been vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 98-1379 and 08-1144, respectively; June 27, 2014):


(ii) Texas has adopted the following Federal provisions from the *Revisions to the Definition of Solid Waste Rule* (80 FR 1694); January 13, 2015, which have since been vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (*Am. Petroleum Inst.* v. *EPA,* 862 F.3d 50 (D.C. Cir. 2017) and *Am. Petroleum Inst.* v. *EPA,* No. 09-1038 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 6, 2018):


(A) one criterion in the determination of whether recycling is legitimate at 40 CFR 260.43(a)(4);


(B) one criterion related to the management of hazardous secondary materials at verified recycler facilities at 40 CFR 260.30(f);


(C) one criterion in the variance determination for exceptions to the classification of hazardous secondary materials as a solid waste (at 40 CFR 260.31(d)(6)); and


(D) the verified recycler exclusion, which allowed generators to send their hazardous secondary materials to certain reclaimers at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(24).
