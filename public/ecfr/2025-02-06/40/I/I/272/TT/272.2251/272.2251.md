(ii) [Reserved] 


(2) The following statutes and regulations concerning State procedures and enforcement, although not incorporated by reference, are part of the authorized State program: 


(i) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3A, 1998 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 19: Sections 19-1-306(2), 19-1-306(3), 19-6-102 introductory paragraph, 19-6-102(1) & (2), 19-6-102(6)-(9), 19-6-102(11), 19-6-102(13)-(21), 19-6-102.1, 19-6-103, 19-6-104(1) except (1)(j), 19-6-105(1) introductory paragraph, 19-6-105(1)(a)-(f), 19-6-105(1)(i) & (j), 19-6-105(2), 19-6-106, 19-6-107, 19-6-109, 19-6-111, 19-6-112, 19-6-113(1) through (4), 19-6-113(6), 19-6-114, 19-6-115, and 19-6-116. 


(ii) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 6D, 1997 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 63: Sections 63-2-103 through 63-2-105, 63-2-201 through 63-2-203 (except 63-2-203(10)), 63-2-204, 63-2-205, 63-2-301 through 63-2-308, 63-2-401 through 63-2-405, and 63-2-802. 


(iii) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3, 1953 as amended 1987, Title 26, Chapter 14: Section 26-14-8. 


(iv) Utah Administrative Code revised as of January 3, 1989: R450-3.1.1(b) & (c) and R450-3-2.4(b). 


(v) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996: Sections R315-2-14, R315-3-3(i)(1)&(3), R315-3-11(a), (b) & (f), R315-3-16(b), R315-3-23(b)(1) & (2), R315-3-23(c) & (d), R315-3-24(a) through R315-3-29, and R315-3-34. 


(vi) Utah Administrative Code revised as of May 15, 1996: Section R315-15-1.1(j) & (k). 


(3) The following statutory and regulatory provisions are broader-in-scope than the Federal program, are not part of the authorized program, and are not incorporated by reference: 


(i) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3A, 1998 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 19: Sections 19-6-105(3), 19-6-113(5), 19-6-118, 19-6-120, and 19-6-121. 


(ii) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996. EPA considers Utah's listing of all P999 and some F999 wastes (specifically: nerve, military, and chemical agents) as more stringent than the Federal rule. To the extent that unused chemical agents, as produced, exhibit a hazardous waste reactivity characteristic, they are considered hazardous waste and, thus, are regulated under Federal rule. Utah's listing of these wastes enhances the degree of regulatory control regarding these wastes. EPA also considers Utah's rule as broader-in-scope than the federal rule for those F999 process wastes which do not exhibit a characteristic for hazardous waste and would not be regulated under Federal rule. R315-2-10(e)(1), 315-2-11(e) introductory paragraph and R315-2-11(e)(1) are broader-in-scope regarding these wastes. 


(iii) Utah Administrative Code, as of May 15, 1996: R315-15-7.1(d), R315-15-10, R315-15-11 with respect to used oil transfer and off-specification used oil burning facilities, and R315-15-12 through R315-15-15 except R315-15-13.5(d). 


(4) *Unauthorized State provisions:* (i) Although the Federal rules listed in the following table have been adopted by the State and have been included in the materials incorporated by reference in paragraph (b)(1) of this Section, EPA has not authorized the State for these rules at this time. While they may be enforceable under State law, they are not enforceable under RCRA:


(ii) Additionally Utah has adopted but is not authorized to implement the HSWA rules that are listed below in lieu of EPA. EPA will continue to implement the Federal HSWA requirements for which Utah is not authorized until the State receives specific authorization for those requirements.


(5) *Unauthorized State amendments.* The following authorized provisions of the Utah regulations include amendments published in the *Utah State Bulletin* that are not approved by EPA. Such unauthorized amendments are not part of the State's authorized program and are, therefore, not Federally enforceable. Thus, notwithstanding the language in the Utah hazardous waste regulations incorporated by reference at § 272.2251(b)(1), EPA will only enforce the authorized State provisions with the effective dates indicated in the table below. The actual State regulatory text authorized by EPA for the listed provisions is available as a separate document, Addendum to the EPA-Approved Utah Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Hazardous Waste Management Program, March 1999. Copies of the document can be obtained from U.S. EPA Region VIII, 999 18th St., Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202-2466, phone (303) 312-6139. 


At R315-3-23(f)(3)(iv), Utah's analog to 40 CFR 270.33(b)(3)(iv), the State has a printing error in its regulations. The State will fix this error in its next rule making. For the codification, the authorized version of the provision will also be included in the Addendum to the EPA-Approved Utah Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Hazardous Waste Management Program, March 1999. 


(6) *Memorandum of Agreement.* The Memorandum of Agreement between EPA Region VIII and the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, signed by the EPA Regional Administrator on October 4, 1994, is referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 *et seq.*

(7) *Statement of legal authority.* “Attorney General's Statement for Final Authorization”, signed by the Attorney General of Utah on January 16, 1984, and revisions, supplements and addenda to that Statement dated October 29, 1986, March 6, 1991, September 17, 1991, September 223, 1992, November 19, 1993, March 16, 1994, March 20, 1995, November 13, 1997, and March 2, 1999, are referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 *et seq.*

(8) *Program description.* The Program description and any other materials submitted as part of the original application or as supplements thereto are referenced as part of the authorized hazardous waste management program under subtitle C of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921 *et seq.*
