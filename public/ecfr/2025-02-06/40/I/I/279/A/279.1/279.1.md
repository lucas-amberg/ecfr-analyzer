*Used oil processor/re-refiner* means a facility that processes used oil.


*Used oil transfer facility* means any transportation related facility including loading docks, parking areas, storage areas and other areas where shipments of used oil are held for more than 24 hours and not longer than 35 days during the normal course of transportation or prior to an activity performed pursuant to § 279.20(b)(2). Transfer facilities that store used oil for more than 35 days are subject to regulation under subpart F of this part.
