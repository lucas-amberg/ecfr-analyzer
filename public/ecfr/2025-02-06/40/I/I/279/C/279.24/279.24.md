# § 279.24   Off-site shipments.

Except as provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, generators must ensure that their used oil is transported only by transporters who have obtained EPA identification numbers.


(a) *Self-transportation of small amounts to approved collection centers.* Generators may transport, without an EPA identification number, used oil that is generated at the generator's site and used oil collected from household do-it-yourselfers to a used oil collection center provided that:


(1) The generator transports the used oil in a vehicle owned by the generator or owned by an employee of the generator;


(2) The generator transports no more than 55 gallons of used oil at any time; and


(3) The generator transports the used oil to a used oil collection center that is registered, licensed, permitted, or recognized by a state/county/municipal government to manage used oil.


(b) *Self-transportation of small amounts to aggregation points owned by the generator.* Generators may transport, without an EPA identification number, used oil that is generated at the generator's site to an aggregation point provided that:


(1) The generator transports the used oil in a vehicle owned by the generator or owned by an employee of the generator;


(2) The generator transports no more than 55 gallons of used oil at any time; and


(3) The generator transports the used oil to an aggregation point that is owned and/or operated by the same generator.


(c) *Tolling arrangements.* Used oil generators may arrange for used oil to be transported by a transporter without an EPA identification number if the used oil is reclaimed under a contractual agreement pursuant to which reclaimed oil is returned by the processor/re-refiner to the generator for use as a lubricant, cutting oil, or coolant. The contract (known as a “tolling arrangement”) must indicate:


(1) The type of used oil and the frequency of shipments;


(2) That the vehicle used to transport the used oil to the processing/re-refining facility and to deliver recycled used oil back to the generator is owned and operated by the used oil processor/re-refiner; and


(3) That reclaimed oil will be returned to the generator.
