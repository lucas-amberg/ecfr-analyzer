(a) Used oil transporters may consolidate or aggregate loads of used oil for purposes of transportation.

(b) Transporters may conduct incidental processing operations that occur in the normal course of used oil transportation (e.g., settling and water separation), but that are not designed to produce (or make more amenable for production of) used oil derived products unless they also comply with the processor/re-refiner requirements in subpart F of this part.


(c) Transporters of used oil that is removed from oil bearing electrical transformers and turbines and filtered by the transporter or at a transfer facility prior to being returned to its original use are not subject to the processor/re-refiner requirements in subpart F of this part.
