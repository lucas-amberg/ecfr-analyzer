All other repairs to tanks and piping must be tightness tested in accordance with § 280.43(c) and § 280.44(b) within 30 days following the date of the completion of the repair except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section:


(1) The repaired tank is internally inspected in accordance with a code of practice developed by a nationally recognized association or an independent testing laboratory; or
