# § 280.40   General requirements for all UST systems.

(a) Owners and operators of UST systems must provide a method, or combination of methods, of release detection that:


(1) Can detect a release from any portion of the tank and the connected underground piping that routinely contains product;


(2) Is installed and calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions;


(3) Beginning on October 13, 2018, is operated and maintained, and electronic and mechanical components are tested for proper operation, in accordance with one of the following: manufacturer's instructions; a code of practice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory; or requirements determined by the implementing agency to be no less protective of human health and the environment than the two options listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. A test of the proper operation must be performed at least annually and, at a minimum, as applicable to the facility, cover the following components and criteria:


(i) Automatic tank gauge and other controllers: test alarm; verify system configuration; test battery backup;


(ii) Probes and sensors: inspect for residual buildup; ensure floats move freely; ensure shaft is not damaged; ensure cables are free of kinks and breaks; test alarm operability and communication with controller;


(iii) Automatic line leak detector: test operation to meet criteria in § 280.44(a) by simulating a leak;


(iv) Vacuum pumps and pressure gauges: ensure proper communication with sensors and controller; and


(v) Hand-held electronic sampling equipment associated with groundwater and vapor monitoring: ensure proper operation.


(4) Meets the performance requirements in § 280.43, § 280.44, or subpart K of this part, as applicable, with any performance claims and their manner of determination described in writing by the equipment manufacturer or installer. In addition, the methods listed in § 280.43(b), (c), (d), (h), and (i), § 280.44(a) and (b), and subpart K of this part, must be capable of detecting the leak rate or quantity specified for that method in the corresponding section of the rule with a probability of detection of 0.95 and a probability of false alarm of 0.05.


(b) When a release detection method operated in accordance with the performance standards in § 280.43, § 280.44, or subpart K of this part indicates a release may have occurred, owners and operators must notify the implementing agency in accordance with subpart E of this part.


(c) Any UST system that cannot apply a method of release detection that complies with the requirements of this subpart must complete the closure procedures in subpart G of this part. For previously deferred UST systems described in subparts A and K of this part, this requirement applies after the effective dates described in § 280.10(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) and § 280.251(a).
