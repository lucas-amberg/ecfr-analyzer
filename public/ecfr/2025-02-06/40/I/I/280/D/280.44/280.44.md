# § 280.44   Methods of release detection for piping.

Each method of release detection for piping used to meet the requirements of § 280.41 must be conducted in accordance with the following:


(a) *Automatic line leak detectors.* Methods which alert the operator to the presence of a leak by restricting or shutting off the flow of regulated substances through piping or triggering an audible or visual alarm may be used only if they detect leaks of 3 gallons per hour at 10 pounds per square inch line pressure within 1 hour. An annual test of the operation of the leak detector must be conducted in accordance with § 280.40(a)(3).


(b) *Line tightness testing.* A periodic test of piping may be conducted only if it can detect a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate at one and one-half times the operating pressure.


(c) *Applicable tank methods.* Except as described in § 280.41(a), any of the methods in § 280.43(e) through (i) may be used if they are designed to detect a release from any portion of the underground piping that routinely contains regulated substances.
