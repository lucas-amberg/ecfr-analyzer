# § 280.65   Investigations for soil and groundwater cleanup.

(a) In order to determine the full extent and location of soils contaminated by the release and the presence and concentrations of dissolved product contamination in the groundwater, owners and operators must conduct investigations of the release, the release site, and the surrounding area possibly affected by the release if any of the following conditions exist:


(1) There is evidence that groundwater wells have been affected by the release (e.g., as found during release confirmation or previous corrective action measures);


(2) Free product is found to need recovery in compliance with § 280.64;


(3) There is evidence that contaminated soils may be in contact with groundwater (e.g., as found during conduct of the initial response measures or investigations required under §§ 280.60 through 280.64); and


(4) The implementing agency requests an investigation, based on the potential effects of contaminated soil or groundwater on nearby surface water and groundwater resources.


(b) Owners and operators must submit the information collected under paragraph (a) of this section as soon as practicable or in accordance with a schedule established by the implementing agency.
