# § 280.70   Temporary closure.

(a) When an UST system is temporarily closed, owners and operators must continue operation and maintenance of corrosion protection in accordance with § 280.31, and any release detection in accordance with subparts D and K of this part. Subparts E and F of this part must be complied with if a release is suspected or confirmed. However, release detection and release detection operation and maintenance testing and inspections in subparts C and D of this part are not required as long as the UST system is empty. The UST system is empty when all materials have been removed using commonly employed practices so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue, or 0.3 percent by weight of the total capacity of the UST system, remain in the system. In addition, spill and overfill operation and maintenance testing and inspections in subpart C of this part are not required.


(b) When an UST system is temporarily closed for 3 months or more, owners and operators must also comply with the following requirements:


(1) Leave vent lines open and functioning; and


(2) Cap and secure all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment.


(c) When an UST system is temporarily closed for more than 12 months, owners and operators must permanently close the UST system if it does not meet either performance standards in § 280.20 for new UST systems or the upgrading requirements in § 280.21, *except that* the spill and overfill equipment requirements do not have to be met. Owners and operators must permanently close the substandard UST systems at the end of this 12-month period in accordance with §§ 280.71 through 280.74, *unless* the implementing agency provides an extension of the 12-month temporary closure period. Owners and operators must complete a site assessment in accordance with § 280.72 before such an extension can be applied for.
