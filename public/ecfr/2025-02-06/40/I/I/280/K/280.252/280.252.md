# § 280.252   Additions, exceptions, and alternatives for UST systems with field-constructed tanks and airport hydrant systems.

(a) *Exception to piping secondary containment requirements.* Owners and operators may use single walled piping when installing or replacing piping associated with UST systems with field-constructed tanks greater than 50,000 gallons and piping associated with airport hydrant systems. Piping associated with UST systems with field-constructed tanks less than or equal to 50,000 gallons not part of an airport hydrant system must meet the secondary containment requirement when installed or replaced.


(b) *Upgrade requirements.* Not later than October 13, 2018, airport hydrant systems and UST systems with field-constructed tanks where installation commenced on or before October 13, 2015 must meet the following requirements or be permanently closed pursuant to subpart G of this part.


(1) *Corrosion protection.* UST system components in contact with the ground that routinely contain regulated substances must meet one of the following:


(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the new UST system performance standards for tanks at § 280.20(a) and for piping at § 280.20(b); or


(ii) Be constructed of metal and cathodically protected according to a code of practice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory and meets the following:


(A) Cathodic protection must meet the requirements of § 280.20(a)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) for tanks, and § 280.20(b)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) for piping.


(B) Tanks greater than 10 years old without cathodic protection must be assessed to ensure the tank is structurally sound and free of corrosion holes prior to adding cathodic protection. The assessment must be by internal inspection or another method determined by the implementing agency to adequately assess the tank for structural soundness and corrosion holes.


(2) *Spill and overfill prevention equipment.* To prevent spilling and overfilling associated with product transfer to the UST system, all UST systems with field-constructed tanks and airport hydrant systems must comply with new UST system spill and overfill prevention equipment requirements specified in § 280.20(c).


(c) *Walkthrough inspections.* In addition to the walkthrough inspection requirements in § 280.36, owners and operators must inspect the following additional areas for airport hydrant systems at least once every 30 days if confined space entry according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (see 29 CFR part 1910) is not required or at least annually if confined space entry is required and keep documentation of the inspection according to § 280.36(b).


(1) Hydrant pits—visually check for any damage; remove any liquid or debris; and check for any leaks, and


(2) Hydrant piping vaults—check for any hydrant piping leaks.


(d) *Release detection.* Owners and operators of UST systems with field-constructed tanks and airport hydrant systems must begin meeting the release detection requirements described in this subpart not later than October 13, 2018.


(1) *Methods of release detection for field-constructed tanks.* Owners and operators of field-constructed tanks with a capacity less than or equal to 50,000 gallons must meet the release detection requirements in subpart D of this part. Owners and operators of field-constructed tanks with a capacity greater than 50,000 gallons must meet either the requirements in subpart D (except § 280.43(e) and (f) must be combined with inventory control as stated below) or use one or a combination of the following alternative methods of release detection:


(i) Conduct an annual tank tightness test that can detect a 0.5 gallon per hour leak rate;


(ii) Use an automatic tank gauging system to perform release detection at least every 30 days that can detect a leak rate less than or equal to one gallon per hour. This method must be combined with a tank tightness test that can detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate performed at least every three years;


(iii) Use an automatic tank gauging system to perform release detection at least every 30 days that can detect a leak rate less than or equal to two gallons per hour. This method must be combined with a tank tightness test that can detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate performed at least every two years;


(iv) Perform vapor monitoring (conducted in accordance with § 280.43(e) for a tracer compound placed in the tank system) capable of detecting a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate at least every two years;


(v) Perform inventory control (conducted in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 4140.25; ATA Airport Fuel Facility Operations and Maintenance Guidance Manual; or equivalent procedures) at least every 30 days that can detect a leak equal to or less than 0.5 percent of flow-through; and


(A) Perform a tank tightness test that can detect a 0.5 gallon per hour leak rate at least every two years; or


(B) Perform vapor monitoring or groundwater monitoring (conducted in accordance with § 280.43(e) or (f), respectively, for the stored regulated substance) at least every 30 days; or


(vi) Another method approved by the implementing agency if the owner and operator can demonstrate that the method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. In comparing methods, the implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method can detect and the frequency and reliability of detection.


(2) *Methods of release detection for piping.* Owners and operators of underground piping associated with field-constructed tanks less than or equal to 50,000 gallons must meet the release detection requirements in subpart D of this part. Owners and operators of underground piping associated with airport hydrant systems and field-constructed tanks greater than 50,000 gallons must follow either the requirements in subpart D (except § 280.43(e) and (f) must be combined with inventory control as stated below) or use one or a combination of the following alternative methods of release detection:


(i)(A) Perform a semiannual or annual line tightness test at or above the piping operating pressure in accordance with the table below.


(B) Piping segment volumes ≥100,000 gallons not capable of meeting the maximum 3.0 gallon per hour leak rate for the semiannual test may be tested at a leak rate up to 6.0 gallons per hour according to the following schedule:


(ii) Perform vapor monitoring (conducted in accordance with § 280.43(e) for a tracer compound placed in the tank system) capable of detecting a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate at least every two years;


(iii) Perform inventory control (conducted in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 4140.25; ATA Airport Fuel Facility Operations and Maintenance Guidance Manual; or equivalent procedures) at least every 30 days that can detect a leak equal to or less than 0.5 percent of flow-through; and


(A) Perform a line tightness test (conducted in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section using the leak rates for the semiannual test) at least every two years; or


(B) Perform vapor monitoring or groundwater monitoring (conducted in accordance with § 280.43(e) or (f), respectively, for the stored regulated substance) at least every 30 days; or


(iv) Another method approved by the implementing agency if the owner and operator can demonstrate that the method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. In comparing methods, the implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method can detect and the frequency and reliability of detection.


(3) *Recordkeeping for release detection.* Owners and operators must maintain release detection records according to the recordkeeping requirements in § 280.45.


(e) *Applicability of closure requirements to previously closed UST systems.* When directed by the implementing agency, the owner and operator of an UST system with field-constructed tanks or airport hydrant system permanently closed before October 13, 2015 must assess the excavation zone and close the UST system in accordance with subpart G of this part if releases from the UST may, in the judgment of the implementing agency, pose a current or potential threat to human health and the environment.
