# § 281.12   Scope and definitions.

(a) *Scope.* (1) The Administrator may approve either partial or complete state programs. A “partial” state program regulates either solely UST systems containing petroleum or solely UST systems containing hazardous substances. If a “partial” state program is approved, EPA will administer the remaining part of the program. A “complete” state program regulates both petroleum and hazardous substance tanks.


(2) EPA will administer the UST program in Indian country, except where Congress has clearly expressed an intention to grant a state authority to regulate petroleum and hazardous substance USTs in Indian country. In either case, this decision will not impair a state's ability to obtain program approval for petroleum or hazardous substances in non-Indian country in accordance with this part.


(3) Nothing in this subpart precludes a state from:


(i) Adopting or enforcing requirements that are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this part; or


(ii) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this part. Where an approved state program has a greater scope of coverage than required by federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the federally-approved program.


(b) *Definitions.* (1) The definitions in 40 CFR part 280 apply to this entire part except as described below.


(i) States may use the definitions associated with tank and piping secondary containment as defined in section 9003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.


(ii) States may use the definitions associated with operator training as described in § 9010 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.


(2) For the purposes of this part the term “final approval” means the approval received by a state program that meets the requirements in § 281.11(b).
