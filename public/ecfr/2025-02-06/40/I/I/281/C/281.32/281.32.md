In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal general operating requirements, the state must have requirements that ensure all new and existing UST systems conform to the following:


(a) Prevent spills and overfills by ensuring that the space in the tank is sufficient to receive the volume to be transferred and that the transfer operation is monitored constantly;


(b) Where equipped with cathodic protection, be operated and maintained by a person with sufficient training and experience in preventing corrosion, and in a manner that ensures that no releases occur during the operating life of the UST system;


(c) Be made of or lined with materials that are compatible with the substance stored; in order to ensure compatibility, the state requirements must also include provisions for demonstrating compatibility with new and innovative regulated substances or other regulated substances identified by the implementing agency or include other provisions determined by the implementing agency to be no less protective of human health and the environment than the provisions for demonstrating compatibility;


(d) At the time of upgrade or repair, be structurally sound and upgraded or repaired in a manner that will prevent releases due to structural failure or corrosion during their operating lives;


(e) Have spill and overfill prevention equipment periodically tested or inspected in a manner and frequency that ensures its functionality for the operating life of the equipment and have the integrity of containment sumps used for interstitial monitoring of piping periodically tested in a manner and frequency that prevents releases during the operating life of the UST system;


(f) Have operation and maintenance walkthrough inspections periodically conducted in a manner and frequency that ensures proper operation and maintenance for the operating life of the UST system; and
