In order to be considered no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements for release response and corrective action, the state must have requirements that ensure:


(a) All releases from UST systems are promptly assessed and further releases are stopped;


(b) Actions are taken to identify, contain and mitigate any immediate health and safety threats that are posed by a release (such activities include investigation and initiation of free product removal, if present);


(c) All releases from UST systems are investigated to determine if there are impacts on soil and groundwater, and any nearby surface waters. The extent of soil and groundwater contamination must be delineated when a potential threat to human health and the environment exists.


(d) All releases from UST systems are cleaned up through soil and groundwater remediation and any other steps are taken, as necessary to protect human health and the environment;


(e) Adequate information is made available to the state to demonstrate that corrective actions are taken in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. This information must be submitted in a timely manner that demonstrates its technical adequacy to protect human health and the environment; and


(f) In accordance with ยง 280.67, the state must notify the affected public of all confirmed releases requiring a plan for soil and groundwater remediation, and upon request provide or make available information to inform the interested public of the nature of the release and the corrective measures planned or taken.
