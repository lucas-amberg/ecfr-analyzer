(a) In order to be considered no less stringent than the federal requirements for financial responsibility for UST systems containing petroleum, the state requirements for financial responsibility for petroleum UST systems must ensure that:


(1) Owners and operators have $1 million per occurrence for corrective action and third-party claims in a timely manner to protect human health and the environment;


(2) Owners and operators not engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing and who handle a throughput of 10,000 gallons of petroleum per month or less have $500,000 per occurrence for corrective action and third-party claims in a timely manner to protect human health and the environment;


(3) Owners and operators of 1 to 100 petroleum USTs must have an annual aggregate of $1 million; and


(4) Owners and operators of 101 or more petroleum USTs must have an annual aggregate of $2 million.


(b) States may allow the use of a wide variety of financial assurance mechanisms to meet this requirement. Each financial mechanism must meet the following criteria in order to be no less stringent than the federal requirements. The mechanism must: Be valid and enforceable; be issued by a provider that is qualified or licensed in the state; not permit cancellation without allowing the state to draw funds; ensure that funds will only and directly be used for corrective action and third party liability costs; and require that the provider notify the owner or operator of any circumstances that would impair or suspend coverage.


(c) States must require owners and operators to maintain records that demonstrate compliance with the state financial responsibility requirements, and these records must be made readily available when requested by the implementing agency.
