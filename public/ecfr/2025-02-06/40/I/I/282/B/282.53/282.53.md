# § 282.53   Arkansas State-Administered Program.

(a) *History of the approval of Arkansas's program.* The State of Arkansas is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991, *et seq.* The State's program, as administered by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and Part 281 of this Chapter. EPA published the notice of final determination approving the Arkansas underground storage tank base program effective on November 16, 1990. A subsequent program revision application was approved effective on March 8, 2021.


(b) *Enforcement authority.* Arkansas has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally-approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection and enforcement authorities under Subtitle I of RCRA sections 9003(h), 9005 and 9006, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h), 6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.


(c) *Retaining program approval.* To retain program approval, Arkansas must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with RCRA section 9004, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Arkansas obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to RCRA section 9004, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the _Federal Register_.


(d) *Final program approval.* Arkansas has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to EPA and approved effective November 16, 1990, and the program revision application approved by EPA effective on March 8, 2021:
