# § 282.60   Georgia State-Administered Program.

(a) *History of the approval of Georgia's Program.* The State of Georgia is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the federal program under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 *et seq.* The State's program, as administered by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this Chapter. EPA approved the Georgia program on May 10, 1991 and it was effective on July 9, 1991. A subsequent program revision was approved by EPA and became effective on February 14, 2020.


(b) *Enforcement authority.* Georgia has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection, and enforcement authorities under sections 9003(h), 9005, and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h), 6991d, and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.

If Georgia obtains approval for revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the _Federal Register_.


(d) *Final approval.* Georgia has final approval for the following elements of its underground storage tank program originally submitted to EPA and approved effective July 9, 1991, and the program revisions approved by EPA effective on February 14, 2020.
