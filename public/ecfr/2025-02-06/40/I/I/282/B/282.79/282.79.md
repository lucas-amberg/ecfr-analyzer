# § 282.79   New Hampshire State-Administered Program.

(a) The State of New Hampshire is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 *et seq.* The State's program, as administered by the New Hampshire Department Environmental Services (NH DES), was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281. EPA approved the New Hampshire program on June 19, 1991, which was effective on July 19, 1991.


(b) New Hampshire has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.


(c) To retain program approval, New Hampshire must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program which makes it more stringent, in accordance with Section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If New Hampshire obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notification of any change will be published in the _Federal Register_.


(d) New Hampshire has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to EPA and approved effective July 19, 1991, and the program revision application approved by EPA, effective on December 31, 2019.
