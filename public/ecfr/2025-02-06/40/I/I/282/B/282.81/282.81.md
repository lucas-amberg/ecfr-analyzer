EPA published the notice of final determination approving the New Mexico underground storage tank base program effective on November 16, 1990. A subsequent program revision application was approved effective on October 27, 2020.


(b) *Enforcement authority.* New Mexico has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection and enforcement authorities under Subtitle I of RCRA sections 9003(h), 9005 and 9006, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h), 6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.

If New Mexico obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to RCRA section 9004, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the _Federal Register_.
