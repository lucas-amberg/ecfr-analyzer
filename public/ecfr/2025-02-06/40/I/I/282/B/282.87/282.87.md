# § 282.87   Oregon State-Administered Program.

(a) The State of Oregon is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 *et seq.* The State's program, as administered by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this chapter. The EPA published the notice of final determination approving the Oregon underground storage tank base program effective on September 16, 2011. A subsequent program revision application was approved by the EPA and became effective on September 24, 2019.


(b) Oregon has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, the EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection, and enforcement authorities under Sections 9003(h), 9005, and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h), 6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.


(c) To retain program approval, Oregon must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Oregon obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to Section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, then the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notification of any change will be published in the _Federal Register_.


(d) Oregon has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to the EPA and approved effective September 16, 2011, and the program revision application approved by the EPA, effective on September 24, 2019:
