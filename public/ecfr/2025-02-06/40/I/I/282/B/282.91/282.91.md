# § 282.91   South Dakota State-Administered Program.

(a) The State of South Dakota is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the Federal program under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 *et seq.* The State's program, as administered by the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Department), was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this chapter. On March 16, 1995, EPA published the notice of final determination approving the South Dakota underground storage tank base program effective May 15, 1995. A subsequent program revision application was approved by EPA and became effective on July 15, 2024.


(b) South Dakota has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection, and enforcement authorities under sections 9003(h), 9005, and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h), 6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.


(c) To retain program approval, South Dakota must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If South Dakota obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the _Federal Register_.


(d) South Dakota has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to EPA and approved effective May 15, 1995, and the program revision application approved by EPA effective on July 15, 2024:
