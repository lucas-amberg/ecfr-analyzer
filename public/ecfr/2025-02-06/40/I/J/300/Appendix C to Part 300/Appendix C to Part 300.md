# Appendix C to Part 300—Requirements for Product Testing Protocols and Summary Test Data: Dispersant Baffled Flask Efficacy and Toxicity Tests; Standard Acute Toxicity Test for Bioremediation Agents, Surface Washing Agents, Herding Agents, and Solidifiers; and Bioremediation Agent Efficacy Test


1.0 *Applicability and Scope.* This Appendix establishes laboratory protocols required under Subpart J (Use of Dispersants and Other Chemical and Biological Agents) of 40 CFR part 300 (National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan) to make listing determinations for the Product Schedule. The protocols apply, based on product type, to dispersants, bioremediation agents, surface washing agents, herding agents, and solidifiers as defined in Subpart A (Introduction) of 40 CFR part 300.


2.0 *Baffled Flask Dispersant Efficacy Test (BFT)*

2.1 *Summary.* This laboratory protocol establishes procedures to evaluate the degree to which a product effectively disperses oil spilled on the surface of seawater, using a modified 150-mL screw-cap trypsinizing flask (an Erlenmeyer flask with baffles) with a glass and Teflon® stopcock near the bottom to allow removal of subsurface water samples without disturbing the surface oil layer. The efficacy of a dispersant is measured using one reference oil, Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserve Bryan Mound at two temperatures (5 °C and 25 °C). Six replicates and one method blank are required at each temperature. A layer of oil is placed on the surface of artificial seawater, and the dispersant is added to the slick at a dispersant:oil ratio (DOR) of 1:25 (4%) by volume. A standard orbital shaker table provides turbulent mixing at a speed of 250 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 10 minutes, immediately after which it is maintained stationary for 10 minutes to allow non-dispersed oil to rise to the water's surface. An undisturbed water sample is removed from the bottom of the flask through the stopcock, extracted with dichloromethane (DCM), and analyzed for oil content by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry at wavelengths ranging between 340 and 400 nm.


2.2 *Apparatus.* All equipment must be maintained and calibrated per standard laboratory procedures.


2.2.1 *Modified Trypsinizing Flask.* A modified 150 mL glass screw-capped Erlenmeyer flasks with baffles (*e.g.,* Wheaton No. 355394 or equivalent) fitted with a 2 mm bore Teflon® stopcock and glass tubing, the center of which is no more than 1.3 cm from the bottom, as shown in Figure 1.


2.2.2 *Orbital Shaker Table.* An orbital shaker table with a variable speed control unit capable of maintaining 250 rpm. The orbital diameter must be approximately 1.0 inch (2.5 cm) ±0.1 inch (0.25 cm).


2.2.3 *Spectrophotometer.* A UV-visible spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance between 340 and 400 nm (*e.g.,* Shimadzu UV-1800, Agilent 8453, or equivalent). Use standard transmission-matched quartz 10-mm path length rectangular cells with PTFE cover for absorbance measurements.


2.2.4 *Glassware.* Including: 25-ml graduated mixing cylinders (a graduated cylinder with a ground glass stopper); 50- and 100-ml graduated cylinders; 125-mL separatory funnels with Teflon stopcocks; 10-ml volumetric flasks; 30-ml crimp style glass serum bottles; 1-, 2-, 5-mL pipettes; other miscellaneous laboratory items.


2.2.5 *Micropipettor.* Use a micropipettor capable of dispensing 4 µL of dispersant and 100 µL of oil (*e.g.,* Brinkmann Eppendorf repeater pipettor with 100 µL and 5 mL syringe tip attachments or equivalent).


2.2.6 *Syringes.* 25-, 100-, 250-, 1,000-, 2,500-, 5,000-µl gas-tight syringes.


2.2.7 *Constant temperature rooms or incubators to hold the shaker at* 5 °C and 25 °C.


2.2.8 *Analytical Balance.*

2.2.9 *Chemical fume hood.*

2.3 *Reagents.*

2.3.1 *Artificial seawater.* Use the artificial seawater GP2 formulation shown in Table 1 of this Appendix.


2.3.2 *Test oil.* Use the EPA standard reference oil Strategic Petroleum Reserve Bryan Mound. To obtain this oil at no charge (except for a minimal shipping fee), see the instructions at *http://www.epa.gov/emergencies/content/ncp/index.htm.* Selected properties are summarized in Table 2 of this Appendix.


2.3.3 *Dichloromethane (DCM) (also known as methylene chloride), pesticide quality.*

2.4 *Container Handling and Storage.*

2.4.1 *Glassware.* If the glassware has been used with oil before, rinse with DCM to remove as much of the oil adhering to the sides of the flask as possible; waste DCM may be used. Soak in warm water with detergent and individually wash with bristled brushes. First rinse with tap water, then follow with two de-ionized water rinses. Dry either on a rack or in a 110 °C drying oven. After drying, rinse with fresh DCM (use sparingly).


2.4.2 *Serum bottles and other non-volumetric glassware.* Bake for at least 4 hours in a muffle furnace at 450 °C.


2.5 *Calibration Curve for the UV-visible spectrophotometer.*

2.5.1 *Stock Standard Solution Preparation.* Stock standard solution concentrations are based on the mass measurements after each addition and density determinations of the oil/dispersant/DCM solution using a density bottle or a 1-mL gas tight syringe. An example calculation is given in Table 3 of this Appendix according to the following equation:


Use the reference oil and the specific dispersant being tested for a particular set of experimental test runs. Prepare the stock standard solution of dispersant-oil mixture in DCM, starting with 2 ml of the oil, then adding 80 µl of the dispersant followed by 18 ml of DCM.


2.5.2 Six*-point Calibration Curve.* For the reference oil, add specific volumes of its stock standard solution (given in Table 4 of this Appendix) to 30 ml of artificial seawater in a 125 ml separatory funnel. Extract the oil/dispersant water mixture with triplicate 5 ml volumes of DCM. Follow each DCM addition by 15 seconds of vigorous shaking, carefully releasing the initial pressure inside the separatory funnel by partially removing the glass stopper inside a fume hood after the first few shakes. Then, allow a 2-minute stationary period for phase separation for each extraction. Drain the extracts into a 25-mL graduated mixing cylinder. Release any entrained bubbles of DCM from the water layer by sideways shaking of the funnel. Use precaution not to drain water into the DCM extract as it can affect the absorbance readings. Adjust the final volume of the collected extracts to 25 mL in the mixing cylinder using DCM. Determine specific masses for oil concentrations in the standards as volumes of oil/dispersant solution multiplied by the concentration of the stock solution. An example calculation is given in Table 4 of this Appendix. One calibration curve is needed for the reference oil and dispersant combination.


2.6 *Sample Preparation and Testing.* See section 2.7 of this Appendix for a detailed description of the spectrophotometer's linear calibration procedure.


2.6.1 Six replicates of the oil and test dispersant are required at each temperature plus two additional tests of method blanks (artificial seawater without oil and dispersant), one at each temperature. A completed test consists of 14 baffled flask tests (a total of six replicates for the reference oil/test dispersant combination at two temperatures (5 °C and 25 °C), plus two method blanks).


2.6.2 Attach a 3-inch length of Teflon tubing to the stopcock of each of the 150-mL baffled flasks. Add 120 mL of artificial seawater to each flask. Put screw cap on flasks and place them at the appropriate temperature (either 5 °C or 25 °C) for equilibration.


2.6.3 Calibrate and adjust the shaker table to 250 ± 10 rpm.


2.6.4 Prepare and time separately each baffled flask. Sequentially add 100 µL of oil and 4 µL of dispersant to the flask layering them onto the center of the seawater to give a dispersant-to-oil ratio (DOR) of 1:25. Avoid any oil or dispersant splashing on the flask walls, as it may reduce efficacy or cause errors in the calculated results. Discard the sample and repeat the setup if: (1) any oil or dispersant splashing occurs during the additions, or (2) the dispersant contacts the water first rather than the oil. This is especially important for 5 °C work because of increased oil viscosity.


2.6.5 For the oil, fill the tip of the pipettor, using a wipe to remove any oil from the sides of the tip. Holding the pipettor vertically, dispense several times back into the reservoir to ensure that the oil flows smoothly. Insert the syringe tip vertically into the baffled flask and let the bottom of the pipettor rest on the neck of the flask. Slowly and carefully dispense the oil one time onto the center of the water's surface. The remainder of the oil can either be returned to the oil bottle or set aside for use in the next test flask.


_Note to 2.6.5:_ If a Brinkmann Eppendorf repeater pipettor is used for dispensing the oil, attach a 5-mL syringe tip, and set the dial to 1.


2.6.6 For the dispersant, use the same procedure as for the oil to dispense onto the center of the oil slick surface. As the dispersant first contacts the oil, it will usually push the oil to the sides of the flask. Replace the screw cap onto the flask.


_Note to 2.6.6:_ If a Brinkmann Eppendorf repeater pipettor is used for dispensing the dispersant, attach a 100-µL syringe tip, and set the dial to 2.


2.6.7 Carefully place flask securely onto the shaker and agitate for 10 ± 0.25 minutes at 250 ± 10 rpm.


2.6.8 Remove the flask from the shaker table and allow a stationary, quiescent period of 10 ± 0.25 minutes to allow undispersed and/or recoalesced oil droplets to refloat to the surface.


2.6.9 Carefully open the screw cap, then the stopcock at the bottom, and discard the first several mL of seawater into a waste beaker to remove non-mixed water-oil initially trapped in the stopcock tubing. Collect a volume slightly greater than 30-mL into a 50-mL graduated cylinder. Adjust the collected volume to the 30-mL mark by removing excess with a disposable glass Pasteur pipette. A web-like emulsion may form at the solvent/water interface during the water sample extraction. Avoid pulling any emulsion phase into the DCM extract as it may cloud the DCM-extract, leading to error.


2.6.10 Transfer the water-oil sample from the graduated cylinder into a 125-mL glass separatory funnel fitted with a Teflon stopcock.


2.6.11 Add 5 mL DCM to the separatory funnel. Start shaking, releasing pressure into the fume hood by loosening the glass stopper. Shake vigorously at least 20 times for 15 seconds.


2.6.12 Allow the funnel to remain in a stationary position for 2 minutes to allow phase separation of the water and DCM.


2.6.13 Drain the DCM layer from the separatory funnel into a 25 mL mixing cylinder. Avoid pulling any emulsion phase into the DCM extract as it may cloud the DCM extract.


2.6.14 Repeat the DCM-extraction process two or three additional times until the DCM is clear. Collect each extract in the graduated cylinder. After the final extraction, lightly shake the separatory funnel sideways once or twice to dislodge entrained bubbles of DCM and drain.


2.6.15 Adjust the final volume to a known quantity, 25 mL, in the mixing cylinder. Using a syringe, dispense 2.5 mL or 5.0 mL of a reference oil sample into a 10-mL volumetric flask, and fill with DCM to make either a 1:4 or 1:2 dilution, respectively.


2.6.16 If analysis cannot be conducted immediately, store the extracted DCM samples at 4 ± 2 °C until time of analysis. Glass-stoppered mixing cylinders may be used for short-term storage or prior to bringing the extracts up to volume. After bringing to volume, transfer the DCM extracts to 25-30 ml crimp-style serum vials with aluminum/Teflon seals.


2.6.17 Complete all analysis within 10 consecutive days from when the sample was collected.


2.7 *UV-Visible Spectrophotometer Linear Stability Calibration*

2.7.1 A six-point calibration of the UV-visible spectrophotometer is required at least once per day for each oil. The stability calibration criterion is determined with the six oil standards identified in Table 4 of this Appendix.


2.7.2 Turn on spectrophotometer and allow it to warm up for at least 30 minutes before beginning analysis. Blank the instrument for the wavelengths between 340 and 400 nm with DCM.


2.7.3 If refrigerated, allow all extracts, standards, and samples to warm to room temperature.


2.7.4 Determine the absorbance of the six standards between the wavelengths of 340 and 400 nm. This can be done by either one of the following methods:


2.7.4.1 *Trapezoidal Rule.* Program the spectrophotometer to take readings every 5λ or 10λ and calculate the area under the curve using the Trapezoidal rule:




When using readings taken every 5λ, each absorbance sum is multiplied by 5.


2.7.4.2 Automatic *Integration.* Program the spectrophotometer to automatically integrate the area under the curve between 340 nm and 400 nm.


2.7.4.3 If the wavelengths must be manually set on the spectrophotometer, the older method of only measuring at 340λ, 370λ, and 400λ may be used. Then calculate using the trapezoidal rule for N + 1 = 3, H = 30. While the resulting area count with the older method is less accurate, the final results are similar since the inaccuracy is systematic.


2.7.5 After determining the area count for each standard, determine the response factor (RF) for the oil at each concentration using the following equation:




2.7.6 Spectrophotometer stability for the initial calibration is acceptable when the RFs of the six standard extracts are less than 10% different from the overall mean value for the six standards, as calculated in Equation 5 of this Appendix and depicted in the example in Table 4 of this Appendix.


2.7.7 If this criterion is satisfied, begin analysis of sample extracts. Absorbances greater than or equal to 3.5 are not included because absorbance saturation occurs at and above this value. If any of the standard oil extracts fails to satisfy the initial-stability criterion, the source of the problem (*e.g.,* preparation protocol for the oil standards, spectrophotometer stability, etc.) must be corrected before analysis of the sample extracts begins.


2.7.8 Determine the slope of the calibration points by using linear regression forced zero intercept:


2.8 Spectrophotometric *Analysis and Calculations*

2.8.1 Once a successful calibration curve for the reference oil has been created and verified, measure experimental replicates for the reference oil at each temperature followed by a standard check sample.


2.8.2 Determine the area for the absorbance values obtained for the experimental samples by using Equation 2 of this Appendix and illustrated by Equation 3 of this Appendix.


2.8.3 Calculate the Total Oil dispersed and the percentage of oil dispersed (%OD) based on the ratio of oil dispersed in the test system to the total oil added to the system, as follows:


2.8.4 The %ODs for the six replicates within a particular treatment are then subjected to an outlier test, the Grubb's Test or Maximum Normal Residual test (6). A convenient internet-based calculator of a Grubbs outlier may be found at: *http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/Grubbs1.cfm.* If an outlier is detected (p < 0.05), analyze an additional replicate to obtain the required six replicates.


2.8.5 Report the Dispersion Efficacy value for each oil and each temperature, which is the lower 95% confidence level of the 6 independent replicates (DE_LCL95_) for each oil/temperature combination. Error bars are not needed as reporting the lower confidence level computationally takes the variability of the replicates into account as shown in Equation 9 of this Appendix.


(%OD) = mean percentage oil dispersed for the n = 6 replicates, S = standard deviation, and t_(n-1,1-__α__)_ = 100 * (1-α)th percentile from the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. For 6 replicates, t_n-1,1-__α_ = 2.015, where α = 0.05. An example of the calculations is given in Table 5 of this Appendix.


2.9 *Performance Criterion*

The dispersant product tested will remain in consideration for listing on the NCP Product Schedule if the dispersant efficacy (DE_LCL95_), as calculated in section 2.8.6 of this Appendix, is:


2.10 *Quality Control (QC) Procedures for Oil Concentration Measurements*

2.10.1 *Absorbance readings.* Perform at least 5% of all UV-visible spectrophotometric measurements in duplicate as a QC check on the analytical measurement method. The absorbance values for the duplicates must agree within ±5% of their mean value.


2.10.2 *Method blanks.* Analytical method blanks involve an analysis of artificial seawater blanks (artificial seawater without oil or dispersant in a baffled flask) through testing and analytical procedures. Analyze method blanks with a frequency of at least two per completed test. Oil concentrations in method blanks must be less than detectable limits.


2.10.3 *Accuracy.* Determine accuracy by using a mid-point standard calibration check after each set of replicate samples analyzed. The acceptance criterion is based on a percent recovery of 90-110% using the following equation:




2.10.4 Calibration *QC checks.* Before analyzing samples, the spectrophotometer must meet an instrument stability calibration criterion using the oil standards. The instrument stability for initial calibration is acceptable when the RFs (Equation 5 of this Appendix) for each of the six standard concentration levels are less than 10% different from the overall mean value.

3.0 Dispersant Toxicity Testing


3.1 *Summary.* This laboratory protocol includes testing for: (1) dispersant standard static acute toxicity tests for the mysid shrimp, *Americamysis bahia* (48-hr duration) and the inland silverside, *Menidia beryllina* (96-hr duration); (2) dispersant-oil mixture static acute toxicity tests for *Americamysis bahia* and *Menidia beryllina* (48-hr and 96-hr duration, respectively); (3) dispersant developmental assay for *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus* or *Arbacia punctulata,* (72-hr duration); and (4) dispersant 7-day static subchronic tests with *Americamysis bahia* and *Menidia beryllina* (Table 6 of this Appendix).


3.2 *Preparation of Stock Solutions*

3.2.1 *Dispersant.* Prepare a 1000 µL/L primary stock solution prior to test initiation by adding 1.1 mL of dispersant to 1100 mL of dilution water consisting of salinity adjusted uncontaminated natural or artificial seawater, in a glass vessel. Using a laboratory top stirrer equipped with a stainless-steel blade, center the stirrer blade in the mixing vessel one inch off the bottom. Initially mix the resulting stock solution for approximately five seconds at speeds of <10,000 rpm to avoid foaming. Thereafter, set the speed to provide a 70% vortex. Using a glass pipette, remove appropriate aliquots of stock solution from between the mixing vessel wall and edge of the vortex and place directly into the dilution water within an exposure vessel. Suspend mixing of the stock solution after the removal of each aliquot. Base the preparation of exposure solutions on the nominal concentration of the stock solution and follow procedures outlined in sections 3.5 and 3.6 of this Appendix.


3.2.2 *Dispersant-Reference Oil(s) Mixtures.* Use Strategic Petroleum Reserve Bryan Mound reference oil. To obtain this oil at no charge (except for a minimal shipping fee) see *https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/national-contingency-plan-subpart-j#howto.* Assessment of dispersant-reference oil mixture (DOM) toxicity is determined for each reference oil using the aqueous phase of a chemically enhanced-water accommodated fraction (CE-WAF). Fit a glass aspirator bottle (approximately 23 L) equipped with a hose bib at the base with a length of silicon tubing containing a hose clamp. Fill the bottle with 19L of seawater leaving a 20% headspace above the liquid, place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar. Add the reference oil at 25 g/L using a silicon tube attached to a glass funnel that reaches just below the water surface. Using this method reduces the production of air bubbles on the oil surface slick. Adjust the stir plate to obtain an oil vortex of 25% of the total volume of the seawater, then add the dispersant to be tested at a ratio of 1:10 dispersant:oil (2.5 g/L). Securely seal the bottle to reduce the loss of volatiles using a silicon stopper and wraps of Parafilm and stir for 18 hours, then allow the solution to settle for 6 hours. Maintain the temperature at 25 °C during stirring and settling. Purge the hose at the base of the bottle of any material followed by removal of the CE-WAF (aqueous phase) into a clean glass container without disturbing the surface oil slick. The CE-WAF should be remixed and 1 to 2 L removed for chemical analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) following the procedures outlined in section 3.4 of this Appendix. The remaining volume will be used for the preparation of exposure solutions following procedures outlined in section 3.3 of this Appendix. To reduce time and cost, mix sufficient amounts of dispersant product-reference oil mixture CE-WAF to allow preparation of exposure solutions for conducting simultaneous acute tests with both *Americamysis bahia* and *Menidia beryllina.*

3.3 *Preparation of Exposure Concentrations.*

3.3.1 *Concentration Selection.* Preliminary rangefinder tests may be necessary using a series of logarithmic concentrations (*e.g.* 0.1, 1, 10, 100 µl dispersant product/L or mg TPH/L) to determine the appropriate exposure concentration range necessary to determine LC_50_ values and 95% confidence intervals. For definitive tests, conduct a minimum of five test concentrations using a geometric ratio between 1.5 and 2.0 (*e.g.* 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32). Note that when testing only the dispersant product, the highest test concentration must not exceed the dispersant's self-dispersibility limit.


3.3.2 *Exposure Concentrations.* Exposure solutions are prepared by adding the appropriate amount of stock solution directly to dilution water in each test chamber. Mix each exposure solution using five rotations in one direction followed by five rotations in the opposite direction using a solid glass stir rod.


3.3.3 *Reference Toxicants.* Separate toxicity tests must be performed with a reference toxicant for each species tested. Conduct additional reference toxicity tests any time a change in the population or source of a test species occurs. Use sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), also known as dodecyl sodium sulfate (DSS), and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as the reference toxicant for exposures conducted with *Menidia beryllina* and *Americamysis bahia.* Use copper chloride as the reference toxicant for exposures conducted with the sea urchin developmental test. Use reagent grade quality SDS and copper chloride for tests. Information on procedures for conducting reference toxicant tests with these species can be found in the specific EPA methods documents cited in sections 3.5.1, 3.6.1, and 3.7.1 of this Appendix.


3.4 *Chemical Analysis of Stock Solutions.* Add the 1 L sample of CE-WAF (Section 3.2.2 of this Appendix) solutions directly to amber glass bottles with Teflon®-lined cap. Collect a replicate sample in the event of accidental loss or if reanalysis of the stock solution becomes necessary. Adjust sample to a pH=2 using 50% hydrochloric acid, immediately refrigerate and analyze within 48 hours of collection. Analyze samples for C9-C32 TPH by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) following EPA SW-846, Method 8015B-DRO (4). Report TPH concentration of stock solutions as milligrams TPH/L and use in the calculation of exposure concentrations for all toxicity tests conducted with CE-WAF.


3.5 *Static Acute Tests with M. beryllina and A. bahia*

3.5.1 *General.* Use EPA's *Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms* (EPA-821-R-02-012) (1) for testing each species separately with dispersant product or a mixture of dispersant product and reference oil (DOM).


3.5.2 *Test Solutions.* Modify procedures in EPA-821-R-02-012 specifically dealing with the handling and toxicity testing of effluents or receiving water samples as follows: Prepare stock solutions following section 3.2 of this Appendix and exposure concentrations following section 3.3 of this Appendix.

3.6.5 *Exposure Duration and Test Endpoint.* Examine the effects of the dispersant product on normal development of sea urchin embryos over a period of 72 hours. An IC_50_ (the exposure concentration at which normal development is inhibited in 50% of the embryos) with 95% confidence intervals are to be determined in place of an IC_25._ The concentration of dispersant causing inhibition of development in 50% of exposed embryos (IC_50_) with the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals (LCI_95_ and ULCI_95_) must be calculated at the end of the exposure period. Mortality determinations are not required.

4.1 *Summary.* This laboratory protocol includes testing for: (1) saltwater standard static acute toxicity tests for test products with the mysid shrimp, *Americamysis bahia* (48-hr duration) and the inland silverside, *Menidia beryllina* (96-hr duration); and (2) freshwater standard static acute toxicity tests for test products with the daphnid, *Ceriodaphnia dubia* (48-hr duration) and the fathead minnow, *Pimephales promelas* (96-hr duration) (see Table 8 of this Appendix).


4.2 *Dilution Water.* Use Section 7 of EPA's *Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms* (EPA-821-R-02-012) [1] for preparation of the appropriate dilution water for each species tested. Use of clean natural or synthetic seawater for tests conducted with saltwater species is acceptable.


4.3 *Preparation of Stock Solutions.*

4.3.1 Liquid *Surface Washing Agents and/or Herding Agents.* Prepare a 1000 µL/L stock solution prior to test initiation by adding 1.1 mL of test product to 1100 mL of dilution water in a glass vessel. Place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar and adjust the stir plate to obtain a vortex of 25% of the total volume of the liquid. Mix the resulting stock solution for approximately five minutes at room temperature. Using a glass pipette, remove appropriate aliquots of stock solution from between the mixing vessel wall and edge of the vortex and place directly into the dilution water within an exposure vessel. Base the preparation of exposure solutions on the nominal concentration of the stock solution and follow procedures outlined in sections 4.6 and/or 4.7 of this Appendix, as appropriate.


4.3.2 *Bioremediation Agents.* For products consisting of two or more liquid and/or solid components, prepare the product following the manufacturers recommended procedure and ensure the test product mixture is completely blended. Prepare a 1000 µL/L stock solution prior to test initiation by adding 1.1 mL of the test product mixture to 1100 mL of dilution water in a glass vessel. Place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar and adjust the stir plate to obtain a vortex of 25% of the total volume of the liquid. Mix the resulting stock solution for approximately five minutes at room temperature. Using a glass pipette, remove appropriate aliquots of stock solution from between the mixing vessel wall and edge of the vortex and place directly into the dilution water within an exposure vessel. Base the preparation of exposure solutions on the nominal concentration of the stock solution and follow procedures outlined in sections 4.5 and/or 4.6 of this Appendix, as appropriate.


4.3.3 *Solid Phase Products.* Assessment of the toxicity of solidifiers and other solid phase products are determined using the aqueous phase of water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of the test product. Fit a glass aspirator bottle (approximately 23L) equipped with a hose bib at the base with a length of silicon tubing containing a hose clamp. Fill the bottle with 19L of dilution water leaving a 20% headspace above the liquid, place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar. Add the test product at 25 g/L and securely seal the bottle using a silicon stopper and wraps of parafilm. Adjust the stir plate to obtain a vortex of 25% of the total fluid volume, stir for 18 hours then settle for 6 hours. Maintain the temperature at 25 °C during stirring and settling. Purge the hose at the base of the bottle of any material followed by removal of the WAF (aqueous phase) into a clean glass container without disturbing the product on the surface. The WAF should be remixed and used for the preparation of exposure solutions following procedures outlined in section 4.4 of this Appendix.


4.4 *Preparation of Exposure Concentrations.*

4.4.1 *Concentration Selection.* Preliminary rangefinder tests may be necessary using a series of logarithmic concentrations (*e.g.* 0.1, 1, 10, 100 µl test product/L) to determine the appropriate exposure concentration range necessary to determine LC_50_ values and 95% confidence intervals. For definitive tests, conduct a minimum of five test concentrations using a geometric ratio between 1.5 and 2.0 (*e.g.* 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32). Note that when testing the product, the highest test concentration should not exceed the test product's self-dispersibility limit.


4.4.2 *Exposure Concentrations.* Exposure solutions are prepared by adding the appropriate amount of stock solution directly to dilution water in each test chamber. Mix each exposure solution using five rotations in one direction followed by five rotations in the opposite direction using a solid glass stir rod.


4.4.3 *Reference Toxicants.* Separate toxicity tests must be performed with a reference toxicant for each species tested. Conduct additional reference toxicity tests any time a change in the culture population or source of a test species occurs. Use reagent grade quality sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), also known as dodecyl sodium sulfate (DSS), and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as the reference toxicant. Information on procedures for conducting reference toxicant tests with these species can be found in section 4 of EPA's *Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms* (EPA-821-R-02-012) (3).

5.0 *Bioremediation Agent Efficacy Test Protocol*

5.1 *Summary.* This protocol quantifies changes in weathered Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil composition of alkanes and aromatics resulting from the use of a bioremediation agent in either artificial seawater or freshwater. The manufacturer may test either one or both freshwater or saltwater, depending on the product's intended use. Biodegradation of the alkanes and aromatics is monitored for 28 days at 20-23 °C. Product flasks at Day 28 are compared to Day 0 flasks to determine reductions in alkanes and aromatics. A positive control of a known oil-degrading bacterial consortium supplied by EPA is tested. A negative, sterile control is also set up containing exposure water, weathered crude oil, product, and a sterilant, sodium azide. The purpose of the negative, killed control is to make sure the disappearance of the oil constituents at day 28 is due to biodegradation and not some physical loss such as volatilization. The day 28 GC/MS results from the killed control must not be less than 90% of the day 0 results. The sample preparation procedure extracts the oil phase into the solvent dichloromethane (DCM) (also known as methylene chloride) with a subsequent solvent exchange into hexane. The hexane extracts are analyzed by a high-resolution gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) operated in the selected ion monitoring mode (SIM) at a scan rate of >5 scans per second.


*Note to 5.1:* Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil is artificially weathered by distillation at 521 °F (272 °C) to remove the low molecular weight hydrocarbons to approximate natural weathering processes that occur after a spill.

5.2.12 Fixed Rotor Centrifuge.


5.3 *Reagents and consortium medium.*

5.3.1 *Stock Seawater Preparation.* Prepare the artificial seawater GP2 (modified from Spotte *et al.,* 1984) following the procedures in section 2.3 of this Appendix, to obtain the final concentration of the salts listed in Table 1 of this Appendix, except for the sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO_3_) which is prepared separately. Autoclave the artificial seawater. Filter sterilize the concentrated solution of sodium bicarbonate through a 0.45 µm membrane filter and add to the autoclaved and cooled artificial seawater GP2 to obtain the final concentration listed in Table 1 of this Appendix.


5.3.2 *Seawater for the positive control flasks.* Prepare sodium triphosphate (a.k.a., sodium tripolyphosphate) (Na_5_P_3_O_10_), potassium nitrate (KNO_3_), and ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl_3_ · 6H_2_O) as a concentrated solution. Filter sterilize through a 0.45 µm membrane filter and add to autoclaved artificial seawater to obtain the final nutrient concentrations listed in Table 10 of this Appendix. Calibrate the pH meter at room temperature (approximately 20-23 °C) using commercial buffers of pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0, as appropriate, prior to use. Adjust the pH of the artificial seawater with concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) or 10 normality sodium hydroxide (10 N NaOH), as appropriate.


5.3.3 Seawater for bioremediation agents that do not include nutrients. If a bioremediation agent contains living microorganisms but not nutrients (or limiting concentrations of nutrients), then nutrients may be added by the manufacturer. However, the total concentration of the nutrients added to the bioremediation agent must not exceed the final concentrations listed in Table 11 of this Appendix.


5.3.4 *Freshwater Preparation.* The artificial freshwater, which is a modification of Bushnell-Haas medium (Haines *et al.,* 2005), is prepared following the concentrations listed in Table 12 of this Appendix and then autoclaved. The pH is adjusted to 7.4 before autoclaving. Constituents removed from the original formulation are KNO_3_, K_2_HPO4 and KH_2_PO_4_.


5.3.5 *Freshwater for the positive control.* To prepare the freshwater for the positive controls, prepare the nutrients potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4), potassium phosphate dibasic (K2HPO4) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) as a concentrated solution. Filter sterilize and add to autoclaved artificial freshwater to obtain the final concentrations given in Table 13 of this Appendix. Calibrate the pH meter at room temperature (approximately 20-23 °C) using commercial buffers of pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0, as appropriate, prior to use. Adjust the pH of the artificial freshwater to 7.4 with 1 N HCl or 1 N NaOH, as appropriate.


5.3.6 *Freshwater for bioremediation agents that contain living microorganisms but not nutrients or limiting concentrations of nutrients.* If a bioremediation agent does not include nutrients, then nutrients may be added. However, the total concentration of the nutrients added to the bioremediation agent must not exceed the final concentrations provided in Table 14 of this Appendix.


5.3.7 *Oil Preparation.* The test oil, weathered ANS521 crude oil, can be obtained from EPA at no charge (except for a minimal shipping fee). See *https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/national-contingency-plan-subpart-j#howto* for more information.


5.3.8 *Sodium azide sterilant.* Prepare a stock solution of NaN_3_ for addition to the negative killed control. The final concentration in the killed controls will be 0.5 g/L.


5.4 *Experimental Setup and Procedure*

5.4.1 Autoclave clean borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) for 20 minutes at 121 °C at 15 psig.


5.4.2 Label flasks with the appropriate code (negative control, positive control, or product; day to be sampled (0 or 28); letter indicating replicate number) to reflect the following treatment design in Table 15 of this Appendix:


5.4.3 Aseptically dispense 100 mL of pre-sterilized artificial exposure water (seawater or freshwater) into each sterile flask. For the positive control flasks, use exposure water containing nutrients.


5.4.4 Tare the labeled flasks containing exposure water and other additions, as necessary, on the balance with a minimum accuracy of 0.01 g. Add drop-wise 0.50 g oil (this results in a final oil concentration of 5 g/L) using a sterile Pasteur pipette to the center of the flask taking care to avoid splashing the oil onto the sides of the flasks. Record the precise weight. ANS521 may be previously warmed in a hot water bath at 60 °C for 40-60 minutes to facilitate its flow. Take precautions when handling and charging the flasks to minimize the likelihood of contamination by exogenous microbes, including using a new sterile pipette for each series of flasks.


5.4.5 Preparation of the EPA consortium for both the positive control flasks and the flasks containing non-living bio-stimulation products. Use the supplied vials containing approximately 5 mL of the known EPA consortium frozen in glycerol. Thaw the supplied vials at room temperature (*do not allow cultures preserved in glycerol to sit at room temperature past thawing*), transfer the contents of the thawed vials to a single sterile centrifuge tube, rinse tubes with two volumes each of sterile exposure water, centrifuge at between 6,000- and 7,000-times gravity (6,000-7,000 × *g*) for 15 minutes using a fixed rotor to fully pellet the cells. Carefully resuspend the cell pellet in sterile exposure water using the appropriate volume to achieve the desired seeding density, which will be provided by EPA upon shipment of the consortium.


5.4.6 Positive control flasks contain exposure water, oil, nutrients, and the EPA consortium.


5.4.7 Negative killed control flasks for all products shall contain exposure water, oil, product, the EPA consortium for products not containing a living culture, and the sodium azide sterilant at a final concentration of 0.5 g/L. Add the sodium azide sterilant prior to adding any product or EPA consortium. For the negative killed control flasks and product flasks, prepare and add the product to the flasks in a concentration specified by the manufacturer or vendor.


5.4.8 For non-living products that contain nutrient only, use the EPA consortium as the inoculum.


5.4.9 For other non-living products (*e.g.,* enzymes), do not add nutrients or the EPA consortium as the inoculum as they are not needed.


5.4.10 For products containing living microorganisms, prepare 6 flasks the same way as in Steps a-d, but without the EPA consortium. A product that contains its own nutrients must not be amended with nutrients, unless the product contains insufficient nutrients. Since this is a closed flask test, nutrients could be limiting if they are at the same concentration as used in the field. This could cause the product to fail the test. Thus, the manufacturer has the option to supplement its product with a higher concentration of nutrients than that contained in the product. Any nutrient supplements to a product must be reported and must not exceed the concentration limits in Table 10 (for seawater) and 13 (for freshwater) of this Appendix, as applicable.


5.4.11 Cap all flasks either with sterile cotton stoppers or loosely applied aluminum foil to allow gas exchange with the atmosphere. Set aside the T = 0 flasks for immediate extraction and analysis. Place the rest of the flasks onto the orbital shaker table. Do not tip the flasks excessively to avoid stranding oil above the mixing area of the flask. Set the orbital shaker to 200 rpm and shake the flasks for 28 days at 20-23 °C in the dark.


5.4.12 Submit all information on added microorganisms and nutrients for testing in the data report.


5.5 *Sampling and Chemical Analysis.*

5.5.1 *Summary.* At each sampling event (Days 0 and 28), product and control flasks are sacrificed for analysis of residual oil concentrations (SOP 4 of this Appendix). Record all physical observations for each flask (such as degree of emulsification, whether the oil has congealed into tar balls, wall growth, color, etc.) at each sampling. The analytical procedure is summarized in Table 16 of this Appendix. Dichloromethane (DCM) is the solvent used for the initial extraction. Solvent-exchange the extract into hexane prior to injection into the gas chromatograph. The solvent exchange is done to prevent asphaltenes from contaminating the column.


5.5.2 *Hydrocarbon Extraction.* To measure extraction efficiency, 200 µL of the 400 mg/L surrogate recovery standard (compounds and concentrations described in SOP 1 in this Appendix) is added to each flask. Add 50 mL DCM to each flask. Transfer the contents to a 250 mL separatory funnel and shake for 2 minutes; allow the phases to separate for 2 minutes. If an emulsion remains after 2 minutes, centrifuge the emulsion in Teflon® centrifuge tubes for at least ten minutes in a low-speed centrifuge at 3,000 times gravity (3,000 × *g*) to break the emulsion and recover the DCM phase. Pass the DCM extract through a funnel plugged with glass wool and containing approximately 20 g anhydrous, granular sodium sulfate (Na_2_SO_4_) to remove water. Repeat the steps above two more times with 25 mL DCM each (100 mL DCM used in total). Add 10 mL DCM on to the sodium sulfate after the third extraction to rinse off any oil residue. Collect the extract in 125 mL serum vials, capped with Teflon lined septa and aluminum crimp seals, and store at 4 °C for up to 6 months.


5.5.3 *Solvent Exchange.* Perform a solvent exchange (DCM to hexane) prior to GC/MS analysis to prevent injection of asphaltenes into the GC/MS column. Transfer the DCM extract to concentration tubes. Place the tubes in a 29 °C water bath under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Reduce the sample to 1 mL and transfer the extract to a 10 mL volumetric flask. Rinse the concentration tube with hexane and add it to the volumetric flask 2 times. Adjust the final volume with hexane to 10 mL.


5.5.4 *Hydrocarbon Analysis.* Quantify the concentrations of 25 alkanes, 32 aromatics and hopane (SOP 4, Table SOP 4.4 of this Appendix) using an Agilent 6890 GC/5973 MS or equivalent equipped with a 30-m × 0.25-mm ID × 0.25-µm film thickness DB-5 or equivalent fused silica column. To prepare the samples, transfer 1.0 mL of the hexane extract into a 2 mL autosampler vial with Teflon lined cap. Add 20 µL of internal standard solution to each vial with a syringe or positive displacement pipettor. SOP 2 of this Appendix outlines the procedure for preparing the internal standard solution. Load vials onto the autosampler tray and analyze in selected ion monitoring mode (SIM). Sum the individual alkane concentrations for the total alkane concentration and the individual aromatic concentrations for total aromatic concentrations in each flask.


5.6 *Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC).*

5.6.1 *Objectives.* The critical variables to be analyzed for each set of experimental conditions are the individual petroleum hydrocarbons, *i.e.,* the alkanes ranging in carbon number from nC-14 to nC-35, plus pristane and phytane, and the 2- to 4-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologs as listed in SOP 4 of this Appendix. The quality assurance objectives for precision, accuracy, and detection limits are ±20%, 75-125% recovery, and 22.5 µg/L on average for the 58 compounds, respectively. For more details, refer to the SOPs of this Appendix.


5.6.2 *Precision Objectives.* Precision is presented as relative percent difference (RPD) for duplicate measurements and as relative standard deviation (RSD, or coefficient of variance) for triplicate measurements, applicable to replication of treatments as separate samples.


5.6.3 *Accuracy Objectives.* These are based on the check standards and standard oil samples run concurrently with the sample analyses for GC/MS analysis of critical compounds. Critical compounds in the check standards and in the oil standards must fall within 75-125% of expected values for the analysis to be valid. Six surrogate compounds (SOP 1 of this Appendix) added to each sample before extraction can also serve as a surrogate for determining accuracy. The measured surrogate concentrations must fall within 75-125% of expected values.


5.6.4 *Calibration Range.* Conduct all measurements within the linear calibration range of the instrument. The calibrated concentration range for GC/MS analysis is 0.1 mg/L to 30 mg/L. If the measured concentration of any critical compound is above the calibration range, dilute the sample and re-analyze to quantify that particular compound within the linear calibration range.


5.6.5 *Quality Control.* Table 17 of this Appendix summarizes the QC checks for each measurement. See the corresponding SOP in this Appendix for detailed descriptions of QC checks, frequency, acceptance criteria, and corrective actions.


5.7 *Pass/Fail Criteria.*

5.7.1 Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the hopane-normalized total aromatics (sum of all resolved aromatics) and hopane-normalized total alkane concentrations (sum of all resolved alkanes) from the 6 independent replicates at days 0 and 28. To normalize, divide the sum of the alkane analytes and the sum of the aromatic analytes in each replicate by the hopane concentration in the corresponding replicate.


5.7.2 From those data, calculate the 95% Upper Confidence Level (UCL95) at days 0 and 28 using the following formula (Equation 11 of this Appendix):


5.7.3 Using Equation 12 of this Appendix, calculate the % reduction of each oil fraction from day 0 to day 28, using the day 0 and 28 UCL_95_ hopane-normalized values for each fraction:


5.7.4 A product is successful in saltwater or freshwater if the % reduction of total alkanes (aliphatic fraction) from the GC/MS analysis is greater than or equal to 85% and the % reduction of total aromatics (aromatic fraction) is greater than or equal to 35% at day 28 based on the UCL_95_ (Equation 12 of this Appendix). The benchmark reduction ranges in aliphatic and aromatic fractions for the positive control are the same as for the products specified above. The average concentration of the biomarker hopane at day 28 must not differ from the average concentration at day 0 by more than 12% in the positive control. If the conditions for the positive control are not met, the entire procedure must be repeated.


5.8 *Data Verification and Reporting.* GC/MS data files are generated by MS ChemStation software (the Agilent standard software for GC/MS) or equivalent for each injection. Data files contain summed ion chromatograms and selected ion chromatograms. Calibration curves are generated within MS ChemStation software, and all data files are calculated against the calibration curve by MS ChemStation. Data verification would be done by crosschecking between analysts for 10% of the raw data and its reduction process.


5.9 *Laboratory Report.* The summary of findings from a product test must include the data listings for each analyte that was analyzed (*i.e.,* all individual alkanes and aromatics in the list of required analytes), along with QA/QC checks (see Table 17) and instrument detection/reporting limits for each analyte. Express all concentrations as mg analyte/L exposure water.

5.10.3.4 *Quality Control/Quality Assurance:*

5.10.3.4.1 Run the seven standard solutions using the GC/MS method (SOP 4) on a tuned GC/MS. Use the EnviroQuant software or equivalent to calculate the average Relative Response Factor (RRF) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the RRFs for each analyte over the six concentrations. The RRF is defined as:


5.10.3.4.2 The RSD of the RRFs for all analytes must be 25% or less. Alternatively, the coefficients of determination (R2) for the calibration curve for each target compounds and surrogate should be over 0.99.


5.10.4 *SOP 4. GC/MS Method for the Analysis of Crude Oil Samples.*

5.10.4.1 *Instrument Specifications:*

5.10.4.1.1 Use an Agilent 6890 GC coupled with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (MSD) and an Agilent 6890 series auto sampler or equivalent, equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm I.D., and 0.25 µm film thickness) or equivalent, and a split/splitless injection port operating in the splitless mode. Data acquisition occurs in the SIM (selected ion monitoring) mode for quantitative analysis. In SIM mode, the dwell time of each ion is set to be 10 milliseconds and the ions are split up into groups by retention time. One way to divide the ions is by retention time grouping as shown in Table SOP 4.1 of this Appendix. The number of ions in each ion group must be constant, yielding the same scan rate for each group.


5.10.4.1.2 Table SOP 4.2 of this Appendix summarizes the instrumental conditions for crude oil analysis. Use only ultra-high purity helium (99.999% pure) as the carrier gas. In series, connect a moisture trap, an oxygen trap, and an organic trap to the carrier gas line before it enters the column.


5.10.4.2 *Procedure for preparing the instrument:*

5.10.4.2.1 Lower the injection port temperature and the oven temperature to 50 °C or less to avoid oxidation of the column.


5.10.4.2.2 Replace the liner with a clean, silanized liner. Do not touch the liner with bare fingers. A small piece of muffled glass wool may be inserted to protect the column.


5.10.4.2.3 Return the injection port and oven to the appropriate temperatures.


5.10.4.2.4 Wait five minutes after the temperature equilibrates before using the instrument.


5.10.4.3 *Procedure for tuning the MSD:*

5.10.4.3.1 Perform an air/water check. The value reported for the relative abundance of water (m/z 18), nitrogen (m/z 28), oxygen (m/z 32), or carbon dioxide (m/z 44) shall be less than 5% of the base peak for the system to be considered leak free and are expected to be closed to 1% for a stable system.


5.10.4.3.2 Tune the MSD using the Standard Autotune program and the decafluorotriphenylphosphine (DFTPP) Tune program to reduce instrument variability. The Autotune report file is referenced by the instrument when performing an air/water check and thus must be run at least once per month. Run standards and samples using DFTPP Tune parameters, and retune the instrument using DFTPP Tune at least once per week. The tune programs use three fragment ions of perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) as a standard for tuning: m/z 69, 219, and 502. Tune reports must meet the following criteria:


5.10.4.3.2.1 Symmetrical peaks;


5.10.4.3.2.2 Mass assignments within ±0.2 amu's from 69, 219, and 502;


5.10.4.3.2.3 Peak widths within 0.5 ± 0.1 amu's;


5.10.4.3.2.4 Relative abundance is 100% for ion 69, at least 35% for ion 219, and at least 1% for ion 502;


5.10.4.3.2.5 Relative abundances for isotope masses 70, 220, and 503 ± 0.2 amu's are 0.5-1.5%, 2-8%, and 5-15%, respectively; and


5.10.4.3.2.6 Air and water peaks at m/z = 18, 28, 32, and 44 amu's must be very small and consistent with historical values.


5.10.4.4 *Maintaining a log book.* Maintain an instrument log book, and make entries for each use. Include the following information in the logbook: operator name, helium cylinder tank pressure and outlet pressure, vacuum gauge reading, any maintenance performed on the instrument (such as changing the injection port liner, gold seal, guard column, source cleaning), sequence name, data path, samples in order of injection, method information, GC column number, and the Standard Auto Tune report and DFTPP Tune report.


5.10.4.5 *Running a Solvent Blank:* Following a liner change or at the start of a new run, run an injection of a pure solvent to confirm that the system is free of excessive or interfering contamination. Analyze the solvent in SCAN mode using the same temperature program used for sample analysis. If contamination is present, analyze additional samples of fresh solvent until the interfering contamination is removed.


5.10.4.6 *Checking the DFTPP Tune:* Prior to running the first calibration standard, verify the instrument tune conditions by running a 10 ng/µL DFTPP check standard to check the mass measuring accuracy of the MS, the resolution sensitivity, the baseline threshold, and the ion abundance ranges. Run the standard using the DFTPP method provided with the instrument. Each of the criteria identified in Table SOP 4.2 of this Appendix must be met before using the instrument for analysis:


5.10.4.7 Calibrating *with a Multiple-Point Calibration Curve.* A 5- or 6-point calibration curve is obtained by running 5 or 6 working standards (see SOP 3) on the tuned GC/MS instrument. Calculate the relative response factor (RRF) for each compound relative to its corresponding deuterated internal standard as indicated in Table SOP 4.3 of this Appendix. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the RRFs for each compound must be less than 25%. Run an independently prepared check standard immediately after the calibration standards to validate the accuracy of the calibration curve.


5.10.4.8 *Running Samples.* Once the calibration curve has been validated, samples can be analyzed. Dispense 1,000 µL of sample extract into labeled auto-sampler vials. Add 20 µL of the internal standard solution (see SOP 2 of this Appendix) to the extract using a syringe or a positive displacement pipettor. Run a check standard every 10 samples to ensure the consistency of the instrument. The RRF for each compound in the check standard must be within 25% of the average RRF obtained in the initial calibration.


5.10.4.9 *Quantification:* Once a calibration table has been generated, quantify each data file using the “Calculate and Generate” function in the MS ChemStation software, or equivalent software. Review individual peak integration manually to ensure proper baseline integration. The quantification of a compound is based on the peak area of the primary ion (Q Ion) indicated in Table SOP 4.4 of this Appendix.


5.10.4.10 Equation 14 of this Appendix is used to calculate the concentration of analytes in units of µg/g oil added:


5.10.4.11 If some analytes are not commercially available, the RRFs of other compounds (usually the parent compound) are used to quantify those analytes. For example, the RRF of C3-naphthalene may be used to calculate the concentrations of C3- and C4-naphthalenes. See Table SOP 4.4 of this Appendix for details. The quantification of these alkylated PAHs is relative because it is assumed that the molecular ions of the alkylated PAHs have the same RRFs as the parent compound ions. Nevertheless, these relative concentrations are useful for monitoring the fate of these compounds during the course of any analysis, as long as their concentrations are measured in a consistent way throughout the analysis.


5.10.4.12 Concentration calculations for all target compounds are performed using EnviroQuant software or equivalent. Data for each sample can be printed directly using a customized report template. Data can also be automatically entered into a spreadsheet within the EnviroQuant software.


5.10.5 *Quality Assurance/Quality Control.* The following criteria must be met before any samples are analyzed:


5.10.5.1 Air/water check to verify the system is leak free.


5.10.5.2 AutoTune and DFTPP Tune pass all criteria.


5.10.5.3 DFTPP check standard passes all criteria.


5.10.5.4 Solvent blank scan indicates the GC/MS system is free of interfering contamination.


5.10.5.5 Prepare and monitor a control chart of a standard oil analysis. Concentrations of the analytes in the control chart must be no more than 25% different from their historical averages.


5.10.5.6 Relative response factors for analytes in the check standards inserted between every 10 samples must be no more than 25 percent different from the average RRF of those same analytes in the calibration curve. Peak shapes must be symmetrical.
