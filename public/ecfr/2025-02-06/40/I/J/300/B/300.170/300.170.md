# ยง 300.170   Federal agency participation.

Federal agencies listed in ยง 300.175 have duties established by statute, executive order, or Presidential directive which may apply to federal response actions following, or in prevention of, the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.

(1) Make necessary information available to the Secretary of the NRT, RRTs, Area Committees, and OSCs/RPMs.


(2) Provide representatives to the NRT and RRTs and otherwise assist RRTs and OSCs, as necessary, in formulating RCPs and ACPs.


(3) Inform the NRT, RRTs, and Area Committees, consistent with national security considerations, of changes in the availability of resources that would affect the operations implemented under the NCP.
