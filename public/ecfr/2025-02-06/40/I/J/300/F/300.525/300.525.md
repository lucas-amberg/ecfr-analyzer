# ยง 300.525   State involvement in removal actions.

(a) States may undertake Fund-financed removal actions pursuant to a cooperative agreement with EPA. State-lead removal actions taken pursuant to cooperative agreements must be conducted in accordance with ยง 300.415 on removal actions, and 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.
