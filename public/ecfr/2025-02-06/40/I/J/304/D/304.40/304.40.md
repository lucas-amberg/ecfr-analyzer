(c)(1) If any award made in the final decision is not paid within the time required by ยง 304.33(f) of this part, the final decision may be enforced as a settlement under section 122(h) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(h), by the Attorney General on behalf of EPA in any appropriate Federal district court pursuant to section 122(h)(3) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(h)(3). Pursuant to section 122(h)(3) of CERCLA, the terms of the final decision shall not be subject to review in any such action.

(2) Take further response action at the facility concerned pursuant to CERCLA or any other applicable statute, regulation or legal theory; or
