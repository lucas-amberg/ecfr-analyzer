# Appendix C to Part 307—Notice of Limitations on the Payment of Claims for Response Actions, Which Is To Be Placed in the Federal Register Preamble Whenever Sites Are Added to the Final NPL


*Limitations on the Payment of Claims for Response Actions*

Sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) of CERCLA authorize the Fund to reimburse certain parties for necessary costs of performing a response action. As is described in more detail at 58 FR 5460, Jan. 21, 1993, 40 CFR part 307, there are two major limitations placed on the payment of claims for response actions. First, only private parties, certain potentially responsible parties (including States and political subdivisions), and certain foreign entities are eligible to file such claims. Second, all response actions under sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) must receive prior approval, or “preauthorization,” from EPA.
