The application shall also include a discussion of pertinent Federal and State guidance, advisories, and criteria;

(g) Claims of business confidentiality may be asserted for information submitted to EPA under this subpart. Information claimed confidential will be disclosed by EPA only to the extent permitted by CERCLA, this subpart, and part 2, subpart B, of this chapter.


(1) Any claim of business confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Claims must be asserted as prescribed on the forms. Items claimed confidential on the forms and attachments to the forms must be clearly marked by circling or bracketing them.

(i) One copy of the submittal must be complete, with items claimed confidential clearly marked in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(ii) The second copy must be complete except that all information claimed as confidential in the first copy must be deleted. EPA may make this second copy available to the public.


(iii) If the applicant does not provide a redacted copy, the application for preauthorization is incomplete. If the claimant does not provide a redacted copy, the claim against the Fund will not be perfected by EPA. EPA will not process such submittals until it receives the redacted copy.


(3) If a submitter of a response claim or an application for preauthorization does not assert a claim of business confidentiality for information at the time the information is submitted to EPA, the Agency may make the information public without further notice to the submitter.

(1) A copy of the settlement agreement, or the most recent draft of any pending agreement, reached between such parties and the Federal Government; and


(2) If the application is to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study, an affirmation that the applicant will not directly or indirectly benefit from the preauthorization as a response action contractor, or as a person hired or retained by such a contractor with respect to the site at issue and an agreement to reimburse the Fund for any costs incurred under, or in connection with, the oversight contract or arrangement for the remedial investigation and feasibility study.


(i) If it is subsequently determined that the preauthorized response actions require modification or if it appears that project costs will exceed approved costs, a revised application for preauthorization must be approved by EPA before different, or additional, actions can be undertaken, if such actions are to be eligible for compensation from the Fund.


(j) Unless otherwise specified and agreed to by EPA, the terms, provisions, or requirements of a court judgment, Consent Decree, administrative order (whether unilateral or on consent), or any other consensual agreement with EPA requiring a response action do not constitute preauthorization to present a claim to the Fund.
