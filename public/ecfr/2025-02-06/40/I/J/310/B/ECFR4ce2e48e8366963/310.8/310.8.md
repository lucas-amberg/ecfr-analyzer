# ยง 310.8   Can EPA reimburse the entire cost of my response?

Possibly not. EPA can only reimburse you for temporary emergency measures you take in response to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. The statute allows reimbursement for only certain costs, and by statute, the total amount of the reimbursement may not exceed $25,000 for a single response.
