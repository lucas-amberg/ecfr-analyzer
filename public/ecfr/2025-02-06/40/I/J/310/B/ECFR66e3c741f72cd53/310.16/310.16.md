(b) Specify the local agency that incurred the cost, (such as, the Town Fire Department, the County Health Department, or the City Department of Public Works);


(c) Include invoices, sales receipts, rental or leasing agreements, or other proof of costs you incurred; and


(d) Certify that all costs are accurate and that you incurred them specifically for the response for which you are requesting reimbursement.
