# ยง 310.19   Under what conditions would EPA deny my request?

We may deny your reimbursement request in full or in part if:


(a) Your records, documents, or other evidence are not maintained according to generally accepted accounting principles and practices consistently applied;


(b) The costs you claim are NOT reasonable or allowable, that is, they are higher than what a careful person would spend for similar products or services in your area; or


(c) You do not supply additional information within one year from when we request it; and


(d) Reimbursement would be inconsistent with CERCLA section 123, or the regulations in this part.
