# ยง 355.16   How do I determine the quantity of extremely hazardous substances present for certain forms of solids?

For the three forms of solids that are listed in ยง 355.15(a)(1) through (3), use these instructions to determine the quantity of extremely hazardous substance present:


(a) *Solid in powdered form with a particle size less than 100 microns.* Multiply the weight percent of solid with a particle size less than 100 microns in a particular container by the total weight of solid in the container.


(b) *Solid in solution.* Multiply the weight percent of the non-reactive solid in solution in a particular container by the total weight of solution in that container. Then multiply by 0.2.


(c) *Solid in molten form.* Multiply the weight of the non-reactive solid in molten form by 0.3.
