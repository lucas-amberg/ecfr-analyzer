# ยง 370.14   How do I report mixtures containing hazardous chemicals?

(a) For a mixture containing a hazardous chemical, use the following table to determine if a reporting threshold is equaled or exceeded, and to determine how to report:


(b) For each specific mixture, the reporting option used must be consistent for both MSDS (or SDS) and inventory reporting, unless it is not possible to do so. This means that if you report on a specific mixture as a whole for MSDS (or SDS) reporting, you must report on that mixture as a whole for inventory reporting too (unless it is not possible). MSDS (or SDS) reporting and inventory reporting are discussed in detail in subpart C of this part.


(c) To determine the quantity of an EHS or a non-EHS hazardous chemical component present in a mixture, multiply the concentration of the hazardous chemical component (in weight percent) by the weight of the mixture (in pounds). You do not have to count a hazardous chemical present in a mixture if the concentration is less than or equal to 1%, or less than or equal to 0.1% for a carcinogenic chemical.
