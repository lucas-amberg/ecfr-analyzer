Section 310 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), authorizes civil actions by any person to enforce the Act. These civil actions may be brought against any person (including the United States, and any other governmental instrumentality or agency, to the extent permitted by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution), that is alleged to become effective pursuant to the Act (including any provision of an agreement under section 120 of the Act, relating to Federal facilities); and against the President or any other officer of the United States (including the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry) where there is alleged a failure to perform any act or duty under this Act, which is not discretionary with the President or such other officer, including an act or duty under section 120 of the Act (relating to Federal facilities), but not including any act or duty under section 311 of the Act (relating to research, development, and demonstration). These civil actions under section 310 of the Act are to be filed in accordance with the rules of the district court in which the action is instituted. The purpose of this part is to prescribe procedures governing the notice requirements of subsections (d) and (e) of section 310 of the Act as a prerequisite to the commencement of such actions.
