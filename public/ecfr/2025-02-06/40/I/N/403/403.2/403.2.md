By establishing the responsibilities of government and industry to implement National Pretreatment Standards this regulation fulfills three objectives:


(a) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into POTWs which will interfere with the operation of a POTW, including interference with its use or disposal of municipal sludge;


(b) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into POTWs which will pass through the treatment works or otherwise be incompatible with such works; and


(c) To improve opportunities to recycle and reclaim municipal and industrial wastewaters and sludges.
