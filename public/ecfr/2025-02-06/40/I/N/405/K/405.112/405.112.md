(b) For whey condensing plants with 300,000 lb/day or less of raw fluid whey input (less than 20,700 lb/day of solids or 14,160 lb/day of BOD*5* input).


(c) For plants in the size range covered in paragraph (b) once-through barometric condenser water may be discharged untreated if the composite net entrainment is below 15 mg/1 of BOD*5* for any one day and below 10 mg/1 of BOD*5* as the average for thirty consecutive days.
