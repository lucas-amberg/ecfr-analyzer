The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the processing of bottom fish outside of Alaska in which the unit operations are carried out predominately through manual methods.

The provisions of this subpart apply to the processing of currently, commercially processed species of bottom fish such as flounder, ocean perch, haddock, cod, sea catfish, sole, halibut, and rockfish. These provisions apply to existing facilities processing more than 1816 kg (4000 lbs) of raw material per day on any day during a calendar year and all new sources.
