As used in this subpart:


(a) For the sintering subcategory, the term *product* means sinter agglomerated from iron-bearing materials.


(b) The term *dry air pollution control system* means an emission control system that utilizes filters to remove iron-bearing particles (fines) from blast furnace or sintering off-gases.


(c) The term *minimum level (ML)* means the level at which the analytical system gives recognizable signals and an acceptable calibration point. For 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran, the minimum level is 10 pg/L per EPA Method 1613B for water and wastewater samples.


(d) The *term pg/L* means picograms per liter (ppt = 1.0 ร 10-12 gm/L).


(e) The term *sintering* means a process for agglomerating iron-bearing materials into small pellets (sinter) that can be charged to a blast furnace.


(f) The term *wet air pollution control system* means an emission control system that utilizes water to clean process or furnace off-gases.
