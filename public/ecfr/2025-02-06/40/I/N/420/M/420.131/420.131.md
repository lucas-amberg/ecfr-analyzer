As used in this subpart:


(a) The term *briquetting operations* means a hot or cold process that agglomerates (presses together) iron-bearing materials into small lumps without melting or fusion. Used as a concentrated iron ore substitute for scrap in electric furnaces.


(b) The term *direct-reduced iron (DRI)* means iron produced by reduction of iron ore (pellets or briquettes) using gaseous (carbon monoxide-carbon dioxide, hydrogen) or solid reactants.


(c) The term *forging* means the hot-working of heated steel shapes (e.g., ingots, blooms, billets, slabs) by hammering or hydraulic presses, performed at iron and steel mills.


(d) For briquetting operations, the term product means the amount in tons of briquettes manufactured by hot or cold agglomeration processes.


(e) For direct reduced iron (DRI), the term product means the amount of direct reduced iron and any fines that are produced and sold commercially (as opposed to fines that may be reprocessed on site).


(f) For forging, the term product means the tons of finished steel forgings produced by hot working steel shapes.


(g) The term *O&G (as HEM)* means total recoverable oil & grease measured as n-hexane extractable materials.
