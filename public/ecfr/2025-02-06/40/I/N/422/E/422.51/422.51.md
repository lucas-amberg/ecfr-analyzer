For the purpose of this subpart:


(a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations, and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.


(b) The term *process waste water* means any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product, or waste product. The term “process waste water” does not include contaminated non-process waste water, as defined below.


(c) The term *contaminated nonprocess waste water* shall mean any water including precipitation runoff, which during manufacturing or processing, comes into incidental contact with any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product or waste product by means of:


(1) Precipitation runoff, (2) accidental spills, (3) accidental leaks caused by the failure of process equipment and which are repaired or the discharge of pollutants therefrom contained or terminated within the shortest reasonable time which shall not exceed 24 hours after discovery or when discovery should reasonably have been made, whichever is earliest, and (4) discharges from safety showers and related personal safety equipment, and from equipment washings for the purpose of safe entry, inspection and maintenance; provided that all reasonable measures have been taken to prevent, reduce, eliminate and control to the maximum extent feasible such contact and provided further that all reasonable measures have been taken that will mitigate the effects of such contact once it has occurred.


(d) The term *ten-year 24-hour rainfall event* shall mean the maximum precipitation event with a probable recurrence interval of once in 10 years as defined by the National Weather Service in technical paper no. 40, “Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States,” May 1961, and subsequent amendments or equivalent regional or State rainfall probability information developed therefrom.


(e) The term *25-year 24-hour rainfall event* shall mean the maximum precipitation event with a probable recurrence interval of once in 25 years as defined by the National Weather Service in technical paper no. 40, “Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States,” May 1961, and subsequent amendments or equivalent regional or State rainfall probability information developed therefrom.
