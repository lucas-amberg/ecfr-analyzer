# § 430.25   New source performance standards (NSPS).

New sources subject to this subpart must achieve the following new source performance standards (NSPS), as applicable.


(a) The following standards apply to each new source that commenced discharge after June 15, 1988 and before June 15, 1998, provided that the new source was constructed to meet these standards:


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section—


(1) The following standards apply with respect to each new source fiber line that does not use an exclusively TCF bleaching process, as disclosed by the discharger in its NPDES permit application under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(3) and certified under 40 CFR 122.22, and that commences discharge after June 15, 1998:


(2) The following standards apply with respect to each new source fiber line that uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes, as disclosed by the discharger in its NPDES permit application under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(3) and certified under 40 CFR 122.22, and that commences discharge after June 15, 1998:


(c) With respect to each new source fiber line that is enrolled in the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program, dischargers subject to this section must achieve:


(1) The standards specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (except for AOX) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section, as applicable; and


(2) Standards for filtrates, flow, and AOX:


(d) These additional standards apply to all new sources, regardless of when they commenced discharge, in accordance with the previous subcategorization scheme unless the discharger certifies to the permitting authority that it is not using these compounds as biocides. Also, for non-continuous dischargers, concentration limitations (mg/l) shall apply. Concentration limitations will only apply to non-continuous dischargers:


(e) Pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h), a discharger must demonstrate compliance with the limitations in paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section, as applicable, by monitoring for all pollutants (except for AOX, COD, BOD5, TSS, and pH) at the point where the wastewater containing those pollutants leaves the bleach plant. The permitting authority may impose effluent limitations and/or monitoring requirements on internal wastestreams for any other pollutants covered in this section as appropriate under 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h). In addition, a discharger subject to a limitation on total pulping area condensate, evaporator condensate, and bleach plant wastewater flow under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must demonstrate compliance with that limitation by establishing and maintaining flow measurement equipment monitoring these flows at the point or points where they leave the pulping area, evaporator area, and the bleach plant.
