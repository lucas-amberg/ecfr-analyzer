(a) The following applies to mechanical pulp facilities where pulp and paper at groundwood mills are produced through the application of the thermo-mechanical process; mechanical pulp facilities where the integrated production of pulp and coarse paper, molded pulp products, and newsprint at groundwood mills occurs; and mechanical pulp facilities where the integrated production of pulp and fine paper at groundwood mills occurs: any new source subject to this subpart must achieve the following new source performance standards (NSPS), except that non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations for BOD5 and TSS, but shall be subject to annual average effluent limitations. Also, for non-continuous dischargers, concentration limitations (mg/l) shall apply, where provided. Concentration limitations will only apply to non-continuous dischargers. Pentachlorophenol and trichlorophenol limitations are only applicable at facilities where chlorophenolic-containing biocides are used. Permittees not using chlorophenolic-containing biocides must certify to the permit-issuing authority that they are not using these biocides. Zinc limitations are only applicable at facilities where zinc hydrosulfite is used as a bleaching agent. Permittees not using zinc hydrosulfite as a bleaching agent must certify to the permit issuing authority that they are not using this bleaching compound:
