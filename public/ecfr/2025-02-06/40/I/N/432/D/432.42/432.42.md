# § 432.42   Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BPT:


(a) Facilities that slaughter no more than 50 million pounds per year (in units of LWK) must achieve the following limitations:


(1) In the case of process wastewater associated with the slaughtering of animals on-site or the processing of the carcasses of animals slaughtered on-site: 


(2) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing (defleshing, washing and curing) of hides derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(2) apply.


(3) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing of blood derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(3) apply.


(4) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the wet or low-temperature rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(4) apply.


(5) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with dry rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(5) apply.


(b) Facilities that slaughter more than 50 million pounds per year (in units of LWK) must achieve the following limitations:


(1) All facilities must achieve the following effluent limitations for ammonia (as N): 


(2) In the case of process wastewater associated with the slaughtering of animals on-site or the processing of the carcasses of animals slaughtered on-site, the limitations for BOD_5_, fecal coliform, TSS, and O&G are the same as the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(3) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing (defleshing, washing and curing) of hides derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply.


(4) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing of blood derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply.


(5) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with wet or low-temperature rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section apply.


(6) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the dry rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section apply.
