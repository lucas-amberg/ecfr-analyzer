# § 432.45   New source performance standards (NSPS).

Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any source that is a new source subject to this subpart must achieve the following performance standards:


(a) Facilities that slaughter no more than 50 million pounds per year (in units of LWK) must achieve the following performance standards:


(1) In the case of process wastewater associated with the slaughtering of animals on-site or the processing of the carcasses of animals slaughtered on-site, the standards for BOD_5_, fecal coliform, TSS, and O&G are the same as the limitations specified in § 432.42(a)(1); and standards for ammonia (as N) are as follows: 


(2) In addition to the standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing of blood derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(3) and the standards for ammonia (as N) specified in § 432.15(a)(2) apply.


(3) In addition to the standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the wet or low-temperature rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(4) and the standards for ammonia (as N) specified in § 432.15(a)(3) apply.


(4) In addition to the standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the dry rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(5) and the standards for ammonia (as N) specified in § 432.15(a)(4) apply:


(b) Facilities that slaughter more than 50 million pounds per year (in units of LWK) must achieve the following performance standards:


(1) In the case of process wastewater associated with the slaughtering of animals on-site or the processing of the carcasses of animals slaughtered on-site, the standards for BOD_5_, fecal coliform, TSS, and O&G are the same as the limitations specified in § 432.42(a)(1); and standards for ammonia (as N) and total nitrogen are the same as the limitations specified in § 432.15(b)(1).


(2) In addition to the standards specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing of blood derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the standards for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(3) apply.


(3) In addition to the standards specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the wet or low-temperature rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the standards for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(4) apply in addition to the standards specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(4) In addition to the standards specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the dry rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the standards for BOD_5_ and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(5) apply.


(c) Any source that was a new source subject to the standards specified in § 432.45 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, revised as of July 1, 2003, must continue to achieve the standards specified in this section until the expiration of the applicable time period specified in 40 CFR 122.29(d)(1) after which it must achieve the effluent limitations specified in §§ 432.42 and 432.43.
