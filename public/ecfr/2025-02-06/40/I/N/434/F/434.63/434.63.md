(ii) All discharges from steep slope areas, (as defined in section 515(d)(4) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, as amended (SMCRA)), and from mountaintop removal operations (conducted pursuant to section 515(c) of SMCRA);


(iii) Discharges from coal preparation plants and preparation plant associated areas (excluding acid or ferruginous mine drainage from coal refuse disposal piles).


(2) Any discharge or increase in the volume of a discharge caused by precipitation within any 24 hour period less than or equal to the 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event (or snowmelt of equivalent volume) may comply with the following limitations instead of the otherwise applicable limitations:


(b) The following alternate limitations apply with respect to acid or ferruginous drainage from coal refuse disposal piles: 


(c) The following alternate limitations apply with respect to acid or ferruginous mine drainage, except for discharges addressed in paragraphs (a) (mountaintop removal and steep slope areas), (d) (controlled surface mine discharges) and (f) (discharges from underground workings of underground mines) of this section:


(1) Any discharge or increase in the volume of a discharge caused by precipitation within any 24 hour period less than or equal to the 2-year, 24-hour precipitation event (or snowmelt of equivalent volume) may comply with the following limitations instead of the otherwise applicable limitations:


(2) Any discharge or increase in the volume of a discharge caused by precipitation within any 24 hour period greater than the 2-year, 24-hour precipitation event, but less than or equal to the 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event (or snowmelt of equivalent volume) may comply with the following limitations instead of the otherwise applicable limitations: 


(d)(1) The alternate limitations specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply with respect to all discharges described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section *and* to:

(ii) Controlled acid or ferruginous surface mine discharges; and 


(iii) Discharges from reclamation areas. 


(2) Any discharge or increase in the volume of a discharge caused by precipitation within any 24 hour period greater than the 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event (or snowmelt of equivalent volume) may comply with the following limitations instead of the otherwise applicable limitations: 


(e) The operator shall have the burden of proof that the discharge or increase in discharge was caused by the applicable precipitation event described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
