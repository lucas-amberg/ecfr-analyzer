# ยง 439.37   Pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart must achieve the same standards as specified in ยง 439.36.


(a) Sources that discharge to a POTW with nitrification capability (defined at ยง 439.2(i)) are not required to achieve the pretreatment standard for ammonia (as N).


(b) The pretreatment standards for cyanide are as follows:


(c) When monitoring for cyanide at the end-of-pipe is impractical because of dilution by other process wastewaters, compliance with the cyanide pretreatment standards in paragraph (b) of this section must be demonstrated at in-plant monitoring points pursuant to 40 CFR 403.6(e) (2) and (4). Under the same provisions, the permitting authority may impose monitoring requirements on internal wastestreams for any other parameter(s) regulated by this section.


(d) Compliance with the standard in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section may be achieved by certifying to the permit issuing authority that a facility's manufacturing processes neither use nor generate cyanide.
