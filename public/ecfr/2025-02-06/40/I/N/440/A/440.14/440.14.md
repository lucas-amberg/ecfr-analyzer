# ยง 440.14   New source performance standards (NSPS).

Except as provided in subpart L of this part, any new source subject to this subpart must achieve the following NSPS representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by applying the best available demonstrated technology (BADT):


(a) The concentration of pollutants discharged in mine drainage from mines operated to obtain iron ore shall not exceed:


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the concentration of pollutants discharged from mills that employ physical (magnetic and nonmagnetic) and/or chemical methods to beneficiate iron ore shall not exceed:


(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, there shall be no discharge of process wastewater to navigable waters from mills that employ magnetic and physical methods to beneficiate iron ore in the Mesabi Range. The Agency recognizes that the elimination of the discharge of pollutants to navigable waters may result in an increase in discharges of some pollutants to other media. The Agency has considered these impacts and has addressed them in the preamble published on December 3, 1982. 


(2) In the event that the annual precipitation falling on the treatment facility and the drainage area contributing surface runoff to the treatment facility exceeds the annual evaporation, a volume of water equal to the difference between annual precipitation falling on the treatment facility and the drainage area contributing surface runoff to the treatment facility and annual evaporation may be discharged subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
