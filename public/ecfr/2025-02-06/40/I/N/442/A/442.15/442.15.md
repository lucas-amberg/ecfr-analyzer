(b) As an alternative to achieving PSES as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, any existing source subject to paragraph (a) of this section may have a pollution prevention allowable discharge of wastewater pollutants, as defined in ยง 442.2, if the source agrees to control mechanism with the control authority as follows:


(1) The discharger shall prepare a Pollutant Management Plan that satisfies the requirements as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, and the discharger shall conduct its operations in accordance with that plan.


(2) The discharger shall notify its local control authority prior to renewing or modifying its individual control mechanism or pretreatment agreement of its intent to achieve the pollution prevention allowable discharge pretreatment standard by submitting to the local control authority a certification statement of its intent to utilize a Pollutant Management Plan as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The certification statement must be signed by the responsible corporate officer as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(l);


(3) The discharger shall submit a copy of its Pollutant Management Plan as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the appropriate control authority at the time he/she applies to renew, or modify its individual control mechanism or pretreatment agreement; and


(4) The discharger shall maintain at the offices of the facility and make available for inspection the Pollutant Management Plan as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(5) The Pollutant Manager Plan shall include:


(i) Procedures for identifying cargos, the cleaning of which is likely to result in discharges of pollutants that would be incompatible with treatment at the POTW;


(ii) For cargos identified as being incompatible with treatment at the POTW, the Plan shall provide that heels be fully drained, segregated from other wastewaters, and handled in an appropriate manner;


(iii) For cargos identified as being incompatible with treatment at the POTW, the Plan shall provide that the tank be prerinsed or presteamed as appropriate and the wastewater segregated from wastewaters to be discharged to the POTW and handled in an appropriate manner, where necessary to ensure that they do not cause or contribute to a discharge that would be incompatible with treatment at the POTW;


(iv) All spent cleaning solutions, including interior caustic washes, interior presolve washes, interior detergent washes, interior acid washes, and exterior acid brightener washes shall be segregated from other wastewaters and handled in an appropriate manner, where necessary to ensure that they do not cause or contribute to a discharge that would be incompatible with treatment at the POTW;


(v) Provisions for appropriate recycling or reuse of cleaning agents;


(vi) Provisions for minimizing the use of toxic cleaning agents (solvents, detergents, or other cleaning or brightening solutions);


(vii) Provisions for appropriate recycling or reuse of segregated wastewaters (including heels and prerinse/pre-steam wastes);


(viii) Provisions for off-site treatment or disposal, or effective pre-treatment of segregated wastewaters (including heels, prerinse/pre-steam wastes, spent cleaning solutions);


(ix) Information on the volumes, content, and chemical characteristics of cleaning agents used in cleaning or brightening operations; and


(x) Provisions for maintaining appropriate records of heel management procedures, prerinse/pre-steam management procedures, cleaning agent management procedures, operator training, and proper operation and maintenance of any pre-treatment system;
