(a) As defined more specifically in each subpart and except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, this part applies to discharges of wastewater from landfill units.


(b) The provisions of this part do not apply to wastewater discharges from land application or land treatment units, surface impoundments, underground injection wells, waste piles, salt dome formations, salt bed formations, underground mines or caves as these terms are defined in 40 CFR 257.2 and 260.10.

(f) This part does not apply to discharges of landfill wastewater from landfills operated in conjunction with other industrial or commercial operations when the landfill receives wastes generated by the industrial or commercial operation directly associated with the landfill and also receives other wastes provided the other wastes received for disposal are generated by a facility that is subject to the same provisions in 40 CFR subchapter N as the industrial or commercial operation or the other wastes received are of similar nature to the wastes generated by the industrial or commercial operation.
