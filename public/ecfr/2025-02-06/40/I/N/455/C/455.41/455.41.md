# § 455.41   Special definitions.

(a) *Initial Certification Statement* for this subpart means a written submission to the appropriate permitting authority, e.g., the local Control Authority (the POTW) or NPDES permit writer which must be signed by the responsible corporate officer as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(l) or 40 CFR 122.22 and which: 


(1) Lists and describes those product families, process lines and/or process units for which the PFPR facility is implementing the Pollution Prevention Alternative (“P2 Alternative”); 


(2) Describes the PFPR facility specific practices for each product family/process line/process unit which are to be practiced as part of the P2 Alternative; 


(3) Describes any justification allowing modification to the practices listed in Table 8 to this part 455; and 


(4) Lists the treatment system being used to obtain a P2 allowable discharge (as defined in 455.41). 


(b) *Periodic Certification Statement* for this subpart means a written submission to the appropriate permitting authority, e.g., the local Control Authority (the POTW) or NPDES permit writer, which states that the P2 Alternative is being implemented in the manner set forth in the control mechanism (for indirect dischargers) or NPDES permit (for direct dischargers) or that a justification allowing modification of the practices listed in Table 8 to this part 455 has been implemented resulting in a change in the pollution prevention practices conducted at the facility. The Periodic Certification Statement must be signed by the responsible corporate officer as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(l) or 40 CFR 122.22. 


(c) *On-site Compliance Paperwork* for this subpart means data or information maintained in the offices of the PFPR facility which supports the initial and periodic certification statements as follows: 


(1) Lists and describes those product families, process lines and/or process units for which the facility is implementing the P2 Alternative; 


(2) Describes the facility specific practices for each product family/process line/process unit which are to be practiced as part of the P2 Alternative; 


(3) Describes any justification allowing modification to the practices listed in Table 8 to this part 455; 


(4) Includes a written discussion demonstrating that the treatment system being used contains the appropriate pollution control technologies (or equivalent systems/pesticide manufacturing systems) for removing the PAIs which may be found in the wastewater; 


(5) Establishes a method for demonstrating to the permitting/control authority that the treatment system is well operated and maintained; and 


(6) Includes a discussion of the rationale for choosing the method of demonstration. 


(d) For Indirect Dischargers: 


*Pollution prevention (P2) allowable discharge (excluding interior wastewater sources, leak and spill clean-up water, and floor wash)* for this subpart means the quantity of/concentrations of pollutants in PFPR process wastewaters that remain after a facility has demonstrated that it is using the specified practices of the Pollution Prevention Alternative as listed in Table 8 to this part 455. 


*Pollution prevention (P2) allowable discharge for interior wastewater sources, leak and spill cleanup water, and floor wash* for this subpart means the quantity of/concentrations of pollutants in PFPR process wastewaters that remain after a facility has demonstrated that it is using the specified practices of the Pollution Prevention Alternative as listed in Table 8 to this part 455 and that have been pretreated using appropriate pollution control technologies, as defined in § 455.10(g), or a pesticide manufacturer's treatment system, or an equivalent system, used individually, or in any combination to achieve a sufficient level of pollutant reduction. Pretreatment requirements may be modified or waived by the Control Authority (POTW) to the extent that removal credits have been granted by the POTW in accordance with 40 CFR 403.7, provided the granting of such credits does not result in pass through or interference as defined in 40 CFR 403.3 and complies with the provisions of 40 CFR 403.5. The facility must demonstrate that the appropriate pollution control technology is properly maintained and operated. 


(e) For Direct Dischargers: 


*Pollution prevention (P2) allowable discharge* for this subpart means the quantity of/concentrations of pollutants in PFPR process wastewaters that remain after a facility has demonstrated that it is using the specified practices of the Pollution Prevention Alternative as listed in Table 8 to this part 455 and that have been treated using appropriate pollution control technologies, as defined in § 455.10(g), or a pesticide manufacturer's treatment system, or an equivalent system, used individually, or in any combination to achieve a sufficient level of pollutant reduction. The facility must demonstrate that the appropriate pollution control technology is properly maintained and operated. 


(f) *Process wastewater,* for this subpart, means all wastewater associated with pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging except for sanitary water, non-contact cooling water and those wastewaters excluded from the applicability of the rule in § 455.40.
