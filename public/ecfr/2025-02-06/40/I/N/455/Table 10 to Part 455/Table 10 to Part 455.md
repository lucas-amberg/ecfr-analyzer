# Table 10 to Part 455—List of Appropriate Pollution Control Technologies


This table contains those pollutant control technologies, such as hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, precipitation and activated carbon adsorption, which have been used for estimating compliance costs on a PAI specific basis. In general, these treatment technologies have been determined to be effective in treating pesticide containing wastewaters in literature, in bench or pilot scale treatability studies or in the Pesticide Manufacturing effluent guidelines. These are the same technologies that are presented as part of the Universal Treatment System. However, these technologies are PAI specific and may need to be used in conjunction with one another to provide treatment for all PAIs used at a facility over a period of time. In addition, facilities may experience difficulties treating wastewaters that contain emulsions, therefore, “appropriate” treatment for emulsified wastewaters must include an emulsion breaking step. For PAIs whose technology is listed as “Pollution Prevention”, the permitting authority/control authority can determine if additional treatment is necessary through best professional judgement/best engineering judgement, respectively.
