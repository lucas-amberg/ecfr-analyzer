The “average process water usage flow rate” for a plant with more than one plastics molding and forming process that uses finishing water is the sum of the “average process water usage flow rates” for the finishing processes. 


(b) The “volume of process water used per year” is the volume of process water that flows through a finishing water process and comes in contact with the plastics product over a period of one year.
