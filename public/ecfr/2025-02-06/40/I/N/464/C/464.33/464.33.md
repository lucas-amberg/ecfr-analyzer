# ยง 464.33   Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable.

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable, except that non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day and maximum for monthly average mass (kg/1,000 kkg or lb/million lb of metal poured; kg/1,000 kkg or lb/million lb of sand reclaimed; kg/62.3 million Sm
3 or lb/billion SCF of air scrubbed) effluent limitations for copper, lead, zinc, and total phenols. For non-continuous dischargers, annual average mass limitations and maximum day and maximum for monthly average concentration (mg/l) limitations shall apply. Concentration limitations and annual average mass limitations shall only apply to non-continuous dischargers.
