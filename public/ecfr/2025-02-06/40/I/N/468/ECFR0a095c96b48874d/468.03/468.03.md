# § 468.03   Monitoring and reporting requirements.

The following special monitoring requirements apply to all facilities controlled by this regulation. 


(a) The “monthly average” regulatory values shall be the basis for the monthly average discharge in direct discharge permits and for pretreatment standards. Compliance with the monthly discharge limit is required regardless of the number of samples analyzed and averaged. 


(b) As an alternate monitoring procedure for TTO, indirect dischargers may monitor for oil and grease and meet the alternate monitoring standards for oil and grease established for PSES and PSNS. Any indirect discharger meeting the alternate monitoring oil and grease standards shall be considered to meet the TTO standard.
