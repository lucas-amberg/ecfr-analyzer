Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations for the process operations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):


(a) *Rolling spent neat oils—subpart D—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(b) *Rolling spent emulsions.*

(c) *Drawing spent neat oils—subpart D—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(d) *Drawing spent emulsions.*

(e) *Drawing spent soap solutions.*

(f) *Metal powder production wet atomization wastewater.*

(g) *Heat treatment contact cooling water.*

(h) *Semi-continuous or continuous casting contact cooling water.*

(i) *Stationary casting contact cooling water—subpart D—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants. 


(j) *Direct chill casting contact cooling water.*

(k) *Shot casting contact cooling water.*

(l) *Wet air pollution control scrubber blowdown—subpart D—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(m) *Pressure bonding contact cooling water.*

(n) *Surface treatment spent baths.*

(o) *Surface treatment rinse.*

(p) *Alkaline cleaning spent baths.*

(q) *Alkaline cleaning rinse.*

(r) *Alkaline cleaning prebonding wastewater.*

(s) *Tumbling or burnishing wastewater.*

(t) *Sawing or grinding spent neat oils—subpart D—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(u) *Sawing or grinding spent emulsions.*

(v) *Degreasing spent solvents—subpart D—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.
