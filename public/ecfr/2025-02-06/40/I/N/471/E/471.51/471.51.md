# § 471.51   Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations for the process operations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):


(a) *Rolling spent neat oils and graphite based lubricants—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(b) *Rolling spent emulsions.*

(c) *Drawing spent lubricants—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(d) *Extrusion spent lubricants—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(e) *Extrusion press hydraulic fluid leakage.*

(f) *Forging spent lubricants—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(g) *Forging contact cooling water.*

(h) *Equipment cleaning wastewater.*

(i) *Metal powder production wastewater.*

(j) *Metal powder production floor wash wastewater—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(k) *Metal powder pressing spent lubricants—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants. 


(l) *Surface treatment spent baths.*

(m) *Surface treatment rinse.*

(n) *Alkaline cleaning spent baths.*

(o) *Alkaline cleaning rinse.*

(p) *Molten salt rinse.*

(q) *Tumbling or burnishing wastewater.*

(r) *Sawing or grinding spent neat oils—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(s) *Sawing or grinding spent emulsions.*

(t) *Sawing or grinding contact cooling water.*

(u) *Sawing or grinding rinse.*

(v) *Wet air pollution control scrubber blowdown.*

(w) *Miscellaneous wastewater sources.*

(x) *Dye penetrant testing wastewater.*

(y) *Degreasing spent solvents—subpart E—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.
