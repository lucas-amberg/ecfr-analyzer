# § 471.54   Pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and by August 23, 1988 achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES). The mass of wastewater pollutants in refractory metals forming process wastewater introduced into a POTW shall not exceed the following values:


(a) *Rolling spent neat oils and graphite based lubricants—subpart E—PSES.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(b) *Rolling spent emulsions.*
