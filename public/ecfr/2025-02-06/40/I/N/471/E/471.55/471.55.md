(b) *Rolling spent emulsions.*

(c) *Drawing spent lubricants—subpart E—PSNS.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(d) *Extrusion spent lubricants—subpart E—NSPS.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(e) *Extrusion press hydraulic fluid leakage.*
