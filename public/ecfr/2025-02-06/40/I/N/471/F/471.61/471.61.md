# § 471.61   Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations for the process operations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):


(a) *Rolling spent neat oils—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(b) *Rolling contact cooling water.*

(c) *Drawing spent neat oils—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(d) *Extrusion spent neat oils—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(e) *Extrusion spent emulsions.*

(f) *Extrusion press hydraulic fluid leakage.*

(g) *Forging spent lubricants—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(h) *Forging contact cooling water.*

(i) *Forging equipment cleaning wastewater.*

(j) *Forging press hydraulic fluid leakage.*

(k) *Tube reducing spent lubricants—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(l) *Heat treatment contact cooling water—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no allowance for the discharge of process wastewater pollutants. 


(m) *Surface treatment spent baths.*

(n) *Surface treatment rinse.*

(o) *Wet air pollution control scrubber blowdown.*

(p) *Alkaline cleaning spent baths.*

(q) *Alkaline cleaning rinse.*

(r) *Molten salt rinse.*

(s) *Tumbling wastewater.*

(t) *Sawing or grinding spent neat oils—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(u) *Sawing or grinding of spent emulsions.*

(v) *Sawing or grinding contact cooling water.*

(w) *Dye penetrant testing wastewater.*

(x) *Miscellaneous wastewater sources.*

(y) *Degreasing spent solvents—subpart F—BPT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.
