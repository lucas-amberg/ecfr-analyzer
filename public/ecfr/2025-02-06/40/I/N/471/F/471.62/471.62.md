(a) *Rolling spent neat oils—subpart F—BAT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(b) *Rolling contact cooling water.*

(c) *Drawing spent neat oils—subpart F—BAT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(d) *Extrusion spent neat oils—subpart F—BAT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(e) *Extrusion spent lubricants.*

(f) *Extrusion press hydraulic fluid leakage.*

(g) *Forging spent lubricants—subpart F—BAT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants. 


(h) *Forging contact cooling water.*

(i) *Forging equipment cleaning wastewater.*

(j) *Forging press hydraulic fluid leakage.*

(k) *Tube reducing spent lubricants—subpart F—BAT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants. 


(l) *Heat treatment contact cooling water—subpart F—BAT.* There shall be no discharge allowance for process wastewater pollutants. 


(m) *Surface treatment spent baths.*

(n) *Surface treatment rinse.*

(o) *Wet air pollutant control scrubber blowdown.*

(p) *Alkaline cleaning spent baths.*

(q) *Akaline cleaning rinse.*

(r) *Molten salt rinse.*

(s) *Tumbling wastewater.*

(t) *Sawing or grinding spent neat oils—subpart F—BAT.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.
