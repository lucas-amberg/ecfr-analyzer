(d) *Extrusion spent neat oils—subpart F—NSPS.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(e) *Extrusion spent emulsions.*

(f) *Extrusion press hydraulic fluid leakage.*

(g) *Forging spent lubricants—subpart F—NSPS.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.


(h) *Forging contact cooling water.*

(i) *Forging equipment cleaning wastewater.*

(j) *Forging press hydraulic fluid leakage.*

(k) *Tube reducing spent lubricants—subpart F—NSPS.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.
