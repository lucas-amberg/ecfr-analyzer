(i) Any person who prepares bulk sewage sludge that is applied to land in a State other than the State in which the bulk sewage sludge is prepared shall provide written notice, prior to the initial application of bulk sewage sludge to the land application site by the applier, to the permitting authority for the State in which the bulk sewage sludge is proposed to be applied. The notice shall include:


(1) The location, by either street address or latitude and longitude, of each land application site.


(2) The approximate time period bulk sewage sludge will be applied to the site.


(3) The name, address, telephone number, and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit number (if appropriate) for the person who prepares the bulk sewage sludge.


(4) The name, address, telephone number, and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit number (if appropriate) for the person who will apply the bulk sewage sludge.


(j) Any person who applies bulk sewage sludge subject to the cumulative pollutant loading rates in § 503.13(b)(2) to the land shall provide written notice, prior to the initial application of bulk sewage sludge to a land application site by the applier, to the permitting authority for the State in which the bulk sewage sludge will be applied and the permitting authority shall retain and provide access to the notice. The notice shall include:
