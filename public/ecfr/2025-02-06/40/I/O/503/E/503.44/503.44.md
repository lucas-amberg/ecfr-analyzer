# § 503.44   Operational standard—total hydrocarbons.

(a) The total hydrocarbons concentration in the exit gas from a sewage sludge incinerator shall be corrected for zero percent moisture by multiplying the measured total hydrocarbons concentration by the correction factor calculated using equation (7). 


(b) The total hydrocarbons concentration in the exit gas from a sewage sludge incinerator shall be corrected to seven percent oxygen by multiplying the measured total hydrocarbons concentration by the correction factor calculated using equation (8). 


(c) The monthly average concentration for total hydrocarbons in the exit gas from a sewage sludge incinerator stack, corrected for zero percent moisture using the correction factor from equation (7) and to seven percent oxygen using the correction factor from equation (8), shall not exceed 100 parts per million on a volumetric basis when measured using the instrument required by § 503.45(a).
