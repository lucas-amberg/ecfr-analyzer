# § 600.001   General applicability.

(a) The provisions of this part apply to 2008 and later model year automobiles that are not medium duty passenger vehicles (MDPV_FE_), and to 2011 and later model year automobiles including MDPV_FE_. The test procedures in subpart B of this part also apply to 2014 and later heavy-duty vehicles subject to standards under 40 CFR part 86, subpart S.




(b) The provisions of subparts A, D, and F of this part are optional through the 2011 model year in the following cases:


(1) Manufacturers that produce only electric vehicles are exempt from the requirements of this subpart, except with regard to the requirements in those sections pertaining specifically to electric vehicles.


(2) Manufacturers with worldwide production (excluding electric vehicle production) of less than 10,000 gasoline-fueled and/or diesel powered passenger automobiles and light trucks may optionally comply with the electric vehicle requirements in this subpart.


(c) Unless stated otherwise, references to fuel economy or fuel economy data in this part shall also be interpreted to mean the related exhaust emissions of CO_2_, HC, and CO, and where applicable for alternative fuel vehicles, CH_3_OH, C_2_H_5_OH, C_2_H_4_O, HCHO, NMHC and CH_4_. References to average fuel economy shall be interpreted to also mean average carbon-related exhaust emissions and average CO_2_ emissions. References to fuel economy data vehicles shall also be meant to refer to vehicles tested for carbon-related exhaust emissions for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with fleet average CO_2_ standards in § 86.1818 of this chapter.


(d) The model year of initial applicability for sections in this part is indicated by the section number. The two digits following the hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is applicable. An individual section continues to apply for later model years until it is replaced by a different section that applies starting in a later model year. Sections that have no two-digit suffix apply for all 2008 and later model year vehicles, except as noted in those sections. If a section has a two-digit suffix but the regulation references that section without including the two-digit suffix, this refers to the section applicable for the appropriate model year. This also applies for references to part 86 of this chapter. As an example, § 600.113-08 applies to the 2008 and subsequent model years until § 600.113-12 is applicable beginning with the 2012 model year. Section 600.111-08 would then apply only for 2008 through 2011 model year vehicles.


(e) The term “you” in this part refers to manufacturers subject to the requirements of this part.


(f) Unless we specify otherwise, send all reports and requests for approval to the Designated Compliance Officer (see § 600.002).
