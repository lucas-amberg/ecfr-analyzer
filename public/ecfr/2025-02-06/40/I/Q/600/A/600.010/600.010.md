# § 600.010   Vehicle test requirements and minimum data requirements.

(a) Unless otherwise exempted from specific emission compliance requirements, for each certification vehicle defined in this part, and for each vehicle tested according to the emission test procedures in part 86 of this chapter for addition of a model after certification or approval of a running change (§ 86.1842 of this chapter, as applicable):


(1) The manufacturer shall generate FTP fuel economy data by testing according to the applicable procedures.


(2) The manufacturer shall generate highway fuel economy data by:


(i) Testing according to applicable procedures, or


(ii) Using an analytical technique, as described in § 600.006(e).


(3) The manufacturer shall generate US06 fuel economy data by testing according to the applicable procedures. Alternate fueled vehicles or dual fueled vehicles operating on alternate fuel may optionally generate this data using the alternate fuel.


(4) The manufacturer shall generate SC03 fuel economy data by testing according to the applicable procedures. Alternate fueled vehicles or dual fueled vehicles operating on alternate fuel may optionally generate this data using the alternate fuel.


(5) The manufacturer shall generate cold temperature FTP fuel economy data by testing according to the applicable procedures. Alternate fueled vehicles or dual fueled vehicles operating on alternate fuel may optionally generate this data using the alternate fuel.


(6) The data generated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, shall be submitted to the Administrator in combination with other data for the vehicle required to be submitted in part 86 of this chapter.


(b) For each fuel economy data vehicle:


(1) The manufacturer shall generate FTP and HFET fuel economy data by:


(i) Testing according to applicable procedures, or


(ii) Use of an analytical technique as described in § 600.006(e), in addition to testing (e.g., city fuel economy data by testing, highway fuel economy data by analytical technique).


(2) The data generated shall be submitted to the Administrator according to the procedures in § 600.006.


(c) *Minimum data requirements for labeling.* (1) In order to establish fuel economy label values under § 600.301, the manufacturer shall use only test data accepted in accordance with § 600.008 meeting the minimum coverage of:


(i) Data required for emission certification under §§ 86.1828 and 86.1842 of this chapter.


(ii)(A) FTP and HFET data from the highest projected model year sales subconfiguration within the highest projected model year sales configuration for each base level, and


(B) If required under § 600.115, for 2011 and later model year vehicles, US06, SC03 and cold temperature FTP data from the highest projected model year sales subconfiguration within the highest projected model year sales configuration for each base level. Manufacturers may optionally generate this data for any 2008 through 2010 model years, and, 2011 and later model year vehicles, if not otherwise required.


(iii) For additional model types established under § 600.208-08(a)(2), § 600.208-12(a)(2) § 600.209-08(a)(2), or § 600.209-12(a)(2) FTP and HFET data, and if required under § 600.115, US06, SC03 and Cold temperature FTP data from each subconfiguration included within the model type.


(2) For the purpose of recalculating fuel economy label values as required under § 600.314-08(b), the manufacturer shall submit data required under § 600.507.


(d) *Minimum data requirements for the manufacturer's average fuel economy and average carbon-related exhaust emissions.* For the purpose of calculating the manufacturer's average fuel economy and average carbon-related exhaust emissions under § 600.510, the manufacturer shall submit FTP (city) and HFET (highway) test data representing at least 90 percent of the manufacturer's actual model year production, by configuration, for each category identified for calculation under § 600.510-08(a) or § 600.510-12(a)(1).
