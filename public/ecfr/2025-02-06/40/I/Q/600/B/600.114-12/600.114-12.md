# § 600.114-12   Vehicle-specific 5-cycle fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission calculations.

Paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section apply to data used for fuel economy labeling under subpart D of this part. Paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section are used to calculate 5-cycle carbon-related exhaust emission values for the purpose of determining optional credits for CO_2_-reducing technologies under § 86.1866 of this chapter and to calculate 5-cycle CO_2_ values for the purpose of fuel economy labeling under subpart D of this part.


(a) *City fuel economy.* For each vehicle tested under § 600.010-08(a), (b), or (c), as applicable, determine the 5-cycle city fuel economy using the following equation:


(2) Terms used in the equations in this paragraph (a) are defined as follows:


(b) *Highway fuel economy.* (1) For each vehicle tested under § 600.010-08(a), (b), or (c), as applicable, determine the 5-cycle highway fuel economy using the following equation:


(2) If the condition specified in § 600.115-08(b)(2)(iii)(B) is met, in lieu of using the calculation in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the manufacturer may optionally determine the highway fuel economy using the following modified 5-cycle equation which utilizes data from FTP, HFET, and US06 tests, and applies mathematic adjustments for Cold FTP and SC03 conditions:


(i) Perform a US06 test in addition to the FTP and HFET tests.


(ii) Determine the 5-cycle highway fuel economy according to the following formula:


(3) Terms used in the equations in this paragraph (b) are defined as follows:


(c) *Fuel economy calculations for hybrid electric vehicles.* Test hybrid electric vehicles as described in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011). For FTP testing, this generally involves emission sampling over four phases (bags) of the UDDS (cold-start, transient, warm-start, transient); however, these four phases may be combined into two phases (phases 1 + 2 and phases 3 + 4). Calculations for these sampling methods follow:


(1) *Four-bag FTP equations.* If the 4-bag sampling method is used, manufacturers may use the equations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to determine city and highway fuel economy estimates. If this method is chosen, it must be used to determine both city and highway fuel economy. Optionally, the following calculations may be used, provided that they are used to determine both city and highway fuel economy:


(i) *City fuel economy.*

(ii) *Highway fuel economy.*

(2) *Two-bag FTP equations.* If the 2-bag sampling method is used for the 75 °F FTP test, it must be used to determine both city and highway fuel economy. The following calculations must be used to determine both city and highway fuel economy:


(i) *City fuel economy.*

(ii) *Highway fuel economy.*

(3) For hybrid electric vehicles using the modified 5-cycle highway calculation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the equation in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section applies except that the equation for Start Fuel_75_ will be replaced with one of the following:


(i) The equation for Start Fuel_75_ for hybrids tested according to the 4-bag FTP is:


(ii) The equation for Start Fuel_75_ for hybrids tested according to the 2-bag FTP is:


(4) Terms used in the equations in this paragraph (b) are defined as follows:


(d) *City CO*_2_*emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions.* For each vehicle tested, determine the 5-cycle city CO_2_ emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions using the following equation:


(2) To determine City CO_2_ emissions, use the appropriate CO_2_ gram/mile values expressed to the nearest 0.1 gram/mile instead of CREE values in the equations in this paragraph (d). The appropriate CO_2_ values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are the measured tailpipe CO_2_ emissions for the test cycle multiplied by 1.0166.




(3) Terms used in the equations in this paragraph (d) are defined as follows:


(e) *Highway CO*_2_*emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions.* (1) For each vehicle tested, determine the 5-cycle highway carbon-related exhaust emissions using the following equation:


(2) If the condition specified in § 600.115-08(b)(2)(iii)(B) is met, in lieu of using the calculation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the manufacturer may optionally determine the highway carbon-related exhaust emissions using the following modified 5-cycle equation which utilizes data from FTP, HFET, and US06 tests, and applies mathematic adjustments for Cold FTP and SC03 conditions:


(i) Perform a US06 test in addition to the FTP and HFET tests.


(ii) Determine the 5-cycle highway carbon-related exhaust emissions according to the following formula:


(3) To determine Highway CO_2_ emissions, use the appropriate CO_2_ gram/mile values expressed to the nearest 0.1 gram/mile instead of CREE values in the equations in this paragraph (e) The appropriate CO_2_ values for fuel economy labeling based on testing with E10 test fuel are the measured tailpipe CO_2_ emissions for the test cycle multiplied by 1.0166.




(4) Terms used in the equations in this paragraph (e) are defined as follows:

For FTP testing, this generally involves emission sampling over four phases (bags) of the UDDS (cold-start, transient, warm-start, transient); however, these four phases may be combined into two phases (phases 1 + 2 and phases 3 + 4). Calculations for these sampling methods follow:

The appropriate CO_2_ emission input values for fuel economy labeling based on testing with E10 test fuel are the measured tailpipe CO_2_ emissions for the test cycle multiplied by 1.0166. If this method is chosen, it must be used to determine both city and highway CO_2_ emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions. Optionally, the following calculations may be used, provided that they are used to determine both city and highway CO_2_ and carbon-related exhaust emissions values:

(ii) The equation for Start CREE_75_ for hybrids tested according to the 2-bag FTP is:


(4) To determine City and Highway CO_2_ emissions, use the appropriate CO_2_ gram/mile values expressed to the nearest 0.1 gram/mile instead of CREE values in the equations in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.
