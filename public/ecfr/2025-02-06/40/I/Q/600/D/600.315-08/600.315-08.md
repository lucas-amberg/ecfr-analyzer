# § 600.315-08   Classes of comparable automobiles.

(a) The Secretary will classify automobiles as passenger automobiles or light trucks (nonpassenger automobiles) in accordance with 49 CFR part 523.


(1) The Administrator will classify passenger automobiles by car line into one of the following classes based on interior volume index or seating capacity except for those passenger automobiles which the Administrator determines are most appropriately placed in a different classification or classed as special purpose vehicles as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(i) *Two seaters.* A car line shall be classed as “Two Seater” if the majority of the vehicles in that car line have no more than two designated seating positions as such term is defined in the regulations of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Transportation (DOT), 49 CFR 571.3.


(ii) *Minicompact cars.* Interior volume index less than 85 cubic feet.


(iii) *Subcompact cars.* Interior volume index greater than or equal to 85 cubic feet but less than 100 cubic feet.


(iv) *Compact cars.* Interior volume index greater than or equal to 100 cubic feet but less than 110 cubic feet.


(v) *Midsize cars.* Interior volume index greater than or equal to 110 cubic feet but less than 120 cubic feet.


(vi) *Large cars.* Interior volume index greater than or equal to 120 cubic feet.


(vii) *Small station wagons.* Station wagons with interior volume index less than 130 cubic feet.


(viii) *Midsize station wagons.* Station wagons with interior volume index greater than or equal to 130 cubic feet but less than 160 cubic feet.


(ix) *Large station wagons.* Station wagons with interior volume index greater than or equal to 160 cubic feet.


(2) The Administrator will classify light trucks (nonpassenger automobiles) into the following classes: Small pickup trucks, standard pickup trucks, vans, minivans, and SUVs. Starting in the 2013 model year, SUVs will be divided between small sport utility vehicles and standard sport utility vehicles. Pickup trucks and SUVs are separated by car line on the basis of gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). For a product line with more than one GVWR, establish the characteristic GVWR value for the product line by calculating the arithmetic average of all distinct GVWR values less than or equal to 8,500 pounds available for that product line. The Administrator may determine that specific light trucks should be most appropriately placed in a different class or in the special purpose vehicle class as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, based on the features and characteristics of the specific vehicle, consumer information provided by the manufacturer, and other information available to consumers.


(i) Small pickup trucks. Pickup trucks with a GVWR below 6,000 pounds.


(ii) Standard pickup trucks. Pickup trucks with a GVWR at or above 6,000 pounds and at or below 8,500 pounds.


(iii) Vans.


(iv) Minivans.


(v) Small sport utility vehicles. Sport utility vehicles with a GVWR below 6,000 pounds.


(vi) Standard sport utility vehicles. Sport utility vehicles with a GVWR at or above 6,000 pounds and at or below 10,000 pounds.


(3)(i) *Special purpose vehicles.* All automobiles with GVWR less than or equal to 8,500 pounds and all medium-duty passenger vehicles which possess special features and which the Administrator determines are more appropriately classified separately from typical automobiles or which do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section will be classified as special purpose vehicles. For example, the Administrator may determine that advanced technology vehicles (such as battery electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and vehicles equipped with hydrogen internal combustion engines) should be appropriately classified as a type of “special purpose vehicle.” The Administrator may determine appropriate names for such types of special purpose vehicles, different from the name “special purpose vehicle.”


(ii) All automobiles which possess features that could apply to two classes will be classified by the Administrator based on the Administrator's judgment on which class of vehicles consumers are more likely to make comparisons.


(4) Once a certain car line is classified by the Administrator, the classification will remain in effect for the model year.


(b) *Interior volume index—passenger automobiles.* (1) The interior volume index shall be calculated for each car line which is not a “two seater” car line, in cubic feet rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic foot. For car lines with more than one body style, the interior volume index for the car line is the arithmetic average of the interior volume indexes of each body style in the car line.


(2) For all body styles except station wagons and hatchbacks with more than one seat (e.g., with a second or third seat) equipped with seatbelts as required by DOT safety regulations, interior volume index is the sum, rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic feet, of the front seat volume, the rear seat volume(s), if applicable, and the luggage capacity.


(3) For all station wagons and hatchbacks with more than one seat (e.g., with a second or third seat) equipped with seatbelts as required by DOT safety regulations, interior volume index is the sum, rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic feet, of the front seat volume, the rear seat volume, and the cargo volume index.


(c) All interior and cargo dimensions are measured in inches to the nearest 0.1 inch. All dimensions and volumes shall be determined from the base vehicles of each body style in each car line, and do not include optional equipment. The dimensions H61, W3, W5, L34, H63, W4, W6, L51, H201, L205, L210, L211, H198, W201, and volume V1 are to be determined in accordance with the procedures outlined in Motor Vehicle Dimensions SAE 1100a (incorporated by reference in § 600.011), except as follows:


(1) *SAE J1100a(2.3)—Cargo dimensions.* All dimensions are measured with the front seat positioned the same as for the interior dimensions and the second seat, for the station wagons and hatchbacks, in the upright position. All head restraints shall be in the stowed position and considered part of the seat.


(2) *SAE J1100a(8)—Luggage capacity.* Total of columns of individual pieces of standard luggage set plus H boxes stowed in the luggage compartment in accordance with the procedure described in 8.2. For passenger automobiles with no rear seat or with two rear seats with no rear seatbelts, the luggage compartment shall include the area to the rear of the front seat, with the rear seat (if applicable) folded, to the height of a horizontal plane tangent to the top of the front seatback.


(3) *SAE J1100a(7)—Cargo dimensions.* (i) L210-Cargo length at second seatback height-hatchback. The minimum horizontal dimension from the “X” plane tangent to the rearmost surface of the second seatback to the inside limiting interference of the hatchback door on the zero “Y” plane.


(ii) *L211—Cargo length at floor-second-hatchback.* The minimum horizontal dimensions at floor level from the rear of the second seatback to the normal limiting interference of the hatchback door on the vehicle zero “Y” plane.


(iii) *H198—Second seatback to load floor height.* The dimension measured vertically from the horizontal tangent to the top of the second seatback to the undepressed floor covering.


(d) The front seat volume is calculated in cubic feet by dividing 1,728 into the product of three terms listed below and rounding the quotient to the nearest 0.001 cubic feet:


(1) *H61—Effective head room-front.* (In inches, obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section),


(2)(i) (W3 + W5 + 5)/2-Average of shoulder and hip room-front, if hip room is more than 5 inches less than shoulder room. (In inches, W3 and W5 are obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section), or


(ii) W3-Shoulder room-front, if hip room is not more than 5 inches less than shoulder room. (In inches, W3 is obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section), and


(3) *L34—Maximum effective leg room-accelerator.* (In inches, obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section.) Round the quotient to the nearest 0.001 cubic feet.


(e) The rear seat volume is calculated in cubic feet, for vehicles with a rear seat equipped with rear seat belts (as required by DOT), by dividing 1,728 into the product of three terms listed below and rounding the quotient to the nearest 0.001 cubic feet:


(1) *H63—Effective head room-second.* (Inches obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section),


(2)(i) (W4 + W6 + 5)/2-Average of shoulder and hip room-second, if hip room is more than 5 inches less than shoulder room. (In inches, W4 and W6 are obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section), or

(3) *L51—Minimum effective leg room-second.* (In inches obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section.)


(f) The luggage capacity is V1, the usable luggage capacity obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section. For passenger automobiles with no rear seat or with a rear seat but no rear seat belts, the area to the rear of the front seat shall be included in the determination of V1, usable luggage capacity, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.


(g) *Cargo volume index.* (1) For station wagons the cargo volume index V10 is calculated, in cubic feet, by dividing 1,728 into the product of three terms and rounding the quotient to the nearest 0.001 cubic feet:


(i) Average cargo width, which is the arithmetic average of:


(A) W4—Shoulder room-second (in inches obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section); and


(B) W201—Cargo width-wheelhouse (in inches obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section).


(ii) *H201-Cargo height.* (In inches obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section.)


(iii) *L205-Cargo length at belt-second.* (In inches obtained according to paragraph (c) of this section.)
