In making such determinations, the Administrator must find that:


(1) A directional change in measured fuel economy of an average vehicle can be predicted from a revision to the test procedures;


(2) The magnitude of the change in measured fuel economy for any vehicle or fleet of vehicles caused by a revision to the test procedures is quantifiable from theoretical calculations or best available test data;


(3) The impact of a change on average fuel economy is not due to eliminating the ability of manufacturers to take advantage of flexibility within the existing test procedures to gain measured improvements in fuel economy which are not the result of actual improvements in the fuel economy of production vehicles;


(4) The impact of a change on average fuel economy is not solely due to a greater ability of manufacturers to reflect in average fuel economy those design changes expected to have comparable effects on in-use fuel economy;


(5) The test procedure change is required by EPA or is a change initiated by EPA in its laboratory and is not a change implemented solely by a manufacturer in its own laboratory.

(h) The increase in average fuel economy determined in paragraph (c) of this section attributable to dual fueled automobiles is subject to a maximum value through model year 2019 that applies separately to each category of automobile specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The increase in average fuel economy attributable to vehicles fueled by electricity or, for model years 2016 and later, by compressed natural gas, is not subject to a maximum value. The increase in average fuel economy attributable to alcohol dual fuel model types calculated under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section is also not subject to a maximum value. The following maximum values apply under this paragraph (h):


(1) The Administrator shall calculate the increase in average fuel economy to determine if the maximum increase provided in this paragraph (h) has been reached. The Administrator shall calculate the increase in average fuel economy for each category of automobiles specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by subtracting the average fuel economy values calculated in accordance with this section, assuming all alcohol dual fueled automobiles subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are operated exclusively on gasoline (or diesel fuel), from the average fuel economy values determined in paragraph (c) of this section. The difference is limited to the maximum increase specified in this paragraph (h).

(1) The Administrator shall calculate the decrease in average carbon-related exhaust emissions to determine if the maximum decrease provided in this paragraph (i) has been reached. The Administrator shall calculate the average carbon-related exhaust emissions for each category of automobiles specified in paragraph (a) of this section by subtracting the average carbon-related exhaust emission values determined in paragraph (j) of this section from the average carbon-related exhaust emission values calculated in accordance with this section by assuming all alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles are operated exclusively on gasoline (or diesel) fuel. For the purposes of these calculations, the values for natural gas dual fuel automobiles using the optional Utility Factor approach in paragraph (j)(2)(vii) of this section shall not be the gasoline CREE values, but the CREE values determined in paragraph (j)(2)(vii) of this section. The difference is limited to the maximum decrease specified in paragraph (i) of this section.

Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the manufacturer must use the value of F that is in effect in paragraphs (j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this section.


(1) Upon written request from a manufacturer, the Administrator will determine and publish by written guidance an appropriate value of F for each requested alternative fuel based on the Administrator's assessment of real-world use of the alternative fuel. Such published values would be available for any manufacturer to use. The Administrator will periodically update these values upon written request from a manufacturer.


(2) The manufacturer may optionally submit to the Administrator its own demonstration regarding the real-world use of the alternative fuel in their vehicles and its own estimate of the appropriate value of F in the equations in paragraphs (j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this section. Depending on the nature of the analytical approach, the manufacturer could provide estimates of F that are model type specific or that are generally applicable to the manufacturer's dual fuel fleet. The manufacturer's analysis could include use of data gathered from on-board sensors and computers, from dual fuel vehicles in fleets that are centrally fueled, or from other sources. The analysis must be based on sound statistical methodology and must account for analytical uncertainty. Any approval by the Administrator will pertain to the use of values of F for the model types specified by the manufacturer.
