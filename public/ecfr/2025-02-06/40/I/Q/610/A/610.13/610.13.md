(3) Publication in the _Federal Register,_ and submission to the Department of Transportation and to the Federal Trade Commission, of a summary of the results of any tests conducted under subparts C through F, or if none were conducted, then a summary of the results of the preliminary analysis conducted under subpart B; together with the Administrator's conclusions as to the effect of the tested retrofit device on fuel economy and exhaust emissions, and as to any other information that the Administrator determines is relevant in evaluating such device.
