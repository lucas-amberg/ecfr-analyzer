(1) Identification and description of the device covered by the application, including drawings, schematics and information on the theory of operation.


(2) Vehicles or engines to which the device is applicable and a description of the types of vehicles or engines to which it is not applicable, e.g., would not provide a benefit, a benefit less than claimed for the device in general, or would result in a safety hazard or damage to the engine.
