# ยง 702.11   Final priority designation.

(a) After considering any additional information collected from the proposed designation process in ยง 702.9, as appropriate, EPA will finalize its designation of a chemical substance as either a High-Priority Substance or a Low-Priority Substance consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2625(h) and (i).


(b) EPA will not consider costs or other non-risk factors in making a final priority designation.


(c) EPA will publish each final priority designation in the _Federal Register,_ along with an identification of the information, analysis, and basis used to support a final designation consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2625(h), (i) and (j). For High-Priority Substance designations, EPA generally expects to indicate which condition(s) of use were the primary basis for such designations.


(d) As required in 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(3)(C), EPA will finalize a designation for at least one High-Priority Substance for each risk evaluation it completes, other than a risk evaluation that was requested by a manufacturer pursuant to subpart B of this part. The obligation in 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(3)(C) will be satisfied by the designation of at least one High-Priority Substance where such designation specifies the risk evaluation that the designation corresponds to, and where the designation occurs within a reasonable time before or after the completion of the risk evaluation.
