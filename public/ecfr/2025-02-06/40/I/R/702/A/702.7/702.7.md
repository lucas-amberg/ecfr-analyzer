(a) EPA generally expects to initiate the prioritization process for a chemical substance only when it believes that the information necessary to prioritize the substance is reasonably available.

(c) The prioritization timeframe in ยง 702.1(d) begins upon EPA's publication of the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section.


(d) Publication of the notice in the _Federal Register_ pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will initiate a period of 90 days during which interested persons may submit relevant information on that chemical substance.

EPA will open a separate docket for each chemical substance to facilitate receipt of information.
