# § 702.43   Risk evaluation actions and timeframes.

(a) *Draft scope.* (1) For each risk evaluation to be conducted, EPA will publish a document that specifies the draft scope of the risk evaluation EPA plans to conduct and publish a notice of availability in the _Federal Register._ The document will address the elements in § 702.39(b).


(2) EPA generally expects to publish the draft scope during the prioritization process concurrent with publication of a proposed designation as a High-Priority Substance pursuant to § 702.9(g), but no later than 3 months after the initiation of the risk evaluation process for the chemical substance.


(3) EPA will allow a public comment period of no less than 45 calendar days during which interested persons may submit comment on EPA's draft scope. EPA will open a docket to facilitate receipt of public comments.


(b) *Final scope.* (1) EPA will, no later than 6 months after the initiation of a risk evaluation, publish a document that specifies the final scope of the risk evaluation EPA plans to conduct, and publish a notice of availability in the _Federal Register._ The document shall address the elements in § 702.39(b).


(2) For a chemical substance designated as a High-Priority Substance under subpart A of this part, EPA will not publish the final scope of the risk evaluation until at least 12 months have elapsed from the initiation of the prioritization process for the chemical substance.


(c) *Draft risk evaluation.* EPA will publish a draft risk evaluation, publish a notice of availability in the _Federal Register,_ open a docket to facilitate receipt of public comment, and provide no less than a 60-day comment period, during which time the public may submit comment on EPA's draft risk evaluation. The document shall include the elements in § 702.39(c) through (f).


(d) *Final risk evaluation.* (1) EPA will complete and publish a final risk evaluation for the chemical substance under the conditions of use as soon as practicable, but not later than 3 years after the date on which EPA initiates the risk evaluation. The document shall include the elements in § 702.39(c) through (f) and EPA will publish a notice of availability in the _Federal Register_.


(2) EPA may extend the deadline for a risk evaluation for not more than 6 months. The total time elapsed between initiation of the risk evaluation and completion of the risk evaluation may not exceed 3- and one-half years.


(e) *Final determination of unreasonable risk.* Upon determination by the EPA pursuant to § 702.39(f) that a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, EPA will initiate action as required pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 2605(a).


(f) *Final determination of no unreasonable risk.* A determination by the EPA pursuant to § 702.39(f) that the chemical substance does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment will be issued by order and considered to be a final Agency action, effective on the date of issuance of the order.


(g) *Substantive revisions to scope documents and risk evaluations.* The circumstances under which EPA will undertake substantive revisions to scope and risk evaluation documents are as follows:


(1) *Draft documents.* To the extent there are changes to a draft scope or draft risk evaluation, EPA will describe such changes in the final document.


(2) *Final scope.* To the extent there are changes to the scope of the risk evaluation after publication of the final scope document, EPA will describe such changes in the draft risk evaluation, or, where appropriate and prior to the issuance of a draft risk evaluation, may make relevant information publicly available in the docket and publish a notice of availability of that information in the _Federal Register_.


(3) *Final risk evaluation.* For any chemical substance for which EPA has already finalized a risk evaluation, EPA will generally not revise, supplement, or reissue a final risk evaluation without first undergoing the procedures at § 702.7 to re-initiate the prioritization process for that chemical substance, except where EPA has determined it to be in the interest of protecting human health or the environment to do so, considering the statutory responsibilities and deadlines under 15 U.S.C. 2605.


(4) *Process for revisions to final risk evaluations.* Where EPA determines to revise or supplement a final risk evaluation pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, EPA will follow the same procedures in this section including publication of a new draft and final risk evaluation and solicitation of public comment in accordance with §§ 702.43(c) and (d), and peer review, as appropriate, in accordance with § 702.41.
