(2) *Substantiation*—(i) *Requirement to substantiate.* Confidentiality claims must be substantiated at the time of submission to EPA, unless exempt under paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.


(ii) *Information in substantiations may be claimed as confidential.* Such claims must be accompanied by the certification described in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, but need not be themselves substantiated.


(iii) *Substantiation questions for all claims.* Answers to the following questions must be provided for each confidentiality claim in a TSCA submission:


(A) Please specifically explain what harm to the competitive position of your business would be likely to result from the release of the information claimed as confidential. How would that harm be *substantial?* Why is the substantial harm to your competitive position *likely* (*i.e.,* probable) to be caused by release of the information rather than just *possible*? If you claimed multiple types of information to be confidential (*e.g.,* site information, exposure information, environmental release information), explain how disclosure of each type of information would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of your business.


(B) Has your business taken precautions to protect the confidentiality of the disclosed information? If yes, please explain and identify the specific measures, including but not limited to internal controls, that your business has taken to protect the information claimed as confidential. If the same or similar information was previously reported to EPA as non-confidential (such as in an earlier version of this submission), please explain the circumstances of that prior submission and reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.


(C)(*1*) Is any of the information claimed as confidential required to be publicly disclosed under any other Federal law? If yes, please explain.


(*2*) Does any of the information claimed as confidential otherwise appear in any public documents, including (but not limited to) safety data sheets; advertising or promotional material; professional or trade publications; state, local, or Federal agency files; or any other media or publications available to the general public? If yes, please explain why the information should be treated as confidential.


(*3*) Does any of the information claimed as confidential appear in one or more patents or patent applications? If yes, please provide the associated patent number or patent application number (or numbers) and explain why the information should be treated as confidential.


(D) Is the claim of confidentiality intended to last less than 10 (ten) years (see TSCA section 14(e)(1)(B))? If yes, please indicate the number of years (between 1 (one) and 10 (ten) years) or the specific date after which the claim is withdrawn.


(E) Has EPA, another federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this chemical substance? If yes, please provide the circumstances associated with the prior determination, whether the information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment, the entity that made the decision, and the date of the determination.


(iv) *Exemptions from the substantiation requirement.* Confidentiality claims are exempt from the requirement to substantiate the claim at the time of submission for the data elements required pursuant to paragraphs (e)(4)(iii)(B)(*1*), (iv)(B)(*1*), (v)(A), (v)(B)(*2*), (vi)(A), (vi)(B)(*2*), (vii)(A), and (vii)(B)(*3*) of this section.


(v) *No claim of confidentiality.* Information not claimed as confidential in accordance with the requirements of this section may be made public without further notice.


(vi) *Public copies.* Submissions and their accompanying attachments that include a confidentiality claim must be accompanied, at the time of submission, by a public version of the submission and any attachments, with all information that is claimed as confidential removed. Only information that is claimed as confidential may be redacted or removed. Generally, a public copy that removes all or substantially all of the information would not meet the requirements of this paragraph.


(A) Where the electronic reporting tool contains a checkbox or other means of designating with specificity what information is claimed as confidential, no further action by the submitter is required to satisfy this requirement.


(B) For all other information claimed as confidential, including but not limited to information in attachments and in substantiations required under paragraph (h) of this section, the submitter must prepare and attach a public copy. Submissions with public or sanitized copies that are entirely blank or that are substantially reduced in length as compared to the CBI version will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (h)(2)(vi) of this section.


(i) *Electronic reporting.* You must use the EPA Central Data Exchange (CDX) to complete and submit the information required under this section. Submissions may only be made as set forth in this paragraph. Submissions must be sent electronically to EPA using the asbestos reporting tool in CDX. The information submitted and all attachments (unless the attachment appears in scientific literature) must be in English. All information must be true and correct. Access the asbestos reporting tool and instructions, as follows:


(1) *By website.* Access the asbestos reporting tool via the CDX homepage at *https://cdx.epa.gov/* and follow the applicable instructions.
