# § 704.20   Chemical substances manufactured or processed at the nanoscale.

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section the terms below are defined as follows:


An *agglomerate* is a collection of weakly bound particles or aggregates or mixtures of the two where the resulting external surface area is similar to the sum of the surface areas of the individual components.


An *aggregate* is a particle comprising strongly bonded or fused particles where the resulting external surface area may be significantly smaller than the sum of calculated surface areas of the individual components.


*Central Data Exchange* or *CDX* means EPA's centralized electronic submission receiving system.


*CISS tool* means the Chemical Information Submission System, EPA's electronic, web-based reporting tool for the completion and submission of data, reports, and other information, or its successors.


*Discrete form of a reportable chemical substance* differs from another form of the same reportable chemical substance in one or more of the following 3 characteristics: 


(i) The change in the reportable chemical substance is due to all of the following:


(A) There is a change in process to effect a change in size, a change in one or more of the properties of the reportable chemical substances identified in paragraph (i)(C) of this definition, or both;


(B) There is a size variation in the mean particle size that is greater than 7 times the standard deviation of the mean particle size (± 7 times the standard deviation); and


(C) There is a change in at least one of the following properties: Zeta potential, specific surface area, dispersion stability, or surface reactivity, that is greater than 7 times the standard deviation of the measured value (± 7 times the standard deviation).


(ii) The reportable chemical substance has a different morphology. Examples of morphologies include but are not limited to sphere, rod, ellipsoid, cylinder, needle, wire, fiber, cage, hollow shell, tree, flower, ring, torus, cone, and sheet.


(iii) A reportable chemical substance that is coated with another chemical substance or mixture at the end of manufacturing or processing has a coating that consists of a different chemical substance or mixture.


*Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program* was a program conducted by EPA from January 2008 to December 2009 under which some nanoscale material manufacturers and processors voluntarily provided EPA available information on engineered nanoscale materials that were manufactured, processed or used.


*Particle* is a minute piece of matter with defined physical boundaries.


*Primary particles* are particles or droplets that form during manufacture of a *chemical* substance before aggregation or agglomerization occurs.


*Reportable chemical substance* is a chemical substance as defined in section 3 of TSCA that is solid at 25 °C and standard atmospheric pressure, that is manufactured or processed in a form where any particles, including aggregates and agglomerates, are in the size range of 1-100 nm in at least one dimension, and that is manufactured or processed to exhibit unique and novel properties because of its size. A reportable chemical substance does not include a chemical substance that is manufactured or processed in a form where less than 1% of any particles, including aggregates, and agglomerates, measured by weight are in the size range of 1-100 nm.


*Small manufacturer or processor* means any manufacturer or processor whose total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company (if any), are less than $11 million. The definition of *small manufacturer* in section 704.3 of this title does not apply to reporting under this section (40 CFR 704.20).


*Specific surface area* means the ratio of the area of the surface of the reportable chemical substance to its mass or volume. Specific surface area by mass is the ratio of the area of the surface of a nanoscale material divided by the mass (m
2/kg) and the specific surface area by volume is the area of the surface of the reportable chemical substance divided by its volume m
2/m
3.


*Surface reactivity* means the reactivity at the surface of a reportable chemical substance. It is dependent upon factors such as redox potential, which is a measure of the tendency of a substance to lose or acquire electrons, photocatalytic activity, including the potential to generate free radicals.


*Unique and novel properties* means any size-dependent properties that vary from those associated with other forms or sizes of the same chemical substance, and such properties are a reason that the chemical substance is manufactured or processed in that form or size.


*Zeta potential* is the electrostatic potential near the particle surface.


(b) *Persons who must report.* (1) Persons who can reasonably ascertain that they are manufacturers and processors of a discrete form of a reportable chemical substance during the three years prior to the final effective date of the rule must report except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) Persons who can reasonably ascertain that they propose to manufacture or process a discrete form of a reportable chemical substance after the final effective date of the rule which was not reported under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must report except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *When reporting is not required.* (1) The following chemical substances are not subject to reporting under this section:


(i) Chemical substances formed at the nanoscale as part of a film on a surface.


(ii) DNA.


(iii) RNA.
