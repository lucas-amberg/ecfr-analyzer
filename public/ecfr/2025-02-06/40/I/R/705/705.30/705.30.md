(i) *Volume.* Production volume information required pursuant to §§ 705.15(d)(1), (5), and (6) and 705.18(a)(4) and (b)(3)(i).


(ii) *Primary submitter.* Joint submission information from the primary submitter, consisting of trade name and supplier identification required pursuant to § 705.15(b)(1)(i) and (ii).


(iii) *Secondary submitter.* Joint submission information from the secondary submitter, consisting of the percentage of formulation required pursuant to § 705.15(b)(1)(i) and (ii).


(c) *Marking information claimed as confidential business information in confidentiality substantiation documentation.* If any of the information contained in the answers to the questions listed in paragraph (e) of this section is asserted to contain information that itself is considered to be confidential, you must clearly identify the information that is claimed confidential.


(d) *Certification statement for claims.* An authorized official representing a person asserting a claim of confidentiality must certify that the submission complies with the requirements of this part by signing and dating the following certification statement:


(e) *Substantiation requirements for all types of confidentiality claims.* For each data element that is claimed as confidential business information, you must submit with your report detailed written answers to the following questions:


(1) *Substantial harm due to release.* Please specifically explain what harm to the competitive position of your business would be likely to result from the release of the information claimed as confidential business information. How would that harm be *substantial?* Why is the substantial harm to your competitive position *likely* (*i.e.,* probable) to be caused by release of the information rather than just *possible*? If you claimed multiple types of information to be confidential (*e.g.,* site information, exposure information, environmental release information, etc.), explain how disclosure of each type of information would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of your business. (40 CFR 703.5(b)(3))


(2) *Precautions to protect confidentiality.* Has your business taken precautions to protect the confidentiality of the disclosed information? If yes, please explain and identify the specific measures, including but not limited to internal controls, that your business has taken to protect the information claimed as confidential business information. If the same or similar information was previously reported to EPA as non-confidential (such as in an earlier version of this submission), please explain the circumstances of that prior submission and reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.


(3) *Disclosure under Federal law or publicly available information.* (i) Is any of the information claimed as confidential business information required to be publicly disclosed under any other Federal law? If yes, please explain.


(ii) Does any of the information claimed as confidential business information otherwise appear in any public documents, including (but not limited to) safety data sheets; advertising or promotional material; professional or trade publications; state, local, or Federal agency files; or any other media or publications available to the general public? If yes, please explain why the information should be treated as confidential. If this chemical is patented and the patent reveals the information you are claiming to be confidential business information, please explain your reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.


(4) *Duration of claims.* Is the claim of confidentiality intended to last less than 10 years (see TSCA section 14(e)(1)(B))? If yes, please indicate the number of years (between 1-10 years) or the specific date after which the claim is withdrawn.


(5) *Previously disclosed information.* Has EPA, another Federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this chemical substance? If yes, please provide the circumstances associated with the prior determination, whether the information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment, the entity that made the decision, and the date of the determination.


(f) *Additional requirements for specific chemical identity.* A person may assert a claim of confidentiality for the specific chemical identity of a chemical substance as described in §§ 705.15(b)(1)(i) and 705.18(b)(2)(i) only if the identity of that chemical substance is treated as confidential in the Master Inventory File (or as a confidential LVE) as of the time the report is submitted for that chemical substance, if that substance is currently on the Inventory or is an LVE. Any person who asserts a claim of confidentiality for the specific chemical identity under this paragraph must provide a generic chemical name. To assert a claim of confidentiality for the identity of a reportable chemical substance, you must submit with the report detailed written answers to the questions from paragraph (b) of this section and to the following questions.


(1) *Chemical substance in U.S. commerce.* Is this chemical substance publicly known (including by your competitors) to be in U.S. commerce? If yes, please explain why the specific chemical identity should still be afforded confidential status (*e.g.,* the chemical substance is publicly known only as being distributed in commerce for research and development purposes, but no other information about the current commercial distribution of the chemical substance in the United States is publicly available) (40 CFR 703.5(b)(4)). If no, please complete the certification statement:


(2) *Leave manufacturing site.* Does this particular chemical substance leave the site of manufacture (including import) in any form, *e.g.,* as a product, effluent, emission? If yes, please explain what measures have been taken to guard against the discovery of its identity.


(3) *Chemical identity.* If the chemical substance leaves the site in a form that is available to the public or your competitors, can the chemical identity be readily discovered by analysis of the substance (*e.g.,* product, effluent, emission), in light of existing technologies and any costs, difficulties, or limitations associated with such technologies? Please explain why or why not.


(4) *Chemical name.* Would disclosure of the specific chemical name release confidential process information? If yes, please explain.


(g) *Joint submissions.* If a primary submitter asks a secondary submitter to provide information directly to EPA in a joint submission under §§ 705.15(b)(1)(i) and 705.18(b)(2)(i), only the primary submitter may assert a confidentiality claim for the data elements that it directly submits to EPA. The primary submitter must substantiate those claims that are not exempt under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The secondary submitter is responsible for asserting all confidentiality claims for the data elements that it submits directly to EPA and for substantiating those claims that are not exempt under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(h) *No claim of confidentiality.* Except for the chemical identity on article importer forms submitted under § 705.18(a), information not claimed as confidential business information in accordance with the requirements of this section may be made public (*e.g.,* by publication of specific chemical name and CASRN on the public portion of the TSCA Inventory). EPA will provide advance public notice of specific chemical identities to be added to the public portion of the TSCA Inventory.
