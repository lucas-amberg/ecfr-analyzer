(a) *Notice of Activity submitted by co-manufacturers.* When, in a single instance of manufacturing or importing a particular volume of a chemical substance during the lookback period, two or more persons qualify as the manufacturer or importer of that volume, they may determine among themselves who should make the required submission under ยง 710.25(a). If no notice is submitted as required under this subpart, EPA will hold each such person liable for failure to submit a notice.


(b) *Notice of Activity by prospective co-manufacturers or co-processors.* If two or more persons intend to manufacture, import, or process a particular volume of an inactive substance, such that multiple persons would qualify as the manufacturer, importer, or processor of that volume, they may determine among themselves who will submit the required notice under ยง 710.25(c). If no notice is submitted as required under this subpart, all of the persons remain subject to the reporting requirements, and EPA will hold each such person liable for a failure to submit a notice prior to the date of manufacturing, importing, or processing.
