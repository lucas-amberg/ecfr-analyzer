# ยง 712.7   Report of readily obtainable information for subparts B and C.

TSCA section 8(a) authorizes EPA to require persons to report information that is known to or reasonably ascertainable by them. For purposes of subpart B, however, a lesser standard applies. Companies must report information that is readily obtainable by management and supervisory employees responsible for manufacturing, processing, distributing, technical services, and marketing. Extensive file searches are not required.
