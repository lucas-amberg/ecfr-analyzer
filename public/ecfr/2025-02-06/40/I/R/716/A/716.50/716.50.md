# § 716.50   Reporting physical and chemical properties.

Studies of physical and chemical properties must be reported under this subpart if performed for the purpose of determining the environmental or biological fate of a substance, and only if they investigated one or more of the following properties:


(a) Water solubility.


(b) Adsorption/desorption on particulate surfaces, e.g., soil.


(c) Vapor pressure.


(d) Octanol/water partition coefficient.


(e) Density/relative density (specific gravity).


(f) Particle size distribution for insoluble solids.


(g) Dissociation constant.


(h) Degradation by photochemical mechanisms—aquatic and atmospheric.


(i) Degradation by chemical mechanisms—hydrolytic, reductive, and oxidative.


(j) Degradation by biological mechanisms—aerobic and anaerobic.
