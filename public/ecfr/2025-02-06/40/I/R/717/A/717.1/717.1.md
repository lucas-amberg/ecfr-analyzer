# § 717.1   Scope and compliance.

Section 8 (c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires manufacturers, processors, and distributors of chemical substances and mixtures:


(a) To keep “records of significant adverse reactions to health or the environment, as determined by the Administrator by rule, alleged to have been caused by the substance or mixture.”


(b) To “permit inspection and submit copies of such records”, upon request of any designated representative of the Administrator. This rule implements section 8(c) of TSCA. It describes the records to be kept and prescribes the conditions under which certain firms must submit or make the records available to a duly designated representative of the Administrator.
