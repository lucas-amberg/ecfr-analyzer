# § 721.10190   Formaldehyde, polymer with aliphatic diamine and phenol, reaction products with 4-methyl-2-pentanone (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as formaldehyde, polymer with aliphatic diamine and phenol, reaction products with 4-methyl-2-pentanone (PMN P-05-186; Chemical D) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (N = 10). However, when this chemical substance is released in combination with any of the substances in § 721.10187, § 721.10188, or § 721.10189, then the value of N shall instead be adjusted according to the following formula:


[(N1 x Release1) + (N2 x Release2) + (N3 x Release3) + (N4 x Release4)] / (Release1 + Release2 + Release3 + Release4) = Adjusted N


Where the “N” variables are the N values for each of the four substances as specified in this section and § 721.10187, § 721.10188, § 721.10189 and the “Release” variables are the number of kilograms released of the respective four substances (in units of kg/site/day) per § 721.91(a).


(ii) [Reserved]


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125 (a), (b), (c), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.
