# § 721.10266   Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (generic) (P-08-733 and P-08-734).

(a) *Chemical substances and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substances identified generically as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PMNs P-08-733 and P-08-734) are subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this rule do not apply to quantities of the PMN substances after they have been completely reacted (cured); embedded or incorporated into a polymer matrix that has been reacted (cured); embedded, encapsulated or incorporated by the polymer binder into a permanent solid matrix (does not include slurries) that is not intended to undergo further processing, except for mechanical processing.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (e.g., physical containment, exhaust control ventilation, or isolation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)—certified respirator with an assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50 meets the minimum requirements for § 721.63(a)(4): NIOSH-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N-100, P-100, or R-100 filter.


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80 (f), (k), and (q).


(iii) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, and processors of these substances.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
