# § 721.10411   Alkanenitrile, bis(cyanoalkyl)amino (generic) (P-07-537).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as alkanenitrile, bis(cyanoalkyl)amino (PMN P-07-537) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after it has been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(v), (a)(6)(vi), (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirator with an assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 5 meets the minimum requirements for § 721.63(a)(4): NIOSH-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100 (if oil aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters; NIOSH-certified powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a loose- fitting hood or helmet and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters; NIOSH-certified powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting facepiece (full-face) and HEPA filters; or NIOSH-certified supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a hood or helmet, or tight-fitting facepiece (full-face) and HEPA filters.


(A) As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i), a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 70 microgram/cubic meter (µg/m
3) as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) consent order.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a), (b), (c), (d), (e)(concentration set at 1.0 percent), (f), (g)(1)(i), (g)(1)(ii), (g)(1)(iii), (g)(1)(iv), (g)(2)(i), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv) (use respiratory protection, or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 70 µg/m
3), (g)(2)(v), (g)(3)(i), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4)(i), (g)(4)(iii), and (g)(5).


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(h) and (q).


(iv) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2).


(v) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
