# § 721.10412   Phosphonic acid ester (generic) (P-07-706).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as phosphonic acid ester (PMN P-07-706) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after it has been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(v), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(v), (a)(6)(vi), (b) (concentration set at 0.1 percent) and (c). The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 15 meet the minimum requirements for § 721.63 (a)(4): NIOSH-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with the appropriate gas/vapor cartridges (organic vapor, acid gas, or substance-specific); NIOSH-certified powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a loose-fitting hood or helmet and the appropriate gas/vapor cartridges (organic vapor, acid gas, or substance-specific); NIOSH-certified powered air-purifying respirator with a tight-fitting facepiece (full-face) and equipped with the appropriate gas/vapor cartridges (organic vapor, acid gas, or substance-specific); NIOSH-certified supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a hood or helmet, or tight-fitting facepiece (full-face); or NIOSH-certified supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a loose-fitting hood or helmet or a tight-fitting facepiece (full-face) if no cartridge service life testing is available.


(A) As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i), a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 1.0 millgram/cubic meter (mg/m
3) as an 8-hour time-weighted-average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) consent order.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1)(i), (g)(1)(vi), (g)(1)(vii), (g)(1)(ix), (g)(2)(i), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv) (use respiratory protection or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 1.0 mg/m
3), and (g)(5).


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(q).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
