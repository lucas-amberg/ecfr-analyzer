For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health assigned protection factor of at least 50. For purposes of § 721.63(b), the concentration is set at 1.0%.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (f), (g)(1) through (3), (g)(4)(i), and (g)(5). For purposes of § 721.72(e), the concentration is set at 1.0%. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1), the required human health hazard statements include: Internal organ effects; reproductive effects; allergic skin reaction. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(2), the required human health precautionary statements include: Use skin protection; where engineering controls are not determined to be adequate, use respiratory protection. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(3), the required environmental hazard statements include: This substance may cause long lasting harmful effects to aquatic life. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial commercial, and consumer activities.* It is a significant new use to process or use the substance with an application method that generates a mist, vapor, or aerosol.


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4) and (c)(4), where N=56.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.
