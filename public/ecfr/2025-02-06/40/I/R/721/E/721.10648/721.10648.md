# § 721.10648   Modified lithium iron phosphates (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substances identified generically as modified lithium iron phosphates (PMNs P-10-545 and P-10-546) are subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this rule do not apply to quantities of the PMN substances after they have been completely reacted (cured), embedded or incorporated into a polymer matrix that has been reacted (cured), or embedded in a permanent solid polymer form that is not intended to undergo further processing, except mechanical.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(4) and (a)(6)(i). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent or reduce exposure, where feasible. A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100 cartridges meets the minimum requirements of § 721.63(a)(4).


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k) (battery electrode components, contained use) and (q).


(iii) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(b)(1) and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a), (b), (c), (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of these substances.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
