# § 721.10703   Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (generic).

(a) *Chemical substances and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substances identified generically as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PMNs P-12-416, P-12-417, P-12-418, and P-12-419) are subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substances that have been completely reacted (cured); incorporated or embedded into a polymer matrix that itself has been completely reacted (cured); imbedded into a permanent polymer form that is not intended to undergo further processing; or incorporated into an article as defined at 40 CFR 721.3(c).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), (a)(4), (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N-100, or P-100, or R-100 filters or power air-purifying particulate respirator), (a)(6)(i), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible.


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f), (k) and (q).


(iii) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(b)(1), and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
