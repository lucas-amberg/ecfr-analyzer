# § 721.10756   Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PMN P-11-339) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this rule do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after it has been completely reacted (cured); embedded or incorporated into a polymer matrix that has been reacted (cured); or embedded in a permanent solid polymer form that is not intended to undergo further processing except for mechanical processing.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii) (clothing that covers other exposed areas of the arms, legs, and torso), (a)(3), (a)(4) (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100, P100, or R100 cartridges), (a)(6)(i), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible.


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k) (a significant new use is any use other than as an additive in resins, thermoplastics, and elastomers for mechanical reinforcement and enhanced electrical performance, as a coating on metallic foils for battery applications, or in the manufacture of fabric composites.) and (q).


(iii) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1), except for water releases determined by monitoring the concentration of the PMN substance in waste water effluent according to a monitoring procedure approved for such purpose by EPA and when the concentration of the PMN substance does not exceed 1 part per billion (ppb). EPA will review and act on written requests to approve monitoring procedures within 90 days after such requests are received. EPA will inform submitters of the disposition of such requests in writing, and will explain the reasons therefore when they are denied.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
