The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of at least 10 meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4):


(A) NIOSH-certified power air-purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.


(B) NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting face piece, hood, or helmet.


(C) NIOSH-certified negative pressure (demand) supplied-air respirator with a full face piece.


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(o) and (y)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).
