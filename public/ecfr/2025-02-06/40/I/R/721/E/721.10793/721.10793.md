# § 721.10793   Phosphoric acid, iron (2 + ) lithium salt (1:1:1).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as phosphoric acid, iron (2 + ) lithium salt (1:1:1) (PMN P-12-17; CAS No. 15365-14-7) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The SNUR does not apply to the PMN substance when it is manufactured, pursuant to any of the exemptions in 40 CFR 720.30(h) with no commercial purpose separate from the substance, mixture, or article of which it is a part.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63 (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(v), (a)(6)(vi), (b), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63 (a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of at least 10 meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4):


(A) NIOSH-certified power air-purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.


(B) NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting face piece, hood, or helmet.


(C) NIOSH-certified negative pressure (demand) supplied-air respirator with a full face piece.


(*1*) As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 2.4 mg/m
3 as an 8-hour time weighted average verified by actual monitoring data.


(*2*) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72.


(A) If as a result of the test data required under the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance, the employer becomes aware that this substance may present a risk of injury to human health or the environment, the employer must incorporate this new information, and any information on methods for protecting against such risk, into a SDS as described in § 721.72(c) within 90 days from the time the employer becomes aware of the new information. If this substance is not being manufactured, processed, or used in the employer's workplace, the employer must add the new information to a SDS before the substance is reintroduced into the workplace.


(B) The employer must ensure that persons who will receive the PMN substance from the employer, or who have received the PMN substance from the employer within 5 years from the date the employer becomes aware of the new information described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section, are provided an SDS containing the information required under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section within 90 days from the time the employer becomes aware of the new information.

(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125 (a) through (f) and (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
