# § 721.10833   Substituted bis 2,6-xylenol (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as substituted bis 2,6-xylenol (PMN P-13-930) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance that have been incorporated into an article or has been incorporated into a polymer matrix.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), (b)(concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50 meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4):


(A) NIOSH-certified power air-purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.


(B) NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting facepiece, hood, or helmet.


(C) NIOSH-certified negative pressure (demand) supplied-air respirator with a full facepiece.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f)(concentration set at 1.0 percent), (g)(1)(The PMN substance may cause sensitization, eye irritation, internal organ effects, and developmental effects), (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4)(i), and (g)(5).


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(g) and (q).


(iv) *Release to water.* (A) Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) N = 6. However the requirements of § 721.91(a)(4) do not apply. Instead, if control technologies are in place to treat the waste stream containing the PMN substance, the amount of the PMN substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms releases. No more than 40 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.


(B) In lieu of calculating the quotient, monitoring or alternative calculations may be used to predict the surface water concentrations expected to result from the intended release of the substance, if the monitoring procedures or calculations have been approved for such purposes by EPA.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
