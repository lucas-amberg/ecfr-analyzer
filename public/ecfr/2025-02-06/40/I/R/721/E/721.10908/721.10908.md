# § 721.10908   Aluminum calcium oxide salt (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as aluminum calcium oxide salt (PMN P-15-328) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after it has been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(4), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(v), (a)(6)(vi), (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of at least 10 meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4):


(A) NIOSH-certified power air-purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.


(B) NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting face piece, hood, or helmet.


(C) NIOSH-certified negative pressure (demand) supplied-air respirator with a full face piece. As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 5 mg/m
3 as an 8-hour time weighted average verified by actual monitoring data.


(ii) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (f)(concentration set at 1.0 percent), (g)(1)(ii), (g)(2) (When using this substance avoid breathing the substance, and use respiratory protection, or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 5 mg/m
3.) and (g)(5).


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (d) and (f) through and (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
