# § 721.10928   Coke (coal), secondary pitch; a carbon-containing residue from the coking of air blown pitch coke oil and/or pitch distillate; composed primarily of isotropic carbon, it contains small amounts of sulfur and ash constituents.

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as coke (coal), secondary pitch. Definition: A carbon-containing residue from the coking of air blown pitch coke oil and/or pitch distillate; composed primarily of isotropic carbon, it contains small amounts of sulfur and ash constituents (PMN P-12-292, PMN P-17-217, and SNUN S-19-4; CAS No. 94113-91-4) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(4), (a)(6)(particulate), (b)(concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified air purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N-100, P-100, or R-100 cartridges, or power air purifying particulate respirator with an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of at least 50 meets the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4).


(A) As an alternative to the respirator requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provision listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.0025 mg/m
3 as an 8-hour time weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will be required to follow NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) consent order.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e)(concentration set at 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1)(vii), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iv), (g)(1)(This substance may cause lung effects), and (g)(5).


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f), (p), and (y)(1) and (2). It is a significant new use to use the substance other than for the confidential use permitted by the Order for P-12-292, as a lubricating agent used in the production of automotive disc brakes, or to process as an additive for the manufacture of diesel particulate filters to increase the porosity of the filter. It is a significant new use to use the substance in an additive formulation to produce diesel particulate filters within the United States. For purposes of § 721.80, the aggregate volume is 2,500,000 kilograms.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (d), and (f) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
