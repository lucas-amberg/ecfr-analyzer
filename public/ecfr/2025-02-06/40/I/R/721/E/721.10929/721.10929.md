# § 721.10929   Single-walled carbon nanotubes (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substances identified generically as single walled carbon nanotubes (PMNs P-13-718, P-13-719, P-13-720, P-13-721, P-14-655, P-14-656, P-14-657, and P-14-658) are subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this rule do not apply to the PMN substance when it is embedded or incorporated into a polymer matrix that itself has been reacted (cured), embedded in a permanent solid polymer form that is not intended to undergo further processing, except mechanical processing, or incorporated into an article as defined at 40 CFR 720.3.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6)(particulate), (b), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified air purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N-100, P-100, or R-100 cartridges, or power air purifying particulate respirator with an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of at least 50 meets the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4).


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k)(A significant new use is use other than as: A semi-conductor, conductive, or resistive element in electronic circuitry and devices; an electro-mechanical switch in electronic circuitry and devices; a film laminate to improve structural, electrical or electro-chemical properties of composite materials; a film laminate to improve conductivity in batteries, capacitors and fuels cells; with composite materials to improve their mechanical properties and electrical conductivities; catalyst support for use in fuel cells; in a nanoporous network in gas diffusion layers; for separation of chemicals; an additive to improve corrosion resistance of metals; an additive in lubricants and greases to improve wear resistance; an additive for transparency and conductivity in electronic devices; an additive for fibers in structural and electrical applications; an additive for fibers in fabrics and as a chemical intermediate) and (q). A significant new use is any use involving an application method that generates a vapor, mist or aerosol unless such application method occurs in an enclosed process. An enclosed process is defined as an operation that is designed and operated so that there is no release associated with normal or routine production processes into the environment of any substance present in the operation. An operation with inadvertent or emergency pressure relief releases remains an enclosed process so long as measures are taken to prevent worker exposure to and environmental contamination from the releases.


(iii) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2).


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (e), (i), (j), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
