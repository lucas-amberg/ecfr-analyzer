(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as plastics, wastes, pyrolyzed, heavy distillate (PMN P-14-715) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(3), (a)(4)(respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor of at least 10), (a)(6)(v), (a)(6)(vi), (a)(6) (particulate or a combination gas/vapor and particulate), (b)(concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible.


(A) As an alternative to the respirator requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the exposure limit (EL) provision listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The EL is both 0.1 ppm for benzene and 10 ppm for naphthalene as an 8-hour time weighted average.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), (f), (g)(1)(i), through (g)(1)(ix), (g)(2)(i), through (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(v), (g)(3)(i), (g)(3)(ii), and (g)(5).
