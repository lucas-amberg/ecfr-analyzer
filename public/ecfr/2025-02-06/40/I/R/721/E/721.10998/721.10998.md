# § 721.10998   Propanoic acid, iron (2+) salt (2:1).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as propanoic acid, iron (2+) salt (2:1) (CAS #1952336-63-8) (PMN P-16-165) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(4) and (5) (particulate) and (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an APF of at least 10 meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4):


(A) NIOSH-certified respirator with an N-100, P-100, or R-100 cartridge.


(B) NIOSH-certified power air purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.


(C) NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting facepiece, hood, or helmet.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), (f), (g)(1)(iv) and (ix), (g)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(l), (p) (270,000 kilograms), (s) (5,000 kilograms). It is a significant new use to use the substance in formulations where the concentration is greater than 1 percent.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (d) and (f) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
