# § 721.11017   Sodium tungsten oxide.

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as sodium tungsten oxide (PMN P-16-455) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance that have been incorporated into a polymer matrix.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (3), (4), and (6) (particulate). The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an APF of at least 1000 meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4):


(A) Any NIOSH-certified powered air purifying full facepiece respirator equipped with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges.


(B) Any NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a full facepiece.


(C) Any NIOSH-certified pressure-demand or other positive pressure mode supplied-air respirator equipped with a full facepiece.


(D) Any NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a full facepiece.


(E) Any NIOSH-certified pressure-demand or other positive pressure mode supplied-air respirator equipped with a full facepiece.


(*1*) As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.3 mg/m
3 as an 8-hour time weighted average verified by actual monitoring data.


(*2*) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1) (lung effects), (g)(1)(vii), (g)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4)(i) and (iii), and (g)(5).


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(q). It is a significant new use to use the PMN substance other than as a component of infrared absorption material. It is a significant new use for any application method that generates a dust, mist, or aerosol, unless such application method occurs in an enclosed process.


(iv) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85(a)(1) and (2), (b)(1) and (2), and (c)(1) and (2).


(v) *Releases to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).
