The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an APF of at least 10 meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4):


(A) NIOSH-certified respirator with an N-100, P-100, or R-100 cartridge.


(B) NIOSH-certified power air purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.


(C) NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting facepiece, hood, or helmet.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1) (dermal sensitization), (g)(1) (endocrine disruption), (g)(1) (reproductive effects), (g)(1)(i), (ii), (iv), and (ix), (g)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v), (g)(3)(i) and (ii), (g)(4)(iii), and (g)(5).
