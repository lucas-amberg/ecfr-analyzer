(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f) and (k). It is a significant new use to process or use the substance without engineering controls to prevent exposure, including dust removal with 99.9% efficiency when loading or unloading the substance in powder form.


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) where N=240.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.
