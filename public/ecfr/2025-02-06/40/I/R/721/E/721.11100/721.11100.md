# § 721.11100   Carbopolycycle-bis(diazonium), dihalo-, chloride (1:2), reaction products with metal hydroxide, 4-[(dioxoalkyl)amino] substituted benzene, 2-[(dioxoalkyl) amino] substituted benzene, 5-[(dioxoalkyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-substituted benzene and oxo-n-phenylalkanamide (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as carbopolycycle-bis(diazonium), dihalo-, chloride (1:2), reaction products with metal hydroxide, 4-[(dioxoalkyl) amino] substituted benzene, 2-[(dioxoalkyl) amino] substituted benzene, 5-[(dioxoalkyl) amino] 2-hydroxy-substituted benzene and oxo-n-phenylalkanamide (PMN P-16-359) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), when determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible, (a)(6)(particulate), (b)(concentrations set at 0.1 percent) and (c).


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e)(concentration set 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1)(iv), (vii), (g)(2)(i), (ii), (do not process or use at greater than 200 degrees Celsius), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f) and (q). It is a significant new use to process or use the PMN substance at a temperature greater than 200 degrees C.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
