# § 721.11126   Mixed metal oxide (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as a mixed metal oxide (PMN P-16-514) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(3) through (5)(respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health assigned protection factor of at least 1,000), (a)(6)(particulate (including solids or liquid droplets)), (when determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible), (b) (concentration set at 1.0%), and (c).


(A) As an alternative to the respirator requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provision listed in the TSCA section 5(e) Order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.04 mg/m
3 as an 8-hour time weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will be required to follow NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) Order.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e)(concentration set at 1.0%), (f), (g)(1)(iv), (lung toxicity if inhaled), (eye irritation), (allergic skin reaction), (g)(2)(i) through (iii) and (v)(use respiratory protection or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 0.04 mg/m
3), (g)(4)(i), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(e), (f), (k), and (q).


(iv) *Disposal.* It is a significant new use to dispose of the chemical substance other than by recycling as described in the Order.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (j) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
