# § 721.11150   2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-butyl-.

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as 2-pyrrolidinone, 1-butyl- (PMN P-14-627, CAS No. 3470-98-2) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i) and (iv), (a)(3), (b), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(2)(i), butyl or Silver Shield gloves may be used. For purposes of § 721.63(b), the concentration is set at 1.0%.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (f), (g)(1)(i) and (ix), (g)(2)(i) through (iii) and (v), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used. For purposes of § 721.72(e), the concentration is set at 1.0%.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f). It is a significant new use to import the substance in containers of less than 55 gallons when the concentration of the confidential component identified in the TSCA Order is greater than 5% by weight for any product either intended for sale or distribution for consumer use, including for use in consumer products, or both intended for commercial use and made available to consumers for retail purchase of any kind. It is a significant new use to use or sell the PMN substance in handheld spray applications that generate a vapor, mist or aerosol.


(iv) *Significant new use to import.* It is a significant new use to import the PMN substance other than to be processed or sold for:


(A) Dispersions for industrial coatings (*e.g.,* polyurethane, acrylic, epoxy);


(B) Coating for consumer and professional use;


(C) Adhesives and sealants;


(D) Solvent-borne industrial coatings;


(E) Silicon wafer cleaning in microelectronics in clean rooms;


(F) Photoresist stripping in microelectronics in clean rooms;


(G) Coatings for microelectronics (*e.g.,* casting of polymer films) in clean rooms;


(H) Reaction medium for polymerization, polymer coatings for industrial and professional applications (*e.g.,* wire enamel, non-stick and friction reduction coating) membranes;


(I) Solvent for chemical synthesis reactions (*e.g.,* pharmaceuticals);


(J) Formulation of inks;


(K) Industrial cleaner (*e.g.,* cleaner for wind turbine, oil rigs, large engines);


(L) Solvent for cleaning industrial reactors;


(M) Wax inhibitors (in hydrocarbon lines);


(N) Petrochemical extraction processes;


(O) Paint stripper;


(P) Solvents for production and formulation of fertilizer;


(Q) Solvent for production and formulation of active ingredients for agriculture;


(R) Solvent for formulation of active ingredients for agriculture-end use pesticide product).


(v) *Significant new use to use or sell.* It is a significant new use to use or sell the PMN substance for:


(A) Dispersions for industrial coatings (*e.g.,* polyurethane, acrylic, epoxy) in a concentration greater than 18% in formulated products;


(B) Adhesives and sealants in concentrations greater than 18% in formulated products;


(C) Solvent-borne industrial coatings in concentrations greater than 30% in formulated products;


(D) Coatings for microelectronics (*e.g.,* casting of polymer films) in clean rooms in concentrations greater than 20% in formulated products;


(E) Reaction medium for polymerization, polymer coatings for industrial and professional applications (*e.g.,* wire enamel, non-stick and friction reduction coating) membranes in concentrations greater than 40% in formulated products;


(F) Inks in concentrations greater than 15% in formulated products;


(G) Solvent for chemical synthesis reactions (*e.g.,* pharmaceuticals) in concentrations greater than 40% in formulated products;


(H) Industrial cleaner (*e.g.,* cleaner for wind turbine, oil rigs, large engines) in concentrations greater than 20% in formulated products;


(I) Wax inhibitors (in hydrocarbon lines) in concentrations greater than 20% in formulated products;


(J) Petrochemical extraction processes in concentrations greater than 60% in formulated products;


(K) Paint stripper only for industrial use in concentrations greater than 20% in formulated products;


(L) Solvent for formulation of active ingredients for agriculture-end use pesticide product) in concentrations greater than 70% in formulated products;


(M) Paint removers in concentrations greater than 5% in formulated products intended for sale or distribution for “consumer” use, including “commercial use” when the “saleable good or service” could introduce PMN material into a “consumer” setting;


(N) Coatings in concentrations greater than 1% in formulated products intended for sale or distribution for “consumer” use, including “commercial use” when the “sealable good or service” could introduce PMN material into a “consumer” setting.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitation or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
