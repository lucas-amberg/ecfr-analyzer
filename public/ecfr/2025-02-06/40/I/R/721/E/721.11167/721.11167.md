# § 721.11167   Siloxanes and Silicones, di-Me, hydrogen-terminated, reaction products with acrylic acid and 2-ethyl-2-[(2-propen-1-yloxyl)methyl]-1,3-propanediol, polymers with chlorotrimethylsilane-iso-Pr alc.-sodium silicate reaction products.

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as siloxanes and silicones, di-Me, hydrogen-terminated, reaction products with acrylic acid and 2-ethyl-2-[(2-propen-1-yloxyl)methyl]-1,3-propanediol, polymers with chlorotrimethylsilane-iso-Pr alc.-sodium silicate reaction products (PMN P-17-296, CAS No. 2014386-23-1) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after they have been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i) through (iii), (a)(3) through (5) (respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health assigned protection factor of at least 1,000 and are required for any process generating a spray, mist, or aerosol), (when determining which persons are reasonable likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposures, where feasible), (a)(6)(v) and (vi) (particulate (including solids or liquid droplets)), (b) (concentration set at 1.0%), and (c).


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 1.0%), (f), (g)(1)(i), (sensitization) (iv), (vii), and (ix), (g)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
