(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 1.0%), (f), (g)(1)(ii), (iv), (vi), and (ix) ((skin and eye irritation), (sensitization), (mutagenicity)), (g)(2)(i) through (v) (use eye protection), (g)(3)(i) and (ii), (g)(4)(i) and (iii), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.
