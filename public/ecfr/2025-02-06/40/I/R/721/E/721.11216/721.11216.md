# § 721.11216   Halogenated benzoic acid (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substances identified generically in the table 1 of this section are subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i) and (iv), (a)(3), (4), and (5), (a)(6)(v) and (vi) (particulate), (b) (concentration set at 1.0%), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonable likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposures, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health with assigned protection factor of at least 50, and respirators are only required for P-17-414 to P-17-418, P-17-420 to P-17-422, and P-17-450.


(A) As an alternative to the respirator requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provision listed in the TSCA section 5(e) Order for the substances. The NCEL is 0.0184 mg/m
3 as an 8-hour time weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will be required to follow NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) Order.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 1.0%), (f), (g)(1)(i) through (iv), (vi), and (ix), (g)(2)(i) through (iii), (v), and (iv), (g)(3)(i) and (ii), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used. For purposes of § 721.63(g)(2), use respiratory protection or maintain workplace airborne concentration at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 0.0184 mg/m
3, and the statement is only required for P-17-414 to P-17-418, P-17-420 to P-17-422, and P-17-450.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(q) and (t). It is a significant new use to use the substances other than for monitoring well performance. It is a significant new use to manufacture or process the substances without the engineering controls specified in the TSCA section 5(e) Order. It is a significant new use to exceed the kilograms per day limit specified in the TSCA section 5(e) Order of the substances handled at processing and use sites. It is a significant new use to use P-17-441 to 442 and P-17-444 to P-17-449 other than in a liquid formulation.


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) where N=460.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of these substances.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725 (b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
