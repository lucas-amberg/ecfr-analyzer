# § 721.11220   Substituted carbomonocycle, polymer with halo substituted heteromonocycle and polyoxyalkylene polymer with alkylenebis [isocyanatocarbomonocycle] bis (carbomonocycledicarboxylate), reaction products with alkylamines, hydrolyzed (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as substituted carbomonocycle, polymer with halo substituted heteromonocycle and polyoxyalkylene polymer with alkylenebis [isocyanatocarbomonocycle] bis (carbomonocycledicarboxylate), reaction products with alkylamines, hydrolyzed (PMN P-18-22) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (iii), and (iv), (a)(3), (4), (5), and (6) (particulate), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonable likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposures, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health with assigned protection factor of at least 50.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), (g)(1)(ii) (irritation to skin, eyes, lungs, and mucous membranes), (g)(2)(i) through (v) (avoid eye contact), and (g)(5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f). It is a significant new use to use the substance other than as primer coating used for corrosion protection. It is a significant new use to import the substance with an average molecular weight greater less than 1026 daltons, and with low weight fractions greater than 15.3% less than 500 daltons and 25% less than 1000 daltons.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
