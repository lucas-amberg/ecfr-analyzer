# § 721.11237   Polysiloxanes, di alkyl, substituted alkyl group terminated, alkoxylated, reaction products with alkanoic acid, isocyanate substituted-alkyl carbomonocycle and polyol (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as polysiloxanes, di alkyl, substituted alkyl group terminated, alkoxylated, reaction products with alkanoic acid, isocyanate substituted alkyl carbomonocycle and polyol (PMN P-17-374) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after they have been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (2)(i), (3) through (5) and (6)(v) and (vi) (particulate), (b) (concentration set at 0.1%), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures.) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a NIOSH assigned protection factor of at least 50.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (e) (concentration set at 0.1%), (f), (g)(1)(i), (vii) and (ix) ((sensitization), (systemic effects)), (2)(i) through (iii) and (v), and (5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f). It is a significant new use to import the substance with more than 0.1% residual isocyanate. It is a significant new use to import the substance at a number average molecular weight less than 1000 Daltons. It is a significant new use to use the substance other than as an ultraviolet curable coating resin.


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4), where N=110.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
