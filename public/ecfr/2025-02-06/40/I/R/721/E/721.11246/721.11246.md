(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as substituted alkanediol, polymer with heteromonocycles, alkenoate, metal complexes (PMN P-18-130) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been reacted (cured).

When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4) engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50, or if spray applied an APF of 1000.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), (g)(1)(i) ((sensitization), (mutagenicity)), (2)(i) through (v), and (5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f). It is a significant new use to use the substance other than as an adhesion promoter for industrial applications.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).
