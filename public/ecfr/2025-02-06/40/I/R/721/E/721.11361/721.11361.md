# § 721.11361   Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PMN P-18-182) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance that have been:


(i) Embedded or incorporated into a polymer matrix that itself has been reacted (cured);


(ii) Embedded in a permanent solid/polymer form that is not intended to undergo further processing, except mechanical processing; or


(iii) Incorporated into an article as defined at 40 CFR 720.3.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (3) through (6), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6), the airborne form(s) of the substance include particulate.


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* It is a significant new use to use an application method that generates a dust, mist, or aerosol, unless such application method occurs in an enclosed process. It is a significant new use to use the substance other than for heat transfer, heat storage, thermal emission, and general temperature management in heat-generating systems such as electronics, to improve mechanical properties or electrical conductivities of other materials or products, and for light absorption properties.


(iii) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85(a)(1) and (2), (b)(1) and (2), and (c)(1) and (2).


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitation or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
