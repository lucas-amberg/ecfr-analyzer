# § 721.11467   Carbon nanotubes (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as carbon nanotubes (PMN P-15-54) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance that have been (i) embedded or incorporated into a polymer matrix that itself has been reacted (cured) or (ii) embedded in a permanent solid polymer form that is not intended to undergo further processing, except mechanical processing.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Workplace protection.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (2)(i) and (ii), and (3) through (6), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6), particulate (including solids or liquid droplets).


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k) (chemical intermediate to manufacture functionalized carbon nanotubes by oxidation with nitric acid; additive in rubber polymers to improve mechanical/physical/chemical/electrical properties; additive in resin polymers to improve mechanical/physical/chemical/electrical properties; additive in metals to improve electrical/thermal properties; additive in ceramics to improve mechanical/electrical/thermal properties; semi-conductor, conductive, or resistive element in electronic circuitry and devices; electric collector element or electrode in energy devices; photoelectric or thermoelectric conversion elements in energy devices; catalyst support element or catalytic electrode for use in energy devices; additive for transparency and conductivity in electronic devices; and electro-mechanical element in actuator, sensor, or switching devices).


(iii) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85(a)(1) and (2), (b)(1) and (2), and (c)(1) and (2).


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1) and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (e) and (i) through (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
