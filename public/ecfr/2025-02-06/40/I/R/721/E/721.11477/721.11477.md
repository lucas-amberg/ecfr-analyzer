(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as 2,5-furandione, polymer with 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, 3a,4,5,6,7,7ahexahydro- 4,7-methano-1H-inden-5(or 6)-yl ester, ester with 2,3-dihydroxypropyl neodecanoate, polymer with 5-isocyanato-l-(isocyanatomethyl)-1,3, 3-trimethylcyclohexane, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate- and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-blocked (PMN P-18-42, CAS No. 2245262-16-0) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance after they have been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (2)(i) through (iv) and (3), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), (g)(1)(i) and (ii), (iv), (vii) and (ix), (2)(i) through (iii) and (v), and (5).
