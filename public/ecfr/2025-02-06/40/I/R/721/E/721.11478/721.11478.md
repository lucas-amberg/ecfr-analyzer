# § 721.11478   Perfluoroalkyl ethyl- and vinyl-modified organopolysiloxane (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as perfluoroalkyl ethyl- and vinyl-modified organopolysiloxane (PMN P-18-52) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely reacted (cured).


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1) through (6) and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required by § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 1,000). For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6) combination gas/vapor and particulate.


(A) As an alternative to respirator requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provision listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.0015 mg/m3 as an 8-hour time weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will be required to follow NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) consent order.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), (g)(1)(vi), (2)(i) through (v), and (5). Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1) specific target organ toxicity. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(2)(iv), use respiratory protection or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 0.0015 mg/m3.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f) and (t) (420 kilograms).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain modification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
