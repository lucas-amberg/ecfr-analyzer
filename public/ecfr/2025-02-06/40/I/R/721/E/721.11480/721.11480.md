When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 1,000. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6), particulate (including solids or liquid droplets). For purposes of § 721.63(b), concentration is set at 0.1%.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (f), and (g)(1)(vi), (vii), (2)(i) through (iii) (use respiratory protection when spraying), (v), (3)(i) and (ii), (4)(i), and (5).

For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1) specific target organ toxicity. For purposes of § 721.72(e), concentration is set at 0.1%.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k). It is a significant new use to manufacture or process the PMN substance in any manner which generates inhalation exposures.


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4) and (c)(4) where N=1.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provision of subpart A of this part apply to this section as modified by this paragraph (b).
