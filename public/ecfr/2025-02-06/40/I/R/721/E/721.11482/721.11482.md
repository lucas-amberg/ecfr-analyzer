# § 721.11482   Saturated fatty acid, reaction products with cadmium zinc selenide sulfide, alkylamine and polymeric amine (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical identified generically as saturated fatty acid, reaction products with cadmium zinc selenide sulfide, alkylamine and polymeric amine (PMN P-18-75) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new use described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (3) and (6), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6), particulate (including solids or liquid droplets).


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), and (g)(1)(i) and (vii), (2)(i) through (iii), and (v), (3)(i) and (ii), (4)(i) and (iii) and (5). For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1) pulmonary toxicity, eye damage, specific target organ toxicity, and skin sensitization. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80 (k)(quantum dot in an optical down-converter). It is a significant new use to manufacture, process, or use the PMN substance in other than a liquid formulation. It is a significant new use to manufacture or process the PMN substance in any manner which generates inhalation exposures. It is a significant new use to manufacture the PMN substance with a cadmium percentage greater than the confidential value stated in the TSCA Order.


(iv) *Disposal.* It is a significant new use to dispose of the PMN substance in any manner other than by incineration in a permitted hazardous waste incinerator.


(v) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1) and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provision of subpart A of this part apply to this section as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (d) and (f) through (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain modification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725 (b)(1) apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
