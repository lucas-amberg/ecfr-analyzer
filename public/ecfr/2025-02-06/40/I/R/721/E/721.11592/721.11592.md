(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), .alpha.-nonyl-.omega.-hydroxy-, branched and linear (PMN P-19-52; CAS No. 2242406-13-7) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i) through (iii), (a)(3) through (6), (b), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 1,000. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6), the airborne form(s) of the substance include particulate (including solids or liquid droplets). For purposes of § 721.63(b), the concentration is set at 1%.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (f), (g)(1), (g)(2)(i) through (v), (g)(3)(i) and (ii), and (g)(5). For purposes of § 721.72(e), the concentration is set at 1%. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1), this substance may cause: skin irritation; respiratory complications; internal organ effects; eye corrosion. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer use.* It is a significant new use to use the substance where the concentration of the substance in the product formulation intended for distribution in commerce exceeds 1% by weight.


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4) and (c)(4), where N = 34.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.
