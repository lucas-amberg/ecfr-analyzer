# § 721.11644   Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (generic).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PMN P-20-72) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely reacted or cured.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(3) through (5), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must include a N-100, P-100, or R-100 cartridge and provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), (g)(1), (g)(3), and (g)(5). For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1), this substance may cause: eye irritation; respiratory sensitization; skin sensitization; carcinogenicity; specific target organ toxicity. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(3), this substance may cause: unknown aquatic toxicity. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f), (k) and (t). It is a significant new use to import the substance such that the maximum weight percentage of the confidential impurity exceeds the confidential percentage specified in the Order. It is a significant new use to import the substance other than as confidentially described in the PMN and allowed by the Order. It is a significant new use to process or use the substance in application methods that generate a dust, mist, spray, vapor, or aerosol unless such application method occurs in an enclosed process.


(iv) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85(b)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2). It is a significant new use to release the PMN substance directly to air.


(v) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (k) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitation or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.11 apply to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
