# § 721.11761   Multi-walled carbon nanotubes; closed; 17.0-34.7 nm diameter; globular shape; Grade: Jenotube 20.

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as multi-walled carbon nanotubes; closed; 17.0-34.7 nm diameter; globular shape; Grade: Jenotube 20 (PMN P-20-65) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely reacted or cured or incorporated into an article.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(3), (5), (6)(vii), (7) and (8), and (c). For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50.


(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), and (g)(1), (3)(iii) and (5). For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1), this substance may cause: skin sensitization; eye irritation; respiratory sensitization; carcinogenicity; specific target organ toxicity. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.


(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f). It is a significant new use to manufacture the substance with a maximum weight percentage of cobalt oxide impurity in excess of 2.1%. It is a significant new use to process or use the substance other than as an electrically conductive material, a heat dissipation material, a heat generation material, an additive for weight reduction, an additive to improve physical or mechanical properties, an additive in batteries, energy storage, and electrode applications, or an additive in field emission applications. It is a significant new use to process or use the substance in application methods that do not generate a vapor, mist, dust, or aerosol unless such an application method occurs in an enclosed process.


(iv) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitation or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
