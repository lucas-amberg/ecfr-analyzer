# § 721.1612   Substituted 2-nitro- and 2-aminobenzesulfonamide.

(a) *Chemical substances and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substances identified generically as substituted 2-nitro- and 2-aminobenzenesulfonamide (PMNs P-88-1937 and P-88-1938) are subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 


(2) The significant new uses are: 


(i) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72 (a) through (d), (f), (g)(3)(i), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4)(i), and (g)(5). The following additional statements shall appear on each label and SDS required by this paragraph: This substance may be toxic to terrestrial organisms and plants. Notice to user: Release to water restrictions apply. 


(ii) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85. A significant new use of these substances is any release of the substances to land. 


(iii) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 100 ppb for P-88-1937 and N = 10 ppb for P-88-1938). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in § 721.91(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the substances that will be released will be calculated before the substances enter control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the PMN substances will be treated before release, the amount of the PMN substances reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 50 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125 (a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (j), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
