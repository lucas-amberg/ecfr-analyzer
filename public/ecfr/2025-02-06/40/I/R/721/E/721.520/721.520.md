# § 721.520   Alanine, N-(2-carboxyethyl)-N-alkyl-, salt.

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as alanine, *N-*(2-carboxyethyl)-*N-* alkyl-, salt (P-89-336) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 


(2) The significant new uses are: 


(i) *Hazard communication program.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72 (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4)(i), and (g)(5). 


(ii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k) and (q). 


(iii) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), (c)(4) (where N = 100). The requirement of 40 CFR 721.91(a)(4) that the amount of the substance estimated to be released to water is calculated before entering control technology is not retained. Instead, if the waste stream containing the PMN substance will be treated using biological treatment (activated sludge or equivalent) plus clarification, then the amount of PMN substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 90 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment. 


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph. 


(1) *Recordkeeping requirements.* The following recordkeeping requirements are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance as specified in § 721.125 (a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (k). 


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this significant new use rule.


(3) *Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.* The provisions of § 721.1725(b)(1) apply to this section.
