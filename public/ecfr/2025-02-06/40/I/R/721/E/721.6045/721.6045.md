# § 721.6045   Phosphinothioic acid, bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- (9CI).

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified as phosphinothioic acid, bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- (9CI) (PMN P-96-1652; CAS No. 132767-86-3) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) The significant new uses are:


(i) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (N = 10). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in § 721.91, the statement that the amount of the substance that will be released will be calculated before the substance enters control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the substance will be treated using carbon adsorption treatment before release, then the amount of the substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 99 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.


(ii) [Reserved]


(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.


(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125 (a), (b), (c), and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.


(2) *Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
