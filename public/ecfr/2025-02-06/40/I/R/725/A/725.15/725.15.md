# § 725.15   Determining applicability when microorganism identity or use is confidential or uncertain.

(a) *Consulting EPA.* Persons intending to conduct activities involving microorganisms may determine their obligations under this part by consulting the Inventory or the microorganisms and uses specified in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part. This section establishes procedures for EPA to assist persons in determining whether the microorganism or the use is listed on the Inventory, in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part.


(1) *Confidential identity or use.* In some cases it may not be possible to directly determine if a specific microorganism is listed, because portions of that entry may contain generic information to protect confidential business information (CBI). If any portion of the microorganism's identity or use has been claimed as CBI, that portion does not appear on the public version of the Inventory, in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part. Instead, it is contained in a confidential version held in EPA's Confidential Business Information Center (CBIC). The public versions contain generic information which masks the confidential business information. A person who intends to conduct an activity involving a microorganism or use whose entry is described with generic information will need to inquire of EPA whether the unreported microorganism or use is on the confidential version.


(2) *Uncertain microorganism identity.* The current state of scientific knowledge leads to some imprecision in describing a microorganism. As the state of knowledge increases, EPA will be developing policies to determine whether one microorganism is equivalent to another. Persons intending to conduct activities involving microorganisms may inquire of EPA whether the microorganisms they intend to manufacture (including import) or process are equivalent to specific microorganisms described on the Inventory, in § 725.239, or in subpart M of this part.


(b) *Requirement of bona fide intent.* (1) EPA will answer the inquiries described in paragraph (a) of this section only if the Agency determines that the person has a *bona fide* intent to conduct the activity for which reporting is required or for which any exemption may apply.


(2) To establish a *bona fide* intent to manufacture (including import) or process a microorganism, the person who proposes to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism must submit the request to EPA via CDX. Prior to submission to EPA via CDX, such *bona fide* intents to manufacture (including import) or process must be generated and completed using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to access the e-PMN software. A *bona fide* intent to manufacture (including import) or process must contain the following information:


(i) Taxonomic designations and supplemental information required by § 725.12.


(ii) A signed statement certifying that the submitter intends to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism for commercial purposes.


(iii) A description of research and development activities conducted with the microorganism to date, demonstration of the submitter's ability to produce or obtain the microorganism from a foreign manufacturer, and the purpose for which the person will manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism.


(iv) An indication of whether a related microorganism was previously reviewed by EPA to the extent known by the submitter.


(v) A specific description of the major intended application or use of the microorganism. 


(c) If an importer or processor cannot provide all the information required by paragraph (b) of this section, because it is claimed as confidential business information by its foreign manufacturer or supplier, the foreign manufacturer or supplier may supply the information directly to EPA.


(d) EPA will review the information submitted by the manufacturer (including importer) or processor under this paragraph to determine whether that person has shown a *bona fide* intent to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism. If necessary, EPA will compare this information to the information requested for the confidential microorganism under § 725.85(b)(3)(iii).


(e) In order for EPA to make a conclusive determination of the microorganism's status, the proposed manufacturer (including importer) or processor must show a *bona fide* intent to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism and must provide sufficient information to establish identity unambiguously. After sufficient information has been provided, EPA will inform the manufacturer (including importer) or processor whether the microorganism is subject to this part and if so, which sections of this part apply.


(f) If the microorganism is found on the confidential version of the Inventory, in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part, EPA will notify the person(s) who originally reported the microorganism that another person (whose identity will remain confidential, if so requested) has demonstrated a *bona fide* intent to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism and therefore was told that the microorganism is on the Inventory, in § 725.239, or in subpart M of this part.


(g) A disclosure to a person with a *bona fide* intent to manufacture (including import) or process a particular microorganism that the microorganism is on the Inventory, in § 725.239, or in subpart M of this part will not be considered a public disclosure of confidential business information under section 14 of the Act.


(h) EPA will answer an inquiry on whether a particular microorganism is subject to this part within 30 days after receipt of a complete submission under paragraph (b) of this section.
