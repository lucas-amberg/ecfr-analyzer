# ยง 725.56   Extension of the review period.

(a) At any time during the review period, EPA may unilaterally determine that good cause exists to extend the review period specified for MCANs, or the exemption requests.


(b) If EPA makes such a determination, EPA:


(1) Will notify the submitter that EPA is extending the review period for a specified length of time and state the reasons for the extension.
