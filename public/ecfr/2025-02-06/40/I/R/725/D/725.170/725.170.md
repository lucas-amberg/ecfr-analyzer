# § 725.170   EPA review of the MCAN.

General procedures for review of all submissions under this part are contained in §§ 725.28 through 725.60. In addition, the following procedures apply to EPA review of MCANs submitted under this subpart:


(a) *Length of the review period.* The MCAN review period specified in section 5(a) of the Act runs for 90 days from the date EPA receives a complete MCAN, or the date EPA determines the MCAN is complete under § 725.33, unless the Agency extends the period under section 5(c) of the Act and § 725.56.




(b) *Determinations.* (1) Within the applicable review period, EPA will make one of the following five determinations on the microorganism, as set forth in section 5(a)(3) of the Act:


(i) The microorganism presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(A) of the Act.


(ii) Information available to EPA is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and the environmental effects of the microorganism, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(i) of the Act.


(iii) In the absence of sufficient information to permit EPA to make such an evaluation, the microorganism may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(ii)(I) of the Act.


(iv) The microorganism is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II) of the Act.


(v) The microorganism is not likely to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(C) of the Act.


(2) EPA will take the following actions required in association with the determination.


(i) For determinations described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, EPA will issue the submitter an order to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the microorganism, or any combination of such activities, to the extent necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(f) of the Act, or will issue a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Act, as set forth in section 5(f) of the Act.


(ii) For determinations described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv), EPA will issue the submitter an order to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the microorganism, or any combination of such activities, to the extent necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(e) of the Act. EPA may issue an order under section 5(e) of the Act that requires certain testing to be conducted and presented to EPA after the applicable review period has concluded.


(iii) Following determinations described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, EPA will issue the submitter a document containing EPA's final determination and will submit for publication in the *Federal Register* a statement of the finding, as set forth in section 5(g) of the Act. Upon EPA's issuance of the determination document, the submitter may commence the manufacture of the microorganism without waiting for the end of the applicable review period.


(3) EPA may modify or revoke the prohibitions and limitations in an order issued under paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section after the applicable review period has ended if EPA receives additional information, testing, studies, or reports that EPA determines, upon review, demonstrate that such prohibitions or limitations are no longer necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Where such information demonstrates that the prohibitions or limitations of the order are not sufficient to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, EPA may modify the order or take other action, as appropriate, to the extent necessary to protect against such risk.


(4) No person submitting an MCAN in response to the requirements of this subpart may manufacture a microorganism subject to this subpart until EPA has issued a determination in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and taken the associated action required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
