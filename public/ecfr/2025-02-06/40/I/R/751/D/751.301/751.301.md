# ยง 751.301   General.

(a) *Applicability.* This subpart sets certain restrictions on the manufacture (including import), processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of trichloroethylene (TCE) (CASRN 79-01-6) to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to health in accordance with TSCA section 6(a).


(b) *Regulatory threshold.* Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the prohibitions and restrictions of this subpart do not apply to products containing TCE at thresholds less than 0.1 percent by weight. This threshold does not apply to wastewater.


(c) *Byproducts within site-limited, physically enclosed systems.* Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the prohibitions and restrictions of this subpart do not apply to TCE processed as a byproduct when that byproduct TCE is processed within a site-limited, physically enclosed system that is part of the same overall manufacturing process from which the byproduct TCE was generated. This exclusion does not permit TCE to be present in any product that results from such site-limited, physically enclosed systems, except as permitted by paragraph (b) of this section.


(d) *Owner and operator requirements.* Any requirement for an owner or operator or an owner and operator is a requirement for any individual that is either an owner or an operator.
