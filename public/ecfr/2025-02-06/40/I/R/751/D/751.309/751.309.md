# ยง 751.309   Phase-out of trichloroethylene use in vapor degreasing for rocket booster nozzles.

(a) In accordance with ยง 751.305(b)(11), until December 18, 2029, TCE may be used as a solvent in closed-loop batch vapor degreasing for rayon fabric scouring for end use in producing rocket booster nozzles for Federal agencies and their contractors, and manufactured (including imported), processed, and distributed in commerce for such use.


(b) From December 18, 2029, until December 18, 2034, TCE may only be used as a solvent in closed-loop batch vapor degreasing for rayon fabric scouring for end use in producing rocket booster nozzles, and manufactured (including imported), processed, and distributed in commerce for such use, by Federal agencies and their contractors who maintain records demonstrating that a final pre-launch test of rocket booster nozzles without using TCE was completed.


(c) If a suitable alternative to TCE is identified and validated before the end of this phase-out period, Federal agencies and their contractors must transition to that alternative.


(d) The owner or operator of the location where TCE is used as a solvent in closed-loop batch vapor degreasing for rayon fabric scouring for end use in producing rocket booster nozzles in accordance with this section, and manufacturers (including importers) and processors of TCE for such use, must comply with ยง 751.315.


(e) The owner or operator of the location where TCE is used as a solvent in closed-loop batch vapor degreasing for rayon fabric scouring for end use in producing rocket booster nozzles in accordance with this section must comply with the recordkeeping requirements in ยง 751.323.
