(b) Interim existing chemical exposure limit (interim ECEL)—(1) Applicability. The provisions of this paragraph (b) apply to any workplace engaged in the conditions of use listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (15) of this section.


(2) *Interim ECEL.* Beginning September 20, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by September 15, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, or beginning 120 days after introduction of TCE into the workplace if TCE use commences after June 16, 2025, the owner or operator must ensure that no person is exposed to an airborne concentration of TCE in excess of the interim ECEL, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and, if necessary, paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(3) *Exposure monitoring*—(i) *General.* (A) Owners or operators must determine each potentially exposed person's exposure, without regard to respiratory protection, by either:


(*1*) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each potentially exposed person's exposure; or


(*2*) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA of each exposure group.


(B) Personal breathing zone air samples are representative of the 8-hour TWA of all potentially exposed persons in an exposure group if the samples are of at least one person's work-shift exposure who represents the highest potential TCE exposures in that exposure group. Personal breathing zone air samples taken during one work shift may be used to represent potentially exposed person exposures on other work shifts where the owner or operator can document that the tasks performed and conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts.


(C) Exposure samples must be analyzed using an appropriate analytical method by a laboratory that complies with the Good Laboratory Practice Standards in 40 CFR part 792 or a laboratory accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or another industry-recognized program.


(D) Owners or operators must ensure that methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are accurate, to a confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of TCE.


(E) Owners and operators must re-monitor within 15 working days after receipt of any exposure monitoring when results indicate non-detect unless an Environmental Professional as defined at 40 CFR 312.10 or a Certified Industrial Hygienist reviews the monitoring results and determines re-monitoring is not necessary.


(ii) *Initial monitoring.* By June 21, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by June 16, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators or within 30 days of introduction of TCE into the workplace, whichever is later, each owner or operator covered by this section must perform initial monitoring of potentially exposed persons. Where the owner or operator has monitoring results from monitoring conducted within five years prior to February 18, 2025 and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the owner or operator may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.


(iii) *Periodic monitoring.* The owner or operator must establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic monitoring of exposure to TCE in accordance with Table 1.


(iv) *Additional monitoring.* (A) The owner or operator must conduct the exposure monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days after there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may reasonably be expected to result in new or additional exposures above the interim ECEL action level or when the owner or operator has any reason to believe that new or additional exposures above the interim ECEL action level have occurred. Prior monitoring data cannot be used to meet this requirement.


(B) Whenever start-ups or shutdown, or spills, leaks, ruptures, or other breakdowns or unexpected releases occur that may lead to exposure to potentially exposed persons, the owner or operator must conduct the exposure monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days after the conclusion of the start-up or shut down and/or the cleanup of the spill or repair of the leak, rupture, or other breakdown. Prior monitoring data cannot be used to meet this requirement.


(v) *Observation of monitoring.* (A) Owners and operators must provide potentially exposed persons or their designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of occupational exposure to TCE that is conducted under this section and designed to 









characterize their exposure.


(B) When monitoring observation requires entry into a regulated area, the owner or operator must provide the observers with the required PPE.


(C) Only persons who are authorized to have access to facilities classified in the interest of national security must be permitted to observe exposure monitoring conducted in such facilities.


(vi) *Notification of monitoring results.* (A) The owner or operator must inform each person whose exposures are monitored or who is part of a monitored exposure group, and their designated representative, of any monitoring results within 15 working days of receipt of those monitoring results.


(B) This notification must include the following:


(*1*) Exposure monitoring results;


(*2*) Identification and explanation of the interim ECEL and interim ECEL action level;


(*3*) Statement of whether the monitored airborne concentration of TCE exceeds the interim ECEL action level or interim ECEL;


(*4*) If the interim ECEL is exceeded, descriptions of any exposure controls implemented by the owner or operator to reduce exposure to or below the interim ECEL;


(*5*) Explanation of any respiratory protection provided in accordance with paragraphs (b)(4) and I of this section;


(*6*) Quantity of TCE in use at the time of monitoring;


(*7*) Location(s) of TCE use at the time of monitoring;


(*8*) Manner of TCE use at the time of monitoring; and


(*9*) Identified releases of TCE.


(C) Notice must be written, in plain language, and either provided to each potentially exposed person individually in a language that the person understands, or posted in an appropriate and accessible location outside the regulated area with an English-language version and a non-English language version representing the language of the largest group of workers who do not read English.


(4) *Regulated areas*—(i) *Establishment.* By September 20, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by September 15, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, or within 90 days after receipt of any exposure monitoring that indicates exposures exceeding the interim ECEL, the owner or operator must establish and maintain a regulated area wherever airborne concentrations of TCE exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed the interim ECEL.


(ii) *Access.* The owner or operator must limit access to regulated areas to authorized persons.


(iii) *Demarcation.* The owner or operator must demarcate regulated areas from the rest of the workplace in a manner that adequately establishes and alerts persons to the boundaries of the area and minimizes the number of authorized persons exposed to TCE within the regulated area.


(iv) *Provision of respirators.* (A) The owner or operator must ensure that each person who enters a regulated area is supplied with a respirator selected in accordance with paragraph I(e) of this section 

and must ensure that all persons within the regulated area are using the provided respirators whenever TCE exposures may exceed the interim ECEL, except as provided in paragraph (B) of this section.


(B) An owner or operator who has implemented all feasible controls as required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and who has established a regulated area as required by paragraphs (b)(4)(i) of this section where TCE exposure can be reliably predicted to exceed the interim ECEL only on certain days (for example, because of work or process schedule) must have persons use respirators in that regulated area on those days.


(v) *Prohibited activities.* (A) The owner or operator must ensure that, within a regulated area, persons do not engage in non-work activities which may increase TCE exposure.


(B) The owner or operator must ensure that while persons are wearing respirators in the regulated area, they do not engage in activities which interfere with respirator performance.


(c) *Interim ECEL control procedures and plan—(1) Methods of compliance.* (i) By December 17, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by December 18, 2025, for non-Federal owners and operators, the owner or operator must institute one or a combination of elimination, substitution, engineering controls or administrative controls to reduce exposure to or below the interim ECEL except to the extent that the owner or operator can demonstrate that such controls are not feasible as an interim measure, in accordance with the hierarchy of controls.


(ii) If the feasible controls required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section that can be instituted do not reduce exposures for potentially exposed persons to or below the interim ECEL, then the owner or operator must use such controls to reduce exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and must supplement those controls by the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.


(iii) Where an owner or operator cannot demonstrate exposure to TCE has been reduced to or below the interim ECEL through the use of controls required under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, and has not demonstrated that it has appropriately supplemented feasible exposure controls with respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, this will constitute a failure to comply with the interim ECEL.


(2) *Exposure control plan.* By December 17, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by December 18, 2025, for non-Federal owners and operators, each owner and operator must establish and implement an exposure control plan.


(i) *Exposure control plan contents.* The exposure control plan must include documentation of the following:


(A) Identification of exposure controls that were considered, including those that were used or not used to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, in the following sequence: elimination, substitution, engineering controls and administrative controls;


(B) For each exposure control considered, a rationale for why the exposure control was selected or not selected based on feasibility, effectiveness, and other relevant considerations;


(C) A description of actions the owner or operator must take to implement exposure controls selected, including proper installation, regular inspections, maintenance, training, or other actions;


(D) A description of each regulated area, how they are demarcated, and persons authorized to enter the regulated areas;


(E) Description of activities conducted by the owner or operator to review and update the exposure control plan to ensure effectiveness of the exposure controls, identify any necessary updates to the exposure controls, and confirm that all persons are properly implementing the exposure controls;


(F) An explanation of the procedures for responding to any change that may reasonably be expected to introduce additional sources of exposure to TCE, or otherwise result in increased exposure to TCE, including procedures for implementing corrective actions to mitigate exposure to TCE.


(ii) *Exposure control plan requirements.* (A) The owner or operator must not implement a schedule of personnel rotation as a means of compliance with the interim ECEL.


(B) The owner or operator must maintain the effectiveness of any controls instituted under this paragraph (c).


(C) The exposure control plan must be reviewed and updated as necessary, but at least every 5 years, to reflect any significant changes in the status of the owner or operator's approach to compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


(iii) *Availability of exposure control plan.* (A) Owners or operators must make the exposure control plan and associated records, including interim ECEL exposure monitoring records, interim ECEL compliance records, and workplace participation records available to potentially exposed persons and their designated representative.


(B) Owners or operators must notify potentially exposed persons and their designated representatives of the availability of the exposure control plan and associated records within 30 days of the date that the exposure control plan is completed and at least annually thereafter.


(C) Notice of the availability of the exposure control plan and associated records must be provided in plain language writing to each potentially exposed person in a language that the person understands or posted in an appropriate and accessible location outside the regulated area with an English-language version and a non-English language version representing the language of the largest group of workers who do not read English.


(D) Upon request by the potentially exposed person or their designated representative(s), the owner or operator must provide the specified records at a reasonable time, place, and manner. If the owner or operator is unable to provide the requested records within 15 working days, the owner or operator must, within those 15 working days, inform the potentially exposed person or designated representative(s) requesting the record(s) of the reason for the delay and the earliest date when the record will be made available.


(d) *Workplace information and training.* (1) By September 20, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by September 15, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, the owner or operator must institute a training program and ensure that persons potentially exposed to TCE participate in the program according to the requirements of this paragraph (d).


(2) The owner or operator must ensure that each potentially exposed person is trained prior to or at the time of initial assignment to a job involving potential exposure to TCE.


(3) The owner or operator must ensure that information and training is presented in a manner that is understandable to each person required to be trained.


(4) The following information and training must be provided to all persons potentially exposed to TCE:


(i) The requirements of this section, as well as how to access or obtain a copy of these requirements in the workplace;


(ii) The quantity, location, manner of use, release, and storage of TCE and the specific operations in the workplace that could result in exposure to TCE, particularly noting where each regulated area is located;
