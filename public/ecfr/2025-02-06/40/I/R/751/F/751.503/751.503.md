# ยง 751.503   Definitions.

The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart unless otherwise specified in this section. In addition, the following definitions apply to this subpart:


*Aftermarket automotive brakes and linings* means any automotive friction brake articles sold in the secondary market as replacement parts (e.g.,  brake pads, linings and shoes) used in disc and drum brake systems on automobiles and trucks.


*Article* means a manufactured item:


(1) Which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture;


(2) Which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and


(3) Which has either no change of chemical composition during its end use or only those changes of composition which have no commercial purpose separate from that of the article, and that result from a chemical reaction that occurs upon end use of other chemical substances, mixtures, or articles; except that fluids and particles are not considered articles regardless of shape or design.


*Authorized person* means any person specifically authorized by the owner or operator to enter, and whose duties require the person to enter, a regulated area.


*Chrysotile asbestos* is the asbestiform variety of a hydrated magnesium silicate mineral, with relatively long and flexible crystalline fibers that are capable of being woven.


*Disposal* means to discard, throw away, or otherwise complete or terminate the useful life of chrysotile asbestos, including any chrysotile asbestos-containing products or articles.


*Distribution in commerce* has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Act, but the term does not include distribution of chrysotile asbestos waste solely for purposes of disposal in accordance with this Subpart.


*Diaphragms* means semipermeable diaphragms, which separate the anode from the cathode chemicals in the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda).


*Gasket* means an article used to form a leakproof seal between fixed components.


*Membrane technology* means a chlor-alkali production technology that uses chlorine production cells in which the anode and the cathode are separated by an ion-exchange membrane that is designed to allow only sodium ions and some water to pass through it.


*Nuclear material* means any source material, special nuclear material, or byproduct material (as such terms are defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and regulations issued under such Act).


*Oilfield brake blocks* means the friction brake blocks component in drawworks used in the hoisting mechanism for oil well drilling rigs.


*Other gaskets* means gaskets other than *sheet gaskets in chemical production,* to include gaskets used in the exhaust systems of utility vehicles.


*Other vehicle friction products* means friction articles such as brakes and clutches, other than *aftermarket automotive brakes and linings,* installed on any vehicle, including on off-road vehicles, trains, planes, etc. *Other vehicle friction products* does not include articles used in the NASA Super Guppy Turbine aircraft, a specialty cargo plane used for the transportation of oversized equipment that is owned and operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).


*Owner or operator* means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a workplace covered by this subpart.


*Potentially exposed person* means any person who may be occupationally exposed to a chemical substance or mixture in a workplace as a result of a condition of use of that chemical substance or mixture.


*Processing* has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Act, but the term does not include processing of chrysotile asbestos waste solely for purposes of disposal in accordance with this subpart.


*Regulated area* means an area established by the regulated entity to demarcate where airborne concentrations of a specific chemical substance exceed, or there is a reasonable possibility they may exceed, the ECEL.


*Savannah River Site* means the Department of Energy's nuclear waste management and related national defense operations at its Savannah River Site in Aiken, Barnwell and Allendale counties in South Carolina, including operations at H-Canyon, F and H Tank Farms, Defense Waste Processing Facility, Savannah River National Laboratory and any on-site facility managed by Savannah River Nuclear Solutions.


*Sheet gaskets in chemical production* means gaskets cut from sheeting, including asbestos-containing rubberized sheeting, that are used in facilities for extreme condition applications such as titanium dioxide manufacturing, or processing nuclear material.
