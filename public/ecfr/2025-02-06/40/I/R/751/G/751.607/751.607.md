(2) *Eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) ECEL.* Beginning September 20, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, March 13, 2026 for non-Federal owners and operators, or beginning four months after introduction of PCE into the workplace if PCE use commences after December 15, 2025, the owner or operator must ensure that no person is exposed to an airborne concentration of PCE in excess of the ECEL, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and, if necessary, paragraph (f) of this section.


(3) *Exposure monitoring*—(i) *General.*

(A) Owners or operators must determine each potentially exposed person's exposure, without regard to respiratory protection, by either:


(*1*) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each potentially exposed person's exposure; or


(*2*) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA of each exposure group.


(B) Personal breathing zone air samples are representative of the 8-hour TWA of all potentially exposed persons in an exposure group if the samples are of at least one person's full-shift exposure who represents the highest potential PCE exposures in that exposure group. Personal breathing zone air samples taken during one work shift may be used to represent potentially exposed person exposures on other work shifts where the owner or operator can document that the tasks performed and conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts.


(C) Exposure samples must be analyzed using an appropriate analytical method by a laboratory that complies with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Standards in 40 CFR part 792 or a laboratory accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or another industry-recognized program.


(D) Owners or operators must ensure that methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are accurate, to a confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of PCE.


(E) Owners and operators must re-monitor within 15 working days after receipt of any exposure monitoring when results indicate non-detect, unless an Environmental Professional as defined at 40 CFR 312.10 or a Certified Industrial Hygienist reviews the monitoring results and determines re-monitoring is not necessary.


(ii) *Initial monitoring.* By June 21, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, by December 15, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, or within 30 days of introduction of PCE into the workplace, whichever is later, each owner or operator covered by this section must perform initial monitoring of potentially exposed persons. Where the owner or operator has monitoring results from monitoring conducted within five years prior to February 18, 2025 and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the owner or operator may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.


(iii) *Periodic monitoring.* The owner or operator must establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic monitoring of exposure to PCE in accordance with table 1.


(iv) *Additional monitoring.* (A) The owner or operator must conduct the exposure monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days after there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may reasonably be expected to result in new or additional exposures above the ECEL action level or when the owner or operator has any reason to believe that new or additional exposures above the ECEL action level have occurred. Prior monitoring data cannot be used to meet this requirement.


(B) Whenever start-ups or shutdowns, or spills, leaks, ruptures or other breakdowns or unexpected releases occur that may lead to exposure to potentially exposed persons, the owner or operator must conduct the exposure monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days after the conclusion of the start-up or shutdown and/or the cleanup of the spill or repair of the leak, rupture or other breakdown. Prior monitoring data cannot be used to meet this requirement.


(v) *Observation of monitoring.* (A) Owners and operators must provide potentially exposed persons or their designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of occupational exposure to PCE that is conducted under this section and designed to characterize their exposure.


(B) When monitoring observation requires entry into a regulated area, the owner or operator must provide the observers with the required PPE.


(C) Only persons who are authorized to have access to facilities classified in the interest of national security must be permitted to observe exposure monitoring conducted in such facilities.


(vi) *Notification of monitoring results.* (A) The owner or operator must inform each person whose exposures are monitored or who is part of a monitored exposure group and their designated representatives of any monitoring results within 15 working days of receipt of those monitoring results.


(B) This notification must include the following:


(*1*) Exposure monitoring results;


(*2*) Identification and explanation of the ECEL and ECEL action level;


(3) Statement of whether the monitored airborne concentration of PCE exceeds the ECEL action level or ECEL;


(*4*) If the ECEL is exceeded, descriptions of any exposure controls implemented by the owner or operator to reduce exposures to or below the ECEL, as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section;


(*5*) Explanation of any respiratory protection provided in accordance with paragraphs (b)(4)(iv), (d)(1)(i), and (f) of this section;
