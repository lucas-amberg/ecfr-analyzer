(B) The basis for specific PPE selection (*e.g.,* demonstration based on permeation testing or manufacturer specifications that each item of PPE selected provides an impervious barrier to prevent exposure during expected duration and conditions of exposure, including the likely combinations of chemical substances to which the PPE may be exposed in the work area);


(C) Appropriately sized PPE and training on proper application, wear, and removal of PPE, and proper care/disposal of PPE;


(D) Occurrence and duration of any direct dermal contact with PCE that occurs during any activity or malfunction at the workplace that causes direct dermal exposures to occur and/or glove breakthrough, and corrective actions to be taken during and immediately following that activity or malfunction to prevent direct dermal contact to PCE; and


(E) Training in accordance with § 751.607(f)(3).


(iii) Information and training provided as required in § 751.607(e).


(4) *Workplace participation.* Owners or operators must document the notice to and ability of any potentially exposed person that may reasonably be affected by PCE inhalation exposure or direct dermal contact and their designated representatives to readily access the exposure control plans, facility exposure monitoring records, PPE program implementation records, or any other information relevant to PCE exposure in the workplace.


(c) *Workplace requirements for laboratory use compliance.* Owners and operators subject to the laboratory chemical requirements described in § 751.609 must retain records of:


(1) Dermal protection used by each potentially exposed person and PPE program implementation, as described in § 751.615(b)(3)(ii);
