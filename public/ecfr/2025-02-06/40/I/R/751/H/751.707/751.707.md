(b) *Existing chemical exposure limit (ECEL)*—(1) *Eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) ECEL.* Beginning September 20, 2027 for Federal agencies or Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by September 9, 2026 for non-Federal owners and operators, or beginning four months after introduction of carbon tetrachloride into the workplace if carbon tetrachloride commences after June 11, 2026, the owner or operator must ensure that no person is exposed to an airborne concentration of carbon tetrachloride in excess of the ECEL, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and, if necessary, paragraph (f) of this section.


(2) *Exposure monitoring*—(i) *General.* (A) Owners or operators must determine each potentially exposed person's exposure, without regard to respiratory protection, by either:


(*1*) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each potentially exposed person's exposure; or


(*2*) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA of each exposure group.


(B) Personal breathing zone air samples are representative of the 8-hour TWA of all potentially exposed persons in an exposure group if the samples are of at least one person's full-shift exposure who represents the highest potential carbon tetrachloride exposures in that exposure group. Personal breathing zone air samples taken during one work shift may be used to represent potentially exposed person exposures on other work shifts where the owner or operator can document that the tasks performed and conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts.


(C) Exposure samples must be analyzed using an appropriate analytical method by a laboratory that complies with the Good Laboratory Practice Standards in 40 CFR part 792 or a laboratory accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or another industry-recognized program.


(D) Owners or operators must ensure that methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are accurate, to a confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of carbon tetrachloride.


(E) Owners and operators must re-monitor within 15 working days after receipt of any exposure monitoring when results indicate non-detect, unless an Environmental Professional as defined at 40 CFR 312.10 or a Certified Industrial Hygienist reviews the exposure monitoring results and determines re-monitoring is not necessary.


(ii) *Initial monitoring.* By June 21, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by June 11, 2026 for non-Federal owners and operators, or within 30 days of introduction of carbon tetrachloride into the workplace, whichever is later, each owner or operator covered by this section must perform initial monitoring of potentially exposed persons. Where the owner or operator has monitoring results from monitoring conducted within five years prior to February 18, 2025 and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the owner or operator may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).


(iii) *Periodic monitoring.* The owner or operator must establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic monitoring of exposure to carbon tetrachloride in accordance with Table 1.


(iv) *Additional exposure monitoring.* (A) The owner or operator must conduct additional exposure monitoring within a reasonable timeframe whenever there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may reasonably be expected to result in new or additional exposures above the ECEL or when the owner or operator has any reason to believe that new or additional exposures above the ECEL action level have occurred.


(B) Whenever start-ups or shutdowns, or ruptures, malfunctions or other breakdowns or unexpected releases occur that may lead to exposure to potentially exposed persons, the owner or operator must conduct the additional exposure monitoring within a reasonable timeframe after the conclusion of the start-up or shutdown and/or the cleanup, repair or remedial action of the malfunction or other breakdown or unexpected release. Prior monitoring data cannot be used to meet this requirement.


(v) *Observation of monitoring.* (A) Owners and operators must provide potentially exposed persons or their designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of occupational exposure to CTC that is conducted under this section and designed to characterize their exposure.


(B) When monitoring observation requires entry into a regulated area, the owner or operator must provide the observers with the required PPE.


(C) Only persons who are authorized to have access to facilities classified in the interest of national security must be permitted to observe exposure monitoring conducted in such facilities.


(vi) *Notification of monitoring results.* (A) The owner or operator must inform each person whose exposures are monitored or who is part of a monitored exposure group and their designated representatives of any monitoring results within 15 working days of receipt of those monitoring results.

(B) If the feasible controls required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section that can be instituted do not reduce exposures for potentially exposed persons to or below the ECEL, then the owner or operator must use such controls to reduce exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and must supplement those controls with the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.


(C) Where an owner or operator cannot demonstrate exposure to carbon tetrachloride has been reduced to or below the ECEL through the use of controls required under paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, and has not demonstrated that it has appropriately supplemented with respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, this will constitute a failure to comply with the ECEL.


(D) The owner or operator must ensure that any engineering controls instituted under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section do not increase emissions of carbon tetrachloride to ambient air outside the workplace.


(ii) *Direct dermal contact controls (DDCC).* (A) The owner or operator must institute one or a combination of elimination, substitution, engineering controls, or administrative controls to prevent all persons from direct dermal contact with carbon tetrachloride except to the extent that the owner or operator can demonstrate that such controls are not feasible.


(B) If the feasible controls required under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section that can be instituted do not prevent direct dermal contact with carbon tetrachloride, then the owner or operator must use such controls to reduce direct dermal contact to the extent achievable by these controls and must supplement those controls by the use of dermal protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
