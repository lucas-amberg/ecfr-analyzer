# ยง 751.709   Workplace Restrictions for the Industrial and Commercial Use as a Laboratory Chemical, Including the Use of Carbon Tetrachloride as a Laboratory Chemical by the U.S. Department of Defense.

(a) *Applicability.* The provisions of this section apply to the industrial and commercial use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical, including the U.S. Department of Defense's industrial and commercial use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical in chemical weapons destruction.


(b) *Laboratory chemical requirements.* (1) After December 18, 2025 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or after June 16, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, owners or operators must ensure laboratory ventilation devices such as fume hoods or glove boxes are in use and functioning properly and that specific measures are taken to ensure proper and adequate performance of such equipment to minimize exposures to potentially exposed persons in the area when carbon tetrachloride is used as a laboratory chemical, except for the U.S. Department of Defense's use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical in chemical weapons destruction.


(2) After December 18, 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense must ensure that advanced engineering controls are in use and functioning properly and that specific measures are taken to ensure proper and adequate performance of such equipment to minimize exposures to potentially exposed persons in the area during the industrial/commercial use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical in chemical weapons destruction.


(3) After December 18, 2025 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or after June 16, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, owners or operators must ensure that all persons reasonably likely to be exposed from direct dermal contact to carbon tetrachloride when carbon tetrachloride is used as a laboratory chemical, except for the U.S. Department of Defense's industrial and commercial use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical in chemical weapons destruction, are provided with dermal PPE and training on proper use of PPE in a manner consistent with ยง 751.707(f)(3).


(4) After December 18, 2025, U.S. Department of Defense must ensure that all persons reasonably likely to be exposed from direct dermal contact to carbon tetrachloride through the industrial and commercial use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical in chemical weapons destruction are provided with dermal PPE and training on proper use of PPE in a manner consistent with ยง 751.707(f)(3), except that the date listed in paragraph (f)(3)(i) does not apply.
