# § 751.713   Recordkeeping Requirements.

(a) *General records.* After February 18, 2025, all persons who manufacture (including import), process, distribute in commerce, or engage in industrial or commercial use of carbon tetrachloride must maintain ordinary business records, such as downstream notifications, invoices and bills-of-lading related to compliance with the prohibitions, restrictions, and other provisions of this subpart.


(b) *Workplace Chemical Protection Program compliance*—(1) *ECEL exposure monitoring.* For each monitoring event, owners or operators subject to the ECEL described in § 751.707(b) must document and retain records of the following:


(i) Dates, duration, and results of each sample taken;


(ii) The quantity, location(s) and manner of use of carbon tetrachloride in use at the time of each monitoring event;


(iii) All measurements that may be necessary to determine the conditions that may affect the monitoring results;


(iv) Name, workplace address, work shift, job classification, work area, and type of respiratory protection (if any) by each monitored person;


(v) Identification of all potentially exposed persons that a monitored person is intended to represent if using a representative sample, consistent with § 751.707(b)(2)(i)(A) and (B);


(vi) Sampling and analytical methods used as described in § 751.707(b)(2)(i)(D);


(vii) Compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice Standards in 40 CFR part 792, or use of laboratory accredited by the AIHA or another industry-recognized program, as required by § 751.707(b)(2)(i)(C); and


(viii) Information regarding air monitoring equipment, including: type, maintenance, calibrations, performance tests, limits of detection, and any malfunctions;


(ix) Re-monitoring determinations conducted by an Environmental Professional as defined at 40 CFR 312.10 or a Certified Industrial Hygienist, if results indicated non-detect; and


(x) Notification of exposure monitoring results in accordance with § 751.707(b)(2)(v).


(2) *ECEL compliance.* Owners or operators subject to the ECEL described in § 751.707(b) must retain records of:


(i) Exposure control plan as described in § 751.707(d)(2);


(ii) Implementation of the exposure control plan as described in § 751.707(d)(2), including:


(A) Any regular inspections, evaluations, and updating of the exposure controls to maintain effectiveness;


(B) Confirmation that all persons are implementing the exposure controls; and


(C) Each occurrence and duration of any start-up, shutdown, ruptures, or malfunction of the facility that causes an exceedance of the ECEL, any subsequent corrective actions taken by the owner or operator during the start-up, shutdown, ruptures, or malfunctions to mitigate exposures to CTC, and documentation indicating that additional monitoring was completed within a reasonable timeframe.


(iii) Respiratory protection used by each potentially exposed person and PPE program implementation as described in § 751.707(f)(2) including:


(A) The name, workplace address, work shift, job classification, work area of each potentially exposed person, and the type of respiratory protection provided to each potentially exposed person;


(B) The basis for the specific respiratory protection selection in accordance with § 751.707(f)(2); and


(C) Fit testing and training in accordance with § 751.707(f)(2).


(iv) Information and training as required in § 751.707(e).


(3) *DDCC compliance.* Owners or operators subject to DDCC requirements described in § 751.707(c) must retain records of:


(i) Exposure control plan as described in § 751.707(d)(2);


(ii) Dermal protection used by each potentially exposed person and PPE program implementation as described in § 751.707(f)(3), including:


(A) The name, workplace address, work shift, job classification, and work area of each person reasonably likely to directly handle carbon tetrachloride or handle equipment or materials on which carbon tetrachloride may be present and the type of PPE selected to be worn by each of these persons;


(B) The basis for specific PPE selection (*e.g.,* demonstration based on permeation testing or manufacturer specifications that each item of PPE selected provides an impervious barrier to prevent exposure during expected duration and conditions of exposure, including the likely combinations of chemical substances to which the PPE may be exposed in the work area);


(C) Appropriately sized PPE and training on proper application, wear, and removal of PPE, and proper care/disposal of PPE;


(D) Occurrence and duration of any direct dermal contact with carbon tetrachloride that occurs during any activity or malfunction at the workplace that causes direct dermal exposures to occur and/or glove breakthrough, and corrective actions to be taken during and immediately following that activity or malfunction to prevent direct dermal contact to carbon tetrachloride; and


(E) Training in accordance with § 751.707(f)(3).


(iii) Information and training provided as required in § 751.707(e).


(4) *Workplace participation.* Owners or operators must document the notice to and ability of any potentially exposed person that may reasonably be affected by carbon tetrachloride inhalation exposure or direct dermal contact and their designated representatives to readily access the exposure control plans, facility exposure monitoring records, PPE program implementation records, or any other information relevant to carbon tetrachloride exposure in the workplace.


(c) *Workplace requirements* for *laboratory use compliance.* Owners and operators subject to the laboratory chemical requirements described in § 751.709 must retain records of:


(1) Dermal protection used by each potentially exposed person and PPE program implementation, as described in § 751.713(b)(3)(ii); and


(2) Documentation identifying criteria that the owner or operator will use to determine and implement control measures to reduce potentially exposed persons' exposure to carbon tetrachloride including laboratory ventilation devices;


(3) Documentation identifying: implementation of a properly functioning laboratory ventilation devices using manufacturer's instructions for installation, use, and maintenance of the devices including inspections, tests, development of maintenance procedures, the establishment of criteria for acceptable test results, and documentation of test and inspection results, except for the U.S. Department of Defense's use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical in chemical weapons destruction; and


(4) For the U.S. Department of Defense's use of carbon tetrachloride as a laboratory chemical in chemical weapons destruction, documentation identifying implementation of advanced engineering controls that are in use and functioning properly and specific measures taken to ensure proper and adequate performance.


(d) *Retention.* Owners or operators must retain the records required under this section for a period of five years from the date that such records were generated.
