# § 761.64   Disposal of wastes generated as a result of research and development activities authorized under § 761.30(j) and chemical analysis of PCBs.

This section provides disposal requirements for wastes generated during and as a result of research and development authorized under § 761.30(j). This section also provides disposal requirements for wastes generated during the chemical analysis of samples containing PCBs under part 761, including §§ 761.30, 761.60, 761.61, 761.62, and 761.79. For determining the presence of PCBs in samples, chemical analysis includes: sample preparation, sample extraction, extract cleanup, extract concentration, addition of PCB standards, and instrumental analysis.


(a) Portions of samples of a size designated in a chemical extraction and analysis method for PCBs and extracted for purposes of determining the presence of PCBs or concentration of PCBs are unregulated for PCB disposal under this part.


(b) All other wastes generated during these activities are regulated for disposal based on their concentration at the time of disposal as follows:


(1) Liquid wastes, including rinse solvents, must be disposed of according to § 761.61(a)(5)(iv).


(2) Non-liquid wastes must be disposed of in the same manner as non-liquid cleaning materials and personal protective equipment waste according to § 761.61(a)(5)(v)(A).
