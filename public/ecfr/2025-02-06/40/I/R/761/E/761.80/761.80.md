If there is such a change, a new exemption petition must be submitted to EPA and it will be addressed through an exemption rulemaking. In such a case, the activities granted under the existing exemption may continue until the new petition is addressed by rulemaking, but must conform to the terms of the existing exemption approved by EPA.
