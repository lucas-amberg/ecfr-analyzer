# § 761.185   Certification program and retention of records by importers and persons generating PCBs in excluded manufacturing processes.

(a) In addition to meeting the basic requirements of § 761.1(f) and the definition of excluded manufacturing processes at § 761.3, manufacturers with processes inadvertently generating PCBs and importers of products containing inadvertently generated PCBs must report to EPA any excluded manufacturing process or imports for which the concentration of PCBs in products leaving the manufacturing site or imported is greater than 2 micrograms per gram (2 µg/g, roughly 2 ppm) for any resolvable gas chromatographic peak. Such reports must be filed by October 1, 1984 or, if no processes or imports require reports at the time, within 90 days of having processes or imports for which such reports are required.


(b) Manufacturers required to report by paragraph (a) of this section must transmit a letter notifying EPA of the number, the type, and the location of excluded manufacturing processes in which PCBs are generated when the PCB level in products leaving any manufacturing site is greater than 2 µg/g for any resolvable gas chromatographic peak. Importers required to report by paragraph (a) of this section must transmit a letter notifying EPA of the concentration of PCBs in imported products when the PCB concentration of products being imported is greater than 2 µg/g for any resolvable gas chromatographic peak. Persons must also certify the following:


(1) Their compliance with all applicable requirements of § 761.1(f), including any applicable requirements for air and water releases and process waste disposal.


(2) Whether determinations of compliance are based on actual monitoring of PCB levels or on theoretical assessments.


(3) That such determinations of compliance are being maintained.


(4) If the determination of compliance is based on a theoretical assessment, the letter must also notify EPA of the estimated PCB concentration levels generated and released.


(c) Any person who reports pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section:


(1) Must have performed either a theoretical analysis or actual monitoring of PCB concentrations.


(2) Must maintain for a period of three years after ceasing process operations or importation, or for seven years, whichever is shorter, records containing the following information:


(i) *Theoretical analysis.* Manufacturers records must include: the reaction or reactions believed to be generating PCBs; the levels of PCBs generated; and the levels of PCBs released. Importers records must include: the reaction or reactions believed to be generating PCBs and the levels of PCBs generated; the basis for all estimations of PCB concentrations; and the name and qualifications of the person or persons performing the theoretical analysis; or


(ii) *Actual monitoring.* (A) The method of analysis. 


(B) The results of the analysis, including data from the Quality Assurance Plan.


(C) Description of the sample matrix.


(D) The name of the analyst or analysts.


(E) The date and time of the analysis.


(F) Numbers for the lots from which the samples are taken.


(d) The certification required by paragraph (b) of this section must be signed by a responsible corporate officer. This certification must be maintained by each facility or importer for a period of three years after ceasing process operation or importation, or for seven years, whichever is shorter, and must be made available to EPA upon request. For the purpose of this section, a responsible corporate officer means:


(1) A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation.


(2) The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25,000,000 (in second quarter 1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.


(e) Any person signing a document under paragraph (d) of this section shall also make the following certification:


(f) This report must be submitted to the Document Control Office (DCO) (7407M), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001, ATTN: PCB Notification. This report must be submitted by October 1, 1984 or within 90 days of starting up processes or commencing importation of PCBs.


(g) This certification process must be repeated whenever process conditions are significantly modified to make the previous certification no longer valid.
