# § 761.298   Decisions based on PCB concentration measurements resulting from sampling.

(a) For grid samples which are chemically analyzed individually, the PCB concentration applies to the area of inference as described in § 761.283(d).


(b) For grid samples analyzed as part of a composite sample, the PCB concentration applies to the area of inference of the composite sample as described in § 761.283(d) (i.e., the area of inference is the total of the areas of the individual samples included in the composite).


(c) For coordinate pair samples analyzed as part of a composite sample, in accordance with §§ 761.283(c)(2) and 761.289(b)(2)(ii), the PCB concentration applies to the entire cleanup site.
