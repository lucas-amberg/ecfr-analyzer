# ยง 761.312   Compositing of samples.

For a surface originally contaminated by a single source of PCBs with a uniform concentration, it is permissible to composite surface wipe test samples and to use the composite measurement to represent the PCB concentration of the entire surface. Composite samples consist of more than one sample gauze extracted and chemically analyzed together resulting in a single measurement. The composite measurement represents an arithmetic mean of the composited samples.


(a) *Compositing samples from surfaces to be used or reused.* For small or irregularly shaped surfaces or large nearly flat surfaces, if the surfaces are contaminated by a single source of PCBs with a uniform concentration, composite a maximum of three adjacent samples.


(b) *Compositing samples from surfaces to be disposed of off-site or on-site.* (1) For small or irregularly shaped surfaces, composite a maximum of three adjacent samples.


(2) For large nearly flat surfaces, composite a maximum of 10 adjacent samples.
