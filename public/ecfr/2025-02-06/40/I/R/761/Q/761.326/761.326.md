# § 761.326   Conducting the comparison study.

Extract or analyze the comparison study samples using the alternative method. For an alternative extraction method or alternative analytical method to be comparable to the methods required in § 761.292, all of the following conditions must be met.


(a) All samples having PCB concentrations greater than or equal to the level of concern, as measured by the methods required in § 761.292, are found to be greater than or equal to the level of concern as measured by the alternative method (no false negatives).


(b) Only one sample which contains PCBs at a level less than the level of concern, as measured by the methods required in § 761.292, is found to have a PCB concentration greater than the level of concern as measured by the alternative method (false positive); and all other samples which contain PCBs at levels less than the level of concern, as measured by the methods required in § 761.292, are found by the alternative method to have PCBs less than the level of concern (there are no additional false positives).
