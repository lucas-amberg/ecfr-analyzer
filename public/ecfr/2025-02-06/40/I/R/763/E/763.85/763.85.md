# § 763.85   Inspection and reinspections.

(a) *Inspection.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, before October 12, 1988, local education agencies shall inspect each school building that they lease, own, or otherwise use as a school building to identify all locations of friable and nonfriable ACBM. 


(2) Any building leased or acquired on or after October 12, 1988, that is to be used as a school building shall be inspected as described under paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section prior to use as a school building. In the event that emergency use of an uninspected building as a school building is necessitated, such buildings shall be inspected within 30 days after commencement of such use. 


(3) Each inspection shall be made by an accredited inspector. 


(4) For each area of a school building, except as excluded under § 763.99, each person performing an inspection shall: 


(i) Visually inspect the area to identify the locations of all suspected ACBM.


(ii) Touch all suspected ACBM to determine whether they are friable. 


(iii) Identify all homogeneous areas of friable suspected ACBM and all homogeneous areas of nonfriable suspected ACBM. 


(iv) Assume that some or all of the homogeneous areas are ACM, and, for each homogeneous area that is not assumed to be ACM, collect and submit for analysis bulk samples under §§ 763.86 and 763.87. 


(v) Assess, under § 763.88, friable material in areas where samples are collected, friable material in areas that are assumed to be ACBM, and friable ACBM identified during a previous inspection. 


(vi) Record the following and submit to the person designated under § 763.84 a copy of such record for inclusion in the management plan within 30 days of the inspection: 


(A) An inspection report with the date of the inspection signed by each accredited person making the inspection, State of accreditation, and if applicable, his or her accreditation number. 


(B) An inventory of the locations of the homogeneous areas where samples are collected, exact location where each bulk sample is collected, dates that samples are collected, homogeneous areas where friable suspected ACBM is assumed to be ACM, and homogeneous areas where nonfriable suspected ACBM is assumed to be ACM. 


(C) A description of the manner used to determine sampling locations, the name and signature of each accredited inspector who collected the samples, State of accreditation, and, if applicable, his or her accreditation number. 


(D) A list of whether the homogeneous areas identified under paragraph (a)(4)(vi)(B) of this section, are surfacing material, thermal system insulation, or miscellaneous material. 


(E) Assessments made of friable material, the name and signature of each accredited inspector making the assessment, State of accreditation, and if applicable, his or her accreditation number. 


(b) *Reinspection.* (1) At least once every 3 years after a management plan is in effect, each local education agency shall conduct a reinspection of all friable and nonfriable known or assumed ACBM in each school building that they lease, own, or otherwise use as a school building. 


(2) Each inspection shall be made by an accredited inspector. 


(3) For each area of a school building, each person performing a reinspection shall: 


(i) Visually reinspect, and reassess, under § 763.88, the condition of all friable known or assumed ACBM. 


(ii) Visually inspect material that was previously considered nonfriable ACBM and touch the material to determine whether it has become friable since the last inspection or reinspection. 


(iii) Identify any homogeneous areas with material that has become friable since the last inspection or reinspection. 


(iv) For each homogeneous area of newly friable material that is already assumed to be ACBM, bulk samples may be collected and submitted for analysis in accordance with §§ 763.86 and 763.87. 


(v) Assess, under § 763.88, the condition of the newly friable material in areas where samples are collected, and newly friable materials in areas that are assumed to be ACBM. 


(vi) Reassess, under § 763.88, the condition of friable known or assumed ACBM previously identified. 


(vii) Record the following and submit to the person designated under § 763.84 a copy of such record for inclusion in the management plan within 30 days of the reinspection: 


(A) The date of the reinspection, the name and signature of the person making the reinspection, State of accreditation, and if applicable, his or her accreditation number, and any changes in the condition of known or assumed ACBM. 


(B) The exact locations where samples are collected during the reinspection, a description of the manner used to determine sampling locations, the name and signature of each accredited inspector who collected the samples, State of accreditation, and, if applicable, his or her accreditation number. 


(C) Any assessments or reassessments made of friable material, the name and signature of the accredited inspector making the assessments, State of accreditation, and if applicable, his or her accreditation number. 


(c) *General.* Thermal system insulation that has retained its structural integrity and that has an undamaged protective jacket or wrap that prevents fiber release shall be treated as nonfriable and therefore is subject only to periodic surveillance and preventive measures as necessary.
