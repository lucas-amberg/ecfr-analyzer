(a) Local education agencies shall have bulk samples, collected under § 763.86 and submitted for analysis, analyzed for asbestos using laboratories accredited by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS).

(c)(1) A homogeneous area is considered not to contain ACM only if the results of all samples required to be collected from the area show asbestos in amounts of 1 percent or less. 


(2) A homogeneous area shall be determined to contain ACM based on a finding that the results of at least one sample collected from that area shows that asbestos is present in an amount greater than 1 percent.
