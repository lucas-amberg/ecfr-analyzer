# § 770.18   Ultra low-emitting formaldehyde resins.

(a) Producers of composite wood product panels made with ultra low-emitting formaldehyde resins may apply to an EPA TSCA Title VI TPC or CARB for approval either to conduct less frequent testing than is specified in § 770.20 or approval for a two-year exemption from the testing requirements in § 770.20 and certification requirements in §§ 770.15 and 770.40(b). The application must contain the following:


(1) The panel producer's name, address, and telephone number;


(2) An identification of the specific product type, including resin system;


(3) At least two tests conducted under the supervision of an EPA TSCA Title VI TPC pursuant to test method ASTM E1333-14 or ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99). Test results obtained by ASTM D6007-14 must include a showing of equivalence in accordance with § 770.20(d)(1); and


(4) Six months of routine quality control tests under § 770.20, including a showing of correlation in accordance with § 770.20(d)(2), totaling not less than twenty-six quality control tests.


(b) The EPA TSCA Title VI TPC will approve a panel producer's application within 90 calendar days of receipt if the application is complete and demonstrates that the candidate product achieves the emission standards required for reduced testing as described in paragraph (c) of this section or the emission standards required for a two-year exemption as described in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) As measured according to paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the emission standards for reduced testing for composite wood products made with ultra low-emitting formaldehyde resins are as follows:


(1) No test result higher than 0.05 parts per million (ppm) of formaldehyde for hardwood plywood, 0.08 ppm for particleboard, 0.09 ppm for medium-density fiberboard, and 0.11 ppm for thin medium-density fiberboard.


(2) For 90% of the six months of routine quality control testing data required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, no higher than 0.05 ppm of formaldehyde for particleboard, no higher than 0.06 ppm of formaldehyde for medium-density fiberboard, and no higher than 0.08 ppm of formaldehyde for thin medium-density fiberboard.


(d) As measured according to paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the emission standards for an exemption from the testing and certification requirements of § 770.20 for composite wood products made with ultra low-emitting formaldehyde resins are as follows:


(1) No test result higher than 0.05 ppm of formaldehyde for hardwood plywood or 0.06 ppm of formaldehyde for particleboard, medium-density fiberboard, and thin medium-density fiberboard.




(2) Ninety percent of six months of routine quality control testing data and the results of two quarterly primary or secondary method tests (required under paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section) must be shown to be no higher than an ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde resins (ULEF)-target value of 0.04 ppm.








(e) Products that have obtained an exemption from the California Air Resources Board will also be exempt from the requirements in §§ 770.15, 770.20, and 770.40(b) if they meet the requirements under § 770.18(d) and the requirements of the California Air Resources Board remain as stringent as EPA's requirements. Products that have obtained approval for reduced testing from the California Air Resources Board will be granted approval to conduct less frequent testing than is specified in § 770.20 if they meet the requirements under § 770.18(c) and the requirements of the California Air Resources Board remain as stringent as EPA's requirements.


(f) Products that are represented by a quarterly test result that exceeds the applicable emission standard in this section or a quality control test that indicates that the product exceeds the applicable emission standard in this section lose their reduced testing approval and must reapply as specified under § 770.18(a).


(g) After the two-year period of the initial exemption, and every two years thereafter, in order to continue to qualify for the exemption from the testing and certification requirements, the panel producer must reapply to an EPA TSCA Title VI TPC or CARB and obtain at least two test results in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section that comply with the emission standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(h) Any time there is an operational or process change such as a change in resin formulation, press cycle duration, temperature, or amount of resin used per panel, at least five quality control tests under § 770.20 and at least one test result in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section that indicate compliance with the emission standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are required.


(i) A change in the resin system invalidates the exemption or reduced testing approval for any product type produced after such a change.
