# § 790.52   Phase II test rule.

(a) If EPA determines that the proposed study plan described in § 790.50(a)(2) complies with § 790.50(c), EPA will publish a proposed Phase II test rule in the _Federal Register_ requesting comments on the ability of the proposed study plan to ensure that data from the test will be reliable and adequate.
