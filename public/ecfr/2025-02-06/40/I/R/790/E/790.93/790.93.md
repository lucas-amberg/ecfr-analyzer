(a) EPA shall terminate a conditional exemption if it determines that:


(1) The test which provided the basis for approval of the exemption application has not been started by the deadlines for initiation of testing adopted in the test rule or modified in accordance with § 790.55; or


(2) Data required by the test rule have not been generated in accordance with the test standards or submitted in accordance with the deadlines for submission of test data that were adopted in the test rule or modified in accordance with § 790.55; or


(3) The testing has not been conducted or the data have not been generated in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice requirements in part 792 of this chapter.


(b) If EPA determines that one or more of the criteria listed in paragraph (a) of this section has been met, EPA will notify each holder of an affected conditional exemption by certified mail or _Federal Register_ notice of EPA's intent to terminate that conditional exemption.


(c) Within 30 days after receipt of a letter notification or publication of a notice in the _Federal Register_ that EPA intends to terminate a conditional exemption, the exemption holder may submit information using the method specified in § 790.5(b) either to rebut EPA's preliminary decision or notify EPA of its intent to conduct the required test pursuant to the test standard established in the test rule. Such a letter of intent shall contain all of the information required by § 790.45(c).
