# ยง 791.27   Pre-hearing preparation.

(a) *Responses to requests for hearings.* After filing of the request for hearing, if any other party desires to file an answer it shall be made in writing and filed with the American Arbitration Association, and a copy thereof shall be mailed to the other parties within a period of fourteen days from the date of receiving the complete list of parties. After the hearing officer is appointed, however, no new or different claim may be submitted except with the hearing officer's consent.


(b) *Pre-hearing conference.* At the request of the parties or at the discretion of the American Arbitration Association, a pre-hearing conference with a representative of the American Arbitration Association and the parties or their counsel will be scheduled in appropriate cases to arrange for an exchange of information and the stipulation of uncontested facts so as to expedite the proceedings.


(c) *Fixing of locale.* The parties may mutually agree on the locale where the hearing is to be held. If the locale is not designated within 45 days from the time the complete list of parties is received, the American Arbitration Association shall have power to determine the locale. Its decision shall be final and binding. If any party requests, and informs the other parties of its request, that the hearing be held in a specific locale and the other parties file no objection thereto within 14 days of the request, the locale shall be the one requested.


(d) *Time and place.* The hearing officer shall fix the time and place for each hearing. The American Arbitration Association will mail notice to each party at least 14 days in advance.
