# ยง 792.17   Effects of non-compliance.

(a) The sponsor or any other person who is conducting or has conducted a test to fulfill the requirements of a testing consent agreement or a test rule issued under section 4 of TSCA will be in violation of section 15 of TSCA if:


(1) The test is not being or was not conducted in accordance with any requirement of this part;


(2) Data or information submitted to EPA under this part (including the statement required by ยง 792.12) include information or data that are false or misleading, contain significant omissions, or otherwise do not fulfill the requirements of this part; or


(3) Entry in accordance with ยง 792.15 for the purpose of auditing test data or inspecting test facilities is denied. Persons who violate the provisions of this part may be subject to civil or criminal penalties under section 16 of TSCA, legal action in United States district court under section 17 of TSCA, or criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 2 or 1001.


(b) EPA, at its discretion, may not consider reliable for purposes of showing that a chemical substance or mixture does not present a risk of injury to health or the environment any study which was not conducted in accordance with this part. EPA, at its discretion, may rely upon such studies for purposes of showing adverse effects. The determination that a study will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the sponsor of a required test of the obligation under any applicable statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA.


(c) If data submitted to fulfill a requirement of a testing consent agreement or a test rule issued under section 4 of TSCA are not developed in accordance with this part, EPA may determine that the sponsor has not fulfilled its obligations under section 4 of TSCA and may require the sponsor to develop data in accordance with the requirements of this part in order to satisfy such obligations.
