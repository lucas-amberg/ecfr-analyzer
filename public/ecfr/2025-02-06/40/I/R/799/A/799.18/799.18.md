# ยง 799.18   Chemicals subject of test rules or consent orders for which the testing reimbursement period has passed.

The following table lists substances and mixtures that have been the subjects of section 4 testing actions and for which the testing reimbursement period has terminated (sunset). The _Federal Register_ citation in the table is for the final rule/consent order that includes the particular substance for which the sunset date listed in the table below applies. Section 12(b) export notification is no longer required for these substances and mixtures. Substances that are the subjects of two or more section 4 testing actions may have section 4 reimbursement or section 12(b) export notification requirements that have not sunset; see subparts B, C, and D of this part to determine if certain other section 4 testing requirements apply. Additionally, section 12(b) export notification may also be triggered by proposed or final action under TSCA section 5, 6, or 7 (in addition to final actions under section 4); see 40 CFR part 707, subpart D for further information regarding the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements.
