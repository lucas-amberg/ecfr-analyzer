# § 1031.150   Production reports.

Engine manufacturers must submit an annual production report for each calendar year in which they produce any engines subject to emission standards under this part.


(a) The report is due by February 28 of the following calendar year. Include emission data in the report as described in paragraph (c) of this section. If you produce exempted or excepted engines, submit a single report with information on exempted/excepted and normally certificated engines.


(b) Send the report to the Designated EPA Program Officer.


(c) In the report, specify your corporate name and the year for which you are reporting. Include information as described in this section for each engine sub-model subject to emission standards under this part. List each engine sub-model manufactured or certificated during the calendar year, including the following information for each sub-model:


(1) The type of engine (turbofan, turboprop, etc.) and complete sub-model name, including any applicable model name, sub-model identifier, and engine type certificate family identifier.


(2) The certificate under which it was manufactured. Identify all the following:


(i) The type certificate number. Specify if the sub-model also has a type certificate issued by a certificating authority other than FAA.


(ii) Your corporate name as listed in the certificate.


(iii) Emission standards to which the engine is certificated.


(iv) Date of issue of type certificate (month and year).


(v) Whether or not this is a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes. If so, identify the previously certificated engine model.


(vi) The engine sub-model that received the original type certificate for an engine type certificate family.


(3) Identify the combustor of the sub-model, where more than one type of combustor is available.


(4) The calendar-year production volume of engines from the sub-model that are covered by an FAA type certificate. Record zero for sub-models with no engines manufactured during the calendar year, or state that the engine model is no longer in production and list the date of manufacture (month and year) of the last engine manufactured. Specify the number of these engines that are intended for use on new aircraft and the number that are intended for use as non-exempt engines on in-use aircraft. For engines delivered without a final sub-model status and for which the manufacturer has not ascertained the engine's sub-model when installed before submitting its production report, the manufacturer may do any of the following in its initial report, and amend it later:


(i) List the sub-model that was shipped or the most probable sub-model.


(ii) List all potential sub-models.


(iii) State “Unknown Sub-Model.”


(5) The number of engines tested and the number of test runs for the applicable type certificate.


(6) Test data and related information required to certify the engine sub-model for all the standards that apply. Round reported values to the same number of decimal places as the standard. Include the following information, as applicable:


(i) The engine's rated pressure ratio and rated output.


(ii) The following values for each mode of the LTO test cycle:


(A) Fuel mass flow rate.


(B) Smoke number.


(C) nvPM mass concentration.


(D) mass of CO_2_

(E) Emission Indices for HC, CO, NO_X_, and CO_2_.


(F) The following values related to nvPM mass and nvPM number:


(*1*) Emission Indices as measured.


(*2*) System loss correction factor.


(*3*) Emissions Indices after correcting for system losses.


(iii) Weighted total values calculated from the tested LTO cycle modes for HC, CO, NO_X_, CO_2_, and nvPM mass and nvPM number. Include nvPM mass and nvPM number values with and without system loss correction.


(iv) The characteristic level for HC, CO, NO_X_, smoke number, nvPM mass concentration, nvPM mass, and nvPM number.


(v) The following maximum values:


(A) Smoke number.


(B) nvPM mass concentration.


(C) nvPM mass Emission Index with and without system loss correction.


(D) nvPM number Emission Index with and without system loss correction.


(d) Identify the number of exempted or excepted engines with a date of manufacture during the calendar year, along with the engine model and sub-model names of each engine, the type of exemption or exception, and the use of each engine (for example, spare or new installation). For purposes of this paragraph (d), treat spare engine exceptions separate from other new engine exemptions.


(e) Include the following signed statement and endorsement by an authorized representative of your company: “We submit this report under 40 CFR 1031.150. All the information in this report is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.”


(f) Where information provided for the previous annual report remains valid and complete, you may report your production volumes and state that there are no changes, without resubmitting the other information specified in this section.
