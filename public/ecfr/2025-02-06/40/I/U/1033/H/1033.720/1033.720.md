# ยง 1033.720   Trading emission credits.

(a) Trading is the exchange of emission credits between certificate holders. You may use traded emission credits for averaging, banking, or further trading transactions. Traded emission credits may be used only as allowed by ยง 1033.740.


(b) You may trade actual emission credits as described in this subpart. You may also trade reserved emission credits, but we may revoke these emission credits based on our review of your records or reports or those of the company with which you traded emission credits.


(c) If a negative emission credit balance results from a transaction, both the buyer and seller are liable, except in cases we deem to involve fraud. See ยง 1033.255(e) for cases involving fraud. We may void the certificates of all engine families participating in a trade that results in a manufacturer/remanufacturer having a negative balance of emission credits. See ยง 1033.745.
