# Appendix A to Part 1036â€”Summary of Previous Emission Standards


The following standards, which EPA originally adopted under 40 CFR part 85 or part 86, apply to compression-ignition engines produced before model year 2007 and to spark-ignition engines produced before model year 2008:


(a) *Smoke.* Smoke standards applied for compression-ignition engines based on opacity measurement using the test procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subpart I, as follows:


(1) Engines were subject to the following smoke standards for model years 1970 through 1973:


(i) 40 percent during the engine acceleration mode.


(ii) 20 percent during the engine lugging mode.


(2) The smoke standards in 40 CFR 86.007-11 started to apply in model year 1974.


(b) *Idle CO.* A standard of 0.5 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle applied through model year 2016 to the following engines:


(1) Spark-ignition engines with aftertreatment starting in model year 1987. This standard applied only for gasoline-fueled engines through model year 1997. Starting in model year 1998, the same standard applied for engines fueled by methanol, LPG, and natural gas. The idle CO standard no longer applied for engines certified to meet onboard diagnostic requirements starting in model year 2005.


(2) Methanol-fueled compression-ignition engines starting in model year 1990. This standard also applied for natural gas and LPG engines starting in model year 1997. The idle CO standard no longer applied for engines certified to meet onboard diagnostic requirements starting in model year 2007.


(c) *Crankcase emissions.* The requirement to design engines to prevent crankcase emissions applied starting with the following engines:


(1) Spark-ignition engines starting in model year 1968. This standard applied only for gasoline-fueled engines through model year 1989, and applied for spark-ignition engines using other fuels starting in model year 1990.


(2) Naturally aspirated diesel-fueled engines starting in model year 1985.


(3) Methanol-fueled compression-ignition engines starting in model year 1990.


(4) Naturally aspirated gaseous-fueled engines starting in model year 1997, and all other gaseous-fueled engines starting in 1998.


(d) *Early steady-state standards.* The following criteria standards applied to heavy-duty engines based on steady-state measurement procedures:


(e) *Transient emission standards for spark-ignition engines.* The following criteria standards applied for spark-ignition engines based on transient measurement using the test procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. Starting in model year 1991, manufacturers could generate or use emission credits for NO_X_ and NO_X_ + NMHC standards. Table 2 to this appendix follows:


(f) *Transient emission standards for compression-ignition engines.* The following criteria standards applied for compression-ignition engines based on transient measurement using the test procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. Starting in model year 1991, manufacturers could generate or use emission credits for NO_X_, NO_X_ + NMHC, and PM standards. Table 3 to this appendix follows:
