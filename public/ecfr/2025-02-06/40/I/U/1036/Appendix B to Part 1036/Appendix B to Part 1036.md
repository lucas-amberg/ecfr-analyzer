# Appendix B to Part 1036—Transient Duty Cycles


(a) This appendix specifies transient test intervals and duty cycles for the engine and powertrain testing described in §§ 1036.512 and 1036.514, as follows:


(1) The transient test intervals and duty cycle for testing engines involves a schedule of normalized engine speed and torque values.


(2) The transient test intervals and duty cycles for powertrain testing involves a schedule of vehicle speeds and road grade. Determine road grade at each point based on the peak rated power of the powertrain system, *P*_rated,_ determined in § 1036.520 and road grade coefficients using the following equation: *Road grade* = a · *P*2_rated_ + *b* · *P*_rated_ + *c*

(3) The operating schedules in this appendix in some cases eliminate repetitive information by omitting 1 Hz records where there is no change in values. Perform testing by continuing to operate at the last specified values until the operating schedule shows a change in values. The official operating schedule for testing, cycle validation, and other purposes includes both the specified and omitted values.


(b) The following transient test interval applies for spark-ignition engines and powertrains when testing over the duty cycle specified in § 1036.512:



(c) The following transient test interval applies for compression-ignition engines and powertrains when testing over the duty cycle specified in § 1036.512:



(d) The following transient duty cycle applies for compression-ignition engines and powertrains when testing under § 1036.514:
