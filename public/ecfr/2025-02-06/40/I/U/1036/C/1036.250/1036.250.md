# ยง 1036.250   Reporting and recordkeeping for certification.

(a) By September 30 following the end of the model year, send the Designated Compliance Officer a report including the total U.S.-directed production volume of engines you produced in each engine family during the model year (based on information available at the time of the report). Report the production by serial number and engine configuration. You may combine this report with reports required under subpart H of this part. We may waive the reporting requirements of this paragraph (a) for small manufacturers.


(b) Organize and maintain the following records:


(1) A copy of all applications and any summary information you send us.


(2) Any of the information we specify in ยง 1036.205 that you were not required to include in your application.


(3) A detailed history of each emission-data engine. For each engine, describe all of the following:


(i) The emission-data engine's construction, including its origin and buildup, steps you took to ensure that it represents production engines, any components you built specially for it, and all the components you include in your application for certification.


(ii) How you accumulated engine operating hours (service accumulation), including the dates and the number of hours accumulated.


(iii) All maintenance, including modifications, parts changes, and other service, and the dates and reasons for the maintenance.


(iv) All your emission tests, including documentation on routine and standard tests, as specified in part 40 CFR part 1065, and the date and purpose of each test.


(v) All tests to diagnose engine or emission control performance, giving the date and time of each and the reasons for the test.


(vi) Any other significant events.


(4) Production figures for each engine family divided by assembly plant.


(5) Engine identification numbers for all the engines you produce under each certificate of conformity.


(c) Keep routine data from emission tests required by this part (such as test cell temperatures and relative humidity readings) for one year after we issue the associated certificate of conformity. Keep all other information specified in this section for eight years after we issue your certificate.


(d) Store these records in any format and on any media, as long as you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review them at any time.
