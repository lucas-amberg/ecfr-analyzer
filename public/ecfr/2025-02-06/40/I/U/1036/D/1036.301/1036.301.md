# ยง 1036.301   Measurements related to GEM inputs in a selective enforcement audit.

(a) Selective enforcement audits apply for engines as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E. This section describes how this applies uniquely in certain circumstances.


(b) Selective enforcement audit provisions apply with respect to your fuel maps as follows:


(1) A selective enforcement audit for an engine with respect to fuel maps would consist of performing measurements with production engines to determine fuel-consumption rates as declared for GEM simulations, and running GEM for the vehicle configurations specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section based on those measured values. The engine is considered passing for a given configuration if the new modeled emission result for each applicable duty cycle is at or below the modeled emission result corresponding to the declared GEM inputs. The engine is considered failing if we determine that its fuel map result is above the modeled emission result corresponding to the result using the manufacturer-declared fuel maps, as specified in ยง 1036.235(c)(5).


(2) If the audit includes fuel-map testing in conjunction with engine testing relative to exhaust emission standards, the fuel-map simulations for the whole set of vehicles and duty cycles counts as a single test result for purposes of evaluating whether the engine family meets the pass-fail criteria under 40 CFR 1068.420.


(c) If your certification includes powertrain testing as specified in ยง 1036.630, these selective enforcement audit provisions apply with respect to powertrain test results as specified in ยง 1036.545 and 40 CFR part 1037, subpart D. We may allow manufacturers to instead perform the engine-based testing to simulate the powertrain test as specified in 40 CFR 1037.551.


(d) We may suspend or revoke certificates for any appropriate configurations within one or more engine families based on the outcome of a selective enforcement audit.
