# § 1036.420   Pass criteria for individual engines.

Perform the following steps to determine whether an engine meets the binned emission standards in § 1036.104(a)(3):


(a) Determine the emission standard for each regulated pollutant for each bin by adding the following accuracy margins for PEMS to the off-cycle standards in § 1036.104(a)(3):


(b) Calculate the mass emission rate for each pollutant as specified in § 1036.530.


(c) For engines subject to compression-ignition standards, determine the number of windows in each bin. A bin is valid under this section only if it has at least 2,400 windows for bin 1 and 10,000 windows for bin 2.


(d) Continue testing additional shift-days as necessary to achieve the minimum window requirements for each bin. You may idle the engine at the end of the shift day to increase the number of windows in bin 1. If the vehicle has tamper-resistant idle-reduction technology that prevents idling, populate bin 1 with additional windows by setting the 1-Hz emission rate for all regulated pollutants to zero as described in § 1036.415(g) to achieve exactly 2,400 bin 1 windows.


(e) An engine passes if the result for each bin is at or below the standard determined in paragraph (a) of this section. An engine fails if the result for any bin for any pollutant is above the standard determined in paragraph (a) of this section.
