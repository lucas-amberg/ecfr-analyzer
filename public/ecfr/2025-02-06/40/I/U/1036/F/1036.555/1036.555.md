Sections 1036.240 through 1036.246 describe certification procedures to determine, verify, and apply deterioration factors. This section describes the measurement procedures for verifying deterioration factors using PEMS with in-use vehicles.


(a) Use PEMS to collect 1 Hz data throughout a shift-day of driving. Collect all the data elements needed to determine brake-specific emissions. Calculate emission results using moving average windows as described in ยง 1036.530.
