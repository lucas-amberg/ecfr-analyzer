# ยง 1036.630   Certification of engine greenhouse gas emissions for powertrain testing.

For engines included in powertrain families under 40 CFR part 1037, you may choose to include the corresponding engine emissions in your engine families under this part instead of (or in addition to) the otherwise applicable engine fuel maps.


(a) If you choose to certify powertrain fuel maps in an engine family, the declared powertrain emission levels become standards that apply for selective enforcement audits and in-use testing. We may require that you provide to us the engine cycle (not normalized) corresponding to a given powertrain for each of the specified duty cycles.


(b) If you choose to certify only fuel map emissions for an engine family and to not certify emissions over powertrain cycles under ยง 1036.545, we will not presume you are responsible for emissions over the powertrain cycles. However, where we determine that you are responsible in whole or in part for the emission exceedance in such cases, we may require that you participate in any recall of the affected vehicles (Note: this does not apply if you also hold the certificate of conformity for the vehicle).


(c) If you split an engine family into subfamilies based on different fuel-mapping procedures as described in ยง 1036.230(f)(2), the fuel-mapping procedures you identify for certifying each subfamily also apply for selective enforcement audits and in-use testing.
