# ยง 1036.750   Consequences for noncompliance.

(a) For each engine family participating in the ABT program, the certificate of conformity is conditioned upon full compliance with the provisions of this subpart during and after the model year. You are responsible to establish to our satisfaction that you fully comply with applicable requirements. We may void the certificate of conformity for an engine family if you fail to comply with any provisions of this subpart.


(b) You may certify your engine family to an FEL/FCL above an applicable standard based on a projection that you will have enough emission credits to offset the deficit for the engine family. See ยง 1036.745 for provisions specifying what happens if you cannot show in your final report that you have enough actual emission credits to offset a deficit for any pollutant in an engine family.


(c) We may void the certificate of conformity for an engine family if you fail to keep records, send reports, or give us information we request. Note that failing to keep records, send reports, or give us information we request is also a violation of 42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(2).


(d) You may ask for a hearing if we void your certificate under this section (see ยง 1036.820).
