# § 1037.106   CO

(a) The CO_2_ standards of this section apply for tractors above 26,000 pounds GVWR. Note that the standards of this section do not apply for vehicles classified as “vocational tractors” under § 1037.630.


(b) CO_2_ standards in this paragraph (b) apply based on modeling and testing as described in subpart F of this part. The provisions of § 1037.241 specify how to comply with the standards in this paragraph (b). Note that § 1037.230 describes how to divide vehicles into subcategories.


(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, model year 2027 and later tractors are subject to Phase 3 CO_2_ standards corresponding to the selected subcategories as shown in the following table:


(2) Qualifying small manufacturers of model year 2027 and later vehicles may continue to meet Phase 2 CO_2_ standards in this paragraph (b)(2) instead of the standards specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If you certify to these Phase 2 CO_2_ standards, you may use the averaging provisions of subpart H of this part to demonstrate compliance. You may use other credit provisions of this part only by certifying all vehicle families within a given averaging set to the Phase 3 standards that apply in that model year.


(3) Model year 2026 and earlier tractors are subject to CO_2_ standards corresponding to the selected subcategory as shown in the following table:


(c) [Reserved]


(d) You may generate or use emission credits for averaging, banking, and trading as described in subpart H of this part. This requires that you calculate a credit quantity if you specify a Family Emission Limit (FEL) that is different than the standard specified in this section for a given pollutant. The FEL may not be less than the result of emission modeling from § 1037.520. These FELs serve as the emission standards for the specific vehicle subfamily instead of the standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section.


(e) The exhaust emission standards of this section apply for the full useful life, expressed in service miles or calendar years, whichever comes first. The following useful life values apply for the standards of this section:


(1) 185,000 miles or 10 years, whichever comes first, for vehicles at or below 33,000 pounds GVWR.


(2) 435,000 miles or 10 years, whichever comes first, for vehicles above 33,000 pounds GVWR.


(f) You may optionally certify Class 7 tractors to Class 8 standards as follows:


(1) You may optionally certify 4x2 tractors with Heavy HDE to the standards and useful life for Class 8 tractors, with no restriction on generating or using emission credits within the Class 8 averaging set.


(2) You may optionally certify Class 7 tractors not covered by paragraph (f)(1) of this section to the standards and useful life for Class 8 tractors. This paragraph (f)(2) applies equally for hybrid vehicles, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles. Credit provisions apply as follows:


(i) If you certify all your Class 7 tractors to Class 8 standards, you may use these Heavy HDV credits without restriction.


(ii) This paragraph (f)(2)(ii) applies if you certify some Class 7 tractors to Class 8 standards under this paragraph (f)(2) but not all of them. If you include Class 7 tractors in a subfamily of Class 8 tractors with an FEL below the standard, exclude the production volume of Class 7 tractors from the credit calculation. Conversely, if you include Class 7 tractors in a subfamily of Class 8 tractors with an FEL above the standard, you must include the production volume of Class 7 tractors in the credit calculation.


(g) Diesel auxiliary power units installed on tractors subject to standards under this section must meet PM standards as follows:


(1) For model years 2021 through 2023, the APU engine must be certified under 40 CFR part 1039 with a deteriorated emission level for PM at or below 0.15 g/kW-hr.


(2) Starting in model year 2024, auxiliary power units installed on tractors subject to standards under this section must be certified to the PM emission standard specified in 40 CFR 1039.699. Selling, offering for sale, or introducing or delivering into commerce in the United States or importing into the United States a new tractor subject to this standard is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) unless the auxiliary power unit has a valid certificate of conformity and the required label showing that it meets the PM standard of this paragraph (g)(2).


(3) See § 1037.660(e) for requirements that apply for diesel APUs in model year 2020 and earlier tractors.
