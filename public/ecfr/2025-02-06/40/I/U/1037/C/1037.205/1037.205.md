# § 1037.205   What must I include in my application?

This section specifies the information that must be in your application, unless we ask you to include less information under § 1037.201(c). We may require you to provide additional information to evaluate your application. References to testing and emission-data vehicles refer to testing vehicles or components to measure any quantity that serves as an input value for modeling emission rates under § 1037.520.


(a) Describe the vehicle family's specifications and other basic parameters of the vehicle's design and emission controls. List the fuel type on which your vehicles are designed to operate (for example, ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel).


(b) Explain how the emission control system operates. As applicable, describe in detail all system components for controlling greenhouse gas emissions, including all auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) and all fuel-system components you will install on any production vehicle. For any vehicle using RESS (such as hybrid vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles), describe in detail all components needed to charge the system, store energy, and transmit power to move the vehicle. Identify the part number of each component you describe. For this paragraph (b), treat as separate AECDs any devices that modulate or activate differently from each other. Also describe your modeling inputs as described in § 1037.520, with the following additional information if it applies for your vehicles:


(1) Describe your design for vehicle speed limiters, consistent with § 1037.640.


(2) Describe your design for predictive cruise control.


(3) Describe your design for automatic engine shutdown systems, consistent with § 1037.660.


(4) Describe your engineering analysis demonstrating that your air conditioning compressor qualifies as a high-efficiency model as described in 40 CFR 86.1868-12(h)(5).


(5) Describe your design for idle-reduction technology, including the logic for engine shutdown and the maximum duration of engine operation after the onset of any vehicle conditions described in § 1037.660.


(6) If you perform powertrain testing under 40 CFR 1036.545, report both CO_2_ and NO_X_ emission levels corresponding to each test run.


(7) Describe the configuration and basic design of hybrid systems. Include measurements for vehicles with hybrid power take-off systems.


(8) If you install auxiliary power units in tractors under § 1037.106(g), identify the family name associated with the engine's certification under 40 CFR part 1039. Starting in model year 2024, also identify the family name associated with the auxiliary power unit's certification to the standards of 40 CFR 1039.699.


(9) Describe how you meet any applicable criteria in § 1037.631(a)(1) and (2).


(c) For vehicles subject to air conditioning standards, include:


(1) The refrigerant leakage rates (leak scores).


(2) The type of refrigerant and the refrigerant capacity of the air conditioning systems.


(3) The corporate name of the final installer of the air conditioning system.


(d) Describe any vehicles or components you selected for testing and the reasons for selecting them.


(e) Describe any test equipment and procedures that you used, including any special or alternate test procedures you used (see § 1037.501). Include information describing the procedures you used to determine *C*_d_*A* values as specified in §§ 1037.525 and 1037.527. Describe which type of data you are using for engine fuel maps (see 40 CFR 1036.505).


(f) Describe how you operated any emission-data vehicle before testing, including the duty cycle and the number of vehicle operating miles used to stabilize emission-related performance. Explain why you selected the method of service accumulation. Describe any scheduled maintenance you did, and any practices or specifications that should apply for our testing.


(g) Where applicable, list the specifications of any test fuel to show that it falls within the required ranges we specify in 40 CFR part 1065.


(h) Identify the vehicle family's useful life.


(i) Include the maintenance instructions and warranty statement you will give to the ultimate purchaser of each new vehicle (see §§ 1037.120 and 1037.125).


(j) Describe your emission control information label (see § 1037.135).


(k) Identify the emission standards or FELs to which you are certifying vehicles in the vehicle family. For families containing multiple subfamilies, this means that you must identify the highest and lowest FELs to which any of your subfamilies will be certified.


(l) Where applicable, identify the vehicle family's deterioration factors and describe how you developed them. Present any emission test data you used for this (see § 1037.241(c)).


(m) Where applicable, state that you operated your emission-data vehicles as described in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this part.


(n) [Reserved]


(o) Report calculated and modeled emission results for ten configurations. Include modeling inputs and detailed descriptions of how they were derived. Unless we specify otherwise, include the configuration with the highest modeling result, the lowest modeling result, and the configurations with the highest projected sales.


(p) Where applicable, describe all adjustable operating parameters (see § 1037.115), including production tolerances. For any operating parameters that do not qualify as adjustable parameters, include a description supporting your conclusion (see 40 CFR 1068.50(c)). Include the following in your description of each adjustable parameter:


(1) The nominal or recommended setting.


(2) The intended practically adjustable range.


(3) The limits or stops used to establish adjustable ranges.


(4) Information showing why the limits, stops, or other means of inhibiting adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use engines to settings outside your intended practically adjustable ranges.


(q) For battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, describe the recharging procedures and methods for determining battery performance, such as state of charge and charging capacity. Also include the certified usable battery energy for each battery durability subfamily.


(r) Unconditionally certify that all the vehicles in the vehicle family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.


(s) Include good-faith estimates of U.S.-directed production volumes by subfamily. We may require you to describe the basis of your estimates.


(t) Include the information required by other subparts of this part. For example, include the information required by § 1037.725 if you plan to generate or use emission credits.


(u) Include other applicable information, such as information specified in this part or 40 CFR part 1068 related to requests for exemptions.


(v) Name an agent for service located in the United States. Service on this agent constitutes service on you or any of your officers or employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States related to the requirements of this part.
