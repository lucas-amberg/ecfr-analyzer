# ยง 1037.527   Aerodynamic measurements for vocational vehicles.

This section describes an optional methodology for determining improved aerodynamic drag area, *C*_d_*A*, for vocational vehicles, as described in ยง 1037.520(m), rather than using the assigned values. A vocational vehicle's aerodynamic performance is based on a _D_*C*_d_*A* value relative to a baseline vehicle. Determine a _D__d_*A* value by performing A to B testing as follows:


(a) Use any of the procedures described in this subpart, with appropriate adjustments, for calculating drag area.


(b) Determine a baseline *C*_d_*A* value for a vehicle representing a production configuration without the aerodynamic improvement. Repeat this testing and measure *C*_d_*A* for a vehicle with the improved aerodynamic design.


(c) Use good engineering judgment to perform paired tests that accurately demonstrate the reduction in aerodynamic drag associated with the improved design.


(d) Measure *C*_d_*A* in m
2 to two decimal places. Calculate _D__d_*A* by subtracting the drag area for the test vehicle from the drag area for the baseline vehicle.
