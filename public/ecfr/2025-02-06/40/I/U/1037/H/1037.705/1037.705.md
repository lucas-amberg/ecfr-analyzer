# ยง 1037.705   Generating and calculating CO

(a) The provisions of this section apply separately for calculating CO_2_ emission credits for each pollutant.


(b) For each participating family or subfamily, calculate positive or negative emission credits relative to the otherwise applicable emission standard. Calculate positive emission credits for a family or subfamily that has an FEL below the standard. Calculate negative emission credits for a family or subfamily that has an FEL above the standard. Sum your positive and negative credits for the model year before rounding. Round the sum of emission credits to the nearest megagram (Mg), using consistent units with the following equation:


(c) Compliance with the requirements of this subpart is determined at the end of the model year by calculating emission credits based on actual production volumes, excluding any of the following vehicles:


(1) Vehicles that you do not certify to the CO_2_ standards of this part because they are permanently exempted under subpart G of this part or under 40 CFR part 1068.


(2) Exported vehicles even if they are certified under this part and labeled accordingly.


(3) Vehicles not subject to the requirements of this part, such as those excluded under ยง 1037.5.


(4) Any other vehicles, where we indicate elsewhere in this part that they are not to be included in the calculations of this subpart.
