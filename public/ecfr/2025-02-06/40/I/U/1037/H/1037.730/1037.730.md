# § 1037.730   ABT reports.

(a) If you certify any vehicle families using the ABT provisions of this subpart, send us a final report by September 30 following the end of the model year.


(b) Your report must include the following information for each vehicle family participating in the ABT program:


(1) Vehicle-family and subfamily designations, and averaging set.


(2) The regulatory subcategory and emission standards that would otherwise apply to the vehicle family.


(3) The FEL for each pollutant. If you change the FEL after the start of production, identify the date that you started using the new FEL and/or give the vehicle identification number for the first vehicle covered by the new FEL. In this case, identify each applicable FEL and calculate the positive or negative emission credits as specified in § 1037.225.


(4) The projected and actual production volumes for the model year for calculating emission credits. If you changed an FEL during the model year, identify the actual production volume associated with each FEL.


(5) Useful life.


(6) Calculated positive or negative emission credits for the whole vehicle family. Identify any emission credits that you traded, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(7) If you have a negative credit balance for the averaging set in the given model year, specify whether the vehicle family (or certain subfamilies with the vehicle family) have a credit deficit for the year. Consider for example, a manufacturer with three vehicle families (“A”, “B”, and “C”) in a given averaging set. If family A generates enough credits to offset the negative credits of family B but not enough to also offset the negative credits of family C (and the manufacturer has no banked credits in the averaging set), the manufacturer may designate families A and B as having no deficit for the model year, provided it designates family C as having a deficit for the model year.


(c) Your report must include the following additional information:


(1) Show that your net balance of emission credits from all your participating vehicle families in each averaging set in the applicable model year is not negative, except as allowed under § 1037.745. Your credit tracking must account for the limitation on credit life under § 1037.740(c).


(2) State whether you will retain any emission credits for banking. If you choose to retire emission credits that would otherwise be eligible for banking, identify the families that generated the emission credits, including the number of emission credits from each family.


(3) State that the report's contents are accurate.


(4) Identify the technologies that make up the certified configuration associated with each vehicle identification number. You may identify this as a range of identification numbers for vehicles involving a single, identical certified configuration.


(d) If you trade emission credits, you must send us a report within 90 days after the transaction, as follows:


(1) As the seller, you must include the following information in your report:


(i) The corporate names of the buyer and any brokers.


(ii) A copy of any contracts related to the trade.


(iii) The averaging set corresponding to the vehicle families that generated emission credits for the trade, including the number of emission credits from each averaging set.


(2) As the buyer, you must include the following information in your report:


(i) The corporate names of the seller and any brokers.


(ii) A copy of any contracts related to the trade.


(iii) How you intend to use the emission credits, including the number of emission credits you intend to apply for each averaging set.


(e) Send your reports electronically to the Designated Compliance Officer using an approved information format. If you want to use a different format, send us a written request with justification for a waiver.


(f) Correct errors in your report as follows:


(1) If you notify us by the deadline for submitting the final report that errors mistakenly decreased your balance of emission credits, you may correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits. If you notify us that errors mistakenly decreased your balance of emission credits after the deadline for submitting the final report, you may correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits after applying a 10 percent discount to the credit correction, but only if you notify us within 24 months after the deadline for submitting the final report. If you report a negative balance of emission credits, we may disallow corrections under this paragraph (f)(1).


(2) If you or we determine any time that errors mistakenly increased your balance of emission credits, you must correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits.
