# ยง 1037.740   Restrictions for using emission credits.

The following restrictions apply for using emission credits:


(a) *Averaging sets.* Except as specified in ยง 1037.105(h) and paragraph (b) of this section, emission credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set. The following principal averaging sets apply for vehicles certified to the standards of this part involving emission credits as described in this subpart:


(1) Light HDV.


(2) Medium HDV.


(3) Heavy HDV.


(4) Note that other separate averaging sets also apply for emission credits not related to this part. For example, vehicles certified to the greenhouse gas standards of 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, comprise a single averaging set. Separate averaging sets also apply for engines under 40 CFR part 1036, including engines used in vehicles subject to this subpart.


(b) *Credits from hybrid vehicles and other advanced technologies.* The following provisions apply for credits you generate under ยง 1037.615.


(1) Credits generated from Phase 1 vehicles may be used for any of the averaging sets identified in paragraph (a) of this section; you may also use those credits to demonstrate compliance with the CO_2_ emission standards in 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, and 40 CFR part 1036. Similarly, you may use Phase 1 advanced-technology credits generated under 40 CFR 86.1819-14(k)(7) or 1036.615 to demonstrate compliance with the CO_2_ standards in this part. The maximum amount of advanced-technology credits generated from Phase 1 vehicles that you may bring into each of the following service class groups is 60,000 Mg per model year:


(i) Spark-ignition HDE, Light HDE, and Light HDV. This group comprises the averaging set listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the averaging set listed in 40 CFR 1036.740(a)(1) and (2).


(ii) Medium HDE and Medium HDV. This group comprises the averaging sets listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and 40 CFR 1036.740(a)(3).


(iii) Heavy HDE and Heavy HDV. This group comprises the averaging sets listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and 40 CFR 1036.740(a)(4).


(iv) This paragraph (b)(1) does not limit the advanced-technology credits that can be used within a service class group if they were generated in that same service class group.


(2) Credits generated from Phase 2 and later vehicles are subject to the averaging-set restrictions that apply to other emission credits.


(c) *Credit life.* Banked credits may be used only for five model years after the year in which they are generated. For example, credits you generate in model year 2018 may be used to demonstrate compliance with emission standards only through model year 2023.


(d) *Other restrictions.* Other sections of this part specify additional restrictions for using emission credits under certain special provisions.
