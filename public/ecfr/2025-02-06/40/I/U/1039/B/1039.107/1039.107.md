# ยง 1039.107   What evaporative emission standards and requirements apply?

There are no evaporative emission standards for diesel-fueled engines, or engines using other nonvolatile or nonliquid fuels (for example, natural gas). If your engine uses a volatile liquid fuel, such as methanol, you must meet the evaporative emission requirements of 40 CFR part 1048 that apply to spark-ignition engines, as follows:


(a) Follow the steps in 40 CFR 1048.245 to show that you meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1048.105.


(b) Do the following things in your application for certification:


(1) Describe how your engines control evaporative emissions.


(2) Present test data to show that equipment using your engines meets the evaporative emission standards we specify in this section if you do not use design-based certification under 40 CFR 1048.245.
