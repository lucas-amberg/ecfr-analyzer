# Appendix I to Part 1042—Summary of Previous Emission Standards


The following standards apply to compression-ignition marine engines produced before the model years specified in § 1042.1:


(a) *Engines below 37 kW.* Tier 1 and Tier 2 standards for engines below 37 kW originally adopted under 40 CFR part 89 apply as follows:


(b) *Engines at or above 37 kW.* Tier 1 and Tier 2 standards for engines at or above 37 kW originally adopted under 40 CFR part 94 apply as follows:


(1) *Tier 1 standards.* NO_X_ emissions from model year 2004 and later engines with displacement of 2.5 or more liters per cylinder may not exceed the following values:


(i) 17.0 g/kW-hr when maximum test speed is less than 130 rpm.


(ii) 45.0 × N_−0.20_ when maximum test speed is at or above 130 but below 2000 rpm, where N is the maximum test speed of the engine in revolutions per minute. Round the calculated standard to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr.


(ii) 9.8 g/kW-hr when maximum test speed is 2000 rpm or more.


(2) *Tier 2 primary standards.* Exhaust emissions from Category 1 engines at or above 37 kW and all Category 2 engines may not exceed the values shown in the following table:


(3) *Tier 2 supplemental standards.* The following not-to-exceed emission standards apply for all engines subject to the Tier 2 standards described in paragraph (b)(2) of this appendix.


(i) *Commercial marine engines.* (A) 1.20 times the applicable standards (or FELs) when tested in accordance with the supplemental test procedures specified in § 1042.515 at loads greater than or equal to 45 percent of the maximum power at rated speed or 1.50 times the applicable standards (or FELs) at loads less than 45 percent of the maximum power at rated speed.


(B) As an option, the manufacturer may instead choose to comply with limits of 1.25 times the applicable standards (or FELs) when tested over the whole power range in accordance with the supplemental test procedures specified in § 1042.515.


(ii) *Recreational marine engines.* (A) 1.20 times the applicable standards (or FELs) when tested in accordance with the supplemental test procedures specified in § 1042.515 at loads greater than or equal to 45 percent of the maximum power at rated speed and speeds less than 95 percent of maximum test speed, or 1.50 times the applicable standards (or FELs) at loads less than 45 percent of the maximum power at rated speed, or 1.50 times the applicable standards (or FELs) at any loads for speeds greater than or equal to 95 percent of the maximum test speed.


(B) As an option, the manufacturer may instead choose to comply with limits of 1.25 times the applicable standards (or FELs) when tested over the whole power range in accordance with the supplemental test procedures specified in § 1042.515.
