# Appendix III to Part 1042—Not-to-Exceed Zones 


(a) The following definitions apply for this Appendix III:

(1) Subzone 1 is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) Percent power ÷ 100 > 0.7 · (percent speed ÷ 100) 
2.5.


(ii) Percent power ÷ 100 ≤ (percent speed ÷ 90) 
3.5.


(iii) Percent power ÷ 100 ≥ 3.0 · (1−percent speed ÷ 100).


(2) Subzone 2 is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) Percent power ÷ 100 ≥ 0.7 · (percent speed ÷ 100) 
2.5.

3.5.


(iii) Percent power ÷ 100 < 3.0 · (1−percent speed ÷ 100).


(iv) Percent speed ≥ 70 percent.


(3) Subzone 3 is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) Percent power ÷ 100 ≤ (percent speed ÷ 90) 
3.5.


(ii) Percent power > 95 percent.


(4) Note that the line separating Subzone 1 and Subzone 3 includes a point at Percent speed = 88.7 percent and Percent power = 95.0 percent. See paragraph (b)(3) of this appendix regarding the line separating Subzone 1 and Subzone 2.


(d) Figure 3 of this Appendix illustrates the default NTE zone for variable-speed marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers that are certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(1), (2), or (3), as follows:


(1) Subzone 1 is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) Percent power ÷ 100 ≥ 0.7 · (percent speed ÷ 100) 
2.5.


(ii) Percent power ÷ 100 ≥ 3.0 · (1−percent speed ÷ 100).


(iii) Percent speed ≥ 78.9 percent.


(2) Subzone 2a is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) Percent power ÷ 100 ≥ 0.7 · (percent speed ÷ 100) 
2.5.


(ii) Percent speed ≥70 percent.


(iii) Percent speed <78.9 percent, for Percent power >63.3 percent.


(iv) Percent power ÷ 100 <3.0 · (1−percent speed ÷ 100), for Percent speed ≥78.9 percent.


(3) Subzone 2b is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) The line formed by connecting the following two points on a plot of speed-vs.-power:


(A) Percent speed = 70 percent; Percent power = 28.7 percent.


(B) Percent power = 40 percent; Speed = governed speed.


(ii) Percent power ÷ 100 < 0.7 · (percent speed ÷ 100)
2.5.


(4) Note that the line separating Subzone 1 and Subzone 2a includes the following endpoints:


(i) Percent speed = 78.9 percent; Percent power = 63.3 percent.


(ii) Percent speed = 84.6 percent; Percent power = 46.1 percent.


(e) Figure 4 of this Appendix illustrates the default NTE zone for constant-speed engines certified using a duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(3) or (4), as follows:


(1) Subzone 1 is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) Percent power ≥70 percent.


(ii) [Reserved]


(2) Subzone 2 is defined by the following boundaries:


(i) Percent power <70 percent.
