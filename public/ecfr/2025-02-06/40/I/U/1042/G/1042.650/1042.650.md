# § 1042.650   Exemptions for migratory vessels and auxiliary engines on Category 3 vessels.

The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply for Category 1 and Category 2 engines, including auxiliary engines installed on vessels with Category 3 propulsion engines. Paragraphs (a) through (c) do not apply for any Category 3 engines. All engines exempted under this section must comply with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 1043.


(a) *Temporary exemption.* A vessel owner may ask us for a temporary exemption from the tampering prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) for a vessel if it will operate for an extended period outside the United States where ULSD is not available. In your request, describe where the vessel will operate, how long it will operate there, why ULSD will be unavailable, and how you will modify the engine, including its emission controls. If we approve your request, you may modify the engine, but only as needed to disable or remove the emission controls needed for meeting the Tier 4 standards. You must return the engine to its original certified configuration before the vessel returns to the United States to avoid violating the tampering prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1). We may set additional conditions to prevent circumvention of the provisions of this part.


(b) *SOLAS exemption.* We may approve a permanent exemption from the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) for an engine that is subject to Tier 4 standards as described in this paragraph (b).


(1) Vessel owners may ask for a permanent exemption from the Tier 4 standards for an engine that will be installed on vessels that will operate for extended periods outside the United States, provided they demonstrate all of the following are true:


(i) Prior to introduction into service, the vessel will comply with applicable certification requirements for international safety pursuant to the U.S. Coast Guard and the International Convention for the Protection of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The vessel owner must maintain compliance with these requirements for the life of the exempted engine.


(ii) The vessel will be used in areas outside of the United States where ULSD will not be available.


(iii) The mix of vessels with engines certified to Tier 3 or earlier standards in the owner's current fleet and the owner's current business operation of those vessels makes the exemption necessary. Note that because of the large fraction of pre-Tier 4 engines in the fleet prior to 2021, a request for a Tier 4 exemption prior to that year must clearly demonstrate that unusual circumstances apply.


(2) An engine exempted under this paragraph (b) must meet the Tier 3 emission standards described in § 1402.101, subject to the procedural requirements of 40 CFR 1068.265.


(3) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this section, you must meet the labeling requirements in § 1042.135, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1042.135(c)(10):


(4) Operating a vessel containing an engine exempted under this paragraph (b) violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) if the vessel is not in full compliance with applicable requirements for international safety specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.


(c) *Vessels less than 500 gross tons.* In unusual circumstances for vessels less than 500 gross tons, we may approve a vessel owner's request for a permanent exemption from the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) for an engine that is subject to Tier 4 standards that will operate for extended periods outside the United States without it being in compliance with applicable certification requirements for international safety. We may set appropriate additional conditions on such exemptions, and may void the exemption if those conditions are not met.


(d) *Auxiliary engines on Category 3 vessels.* Auxiliary engines that will be installed on vessels with Category 3 propulsion engines qualify for an exemption from the standards of this part provided all the following conditions are met:


(1) To be eligible for this exemption, the engine must meet all the following criteria.


(i) The engine must have an EIAPP certificate demonstrating compliance with the applicable NO_X_ standards of Annex VI and meet all other applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 1043. Engines installed on vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2016 must conform fully to the Annex VI Tier III NO_X_ standards as described in 40 CFR part 1043 and meet all other applicable requirements in 40 CFR part 1043. Engines that would otherwise be subject to the Tier 4 standards of this part must also conform fully to the Annex VITier III NO_X_ standards as described in 40 CFR part 1043.


(ii) The engine may not be used for propulsion (except for emergency engines).


(iii) Engines certified to the Annex VI Tier III standards may be equipped with on-off NO_X_ controls, as long as they conform to the requirements of §§ 1042.110(d) and 1042.115(g); however, the engines must comply fully with the Annex VI Tier II standards when the emission controls are disabled, and meet any other requirements that apply underAnnex VI.


(2) You must notify the Designated Compliance Officer of your intent to use this exemption before you introduce engines into U.S. commerce, not later than the time that you apply for an EIAPP certificate for the engine under 40 CFR part 1043.


(3) The remanufactured engine requirements of subpart I of this part do not apply.


(4) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this paragraph (d), you must meet the labeling requirements in § 1042.135, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1042.135(c)(10):


(5) The reporting requirements of § 1042.660 apply for engines exempted under this paragraph (d).
