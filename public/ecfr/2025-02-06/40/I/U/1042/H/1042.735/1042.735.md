(a) You must organize and maintain your records as described in this section.


(b) Keep the records required by this section for at least eight years after the due date for the end-of-year report. You may not use emission credits for any engines if you do not keep all the records required under this section. You must therefore keep these records to continue to bank valid credits.

You must also identify the purchaser and destination for each engine you produce to the extent this information is available.
