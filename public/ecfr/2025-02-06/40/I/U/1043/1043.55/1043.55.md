# ยง 1043.55   Applying equivalent controls instead of complying with fuel requirements.

Regulation 4 of Annex VI allows Administrations to approve the use of fuels not meeting the requirements of Regulation 14 of the Annex, provided the vessel applies a method that results in equivalent emission reductions. This section describes provisions related to applying this allowance.


(a) The U.S. Coast Guard is the approving authority under APPS for such equivalent methods for U.S.-flagged vessels.


(b) The provisions of this paragraph (b) apply for vessels equipped with controls certified by the U.S. Coast Guard or the Administration of a foreign-flag vessel to achieve emission levels equivalent to those achieved by the use of fuels meeting the applicable fuel sulfur limits of Regulation 14 of Annex VI. Fuels not meeting the applicable fuel sulfur limits of Regulation 14 of Annex VI may be used on such vessels consistent with the provisions of the IAPP certificate, APPS and Annex VI.


(c) Compliance with the requirements of this section does not affect the applicability of requirements or prohibitions specified by other statutes or regulations with respect to water pollution.
