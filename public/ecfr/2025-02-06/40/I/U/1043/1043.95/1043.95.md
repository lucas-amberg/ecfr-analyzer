(1) The fuel-use requirements of this part do not apply through December 31, 2025, if we approved an exemption under this section before March 27, 2023 based on the use of replacement engines certified to applicable standards under 40 CFR part 1042 corresponding to the date the vessel entered dry dock for service. All other requirements under this part 1043 continue to apply to exempted vessels, including requirements related to bunker delivery notes.

(ii) You have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity.

(6) We may impose conditions on the waiver, including conditions to limit or recover any environmental loss.


(d) Prior to January 1, 2015, it is not a violation of this part for vessels operating exclusively in the Great Lakes to use a residual fuel not meeting the sulfur limits of Regulation 14.4.2 of Annex VI, where the operator bunkers with the lowest sulfur marine residual fuel that was available within the port area where the vessel bunkered the fuel. For purposes of this paragraph (c), port area means the geographic limits of the port as specified by the Army Corps of Engineers. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements of this part continue to apply for such operation. In addition, if you operate using a residual fuel not meeting the sulfur limits of Regulation 14.4.2 under this paragraph (c), you must send a report to the Designated Certification Officer that identifies the fuel that was used and documents how you determined that no compliant fuel was available. You must send this report within three months after the fueling event.
