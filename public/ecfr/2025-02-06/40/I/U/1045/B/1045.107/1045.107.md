(b) Determine the not-to-exceed standard, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard in Table 1 to this section from the following equation:


(c) For engines equipped with a catalyst, use NTE multipliers from the following table across the applicable zone specified in ยง 1045.515:


(d) For two-stroke engines not equipped with a catalyst, use an NTE multiplier of 1.2 for HC + NO_X_ and CO. Compare the weighted value specified in ยง 1045.515(c)(5) to the NTE standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section.


(e) For engines not covered by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, use the NTE multipliers from the following table across the applicable zone specified in ยง 1045.515:
