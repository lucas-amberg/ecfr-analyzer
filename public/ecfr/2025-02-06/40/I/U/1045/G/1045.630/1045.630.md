# ยง 1045.630   What is the personal-use exemption.

This section applies to individuals who manufacture recreational vessels for personal use with used engines. If you and your vessel meet all the conditions of this section, the vessel and its engine are considered to be exempt from the standards and requirements of this part that apply to new engines, including standards and requirements related to evaporative emissions. For example, you are not required to use certified fuel system components or otherwise obtain certificates of conformity showing that the vessel meets evaporative emission standards, and you do not need to install a certified engine.


(a) The vessel may not be manufactured from a previously certified vessel, nor may it be manufactured from a partially complete vessel that is equivalent to a certified vessel. The vessel must be manufactured primarily from unassembled components, but may incorporate some preassembled components. For example, fully preassembled steering assemblies may be used. You may also power the vessel with an engine that was previously used in a highway or land-based nonroad application.


(b) The vessel may not be sold within five years after the date of final assembly.


(c) No individual may manufacture more than one vessel in any five-year period under this exemption.


(d) You may not use the vessel in any revenue-generating service or for any other commercial purpose. For example, this exemption does not apply for vessels used in commercial fishing or charter service.


(e) This exemption may not be used to circumvent the requirements of this part or the requirements of the Clean Air Act. For example, this exemption would not cover a case in which a person sells an almost completely assembled vessel to another person, who would then complete the assembly. This would be considered equivalent to the sale of the complete new vessel. This section also does not allow engine manufacturers to produce new engines that are exempt from emission standards and it does not provide an exemption from the prohibition against tampering with certified engines.
