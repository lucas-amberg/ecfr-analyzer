# § 1048.1   Does this part apply to me?

(a) The regulations in this part 1048 apply for all new, spark-ignition nonroad engines (defined in § 1048.801) with maximum engine power above 19 kW, except as provided in § 1048.5.


(b) This part 1048 applies for engines built on or after January 1, 2004. You need not follow this part for engines you produce before January 1, 2004. *See* §§ 1048.101 through 1048.115, § 1048.145, and the definition of model year in § 1048.801 for more information about the timing of new requirements.


(c) The definition of nonroad engine in 40 CFR 1068.30 excludes certain engines used in stationary applications. These engines may be required by 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ, to comply with some of the provisions of this part 1048; otherwise, these engines are only required to comply with the requirements in § 1048.20. In addition, the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101 restrict the use of stationary engines for nonstationary purposes unless they are certified under this part 1048 to the same standards that would apply to nonroad engines for the same model year.


(d) In certain cases, the regulations in this part 1048 apply to engines with maximum engine power at or below 19 kW that would otherwise be covered by 40 CFR part 90 or 1054. See 40 CFR 90.913 or 1054.615 for provisions related to this allowance.
