# ยง 1048.320   What happens if one of my production-line engines fails to meet emission standards?

If you have a production-line engine with final deteriorated test results exceeding one or more emission standards (see ยง 1048.315(a)), the certificate of conformity is automatically suspended for that failing engine. You must take the following actions before your certificate of conformity can cover that engine: 


(a) Correct the problem and retest the engine to show it complies with all emission standards. 


(b) Include the test results and describe the remedy for each engine in the written report required under ยง 1048.345.
