# ยง 1051.320   What happens if one of my production-line vehicles or engines fails to meet emission standards?

(a) If you have a production-line vehicle or engine with final deteriorated test results exceeding one or more emission standards (see ยง 1051.315(a)), the certificate of conformity is automatically suspended for that failing vehicle or engine. You must take the following actions before your certificate of conformity can cover that vehicle or engine: 


(1) Correct the problem and retest the vehicle or engine to show it complies with all emission standards. 


(2) Include the test results and describe the remedy for each engine in the written report required under ยง 1051.345.


(b) You may request to amend the application for certification to raise the FEL of the entire engine family at this point (see ยง 1051.225).
