# ยง 1051.330   May I sell vehicles from an engine family with a suspended certificate of conformity?

You may sell vehicles that you produce after we suspend the engine family's certificate of conformity under ยง 1051.315 only if one of the following occurs: 


(a) You test each vehicle or engine you produce and show it complies with emission standards that apply. 


(b) We conditionally reinstate the certificate for the engine family. We may do so if you agree to recall all the affected vehicles and remedy any noncompliance at no expense to the owner if later testing shows that the engine family still does not comply.
