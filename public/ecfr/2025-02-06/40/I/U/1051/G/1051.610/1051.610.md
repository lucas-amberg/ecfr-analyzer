# § 1051.610   What provisions apply to vehicles already certified under the motor vehicle program?

(a) *General provisions.* If you are a motor-vehicle manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new recreational vehicles into commerce if the vehicle is already certified to the requirements that apply under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86. If you comply with all of the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each motor vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the engine under this part 1051 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1051. This section applies especially for highway motorcycles that are modified for recreational nonroad use. See § 1051.605 for similar provisions that apply to motor-vehicle engines or Large SI engines produced for recreational vehicles.


(b) *Nonroad vehicle-manufacturer provisions.* If you are not a motor-vehicle manufacturer, you may produce recreational vehicles from motor vehicles under this section as long as you meet all the requirements and conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section. If you modify the motor vehicle or its engine in any of the ways described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, we will consider you a manufacturer of a new recreational vehicle. Such modifications prevent you from using the provisions of this section.


(c) *Liability.* Engines and vehicles for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts 85 and 86. This applies to engine manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers, and all other persons as if the recreational vehicles were motor vehicles. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new recreational vehicles; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each motor vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the recreational vehicle under this part 1051 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines or vehicles do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 86 or 40 CFR 1068.505.


(d) *Specific requirements.* If you are a motor-vehicle manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements regarding your new recreational vehicle and its engine, the vehicle is eligible for an exemption under this section:


(1) Your vehicle must be covered by a valid certificate of conformity as a motor vehicle issued under 40 CFR part 86.


(2) You must not make any changes to the certified vehicle that we could reasonably expect to increase its exhaust emissions for any pollutant, or its evaporative emissions if it is subject to evaporative-emission standards. For example, if you make any of the following changes, you do not qualify for this exemption:


(i) Change any fuel system parameters from the certified configuration.


(ii) Change, remove, or fail to properly install any other component, element of design, or calibration specified in the vehicle manufacturer's application for certification. This includes aftertreatment devices and all related components.


(iii) Modify or design the engine cooling system so that temperatures or heat rejection rates are outside the original vehicle manufacturer's specified ranges.


(iv) Add more than 500 pounds to the curb weight of the originally certified motor vehicle.


(3) You must show that fewer than 50 percent of the engine family's total sales in the United States are used in recreational vehicles. This includes any type of vehicle, without regard to which company completes the manufacturing of the recreational vehicle. Show this as follows:


(i) If you are the original manufacturer of the vehicle, base this showing on your sales information.


(ii) In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of the vehicle to confirm this based on their sales information.


(4) The vehicle must have the vehicle emission control information we require under 40 CFR part 86.


(5) You must add a permanent supplemental label to the vehicle in a position where it will remain clearly visible. In the supplemental label, do the following:


(i) Include the heading: “RECREATIONAL VEHICLE ENGINE EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.


(ii) Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may instead include the full corporate name and trademark of another company you choose to designate.


(iii) State: “THIS VEHICLE WAS ADAPTED FOR RECREATIONAL USE WITHOUT AFFECTING ITS EMISSION CONTROLS.”.


(iv) State the date you finished modifying the vehicle (month and year), if applicable.


(6) The original and supplemental labels must be readily visible in the fully assembled vehicle.


(7) Send the Designated Compliance Officer a signed letter by the end of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you) with all the following information:


(i) Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone number.


(ii) List the vehicle models you expect to produce under this exemption in the coming year and describe your basis for meeting the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(iii) State: “We produced each listed engine or vehicle model for recreational application without making any changes that could increase its certified emission levels, as described in 40 CFR 1051.610.”.


(e) *Failure to comply.* If your engines or vehicles do not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the engines will be subject to the standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part 1051, and the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 will not be deemed to also be a certificate issued under this part 1051. Introducing these engines into commerce without a valid exemption or certificate of conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).


(f) *Data submission.* We may require you to send us emission test data on any applicable nonroad duty cycles.


(g) *Participation in averaging, banking and trading.* Vehicles adapted for recreational use under this section may not generate or use emission credits under this part 1051. These vehicles may generate credits under the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part 86. These vehicles must use emission credits under 40 CFR part 86 if they are certified to an FEL that exceeds an emission standard that applies.
