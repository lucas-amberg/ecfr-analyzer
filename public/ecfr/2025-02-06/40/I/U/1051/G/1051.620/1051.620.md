# ยง 1051.620   When may a manufacturer obtain an exemption for competition recreational vehicles?

(a) We may grant you an exemption from the standards and requirements of this part for a new recreational vehicle on the grounds that it is to be used solely for competition. The provisions of this part other than those in this section do not apply to recreational vehicles that we exempt for use solely for competition. 


(b) We will exempt vehicles that we determine will be used solely for competition. The basis of our determinations are described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (c) of this section. Exemptions granted under this section are good for only one model year and you must request renewal for each subsequent model year. We will not approve your renewal request if we determine the vehicles will not be used solely for competition. 


(1) *Off-highway motorcycles.* Motorcycles that are marketed and labeled as only for competitive use and that meet at least four of the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section are considered to be used solely for competition, except in cases where other information is available that indicates that they are not used solely for competition. The following features are indicative of motorcycles used solely for competition: 


(i) The absence of a headlight or other lights. 


(ii) The absence of a spark arrestor. 


(iii) The absence of manufacturer warranty. 


(iv) Suspension travel greater than 10 inches. 


(v) Engine displacement greater than 50 cc. 


(vi) The absence of a functional seat. (For example, a seat with less than 30 square inches of seating surface would generally not be considered a functional seat).


(2) *Snowmobiles and ATVs.* Snowmobiles and ATVs meeting all of the following criteria are considered to be used solely for competition, except in cases where other information is available that indicates that they are not used solely for competition: 


(i) The vehicle or engine may not be displayed for sale in any public dealership. 


(ii) Sale of the vehicle must be limited to professional racers or other qualified racers. 


(iii) The vehicle must have performance characteristics that are substantially superior to noncompetitive models. 


(c) Vehicles not meeting the applicable criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section will be exempted only in cases where the manufacturer has clear and convincing evidence that the vehicles will be used solely for competition. 


(d) You must permanently label vehicles exempted under this section to clearly indicate that they are to be used only for competition. Failure to properly label a vehicle will void the exemption for that vehicle. 


(e) If we request it, you must provide us any information we need to determine whether the vehicles are used solely for competition.
