# ยง 1051.635   What provisions apply to new manufacturers that are small businesses?

(a) If you are a small business (as defined by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR 121.201) that manufactures recreational vehicles, but does not otherwise qualify for the small-volume manufacturer provisions of this part, you may ask us to designate you to be a small-volume manufacturer. You may do this whether you began manufacturing recreational vehicles before, during, or after 2002.


(b) We may set other reasonable conditions that are consistent with the intent of this section and the Act. For example, we may place sales limits on companies that we designate to be small-volume manufacturers under this section.
