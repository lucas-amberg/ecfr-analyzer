# ยง 1051.725   What must I include in my applications for certification?

(a) You must declare in your applications for certification your intent to use the provisions of this subpart. You must also declare the FELs you select for each engine family. Your FELs must comply with the specifications of subpart B of this part, including the FEL caps. FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the applicable standards.


(b) Include the following in your application for certification:


(1) A statement that, to the best of your belief, you will not have a negative balance of emission credits for any averaging set when all emission credits are calculated at the end of the year. This means that if you believe that your average emission level will be above the standard (*i.e.,* that you will have a deficit for the model year), you must have banked credits (or project to have received traded credits) to offset the deficit.


(2) Detailed calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on projected production volumes. We may require you to include similar calculations from your other engine families to demonstrate that you will be able to avoid a negative credit balance for the model year. If you project negative emission credits for an engine family, state the source of positive emission credits you expect to use to offset the negative emission credits.
