# ยง 1054.710   How do I average emission credits?

(a) Averaging is the exchange of emission credits among your families. You may average emission credits only within the same averaging set.


(b) You may certify one or more families to an FEL above the emission standard, subject to the FEL caps and other provisions in subpart B of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero.


(c) If you certify a family to an FEL that exceeds the otherwise applicable standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in ยง 1054.730. The emission credits used to address the deficit may come from your other families that generate emission credits in the same model year, from emission credits you have banked from previous model years, or from emission credits generated in the same or previous model years that you obtained through trading.
