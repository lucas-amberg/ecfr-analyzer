# ยง 1054.715   How do I bank emission credits?

(a) Banking is the retention of emission credits by the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model years for averaging or trading. You may use banked emission credits only within the averaging set in which they were generated, except as described in this subpart.


(b) You may designate any emission credits you plan to bank in the reports you submit under ยง 1054.730 as reserved credits. During the model year and before the due date for the final report, you may designate your reserved emission credits for averaging or trading.


(c) Reserved credits become actual emission credits when you submit your final report. However, we may revoke these emission credits if we are unable to verify them after reviewing your reports or auditing your records.
