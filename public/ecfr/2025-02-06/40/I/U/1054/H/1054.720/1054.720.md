# ยง 1054.720   How do I trade emission credits?

(a) Trading is the exchange of emission credits between manufacturers. You may use traded emission credits for averaging, banking, or further trading transactions. Traded emission credits may be used only within the averaging set in which they were generated, except as described in this subpart.


(b) You may trade actual emission credits as described in this subpart. You may also trade reserved emission credits, but we may revoke these emission credits based on our review of your records or reports or those of the company with which you traded emission credits. You may trade banked credits within an averaging set to any certifying engine or equipment manufacturer.


(c) If a negative emission credit balance results from a transaction, both the buyer and seller are liable, except in cases we deem to involve fraud. See ยง 1054.255(e) for cases involving fraud. We may void the certificates of all families participating in a trade that results in a manufacturer having a negative balance of emission credits. See ยง 1054.745.
