# ยง 1054.745   What can happen if I do not comply with the provisions of this subpart?

(a) For each family participating in the ABT program, the certificate of conformity is conditional upon full compliance with the provisions of this subpart during and after the model year. You are responsible to establish to our satisfaction that you fully comply with applicable requirements.

However, we may void the certificate of conformity if you cannot show in your final report that you have enough actual emission credits to offset a deficit for any pollutant in a family.


(c) We may void the certificate of conformity for a family if you fail to keep records, send reports, or give us information we request.


(d) You may ask for a hearing if we void your certificate under this section (see ยง 1054.820).
