This must include January 1 of the calendar year for which the model year is named. It may not begin before January 2 of the previous calendar year and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar year. For seasonal production periods not including January 1, model year means the calendar year in which the production occurs, unless you choose to certify the applicable emission family with the following model year.

*Motor vehicle* has the meaning given in 40 CFR 85.1703(a).


*New nonroad engine* means any of the following things:


(1) A freshly manufactured nonroad engine for which the ultimate purchaser has never received the equitable or legal title. This kind of engine might commonly be thought of as “brand new.” In the case of this paragraph (1), the engine is new from the time it is produced until the ultimate purchaser receives the title or the product is placed into service, whichever comes first.


(2) An engine originally manufactured as a motor vehicle engine or a stationary engine that is later used or intended to be used in a piece of nonroad equipment. In this case, the engine is no longer a motor vehicle or stationary engine and becomes a “new nonroad engine.” The engine is no longer new when it is placed into nonroad service. This paragraph (2) applies if a motor vehicle engine or a stationary engine is installed in nonroad equipment, or if a motor vehicle or a piece of stationary equipment is modified (or moved) to become nonroad equipment.


(3) A nonroad engine that has been previously placed into service in an application we exclude under § 1054.5, when that engine is installed in a piece of equipment that is covered by this part. The engine is no longer new when it is placed into nonroad service covered by this part. For example, this paragraph (3) would apply to a marine-propulsion engine that is no longer used in a marine vessel but is instead installed in a piece of nonroad equipment subject to the provisions of this part.


(4) An engine not covered by paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition that is intended to be installed in new nonroad equipment. This generally includes installation of used engines in new equipment. The engine is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives a title for the equipment or the product is placed into service, whichever comes first.


(5) An imported nonroad engine, subject to the following provisions:


(i) An imported nonroad engine covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part that meets the criteria of one or more of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this definition, where the original engine manufacturer holds the certificate, is new as defined by paragraphs (1) through (4).


(ii) An imported engine that will be covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part, where someone other than the original engine manufacturer holds the certificate (such as when the engine is modified after its initial assembly), is a new nonroad engine when it is imported. It is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives a title for the engine or it is placed into service, whichever comes first.


(iii) An imported nonroad engine that is not covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part at the time of importation is new. This paragraph (5)(iii) addresses uncertified engines and equipment initially placed into service that someone seeks to import into the United States. Importation of this kind of engine (or equipment containing such an engine) is generally prohibited by 40 CFR part 1068. However, the importation of such an engine is not prohibited if the engine has a date of manufacture before January 1, 1997, since it is not subject to standards.


*New nonroad equipment* means either of the following things:


(1) A nonroad piece of equipment for which the ultimate purchaser has never received the equitable or legal title. The product is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives this title or the product is placed into service, whichever comes first.


(2) A nonroad piece of equipment with an engine that becomes new while installed in the equipment. For example, a complete piece of equipment that was imported without being covered by a certificate of conformity would be new nonroad equipment because the engine would be considered new at the time of importation.


*Noncompliant engine or noncompliant equipment* means an engine or equipment that was originally covered by a certificate of conformity but is not in the certified configuration or otherwise does not comply with the conditions of the certificate.


*Nonconforming engine or nonconforming equipment* means an engine or equipment not covered by a certificate of conformity that would otherwise be subject to emission standards.


*Nonhandheld* means relating to an engine (or equipment) subject to the standards of this part that is not a handheld engine (or equipment).
