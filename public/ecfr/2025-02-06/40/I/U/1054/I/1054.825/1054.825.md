# § 1054.825   What reporting and recordkeeping requirements apply under this part?

(a) This part includes various requirements to submit and record data or other information. Unless we specify otherwise, store required records in any format and on any media and keep them readily available for eight years after you send an associated application for certification, or eight years after you generate the data if they do not support an application for certification. We may request these records at any time. You must promptly give us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. This requirement to give us records applies whether or not you rely on someone else to keep records on your behalf. We may require you to submit written records in an electronic format.


(b) The regulations in § 1054.255 and 40 CFR 1068.25 and 1068.101 describe your obligation to report truthful and complete information. This includes information not related to certification. Failing to properly report information and keep the records we specify violates 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(2), which may involve civil or criminal penalties.


(c) Send all reports and requests for approval to the Designated Compliance Officer (see § 1054.801).
