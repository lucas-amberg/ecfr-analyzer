# ยง 1060.120   What emission-related warranty requirements apply?

(a) *General requirements.* The certifying manufacturer must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new nonroad equipment, including its evaporative emission control system, meets two conditions:


(1) It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.


(2) It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.


(b) *Warranty period.* Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least two years from the date the equipment is sold to the ultimate purchaser.


(c) *Components covered.* The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase the evaporative emissions, including those listed in 40 CFR part 1068, appendix I, and those from any other system you develop to control emissions. Your emission-related warranty does not need to cover components whose failure would not increase evaporative emissions.


(d) *Relationships between manufacturers.* (1) The emission-related warranty required for equipment manufacturers that certify equipment must cover all specified components even if another company produces the component.


(2) Where an equipment manufacturer fulfills a warranty obligation for a given component, the component manufacturer is deemed to have also met that obligation.
