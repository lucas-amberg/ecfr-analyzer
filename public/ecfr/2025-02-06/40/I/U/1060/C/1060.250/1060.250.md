(ii) All your emission tests (valid and invalid), including the date and purpose of each test and documentation of test parameters described in subpart F of this part.

(c) Store these records in any format and on any media as long as you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review them at any time.
