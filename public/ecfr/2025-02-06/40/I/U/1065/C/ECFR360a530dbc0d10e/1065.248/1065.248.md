# ยง 1065.248   Gas divider.

(a) *Application.* You may use a gas divider to blend calibration gases.


(b) *Component requirements.* Use a gas divider that blends gases to the specifications of ยง 1065.750 and to the flow-weighted concentrations expected during testing. You may use critical-flow gas dividers, capillary-tube gas dividers, or thermal-mass-meter gas dividers. Note that your overall gas-divider system must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307.
