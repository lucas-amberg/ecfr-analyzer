# ยง 1065.255   H

(a) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use an analyzer that meets the specifications in ยง 1065.205. Note that your system must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307.


(b) *Instrument types.* You may use any of the following analyzers to measure H_2_:


(1) Magnetic sector mass spectrometer.


(2) Raman spectrometer.


(c) *Interference verification.* Certain compounds can positively interfere with magnetic sector mass spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy by causing a response similar to H_2_. Use good engineering judgment to determine interference species when performing interference verification. In the case of raman spectroscopy, determine interference species that are appropriate for each H_2_ infrared absorption band, or you may identify the interference species based on the instrument manufacturer's recommendations.
