# § 1065.290   PM gravimetric balance.

(a) *Application.* Use a balance to weigh net PM on a sample medium for laboratory testing.


(b) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use a balance that meets the specifications in Table 1 of § 1065.205. Note that your balance-based system must meet the linearity verification in § 1065.307. If the balance uses internal calibration weights for routine spanning and the weights do not meet the specifications in § 1065.790, the weights must be verified independently with external calibration weights meeting the requirements of § 1065.790. While you may also use an inertial balance to measure PM, as described in § 1065.295, use a reference procedure based on a gravimetric balance for comparison with any proposed alternate measurement procedure under § 1065.10.


(c) *Pan design.* We recommend that you use a balance pan designed to minimize corner loading of the balance, as follows:


(1) Use a pan that centers the PM sample media (such as a filter) on the weighing pan. For example, use a pan in the shape of a cross that has upswept tips that center the PM sample media on the pan.


(2) Use a pan that positions the PM sample as low as possible.


(d) *Balance configuration.* Configure the balance for optimum settling time and stability at your location.
