# ยง 1065.295   PM inertial balance for field-testing analysis.

(a) *Application.* You may use an inertial balance to quantify net PM on a sample medium for field testing.


(b) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use a balance that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. Note that your balance-based system must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307. If the balance uses an internal calibration process for routine spanning and linearity verifications, the process must be NIST-traceable.


(c) *Loss correction.* You may use PM loss corrections to account for PM loss in the inertial balance, including the sample handling system.


(d) *Deposition.* You may use electrostatic deposition to collect PM as long as its collection efficiency is at least 95%.
