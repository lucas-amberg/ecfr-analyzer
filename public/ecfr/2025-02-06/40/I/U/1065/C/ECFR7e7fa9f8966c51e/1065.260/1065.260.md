# § 1065.260   Flame-ionization detector.

(a) *Application.* Use a flame-ionization detector (FID) analyzer to measure hydrocarbon concentrations in raw or diluted exhaust for either batch or continuous sampling. Determine hydrocarbon concentrations on a carbon number basis of one, C_1_. For measuring THC or THCE you must use a FID analyzer. For measuring CH_4_ you must meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. See subpart I of this part for special provisions that apply to measuring hydrocarbons when testing with oxygenated fuels.






(b) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use a FID analyzer that meets the specifications in Table 1 of § 1065.205. Note that your FID-based system for measuring THC, THCE, or CH_4_ must meet all the verifications for hydrocarbon measurement in subpart D of this part, and it must also meet the linearity verification in § 1065.307.


(c) *Heated FID analyzers.* For measuring THC or THCE from compression-ignition engines, two-stroke spark-ignition engines, and four-stroke spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kW, you must use heated FID analyzers that maintain all surfaces that are exposed to emissions at a temperature of (191 ±11) °C.


(d) *FID fuel and burner air.* Use FID fuel and burner air that meet the specifications of § 1065.750. Do not allow the FID fuel and burner air to mix before entering the FID analyzer to ensure that the FID analyzer operates with a diffusion flame and not a premixed flame.


(e) *NMHC and NMOG.* For demonstrating compliance with NMHC standards, you may either measure THC and determine NMHC mass as described in § 1065.660(b)(1), or you may measure THC and CH_4_ and determine NMHC as described in § 1065.660(b)(2) or (3). You may also use the additive method in § 1065.660(b)(4) for natural gas-fueled engines as described in § 1065.266. See 40 CFR 1066.635 for methods to demonstrate compliance with NMOG standards for vehicle testing.


(f) *NMNEHC.* For demonstrating compliance with NMNEHC standards, you may either measure NMHC or determine NMNEHC mass as described in § 1065.660(c)(1), you may measure THC, CH_4_, and C_2_H_6_ and determine NMNEHC as described in § 1065.660(c)(2), or you may use the additive method in § 1065.660(c)(3).


(g) *CH*_4_. For reporting CH_4_ or for demonstrating compliance with CH_4_ standards, you may use a FID analyzer with a nonmethane cutter as described in § 1065.265 or you may use a GC-FID as described in § 1065.267. Determine CH_4_ as described in § 1065.660(d).
