# ยง 1065.265   Nonmethane cutter.

(a) *Application.* You may use a nonmethane cutter to measure CH_4_ with a FID analyzer. A nonmethane cutter oxidizes all nonmethane hydrocarbons to CO_2_ and H_2_O. You may use a nonmethane cutter for raw or diluted exhaust for batch or continuous sampling.


(b) *System performance.* Determine nonmethane-cutter performance as described in ยง 1065.365 and use the results to calculate CH_4_ or NMHC emissions in ยง 1065.660.


(c) *Configuration.* Configure the nonmethane cutter with a bypass line if it is needed for the verification described in ยง 1065.365.


(d) *Optimization.* You may optimize a nonmethane cutter to maximize the penetration of CH_4_ and the oxidation of all other hydrocarbons. You may humidify a sample and you may dilute a sample with purified air or oxygen (O_2_) upstream of the nonmethane cutter to optimize its performance. You must account for any sample humidification and dilution in emission calculations.
