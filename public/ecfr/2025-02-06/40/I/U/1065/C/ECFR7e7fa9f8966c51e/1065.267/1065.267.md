# § 1065.267   Gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector.

(a) *Application.* You may use a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to measure CH_4_ and C_2_H_6_ concentrations of diluted exhaust for batch sampling. While you may also use a nonmethane cutter to measure CH_4_, as described in § 1065.265, use a reference procedure based on a gas chromatograph for comparison with any proposed alternate measurement procedure under § 1065.10.


(b) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use a GC-FID that meets the specifications in § 1065.205 and that the measurement be done according to SAE J1151 (incorporated by reference, see § 1065.1010). The GC-FID must meet the linearity verification in § 1065.307.
