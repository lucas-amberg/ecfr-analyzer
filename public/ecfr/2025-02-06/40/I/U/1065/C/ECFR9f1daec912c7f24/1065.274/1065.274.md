# ยง 1065.274   Zirconium dioxide (ZrO

(a) *Application.* You may use a zirconia oxide (ZrO_2_) analyzer to measure NO_X_ in raw exhaust for field-testing engines.


(b) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use a ZrO_2_ analyzer that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. Note that your ZrO_2_-based system must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307.


(c) *Species measured.* The ZrO_2_-based system must be able to measure and report NO and NO_2_ together as NO_X_. If the ZrO_2_-based system cannot measure all of the NO_2_, you may develop and apply correction factors based on good engineering judgment to account for this deficiency.


(d) *Interference.* You must account for NH_3_ interference with the NO_X_ measurement.
