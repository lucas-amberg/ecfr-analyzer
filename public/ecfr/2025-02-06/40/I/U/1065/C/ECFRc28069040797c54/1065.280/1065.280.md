# ยง 1065.280   Paramagnetic and magnetopneumatic O

(a) *Application.* You may use a paramagnetic detection (PMD) or magnetopneumatic detection (MPD) analyzer to measure O_2_ concentration in raw or diluted exhaust for batch or continuous sampling. You may use good engineering judgment to develop calculations that use O_2_ measurements with a chemical balance of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust to calculate exhaust flow rate.




(b) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use a PMD or MPD analyzer that meets the specifications in ยง 1065.205. Note that it must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307.
