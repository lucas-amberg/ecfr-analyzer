# § 1065.320   Fuel-flow calibration.

(a) Calibrate fuel-flow meters upon initial installation. Follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions and use good engineering judgment to repeat the calibration.


(b) [Reserved]


(c) You may remove system components for off-site calibration. When installing a flow meter with an off-site calibration, we recommend that you consider the effects of the tubing configuration upstream and downstream of the flow meter. We recommend specifying calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within ±0.5% uncertainty.
