# § 1065.325   Intake-flow calibration.

(a) Calibrate intake-air flow meters upon initial installation. Follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions and use good engineering judgment to repeat the calibration. We recommend using a calibration subsonic venturi, ultrasonic flow meter or laminar flow element. We recommend using calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within ±0.5% uncertainty.




(b) You may remove system components for off-site calibration. When installing a flow meter with an off-site calibration, we recommend that you consider the effects of the tubing configuration upstream and downstream of the flow meter. We recommend specifying calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within ±0.5% uncertainty.


(c) If you use a subsonic venturi or ultrasonic flow meter for intake flow measurement, we recommend that you calibrate it as described in § 1065.340.
