# § 1065.360   FID optimization and verification.

(a) *Scope and frequency.* For all FID analyzers, calibrate the FID upon initial installation. Repeat the calibration as needed using good engineering judgment. For a FID that measures THC, perform the following steps:


(1) Optimize the response to various hydrocarbons after initial analyzer installation and after major maintenance as described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) Determine the methane (CH_4_) response factor after initial analyzer installation and after major maintenance as described in paragraph (d) of this section.


(3) If you determine NMNEHC by subtracting from measured THC, determine the ethane (C_2_H_6_) response factor after initial analyzer installation and after major maintenance as described in paragraph (f) of this section. Verify the C_2_H_6_ response within 185 days before testing as described in paragraph (f) of this section.


(4) You may determine the methane (CH_4_) and ethane (C_2_H_6_) response factors as a function of the molar water concentration in the raw or diluted exhaust. If you choose the option in this paragraph (a)(4), generate and verify the humidity level (or fraction) as described in § 1065.365(g).




(b) *Calibration.* Use good engineering judgment to develop a calibration procedure, such as one based on the FID-analyzer manufacturer's instructions and recommended frequency for calibrating the FID. Alternately, you may remove system components for off-site calibration. For a FID that measures THC, calibrate using C_3_H_8_ calibration gases that meet the specifications of § 1065.750. For a FID that measures CH_4_, calibrate using CH_4_ calibration gases that meet the specifications of § 1065.750. We recommend FID analyzer zero and span gases that contain approximately the flow-weighted mean concentration of O_2_ expected during testing. If you use a FID to measure CH_4_ downstream of a nonmethane cutter (NMC), you may calibrate that FID using CH_4_ calibration gases with the NMC. Regardless of the calibration gas composition, calibrate on a carbon number basis of one (C_1_). For example, if you use a C_3_H_8_ span gas of concentration 200 µmol/mol, span the FID to respond with a value of 600 µmol/mol. As another example, if you use a CH_4_ span gas with a concentration of 200 µmol/mol, span the FID to respond with a value of 200 µmol/mol.








(c) *THC FID response optimization.* This procedure is only for FID analyzers that measure THC. Use good engineering judgment for initial instrument start-up and basic operating adjustment using FID fuel and zero air. Heated FIDs must be within their required operating temperature ranges. Optimize FID response at the most common analyzer range expected during emission testing. Optimization involves adjusting flows and pressures of FID fuel, burner air, and sample to minimize response variations to various hydrocarbon species in the exhaust. Use good engineering judgment to trade off peak FID response to propane calibration gases to achieve minimal response variations to different hydrocarbon species. For an example of trading off response to propane for relative responses to other hydrocarbon species, see SAE 770141 (incorporated by reference, see § 1065.1010). Determine the optimum flow rates and/or pressures for FID fuel, burner air, and sample and record them for future reference.






(d) *THC FID CH*_4_*response factor determination.* This procedure is only for FID analyzers that measure THC. Since FID analyzers generally have a different response to CH_4_ versus C_3_H_8_, determine the THC-FID analyzer's CH_4_ response factor, *RF*_CH4[THC-FID],_ after FID optimization. Use the most recent *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ measured according to this section in the calculations for HC determination described in § 1065.660 to compensate for CH_4_ response. Determine *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ as follows, noting that you do not determine *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ for FIDs that are calibrated and spanned using CH_4_ with an NMC:






(1) Select a C_3_ H_8_ span gas concentration that you use to span your analyzers before emission testing. Use only span gases that meet the specifications of § 1065.750. Record the C_3_H_8_ concentration of the gas.


(2) Select a CH_4_ span gas concentration that you use to span your analyzers before emission testing. Use only span gases that meet the specifications of § 1065.750. Record the CH_4_ concentration of the gas.


(3) Start and operate the FID analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.


(4) Confirm that the FID analyzer has been calibrated using C_3_H_8_. Calibrate on a carbon number basis of one (C_1_). For example, if you use a C_3_ H_8_ span gas of concentration 200 µmol/mol, span the FID to respond with a value of 600 µmol/mol.


(5) Zero the FID with a zero gas that you use for emission testing.


(6) Span the FID with the C_3_H_8_ span gas that you selected under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(7) Introduce the CH_4_ span gas that you selected under paragraph (d)(2) of this section into the FID analyzer.


(8) Allow time for the analyzer response to stabilize. Stabilization time may include time to purge the analyzer and to account for its response.


(9) While the analyzer measures the CH_4_ concentration, record 30 seconds of sampled data. Calculate the arithmetic mean of these values.


(10) For analyzers with multiple ranges, you need to perform the procedure in this paragraph (d) only on a single range.


(11) Divide the mean measured concentration by the recorded span concentration of the CH_4_ calibration gas. The result is the FID analyzer's response factor for CH_4_, *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_.




(12) You may determine the response factor as a function of molar water concentration using the following procedures and use this response factor to account for the CH_4_ response for NMHC determination described in § 1065.660(b)(2)(iii):


(i) Humidify the CH_4_ span gas as described in § 1065.365(g) and repeat the steps in paragraphs (d)(7) through (9) of this section until measurements are complete for each setpoint in the selected range.


(ii) Divide each mean measured CH_4_ concentration by the recorded span concentration of the CH_4_ calibration gas, adjusted for water content, to determine the FID analyzer's CH_4_ response factor, *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]._

(iii) Use the CH_4_ response factors at the different setpoints to create a functional relationship between response factor and molar water concentration, downstream of the last sample dryer if any sample dryers are present.


(iv) Use this functional relationship to determine the response factor during an emission test.






(e) *THC FID CH*_4_*response verification.* This procedure is only for FID analyzers that measure THC. Verify *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ as follows:


(1) Perform a CH_4_ response factor determination as described in paragraph (d) of this section. If the resulting value of *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ is within ±5% of its most recent previously determined value, the THC FID passes the CH_4_ response verification. For example, if the most recent previous value for *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ was 1.05 and it increased by 0.05 to become 1.10 or it decreased by 0.05 to become 1.00, either case would be acceptable because ±4.8% is less than ±5%.


(2) If *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ is not within the tolerance specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, use good engineering judgment to verify that the flow rates and/or pressures of FID fuel, burner air, and sample are at their most recent previously recorded values, as determined in paragraph (c) of this section. You may adjust these flow rates as necessary. Then determine the *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ as described in paragraph (d) of this section and verify that it is within the tolerance specified in this paragraph (e).


(3) If *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ is not within the tolerance specified in this paragraph (e), re-optimize the FID response as described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(4) Determine a new *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Use this new value of *RF*_CH4[THC-FID]_ in the calculations for HC determination, as described in § 1065.660.


(5) For analyzers with multiple ranges, you need to perform the procedure in this paragraph (e) only on a single range.


(f) *THC FID C*_2_H_6_ response factor determination. This procedure is only for FID analyzers that measure THC. Since FID analyzers generally have a different response to C_2_H_6_ than C_3_H_8_, determine the THC-FID analyzer's C_2_H_6_ response factor, *RF*_C2H6[THC-FID],_ after FID optimization using the procedure described in paragraph (d) of this section, replacing CH_4_ with C_2_H_6_. Use the most recent *RF*_C2H6[THC-FID]_ measured according to this section in the calculations for HC determination described in § 1065.660 to compensate for C_2_H_6_ response.
