# § 1065.366   Interference verification for FTIR analyzers.

(a) *Scope and frequency.* If you measure CH_4_, C_2_H_6_, NMHC, or NMNEHC using an FTIR analyzer, verify the amount of interference after initial analyzer installation and after major maintenance.




(b) *Measurement principles.* Certain species can interfere with analyzers by causing a response similar to the target analyte. If the analyzer uses compensation algorithms that utilize measurements of other gases to meet this interference verification, a correct result depends on simultaneously conducting these other measurements to test the compensation algorithms during the analyzer interference verification.






(c) *System requirements.* An FTIR analyzer must have combined interference that is within ±2% of the flow-weighted mean concentration of CH_4_, NMHC, or NMNEHC expected at the standard, though we strongly recommend a lower interference that is within ±1%.


(d) *Procedure.* Perform the interference verification for an FTIR analyzer using the same procedure that applies for N_2_O analyzers in § 1065.375(d).
