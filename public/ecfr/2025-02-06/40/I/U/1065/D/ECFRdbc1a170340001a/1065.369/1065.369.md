# § 1065.369   H

(a) *Scope and frequency.* If you measure ethanol or methanol using a photoacoustic analyzer, verify the amount of H_2_O, CO, and CO_2_ interference after initial analyzer installation and after major maintenance.




(b) *Measurement principles.* H_2_O, CO, and CO_2_ can positively interfere with a photoacoustic analyzer by causing a response similar to ethanol or methanol. If the photoacoustic analyzer uses compensation algorithms that utilize measurements of other gases to meet this interference verification, a correct result depends on simultaneously conducting these other measurements to test the compensation algorithms during the analyzer interference verification.






(c) *System requirements.* Photoacoustic analyzers must have combined interference that is within (0.0 ±0.5) µmol/mol. We strongly recommend a lower interference that is within (0.0 ±0.25) µmol/mol.


(d) *Procedure.* Perform the interference verification by following the procedure in § 1065.375(d), comparing the results to paragraph (c) of this section.
