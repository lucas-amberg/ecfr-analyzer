# § 1065.640   Flow meter calibration calculations.

This section describes the calculations for calibrating various flow meters. After you calibrate a flow meter using these calculations, use the calculations described in § 1065.642 to calculate flow during an emission test. Paragraph (a) of this section first describes how to convert reference flow meter outputs for use in the calibration equations, which are presented on a molar basis. The remaining paragraphs describe the calibration calculations that are specific to certain types of flow meters.


(a) *Reference meter conversions.* The calibration equations in this section use molar flow rate, *n
*_ref_, as a reference quantity. If your reference meter outputs a flow rate in a different quantity, such as standard volume rate,*V
*_stdref_, actual volume rate,*V
*_actref_, or mass rate, *m
*_ref_, convert your reference meter output to a molar flow rate using the following equations, noting that while values for volume rate, mass rate, pressure, temperature, and molar mass may change during an emission test, you should ensure that they are as constant as practical for each individual set point during a flow meter calibration:


(b) *PDP calibration calculations.* Perform the following steps to calibrate a PDP flow meter:


(1) Calculate PDP volume pumped per revolution, *V*_rev,_ for each restrictor position from the mean values determined in § 1065.340 as follows:


(2) Calculate a PDP slip correction factor, *K*_s_, for each restrictor position from the mean values determined in § 1065.340 as follows:


(3) Perform a least-squares regression of *V*_rev_, versus *K*_s_, by calculating slope, *a*_1_, and intercept, *a*_0_, as described for a floating intercept in § 1065.602.


(4) Repeat the procedure in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section for every speed that you run your PDP.


(5) The following table illustrates a range of typical values for different PDP speeds:


(6) For each speed at which you operate the PDP, use the appropriate regression equation from this paragraph (b) to calculate flow rate during emission testing as described in § 1065.642.


(c) *Venturi governing equations and permissible assumptions.* This section describes the governing equations and permissible assumptions for calibrating a venturi and calculating flow using a venturi. Because a subsonic venturi (SSV) and a critical-flow venturi (CFV) both operate similarly, their governing equations are nearly the same, except for the equation describing their pressure ratio, *r* (*i.e., r*_SSV_ versus *r*_CFV_). These governing equations assume one-dimensional isentropic inviscid flow of an ideal gas. Paragraph (c)(5) of this section describes other assumptions that may apply. If good engineering judgment dictates that you account for gas compressibility, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values of *Z* as a function of measured pressure and temperature, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment. Note that the equation for the flow coefficient, *C*_f_, is based on the ideal gas assumption that the isentropic exponent, _g_, is equal to the ratio of specific heats, *C*_p_/*C*_v._ If good engineering judgment dictates using a real gas isentropic exponent, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values of *γ* as a function of measured pressures and temperatures, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment.


(1) Calculate molar flow rate, *n
*, as follows:


(2) Using the data collected in § 1065.340, calculate *C*_d_ for each flow rate using the following equation:


(3) Determine *C*_f_ using one of the following methods:


(i) For CFV flow meters only, determine *C*_fCFV_ from the following table based on your values for *β* and *γ*, using linear interpolation to find intermediate values:


(ii) For any CFV or SSV flow meter, you may use the following equation to calculate *C*_f_ for each flow rate:


(4) Calculate *r* as follows:


(i) For SSV systems only, calculate *r*_SSV_ using the following equation:


(ii) For CFV systems only, calculate *r*_CFV_ iteratively using the following equation:


(5) You may apply any of the following simplifying assumptions or develop other values as appropriate for your test configuration, consistent with good engineering judgment:


(i) For raw exhaust, diluted exhaust, and dilution air, you may assume that the gas mixture behaves as an ideal gas: *Z* = 1.


(ii) For raw exhaust, you may assume _g_ = 1.385.


(iii) For diluted exhaust and dilution air, you may assume _g_ = 1.399.


(iv) For diluted exhaust and dilution air, you may assume the molar mass of the mixture, *M*_mix,_ is a function only of the amount of water in the dilution air or calibration air, as follows:


(v) For diluted exhaust and dilution air, you may assume a constant molar mass of the mixture, *M*_mix,_ for all calibration and all testing as long as your assumed molar mass differs no more than ±1% from the estimated minimum and maximum molar mass during calibration and testing.


You may assume this, using good engineering judgment, if you sufficiently control the amount of water in calibration air and in dilution air or if you remove sufficient water from both calibration air and dilution air. The following table gives examples of permissible ranges of dilution air dewpoint versus calibration air dewpoint:


(6) The following example illustrates the use of the governing equations to calculate *C*_d_ of an SSV flow meter at one reference flow meter value. Note that calculating *C*_d_ for a CFV flow meter would be similar, except that *C*_f_ would be determined from Table 2 of this section or calculated iteratively using values of _b_ and _g_ as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(d) *SSV calibration.* Perform the following steps to calibrate an SSV flow meter:


(1) Calculate the Reynolds number, *Re*_#_, for each reference molar flow rate, *n
*_ref_, using the throat diameter of the venturi, *d*_t_. Because the dynamic viscosity, µ, is needed to compute *Re*_#_, you may use your own fluid viscosity model to determine µ for your calibration gas (usually air), using good engineering judgment. Alternatively, you may use the Sutherland three-coefficient viscosity model to approximate µ, as shown in the following sample calculation for *Re*_#_:


Where, using the Sutherland three-coefficient viscosity model as captured in Table 4 of this section:


(2) Create an equation for *C*_d_ as a function of *Re*_#_, using paired values of the two quantities. The equation may involve any mathematical expression, including a polynomial or a power series. The following equation is an example of a commonly used mathematical expression for relating *C*_d_ and *Re*_#_:


(3) Perform a least-squares regression analysis to determine the best-fit coefficients for the equation and calculate *SEE* as described in § 1065.602. When using Eq. 1065.640-12, treat C_d_ as *y* and the radical term as *y*_ref_ and use Eq. 1065.602-12 to calculate *SEE*. When using another mathematical expression, use the same approach to substitute that expression into the numerator of Eq. 1065.602-12 and replace the 2 in the denominator with the number of coefficients in the mathematical expression.


(4) If the equation meets the criterion of *SEE* ≤ 0.5% · *C*_dmax,_ you may use the equation for the corresponding range of *Re*_#_, as described in § 1065.642.


(5) If the equation does not meet the specified statistical criterion, you may use good engineering judgment to omit calibration data points; however you must use at least seven calibration data points to demonstrate that you meet the criterion. For example, this may involve narrowing the range of flow rates for a better curve fit.


(6) Take corrective action if the equation does not meet the specified statistical criterion even after omitting calibration data points. For example, select another mathematical expression for the *C*_d_ versus *Re*_#_ equation, check for leaks, or repeat the calibration process. If you must repeat the calibration process, we recommend applying tighter tolerances to measurements and allowing more time for flows to stabilize.


(7) Once you have an equation that meets the specified statistical criterion, you may use the equation only for the corresponding range of *Re*_#_.


(e) *CFV calibration.* Some CFV flow meters consist of a single venturi and some consist of multiple venturis, where different combinations of venturis are used to meter different flow rates. For CFV flow meters that consist of multiple venturis, either calibrate each venturi independently to determine a separate discharge coefficient, *C*_d_, for each venturi, or calibrate each combination of venturis as one venturi. In the case where you calibrate a combination of venturis, use the sum of the active venturi throat areas as *A*_t_, the square root of the sum of the squares of the active venturi throat diameters as *d*_t_, and the ratio of the venturi throat to inlet diameters as the ratio of the square root of the sum of the active venturi throat diameters (*d*_t_) to the diameter of the common entrance to all the venturis. (*D*). To determine the *C*_d_ for a single venturi or a single combination of venturis, perform the following steps:


(1) Use the data collected at each calibration set point to calculate an individual *C*_d_ for each point using Eq. 1065.640-4.


(2) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of all the *C*_d_ values according to Eqs. 1065.602-1 and 1065.602-2.


(3) If the standard deviation of all the *C*_d_ values is less than or equal to 0.3% of the mean *C*_d,_ use the mean *C*_d_ in Eq. 1065.642-4, and use the CFV only up to the highest venturi pressure ratio, *r,* measured during calibration using the following equation:


(4) If the standard deviation of all the *C*_d_ values exceeds 0.3% of the mean *C*_d_, omit the *C*_d_ value corresponding to the data point collected at the highest *r* measured during calibration.


(5) If the number of remaining data points is less than seven, take corrective action by checking your calibration data or repeating the calibration process. If you repeat the calibration process, we recommend checking for leaks, applying tighter tolerances to measurements and allowing more time for flows to stabilize.


(6) If the number of remaining *C*_d_ values is seven or greater, recalculate the mean and standard deviation of the remaining *C*_d_ values.


(7) If the standard deviation of the remaining *C*_d_ values is less than or equal to 0.3% of the mean of the remaining *C*_d_, use that mean *C*_d_ in Eq. 1065.642-4, and use the CFV values only up to the highest *r* associated with the remaining *C*_d_.


(8) If the standard deviation of the remaining *C*_d_ still exceeds 0.3% of the mean of the remaining *C*_d_ values, repeat the steps in paragraph (e)(4) through (8) of this section.
