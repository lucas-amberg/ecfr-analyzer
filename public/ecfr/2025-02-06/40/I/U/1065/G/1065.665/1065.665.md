# ยง 1065.665   THCE and NMHCE determination.

(a) If you measured an oxygenated hydrocarbon's mass concentration, first calculate its molar concentration in the exhaust sample stream from which the sample was taken (raw or diluted exhaust), and convert this into a C_1_-equivalent molar concentration. Add these C_1_-equivalent molar concentrations to the molar concentration of non-oxygenated total hydrocarbon (NOTHC). The result is the molar concentration of total hydrocarbon equivalent (THCE). Calculate THCE concentration using the following equations, noting that Eq. 1065.665-3 is required only if you need to convert your oxygenated hydrocarbon (OHC) concentration from mass to moles:


(b) If we require you to determine nonmethane hydrocarbon equivalent (NMHCE), use the following equation:


(c) The following example shows how to determine NMHCE emissions based on ethanol (C_2_H_5_OH), methanol (CH_3_OH), acetaldehyde (C_2_H_4_O), and formaldehyde (CH_2_O) as C_1_-equivalent molar concentrations:
