# ยง 1065.675   CLD quench verification calculations.

Perform CLD quench-check calculations as follows:


(a) Perform a CLD analyzer quench verification test as described in ยง 1065.370.


(b) Estimate the maximum expected mole fraction of water during emission testing, *x*_H2Oexp._ Make this estimate where the humidified NO span gas was introduced in ยง 1065.370(e)(6). When estimating the maximum expected mole fraction of water, consider the maximum expected water content in intake air, fuel combustion products, and dilution air (if applicable). If you introduced the humidified NO span gas into the sample system upstream of a sample dryer during the verification test, you need not estimate the maximum expected mole fraction of water and you must set *x*_H2Oexp_ equal to *x*_H2Omeas._

(c) Estimate the maximum expected CO_2_ concentration during emission testing, *x*_CO2exp_. Make this estimate at the sample system location where the blended NO and CO_2_ span gases are introduced according to ยง 1065.370(d)(10). When estimating the maximum expected CO_2_ concentration, consider the maximum expected CO_2_ content in fuel combustion products and dilution air.


(d) Calculate quench as follows:
