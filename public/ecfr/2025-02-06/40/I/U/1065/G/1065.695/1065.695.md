(xi) Bypassed governor controls during testing.


(xii) Date, time, and location of test (e.g., dynamometer laboratory identification).


(xiii) Cooling medium for engine and charge air.


(xiv) Operating temperatures of coolant, head, and block.


(xv) Natural or forced cool-down and cool-down time.
