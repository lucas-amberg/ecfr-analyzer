# ยง 1065.725   High-level ethanol-gasoline blends.

For testing vehicles capable of operating on a high-level ethanol-gasoline blend, create a test fuel as follows:


(a) Add ethanol to an E10 fuel meeting the specifications described in ยง 1065.710 until the ethanol content of the blended fuel is between 80 and 83 volume %.


(b) You may alternatively add ethanol to a gasoline base fuel with no ethanol if you can demonstrate that such a base fuel blended with the proper amount of ethanol would meet all the specifications for E10 test fuel described in ยง 1065.710, other than the ethanol content.


(c) The ethanol used for blending must be either denatured fuel ethanol meeting the specifications in 40 CFR 1090.270, or fuel-grade ethanol with no denaturant. Account for the volume of any denaturant when calculating volumetric percentages.


(d) The blended test fuel must have a dry vapor pressure equivalent between 41.5 and 45.1 kPa (6.0 and 6.5 psi) when measured using the procedure specified in ยง 1065.710. You may add commercial grade butane as needed to meet this specification.
