# ยง 1065.801   Applicability.

(a) This subpart applies for testing with oxygenated fuels. Unless the standard-setting part specifies otherwise, the requirements of this subpart do not apply for fuels that contain less than 25% oxygenated compounds by volume. For example, you generally do not need to follow the requirements of this subpart for tests performed using a fuel containing 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, but you must follow these requirements for tests performed using a fuel containing 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.


(b) Section 1065.805 applies for all other testing that requires measurement of any alcohols or carbonyls.


(c) This subpart specifies sampling procedures and calculations that are different than those used for non-oxygenated fuels. All other test procedures of this part 1065 apply for testing with oxygenated fuels.
