# ยง 1066.25   Recordkeeping.

(a) The procedures in this part include various requirements to record data or other information. Refer to the standard-setting part and ยง 1066.695 regarding specific recordkeeping requirements.


(b) You must promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. We may review them at any time.


(c) We may waive specific reporting or recordkeeping requirements we determine to be unnecessary for the purposes of this part and the standard-setting part. Note that while we will generally keep the records required by this part, we are not obligated to keep records we determine to be unnecessary for us to keep. For example, while we require you to keep records for invalid tests so we may verify that your invalidation was appropriate, it is not necessary for us to keep records for our own invalid tests.
