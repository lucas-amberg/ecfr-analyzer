# § 1066.255   Parasitic loss verification.

(a) *Overview.* Verify the dynamometer's parasitic loss as described in this section, and correct as necessary. This procedure determines the dynamometer's internal losses that it must overcome to simulate road load. Characterize these losses in a parasitic loss curve that the dynamometer uses to apply compensating forces to maintain the desired road-load force at the roll surface.


(b) *Scope and frequency.* Perform this verification upon initial installation, after major maintenance, and upon failure of a verification in either § 1066.270 or § 1066.275.


(c) *Procedure.* Perform this verification by following the dynamometer manufacturer's specifications to establish a parasitic loss curve, taking data at fixed speed intervals to cover the range of vehicle speeds that will occur during testing. You may zero the load cell at a selected speed if that improves your ability to determine the parasitic loss. Parasitic loss forces may never be negative. Note that the torque transducers must be mathematically zeroed and spanned prior to performing this procedure.


(d) *Performance evaluation.* Some dynamometers automatically update the parasitic loss curve for further testing. If this is not the case, compare the new parasitic loss curve to the original parasitic loss curve from the dynamometer manufacturer or the most recent parasitic loss curve you programmed into the dynamometer. You may reprogram the dynamometer to accept the new curve in all cases, and you must reprogram the dynamometer if any point on the new curve departs from the earlier curve by more than ±9.0 N (±2.0 lbf) for dynamometers capable of testing vehicles at or below 20,000 pounds GVWR, or ±36.0 N (±8.0 lbf) for dynamometers not capable of testing vehicles at or below 20,000 pounds GVWR.
