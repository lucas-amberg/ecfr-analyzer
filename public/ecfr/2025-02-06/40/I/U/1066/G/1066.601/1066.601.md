# § 1066.601   Overview.

(a) This subpart describes calculations used to determine emission rates. See the standard-setting part and the other provisions of this part to determine which equations apply for your testing. This subpart describes how to—


(1) Use the signals recorded before, during, and after an emission test to calculate distance-specific emissions of each regulated pollutant.


(2) Perform calculations for calibrations and performance checks.


(3) Determine statistical values.


(b) You may use data from multiple systems to calculate test results for a single emission test, consistent with good engineering judgment. You may also make multiple measurements from a single batch sample, such as multiple weighing of a PM filter or multiple readings from a bag sample. Although you may use an average of multiple measurements from a single test, you may not use test results from multiple emission tests to report emissions. We allow weighted means where appropriate, such as for sampling onto a PM filter over the FTP. You may discard statistical outliers, but you must report all results.
