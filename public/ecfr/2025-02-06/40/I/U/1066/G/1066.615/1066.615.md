You may correct NO_X_ emissions for intake-air humidity as described in this section if the standard-setting part allows it. See ยง 1066.605(c) for the proper sequence for applying the NO_X_ intake-air humidity correction.


(a) For vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR, apply a correction for vehicles with reciprocating engines operating over specific test cycles as follows:


(1) Calculate a humidity correction using a time-weighted mean value for ambient humidity over the test interval. Calculate absolute ambient humidity, *H*, using the following equation:


(2) Use the following equation to correct measured concentrations to a reference condition of 10.71 grams H_2_O vapor per kilogram of dry air for the FTP, US06, LA-92, SC03, and HFET test cycles:


(b) For vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR, apply correction factors as described in 40 CFR 1065.670.
