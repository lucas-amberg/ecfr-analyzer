# ยง 1066.630   PDP, SSV, and CFV flow rate calculations.

This section describes the equations for calculating flow rates from various flow meters. After you calibrate a flow meter according to ยง 1066.625, use the calculations described in this section to calculate flow during an emission test. Calculate flow according to 40 CFR 1065.642 instead if you calculate emissions based on molar flow rates.


(a) *PDP.* (1) Based on the speed at which you operate the PDP for a test interval, select the corresponding slope, *a*_1,_ and intercept, *a*_0,_ as determined in ยง 1066.625(a), to calculate PDP flow rate, *v
*, as follows:


(2) Calculate *V*_rev_ using the following equation:


(b) *SSV.* Calculate SSV flow rate, *v
*, as follows:


(c) *CFV.* If you use multiple venturis and you calibrated each venturi independently to determine a separate calibration coefficient, *K*_v,_ for each venturi, calculate the individual volume flow rates through each venturi and sum all their flow rates to determine CFV flow rate, *V
*. If you use multiple venturis and you calibrated venturis in combination, calculate *V
* using the *K*_v_ that was determined for that combination of venturis.


(1) To calculate *V
* through one venturi or a combination of venturis, use the mean *K*_v_ you determined in ยง 1066.625(c) and calculate *V
* as follows:


(2) [Reserved]
