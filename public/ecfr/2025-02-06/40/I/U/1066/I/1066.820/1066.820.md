# § 1066.820   Composite calculations for FTP exhaust emissions.

(a) Determine the mass of exhaust emissions of each pollutant for each FTP test interval as described in § 1066.605.


(b) Calculate the final composite gaseous test results as a mass-weighted value, *e*_[emission]-FTPcomp_, in grams per mile using the following equation:


(c) Calculate the final composite PM test results as a mass-weighted value, *e*_PM-FTPcomp,_ in grams per mile as follows:


(1) Use the following equation for PM measured as described in § 1066.815(b)(1), (2), or (3):


(2) Use the following equation for PM measured as described in § 1066.815(b)(4):


(3) Use the following equation for PM measured as described in § 1066.815(b)(5):
