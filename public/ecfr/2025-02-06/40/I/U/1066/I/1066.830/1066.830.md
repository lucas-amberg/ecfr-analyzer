# § 1066.830   Supplemental Federal Test Procedures; overview.

Sections 1066.831 and 1066.835 describe the detailed procedures for the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP). This testing applies for Tier 3 vehicles subject to the SFTP standards in 40 CFR 86.1811-17 or 86.1816-18. The SFTP test procedure consists of FTP testing and two additional test elements—a sequence of vehicle operation with more aggressive driving and a sequence of vehicle operation that accounts for the impact of the vehicle's air conditioner. Tier 4 vehicles subject to 40 CFR 86.1811-27 must meet standards for each individual driving cycle.


(a) The SFTP standard applies as a composite representing the three test elements. The emission results from the aggressive driving test element (§ 1066.831), the air conditioning test element (§ 1066.835), and the FTP test element (§ 1066.820) are analyzed according to the calculation methodology and compared to the applicable SFTP emission standards as described in 40 CFR part 86, subpart S.


(b) The test elements of the SFTP may be run in any sequence that includes the specified preconditioning steps.
