# ยง 1068.15   General provisions for EPA decision-making.

(a) Not all EPA employees may represent the Agency with respect to EPA decisions under this part or the standard-setting part. Only the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or an official to whom the Administrator has delegated specific authority may represent the Agency. For more information, ask for a copy of the relevant sections of the EPA Delegations Manual from the Designated Compliance Officer.


(b) The regulations in this part and in the standard-setting part have specific requirements describing how to get EPA approval before you take specific actions. These regulations also allow us to waive some specific requirements. For provisions or flexibilities that we address frequently, we may choose to provide detailed guidance in supplemental compliance instructions for manufacturers. Such instructions will generally state how they relate to the need for pre-approval. Unless we explicitly state so, you should not consider full compliance with the instructions to be equivalent to EPA approval.
