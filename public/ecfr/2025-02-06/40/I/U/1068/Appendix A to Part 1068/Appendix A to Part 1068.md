# Appendix A to Part 1068â€”Emission-Related Components 


This appendix specifies emission-related components that we refer to for describing such things as emission-related warranty or maintenance or requirements related to rebuilding engines. Note that inclusion of a component in Section III of this Appendix does not make it an emission-related component for engines/equipment that are not subject to evaporative emission standards.




I. For exhaust emissions, emission-related components include any engine parts related to the following systems:


1. Air-induction system.


2. Fuel system.


3. Ignition system.


4. Exhaust gas recirculation systems.


II. The following parts are also considered emission-related components for exhaust emissions: 


1. Aftertreatment devices.


2. Crankcase ventilation valves.


3. Sensors.


4. Electronic control units.


III. The following parts are considered emission-related components for evaporative emissions:


1. Fuel Tank.


2. Fuel Cap.


3. Fuel Line.


4. Fuel Line Fittings.


5. Clamps*.


6. Pressure Relief Valves*.


7. Control Valves*.


8. Control Solenoids*.


9. Electronic Controls*.


10. Vacuum Control Diaphragms*.


11. Control Cables*.


12. Control Linkages*.


13. Purge Valves.


14. Vapor Hoses.


15. Liquid/Vapor Separator.


16. Carbon Canister.


17. Canister Mounting Brackets.


18. Carburetor Purge Port Connector.


*As related to the evaporative emission control system.


IV. Any other part or system that meets the definition of critical emission-related component.
