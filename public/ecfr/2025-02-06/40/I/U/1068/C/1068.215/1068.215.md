# § 1068.215   Exempting manufacturer-owned engines/equipment.

(a) You are eligible for this exemption for manufacturer-owned engines/equipment only if you are a certificate holder. Any engine for which you meet all applicable requirements under this section is exempt without request.


(b) Engines/equipment may be exempt without a request if they are nonconforming engines/equipment under your ownership, possession, and control and you do not operate them for purposes other than to develop products, assess production methods, or promote your engines/equipment in the marketplace, or other purposes we approve. You may not loan, lease, sell, or use the engine/equipment to generate revenue, either by itself or for an engine installed in a piece of equipment, except as allowed by § 1068.201(i). Note that this paragraph (b) does not prevent the sale or shipment of a partially complete engine to a secondary engine manufacturer that will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b). *See* § 1068.262 for provisions related to shipping partially complete engines to secondary engine manufacturers.


(c) To use this exemption, you must do three things:


(1) Establish, maintain, and keep adequately organized and indexed information on all exempted engines/equipment, including the engine/equipment identification number, the use of the engine/equipment on exempt status, and the final disposition of any engine/equipment removed from exempt status.
