You may then have to export the engines/equipment, pay civil penalties, or both. U.S. Customs and Border Protection may seize unlawfully imported engines and equipment.

EPA or U.S. Customs and Border Protection may offer you a grace period to allow you to export temporarily exempted engines/equipment without penalty after the exemption expires.
