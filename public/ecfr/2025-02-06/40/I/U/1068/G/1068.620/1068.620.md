(a) You may request an informal hearing as described in § 1068.650 if you disagree with our decision to order a recall.


(b) You must send your hearing request in writing to the Designated Compliance Officer no later than 45 days after we notify you of our decision, or by some later deadline we specify. If the specified deadline passes, we may nevertheless grant you a hearing at our discretion.


(c) Your hearing request must include the information specified in § 1068.610(d).


(d) We will approve your request for an informal hearing if we find that your request raises a substantial factual issue in the decision we made that, if addressed differently, could alter the outcome of that decision.
