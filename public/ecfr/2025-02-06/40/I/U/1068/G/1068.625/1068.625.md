(b) Send a request for a hearing in writing to the Designated Compliance Officer within the following time frame, as applicable:


(1) No later than 15 days after we notify you that we have approved a nonconformance penalty under this subpart if the compliance level is in the allowable range of nonconformity.


(2) No later than 15 days after completion of the Production Compliance Audit if the compliance level exceeds the upper limit.


(3) No later than 15 days after we notify you of an adverse decision for all other cases.

a hearing at our discretion.


(d) Your hearing request must include the information specified in § 1068.610(d).
