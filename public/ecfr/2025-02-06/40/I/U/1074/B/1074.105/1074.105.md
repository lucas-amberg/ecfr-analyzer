(b) The authorization will not be granted if the Administrator finds that any of the following are true:


(1) California's determination is arbitrary and capricious.


(2) California does not need such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.


(3) The California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with section 209 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7543).


(c) In considering any request from California to authorize the state to adopt or enforce standards or other requirements relating to control of emissions from new nonroad spark-ignition engines smaller than 50 horsepower, the Administrator will give appropriate consideration to safety factors (including the potential increased risk of burn or fire) associated with compliance with the California standard.
