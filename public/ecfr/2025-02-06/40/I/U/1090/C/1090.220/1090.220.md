# § 1090.220   RFG standards.

The standards in this section apply to gasoline that is designated as RFG or RBOB or that is used in an RFG covered area. Gasoline that meets the requirements of this section is deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7545(k).


(a) *Sulfur standards.* RFG or RBOB must comply with the sulfur average standard in § 1090.205(a) and the sulfur per-gallon standards in § 1090.205(b) and (c).


(b) *Benzene standards.* RFG or RBOB must comply with the benzene average standards in § 1090.210(a) and (b).


(c) *RVP standard.* Summer RFG or Summer RBOB must comply with the RFG RVP standard in § 1090.215(a)(3).


(d) *Heavy metals standard.* RFG or RBOB must not contain any heavy metals, including but not limited to lead or manganese. EPA may waive this prohibition for a heavy metal (other than lead) if EPA determines that addition of the heavy metal to the gasoline will not increase, on an aggregate mass or cancer-risk basis, toxic air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles.


(e) *Certified butane and certified pentane blending limitation.* Certified butane and certified pentane must not be blended with Summer RFG or Summer RBOB under § 1090.1320.
