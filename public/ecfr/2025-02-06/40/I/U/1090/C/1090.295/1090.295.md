(3) For any federal 7.8 psi gasoline area covered by the request where emissions reductions from the federal 7.8 psi gasoline are relied upon as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the request must include the following information:


(i) Identify whether the state is withdrawing any submitted SIP that has not yet been approved.


(ii)(A) Identify whether the state intends to submit a SIP revision to any approved SIP or any submitted SIP that has not yet been approved, which relies on emissions reductions from federal 7.8 psi gasoline, and describe any control measures that the state plans to submit to EPA for approval to replace the emissions reductions from federal 7.8 psi gasoline.


(B) A description of the state's plans and schedule for adopting and submitting any revision to any approved SIP or any submitted SIP that has not yet been approved.
