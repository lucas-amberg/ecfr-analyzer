# § 1090.740   Downstream BOB recertification.

(a)(1) A gasoline manufacturer may recertify a BOB that another gasoline manufacturer has specified blending instructions for oxygenate(s) under § 1090.710(a)(5) for a different type or amount of oxygenate, including gasoline recertification to contain no oxygenate, if the recertifying gasoline manufacturer meets all the requirements of this section.


(2) A gasoline manufacturer must comply with applicable requirements of this part and incur deficits to be included in their compliance calculations in § 1090.700 for each facility at which the gasoline manufacturer recertifies BOB.


(3) Unless otherwise required under this part, a gasoline manufacturer that recertifies 1,000,000 or less gallons of BOB under this section at a facility does not need to obtain credits to satisfy deficits incurred under this section or arrange for an auditor to conduct audits under subpart S of this part for that facility. The gasoline manufacturer must still comply with all other applicable provisions of this part (*e.g.,* register and submit reports under subparts I and J of this part, respectively).


(4) A party that only recertifies BOB that contains a greater amount of a specified oxygenate (*e.g.,* a party adds 15 volume percent DFE instead of 10 volume percent to an E10 BOB) or a different oxygenate at an equal or greater amount (*e.g.,* a party adds 16 volume percent isobutanol instead of 10 volume percent to an E10 BOB) does not incur deficits under this section, does not need to submit reports under subpart J of this part, and does not need to arrange for an auditor to conduct an audit under subpart S of this part. The party must still comply with all other applicable provisions of this part (*e.g.,* register and keep records under subparts I and M of this part, respectively).


(b) A gasoline manufacturer that recertifies a BOB under this section must calculate sulfur and benzene deficits for each batch and the total deficits for sulfur and benzene as follows:


(1) *Sulfur deficits from downstream BOB recertification.* Calculate the sulfur deficit from BOB recertification for each individual batch of BOB recertified as follows:


(2) *Total sulfur deficit from downstream BOB recertification.* Calculate the total sulfur deficit from downstream BOB recertification for each facility as follows:


(3) *Benzene deficits from downstream BOB recertification.* Calculate the benzene deficit from BOB recertification for each individual batch of BOB recertified as follows:


(4) *Total benzene deficit from downstream BOB recertification.* Calculate the total benzene deficit from downstream BOB recertification for each facility as follows:


(5) *Deficit rounding.* The deficits calculated in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section must be rounded and reported to the nearest sulfur ppm-gallon or benzene gallon in accordance with § 1090.50, as applicable.


(c) A gasoline manufacturer does not incur a deficit, nor may they generate credits, for negative values from the equations in paragraph (b) of this section.


(d) Deficits incurred under this section must be fulfilled in the compliance period in which they occur and must not be carried forward under § 1090.715.
