(I) The distillation parameters, if tested.


(3) For each diesel sample collected at a retail outlet by the independent surveyor:


(i) A description of the labeling of the fuel dispenser(s) (*e.g.,* “ULSD”) from which the independent surveyor collected the sample.


(ii) The date and time the independent surveyor collected the sample.


(iii) The tested sulfur content of the sample, and the test method used, as determined by the independent surveyor, in ppm.


(4) Any other information as EPA may require in order to administer reporting systems.


(c) *NFSP annual reporting.* An independent surveyor conducting the NFSP under § 1090.1405 must submit the following information annually by March 31.


(1) An identification of the parties that participated in the survey during the compliance period.


(2) An identification of each geographic area included in a survey.


(3) Summary statistics for each identified geographic area, including the following:


(i) The number of samples collected and tested.


(ii) The mean, median, and range expressed in appropriate units for each measured gasoline and diesel parameter.


(iii) The standard deviation for each measured gasoline and diesel parameter.


(iv) The estimated compliance rate for each measured gasoline and diesel parameter subject to a per-gallon standard in subpart C or D of this part.


(v) A summary of potential non-compliance issues.


(4) Any other information as EPA may require in order to administer reporting systems.


(d) *NSTOP quarterly reporting.* An independent surveyor conducting the NSTOP under § 1090.1450 must submit the following information quarterly, as applicable:


(1) For each gasoline manufacturing facility sampled by the independent surveyor:


(i) The EPA-issued company and facility identifiers for the gasoline manufacturer and the gasoline manufacturing facility.


(ii) [Reserved]


(2) For each gasoline sample collected by the independent surveyor:


(i) The designation of the gasoline.


(ii) The date and time the independent surveyor collected the sample.


(iii) The batch number or the sample identification number as assigned by the independent surveyor in a consistent manner and as specified in the survey plan.


(iv) A description of any instance in which the gasoline manufacturer did not follow the applicable sampling procedures.


(v) The test results for the sample, and the test methods used, as determined by the independent surveyor, including the following parameters:


(A) The sulfur content, in ppm.


(B) The benzene content, in volume percent.


(C) The RVP in psi, if tested.


(vi) The test results for the sample, and the test methods used, as determined by the gasoline manufacturer, including the following parameters:

(B) The benzene content, in volume percent.


(C) The RVP in psi, if tested.


(vii) If available, the test results for the sample, and the test methods used, as determined by EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, including the following parameters:


(A) The sulfur content, in ppm.


(B) The benzene content, in volume percent.


(C) The RVP in psi, if tested.


(viii) The determined site precision under § 1090.1450(c)(10)(i) and the test performance index under § 1090.1450(c)(10)(ii) for each method and instrument that the gasoline manufacturer used to test the sample.


(ix) The reproducibility of each method that the gasoline manufacturer used to test the sample.


(x) Any applicable correlation equations used to compare the gasoline manufacturer's test results to the independent surveyor's test results.


(3) Any other information as EPA may require in order to administer reporting systems.
