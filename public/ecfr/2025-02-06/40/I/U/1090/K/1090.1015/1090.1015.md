# § 1090.1015   Designation requirements for diesel and distillate fuels.

(a) *Designation requirements for diesel and distillate fuel manufacturers.* (1) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a diesel fuel or distillate fuel manufacturer must accurately and clearly designate each batch of diesel fuel or distillate fuel as at least one of the following fuel types:


(i) ULSD. A diesel fuel manufacturer may also designate ULSD as 15 ppm MVNRLM diesel fuel.


(ii) 500 ppm LM diesel fuel.


(iii) Heating oil.


(iv) Jet fuel.


(v) Kerosene.


(vi) ECA marine fuel.


(vii) Distillate global marine fuel.


(viii) Certified NTDF.


(ix) Exempt diesel fuel or distillate fuel under subpart G of this part (including additional identifying information).


(2) Only a fuel manufacturer that complies with the requirements in § 1090.515 may designate fuel as 500 ppm LM diesel fuel.


(3) Any batch of diesel fuel or distillate fuel that is certified and designated as ULSD may also be designated as heating oil, kerosene, ECA marine fuel, jet fuel, or distillate global marine fuel if it is also suitable for such use.


(b) *Designation requirements for distributors of diesel and distillate fuels.* A distributor of diesel and distillate fuels must accurately and clearly designate each batch of diesel fuel or distillate fuel for which they transfer custody as follows:


(1) A distributor must accurately and clearly designate such diesel fuel or distillate fuel by sulfur content while it is in their custody (*e.g.,* as 15 ppm or 500 ppm).


(2) A distributor must accurately and clearly designate such diesel fuel or distillate fuel as specified by the diesel fuel or distillate fuel manufacturer under paragraph (a) of this section.


(3) A distributor may redesignate batches or portions of batches of diesel fuel or distillate fuel for which they transfer custody to another facility without recertifying the batch or portion of the batch as follows:


(i) ULSD that is also suitable for use as kerosene or jet fuel (commonly referred to as dual use kerosene) may be designated as ULSD, kerosene, or jet fuel (as applicable).


(ii) ULSD may be redesignated as 500 ppm LM diesel fuel, heating oil, kerosene, ECA marine fuel, jet fuel, or distillate global marine fuel without recertification if all applicable requirements under this part are met for the new fuel designation.


(iii) California diesel may be redesignated as ULSD if the requirements specified in § 1090.625(e) are met.


(iv) Heating oil, kerosene, ECA marine fuel, or jet fuel may be redesignated as ULSD if the fuel meets the ULSD standards in § 1090.305 and was designated as ULSD under paragraph (a) of this section.


(v) 500 ppm LM diesel fuel may be redesignated as ECA marine fuel, distillate global marine fuel, or heating oil. Any person that redesignates 500 ppm LM diesel fuel to ECA marine fuel or distillate global marine fuel must maintain records from the producer of the 500 ppm LM diesel fuel (*i.e.,* PTDs accompanying the fuel under § 1090.1115) to demonstrate compliance with the 500 ppm sulfur standard in § 1090.320(b).


(vi) Fuel designated as certified NTDF may be redesignated as ULSD without recertification if the applicable requirements of 40 CFR 80.1408 are met.


(c) *ULSD designation limitation.* No person may designate distillate fuel with a sulfur content greater than the sulfur standard in § 1090.305(b) as ULSD.
