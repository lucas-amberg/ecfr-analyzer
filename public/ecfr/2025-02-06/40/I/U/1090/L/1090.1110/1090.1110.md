(C) “Low-RVP CBOB. This product does not meet the requirements for summer reformulated gasoline.”


(D) “RBOB. This product meets the requirements for summer reformulated or conventional gasoline.”


(ii) For BOBs designed to produce a finished gasoline that must meet an RVP standard required by any SIP approved or promulgated under 42 U.S.C. 7410 or 7502, additional or substitute language to satisfy the state program may be used as necessary but must include at a minimum the applicable RVP standard established under the SIP.


(c) *RFG and CG requirements.* For batches of RFG and CG, in addition to the information required under paragraph (a) of this section, the following information must be included on the PTD:


(1) *Summer gasoline language requirements.* (i) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, for summer gasoline, identification of the product with one of the following statements indicating the applicable RVP standard:


(A) For gasoline that meets the 9.0 psi RVP standard in § 1090.215(a)(1): “9.0 psi Gasoline.”


(B) For gasoline that meets the 7.8 psi RVP standard in § 1090.215(a)(2): “7.8 psi Gasoline.”


(C) For gasoline that meets the RFG 7.4 psi RVP standard in § 1090.215(a)(3): “Reformulated Gasoline.”


(ii) For finished gasoline that meets an RVP standard required by any SIP approved or promulgated under 42 U.S.C. 7410 or 7502, additional or substitute language to satisfy the state program may be used as necessary.


(2) *Ethanol content language requirements.* (i) For gasoline-ethanol blends, one of the following statements that accurately describes the gasoline:


(A) For gasoline containing no ethanol (“E0”), the following statement: “E0: Contains no ethanol.”


(B) For finished gasoline containing less than 9 volume percent ethanol, the following statement: “EX—Contains up to X% ethanol.” The term X refers to the maximum volume percent ethanol present in the gasoline-ethanol blend.


(C) For E10, the following statement: “E10: Contains between 9 and 10 vol % ethanol.”


(D) For E15, the following statement: “E15: Contains between 10 and 15 vol % ethanol.”


(E) For gasoline-ethanol blends containing more than 15 volume percent ethanol, the following statement: “EXX: Contains up to XX vol % ethanol.” The term XX refers to the maximum volume percent ethanol present in the gasoline-ethanol blend.


(ii) No person may designate a fuel as E10 if the fuel is produced by blending ethanol and gasoline in a manner designed to contain less than 9.0 or more than 10.0 volume percent ethanol.


(iii) No person may designate a fuel as E15 if the fuel is produced by blending ethanol and gasoline in a manner designed to contain less than 10.0 or more than 15.0 volume percent ethanol.


(d) *Oxygenate language requirements.* In addition to any other PTD requirements of this subpart, on each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any oxygenate upstream of any oxygenate blending facility, the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs that include the following information, as applicable:


(1) For DFE: “Denatured fuel ethanol, maximum 10 ppm sulfur.”


(2) For other oxygenates, the name of the specific oxygenate must be identified on the PTD, followed by “maximum 10 ppm sulfur.” For example, for isobutanol, the following statement on the PTD would be required, “Isobutanol, maximum 10 ppm sulfur.”


(e) *Gasoline detergent language requirements.* In addition to any other PTD requirements of this subpart, on each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any gasoline detergent, the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs that include the following information:


(1) The identity of the product being transferred as detergent, detergent-additized gasoline, or non-additized detergent gasoline.


(2) The name of the registered detergent must be used to identify the detergent additive package on its PTD and the LAC on the PTD must be consistent with the requirements in § 1090.260.


(f) *Gasoline additives language requirements.* In addition to any other PTD requirements of this subpart, on each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any gasoline additive that meets the requirements in § 1090.265(a), the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs that include the following information:


(1) The maximum allowed treatment rate of the additive so that the additive will contribute no more than 3 ppm sulfur to the finished gasoline.


(2) [Reserved]


(g) *Certified ethanol denaturant language requirements.* In addition to any other PTD requirements of this subpart, on each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any certified ethanol denaturant that meets the requirements in § 1090.275, the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs that include the following information:


(1) The following statement: “Certified Ethanol Denaturant suitable for use in the manufacture of denatured fuel ethanol meeting EPA standards.”


(2) The PTD must state that the sulfur content is 330 ppm or less. If the certified ethanol denaturant manufacturer represents a batch of denaturant as having a maximum sulfur content lower than 330 ppm, the PTD must instead state that lower sulfur maximum (*e.g.,* has a sulfur content of 120 ppm or less).


(h) *Butane and pentane language requirements.* (1) In addition to any other PTD requirements of this subpart, on each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any certified butane or certified pentane, the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs that include the following information:


(i) The certified butane or certified pentane producer company name and, for the certified pentane producer, the facility registration number issued by EPA.
