# § 1090.1225   Recordkeeping requirements for gasoline additives.

(a) *Gasoline additive manufacturers.* In addition to the requirements in § 1090.1205, a gasoline additive manufacturer must keep records of the following information for each batch of additive produced or imported:


(1) The batch volume.


(2) The date the batch was produced or imported.


(3) The PTD for the batch.


(4) The maximum recommended treatment rate.


(5) The gasoline additive manufacturer's control practices that demonstrate that the additive will contribute no more than 3 ppm on a per-gallon basis to the sulfur content of gasoline when used at the maximum recommended treatment rate.


(b) *Parties that take custody of gasoline additives.* Except for gasoline additives packaged for addition to gasoline in the vehicle fuel tank, all parties that take custody of gasoline additives for bulk addition to gasoline—from the producer through to the gasoline additive blender that adds the additive to gasoline—must keep records of the following information:


(1) The PTD for each batch of gasoline additive.


(2) The treatment rate at which the additive was added to gasoline, as applicable.


(3) The volume of gasoline that was treated with the additive, as applicable. A new record must be initiated in each case where a new batch of additive is mixed into a storage tank from which the additive is drawn to be injected into gasoline.
