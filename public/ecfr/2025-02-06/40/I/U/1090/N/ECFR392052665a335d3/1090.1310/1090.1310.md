# § 1090.1310   Testing to demonstrate compliance with standards.

(a) Perform testing as needed to certify fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock as specified in subpart K of this part. This section specifies additional test requirements.


(b) A fuel manufacturer, fuel additive manufacturer, or regulated blendstock producer must perform the following measurements before fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock from a given batch leaves the facility, except as specified in § 1090.1315:


(1) *Diesel fuel.* Perform testing for each batch of ULSD, 500 ppm LM diesel fuel, and ECA marine fuel to demonstrate compliance with sulfur standards.


(2) *Gasoline.* Perform testing for each batch of gasoline to demonstrate compliance with sulfur standards and perform testing for each batch of summer gasoline to demonstrate compliance with RVP standards.


(c) The following testing provisions apply for gasoline, oxygenate, certified ethanol denaturant, certified butane, and certified pentane:


(1) A gasoline manufacturer producing BOB for which oxygenate added downstream is accounted for under § 1090.710 must prepare a hand blend as specified in § 1090.1340 and perform the following measurements:


(i) Measure the sulfur content of both the BOB and the hand blend.


(ii) Except as specified in § 1090.1325(c), measure the benzene content of the hand blend.


(iii) For Summer CG, measure the RVP of the BOB.


(iv) For Summer RFG, measure the RVP of the hand blend.


(2) A gasoline manufacturer producing gasoline for which oxygenate added downstream is not accounted for under § 1090.710 (*e.g.,* E0 or so-called suboctane gasoline) must perform the following measurements:


(i) Measure the sulfur content of the gasoline.


(ii) Except as specified in § 1090.1325(c), measure the benzene content of the gasoline.


(iii) For Summer CG and Summer RFG, measure the RVP of the gasoline.


(iv) For Summer RFG that is designated as “Intended for Oxygenate Blending” under § 1090.1010(a)(4), create a hand blend as specified in § 1090.1340 and measure the RVP of the hand blend.


(v) For gasoline blended with oxygenate, measure the oxygenate content of the gasoline.


(3) An oxygenate producer must measure the sulfur content of each batch of oxygenate, except that a DFE producer may meet the alternative requirements in § 1090.1330.


(4) An ethanol denaturant producer that certifies denaturant under § 1090.1330 must measure the sulfur content of each batch of denaturant.


(5) A certified butane or certified pentane producer must perform sampling and testing to demonstrate compliance with purity specifications and sulfur and benzene standards as specified in § 1090.1320.


(6) A transmix processor producing gasoline from TGP must test each batch of gasoline for parameters required to demonstrate compliance with § 1090.505 as specified in § 1090.1325.


(d) A blending manufacturer producing gasoline by adding blendstock to PCG must comply with § 1090.1320.


(e) For gasoline produced at a fuel blending facility or a transmix processing facility, a gasoline manufacturer must measure such gasoline for oxygenate and for distillation parameters (*i.e.,* T10, T50, T90, final boiling point, and percent residue). However, a fuel manufacturer or transmix processor does not need to measure the oxygenate content of gasoline if PCG, transmix, TGP, and blendstocks used to produce the batch did not contain any oxygenates, based on the following documentation:


(1) For PCG, documentation consists of oxygenate content identified on PTDs.


(2) For transmix, TGP, and blendstocks, documentation consists of affidavits or oxygenate test results from the person providing the transmix or blendstock stating that these products do not contain oxygenate.
