# ยง 1090.1330   Preparing denatured fuel ethanol.

Instead of measuring every batch, a DFE producer or importer may calculate the sulfur content of a batch of DFE as follows:


(a) Determine the sulfur content of ethanol before adding denaturant by measuring it as specified in ยง 1090.1310 or by estimating it based on your production quality control procedures.


(b) Use the ppm sulfur content of certified ethanol denaturant specified on the PTD for the batch. If the sulfur content is specified as a range, use the maximum specified value.


(c) Calculate the weighted sulfur content of the DFE using the values determined under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
