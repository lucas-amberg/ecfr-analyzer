# § 1090.1355   Calculation adjustments and corrections.

Adjust measured values as follows:


(a) Adjust measured values for total vapor pressure as follows:


(b) For measuring the sulfur content and benzene content of gasoline, adjust a given test result upward in certain circumstances, as follows:


(1) If your measurement method involves a published procedure with a Pooled Limit of Quantitation (PLOQ), treat the PLOQ as your final result if your measured result is below the PLOQ.


(2) If your measurement method involves a published procedure with a limited scope but no PLOQ, treat the lower bound of the scope as your final result if your measured result is less than that value.


(3) If you establish a Laboratory Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) below the lower bound of the scope of the procedure as specified in ASTM D6259 (incorporated by reference in § 1090.95), treat the LLOQ as your final result if your measured result is less than the LLOQ. Note that this option is meaningful only if the LLOQ is less than a published PLOQ, or if there is no published PLOQ.


(c) For measuring the sulfur content of ULSD at a downstream location, subtract 2 ppm from the result.


(d) For measuring the benzene content of butane and pentane, report a zero value if the test result is at or below the PLOQ or Limit of Detection (LOD) that applies for the test method.


(e) If measured content of any oxygenate compound is less than 0.20 percent by mass, record the result as “None detected.”
