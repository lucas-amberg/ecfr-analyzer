# § 1502.16   Environmental consequences.

(a) The environmental consequences section forms the scientific and analytic basis for the comparisons under § 1502.14. It shall consolidate the discussions of those elements required by sections 102(2)(C)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of NEPA that are within the scope of the environmental impact statement and as much of section 102(2)(C)(iii) of NEPA as is necessary to support the comparisons. The comparison of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives shall be based on the discussion of their reasonably foreseeable effects and the significance of those effects (§ 1501.3 of this subchapter), focusing on the significant or important effects. The no action alternative should serve as the baseline against which the proposed action and other alternatives are compared. This section should not duplicate discussions required by § 1502.14 and shall include an analysis of:


(1) Any adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented.


(2) The effects of the no action alternative, including any adverse environmental effects;


(3) The relationship between short-term uses of the human environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity;


(4) Any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of Federal resources that would be involved in the proposal should it be implemented;


(5) Where applicable, possible conflicts between the proposed action and the objectives of Federal, regional, State, Tribal, and local plans, policies, and controls for the area concerned, including those addressing climate change (§ 1506.2(d) of this subchapter);


(6) Where applicable, climate change-related effects, including, where feasible, quantification of greenhouse gas emissions, from the proposed action and alternatives and the effects of climate change on the proposed action and alternatives;


(7) Where applicable, energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures;


(8) Where applicable, natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures;


(9) Where applicable, relevant risk reduction, resiliency, or adaptation measures incorporated into the proposed action or alternatives, informed by relevant science and data on the affected environment and expected future conditions;


(10) Where applicable, urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the design of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures;


(11) Means to mitigate adverse environmental effects (if not fully covered under § 1502.14(e));


(12) Where applicable, economic and technical considerations, including the economic benefits of the proposed action; and


(13) Where applicable, disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects on communities with environmental justice concerns.


(b) Economic or social effects by themselves do not require preparation of an environmental impact statement. However, when the agency determines that economic or social and natural or physical environmental effects are interrelated, the environmental impact statement shall discuss these effects on the human environment.
