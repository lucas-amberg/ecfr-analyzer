# ยง 1700.35   Submarine bilgewater.

The discharge of submarine bilgewater:


(a) Must not contain oil in quantities that:


(1) Cause a film or sheen upon or discoloration of the surface of the water or adjoining shorelines; or


(2) Cause a sludge or emulsion to be deposited beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shorelines; or


(3) Contain an oil content above 15 parts per million (ppm) as measured by EPA Method 1664a (as defined at 40 CFR 136.3) or other appropriate method for determination of oil content as accepted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) (*e.g.,* ISO Method 9377) or U.S. Coast Guard; or


(4) Otherwise are harmful to the public health or welfare of the United States.


(b) Must not contain dispersants, detergents, emulsifiers, chemicals, or other substances added for the purposes of removing the appearance of a visible sheen. This performance standard does not prohibit the use of these materials in machinery spaces for the purposes of cleaning and maintenance activities associated with vessel equipment and structures.


(c) Must only contain substances that are produced in the normal operation of a vessel. Oil solidifiers, flocculants or other additives (excluding any dispersants or surfactants) may be used to enhance oil-water separation during processing in an oil-water separator only if such solidifiers, flocculants, or other additives are minimized in the discharge and do not alter the chemical makeup of the oils being discharged. Solidifiers, flocculants, or other additives must not be directly added, or otherwise combined with, the water in the bilge. Additionally, the vessel must employ management practices that will minimize the leakage of oil and other harmful pollutants into the bilge.


(d) Must not occur in port if the port has the capability to collect and transfer the submarine bilgewater to an onshore facility.


(e) Must be minimized and, if technologically feasible, discharged as far from shore as possible.


(f) Must be minimized in federally-protected waters.
