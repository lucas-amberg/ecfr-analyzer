(3) Each employee who enters a high radiation area. 


(c) As used in this subpart: 


(1) “Personnel monitoring equipment” means devices designed to be worn or carried by an individual for the purpose of measuring the dose received (e.g., film badges, pocket chambers, pocket dosimeters, film rings, etc.); 


(2) “Radiation area” means any area, accessible to personnel, in which there exists radiation at such levels that a major portion of the body could receive in any one hour a dose in excess of 5 millirem, or in any 5 consecutive days a dose in excess of 100 millirem; and 


(3) “High radiation area” means any area, accessible to personnel, in which there exists radiation at such levels that a major portion of the body could receive in any one hour a dose in excess of 100 millirem.
