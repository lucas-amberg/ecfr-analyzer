(a) The Division of Public Contracts returns to the interpretation contained in Rulings and Interpretations No. 2 
1 with respect to coverage under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of truck drivers employed by oil dealers, by amending section 40(e)(1) of Rulings and Interpretations No. 3 
1 to read as follows: 


(1) Where the contractor is a dealer, the act applies to employees at the central distributing plant, including warehousemen, compounders, and chemists testing the lot out of which the Government order is filled, the crews engaged in loading the materials in vessels, tank cars or tank wagons for shipment, and truck drivers engaged in the activities described in section 37(m) above.

(Bulk stations as the term is used herein are intermediate points of storage between a central distributing plant and service stations.)
