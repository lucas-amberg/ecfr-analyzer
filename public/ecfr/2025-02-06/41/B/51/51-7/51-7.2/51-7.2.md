# ยง 51-7.2   Early involvement in private, State, and local activities requiring Federal approval.

(a) 40 CFR 1501.2(d) requires agencies to provide for early involvement in actions which, while planned by private applicants or other non-Federal entities, require some sort of Federal approval. Pursuant to the JWOD Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c), the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled makes the determination as to which qualified nonprofit agency serving persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities will furnish designated products and services to the Government.


(b) To implement the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.2(d) with respect to these actions, the Committee staff shall consult as required with other appropriate parties to initiate and coordinate the necessary environmental analysis. The Executive Director shall determine on the basis of information submitted by private agencies and other non-Federal entities or generated by the Committee whether the proposed action is one that normally does not require an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement (EIS) as set forth in ยง 51-7.4, or is one that requires an environmental assessment as set forth in 40 CFR 1501.4.


(c) To facilitate compliance with these requirements, private agencies and other non-Federal entities are expected to:


(1) Contact the Committee staff as early as possible in the planning process for guidance on the scope and level of environmental information required to be submitted in support of their request;


(2) Conduct any studies which are deemed necessary and appropriate by the Committee to determine the impact of the proposed action on the human environment;


(3) Consult with appropriate Federal, regional, State and local agencies and other potentially interested parties during preliminary planning stages to ensure that all environmental factors are identified;


(4) Submit applications for all Federal, regional, State and local approvals as early as possible in the planning process;


(5) Notify the Committee as early as possible of all other Federal, regional, State, local and Indian tribe actions required for project completion so that the Committee may coordinate all Federal environmental reviews; and 


(6) Notify the Committee of all known parties potentially affected by or interested in the proposed action.
