# ยง 51-8.3   Requirements for Making Requests.

(a) *General Information.* (1) The Committee has designated a FOIA office to process and respond to all FOIA requests. All Committee departments have the capability to receive requests electronically either through email or a web portal. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the FOIA office. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the FOIA office.


(2) A requester may submit a request for records to the Executive Director at the Committee's offices, 1401 S Clark Street, Suite 715, Arlington, Virginia 22202-3259, or via email to *FOIA@abilityone.gov,* or via facsimile to (703) 603-0655. The request must be in writing and should indicate that it is being made under the FOIA. Failure to submit a request in accordance with these procedures may delay the processing of the request.


(3) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in part 51-9.


(4) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual has deceased (*e.g.,* a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Committee can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.


(b) *Description of records sought.* Requesters must describe records sought in sufficient detail to enable Committee personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the FOIA office or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request the FOIA office determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA office shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the FOIA office or FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.


(c) If the Committee determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records, it shall inform the requester of this fact and extend to the requester an opportunity to clarify the request or to confer promptly with knowledgeable Committee personnel to attempt to identify the records being sought or to reformulate a request. The Committee may offer assistance in identifying records and reformulating a request where: The description is deemed insufficient, the production of voluminous records is required, or a considerable number of work hours would be required to complete the request that would interfere with the business of the Committee.
