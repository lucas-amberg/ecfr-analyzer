# ยง 60-1.31   Reinstatement of ineligible contractors.

A contractor debarred from further contracts for an indefinite period under the Order may request reinstatement in a letter filed with the Director at any time after the effective date of the debarment. A contractor debarred for a fixed period may request reinstatement in a letter filed with the Director 30 days prior to the expiration of the fixed debarment period, or at any time thereafter. The filing of a reinstatement request 30 days before a fixed debarment period ends will not result in early reinstatement. In connection with the reinstatement proceedings, all debarred contractors shall be required to show that they have established and will carry out employment policies and practices in compliance with the Order and implementing regulations. Before reaching a decision, the Director may conduct a compliance evaluation of the contractor and may require the contractor to supply additional information regarding the request for reinstatement. The Director shall issue a written decision on the request.
