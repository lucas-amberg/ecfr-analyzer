# § 60-300.1   Purpose, applicability and construction.

(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of the regulations in this part is to set forth the standards for compliance with the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, 38 U.S.C. 4212, (VEVRAA), which prohibits discrimination against protected veterans and pre-JVA veterans as defined in this part, and requires Government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified protected veterans.


Disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, active duty wartime or campaign badge veterans, and Armed Forces service medal veterans are protected veterans under VEVRAA.


(b) *Applicability.* This part applies to any Government contract or subcontract of $100,000 or more, entered into or modified on or after December 1, 2003, for the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services (including construction): Provided, that subpart C of this part applies only as described in § 60-300.40(a); and that the non-discrimination protections in § 60-300.21 and the right to file complaints alleging discriminatory conduct set forth in § 60-300.61 also apply to “pre-JVA veterans” as defined in § 60-300.2, who are applicants or employees of a contractor with a Government contract of $25,000 or more entered into prior to December 1, 2003, and unmodified since to a contract amount of $100,000. Compliance by the contractor with the provisions of this part will not necessarily determine its compliance with other statutes, and compliance with other statutes will not necessarily determine its compliance with this part.


(c) *Construction*—(1) *In general.* The Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. 12101, *et seq.*) set out as an appendix to 29 CFR part 1630 issued pursuant to Title I may be relied upon for guidance in interpreting the parallel provisions of this part.


(2) *Relationship to other laws.* This part does not invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures under any Federal law or the law of any state or political subdivision that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, active duty wartime or campaign badge veterans, or Armed Forces service medal protected veterans as compared to the protection afforded by this part. It may be a defense to a charge of violation of this part that a challenged action is required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation, or that another Federal law or regulation prohibits an action (including the provision of a particular reasonable accommodation) that would otherwise be required by this part.


(i) *Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.* This part does not invalidate or limit the obligations, responsibilities, and requirements of the contractor pursuant to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (38 U.S.C. 4301, *et seq.*). This includes the obligation under USERRA to reemploy employees of the contractor following qualifying service in the uniformed services in the position the employee would have obtained with reasonable certainty had the employee been continuously employed during the period of uniformed service. Compliance by the contractor with the provisions of this part will not necessarily determine its compliance with USERRA, and compliance with USERRA will not necessarily determine its compliance with this part.


(ii) [Reserved]
