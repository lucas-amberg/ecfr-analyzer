# ยง 101-5.303   Guiding principles.

The following principles will control the scope of the health services to be provided in keeping with the objective:


(a) Employees who work in groups of 300 or more, counting employees of all departments or agencies who are scheduled to be on duty at one time in the same building or group of buildings in the same locality will constitute the minimum number of employees required to warrant the establishment of a health service of a scope specified in ยง 101-5.304.


(b) As an exception to paragraph (a) of this section, health services of the scope specified in ยง 101-5.304 may be provided for employees who work in groups of less than 300 where the employing department or agency determines that working conditions involving unusual health risks warrant such provision.


(c) Treatment and medical care in performance-of-duty cases will be provided to employees as set forth in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 751 *et seq.*).


(d) Reimbursable costs for providing health services will be based on an operating budget which is a summary of all costs required to operate the health service. The reimbursement cost is prorated to participating agencies by means of a per capital formula computed by dividing the operating budget of the health service by the total number of employees sponsored for service. The size of the Federal population served, the compensation of the employees of the health unit, and other factors of medical economics prevalent in the area are factors which affect the local reimbursement cost. Further, in appropriate cases where more than one health unit is servicing employees housed in the same general locality, costs may be equalized by combining the operating budgets of all such units and dividing the total of the operating budgets by the number of employees sponsored. Special industrial conditions or other abnormal health or accident risk environments may increase the per capita cost.
