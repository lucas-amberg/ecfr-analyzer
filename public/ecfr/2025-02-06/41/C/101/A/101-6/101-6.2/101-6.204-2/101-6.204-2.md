# § 101-6.204-2   Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.

(a)(1) In connection with any program to which this subpart applies, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:


(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;


(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;


(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;


(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;


(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;


(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise, or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (d) of this § 101-6.204-2).


(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.


(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this subpart.


(4) This subpart does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the ground of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this subpart applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.


(b) As used in this § 101-6.204-2 the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.


(c) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this § 101-6.204-2 does not limit the generality of the pro hibition in § 101-6.204-1.


(d)(1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this subpart applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including, but not limited to, recruitment or recruitment advertising; employment; layoff or termination; upgrading, demotion, or transfer; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; selection for training, including apprenticeship; and use of facilities). The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or the corresponding provisions of any Executive order which supersedes it.


(2) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this subpart tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this subpart, to the extent necessary to insure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.
