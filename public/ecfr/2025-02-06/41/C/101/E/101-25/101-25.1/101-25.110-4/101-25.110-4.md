# ยง 101-25.110-4   Recordkeeping responsibilities.

The effectiveness of the tire identification and recordkeeping regulations depends on the active support and cooperation of all agencies to ensure that tires subject to a recall program are not to continue in service thereby endangering the lives of the occupants of the vehicle. Therefore, agencies should establish procedures for promptly identifying and locating all tires whether in storage or on vehicles so that advice from GSA, the tire manufacturer, or the vehicle manufacturer may be acted upon expeditiously.
