# ยง 101-26.105   Justification to support negotiated procurement by GSA for other agencies.

When a requisition submitted by an agency to GSA requires procurement without providing for full and open competition, the agency submitting the requisition will be so notified and required to furnish specific information to assist GSA in preparing the required written justification. The GSA contracting officer will defer procurement action pending receipt of the requested information. If the requisitioning agency has prior knowledge that a requisition will require procurement without providing for full and open competition (e.g., sole source acquisition), sufficient information shall be included with the requisition to allow GSA to justify the procurement. Specifically, the information must include the following:


(a) The specific needs to be satisfied in terms of identified tasks or work processes;


(b) The requirements that generate the specific needs;


(c) The characteristics of the designated item that enable it to satisfy the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;


(d) The identification of other items evaluated and, for each, a statement of the characteristics (or lack thereof) which preclude their satisfying the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;


(e) The citation of the applicable law, if any, authorizing other than full and open competition (see FAR 6.302 (48 CFR 6.302); and


(f) Any required certifications, pursuant to FAR 6.303-2(b) (48 CFR 6.303-2(b)), that supporting data is complete and accurate.
