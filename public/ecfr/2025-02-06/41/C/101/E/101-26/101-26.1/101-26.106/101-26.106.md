# ยง 101-26.106   Consolidation of requirements.

Full consideration shall be given to the consolidation of individual small volume requirements to enable the Government to benefit from lower prices normally obtainable through definite quantity contracts for larger volume procurements. This policy pertains to procurement from commercial sources either directly or through an intermediary agency and does not apply to GSA stock items or small volume requirements normally obtained from GSA customer supply centers. When it is practical, each agency shall establish procedures that will permit planned requirements consolidation on an agencywide basis. When it is impractical to plan requirements on an agencywide consolidated basis, the requirements consolidation effort may be limited to a bureau, to other agency segments, or to a program, if such limited consolidation will provide significant price advantages when procurement is effected on a volume basis. Requisitions for item requirements exceeding maximum order limitations in Federal Supply Schedule contracts shall be submitted to GSA in accordance with the applicable instructions in the respective schedules. Special buying services desired by agencies for procurement of other consolidated item requirements shall be requested from GSA in accordance with ยง 101-26.102.
