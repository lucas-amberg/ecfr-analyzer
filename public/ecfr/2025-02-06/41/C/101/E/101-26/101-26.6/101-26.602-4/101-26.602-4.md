(c) Contractual information covering these requirements will be furnished each participating agency by the Defense Fuel Supply Center after contracts are awarded. As shipments of coal are required, each activity shall direct the contractor to make delivery. Payment for deliveries shall be arranged for by the ordering activity directly with the contractor. Should estimated requirements not be needed due to changes or conversions in heating equipment or other reasons, activities shall notify the Defense Fuel Supply Center of such changes as soon as possible.
