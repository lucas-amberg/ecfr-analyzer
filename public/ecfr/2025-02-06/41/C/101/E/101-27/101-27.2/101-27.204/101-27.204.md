Type I items have a definite storage life after which the item or material is considered to be no longer usable for its primary function and should be discarded. Type II items are those for which successive reinspection dates can be established when the items have a continued usability as determined by examination based upon criteria that have been agreed upon. Examples of Type I items are drugs and medicines with certain characteristics. Examples of Type II items are paint and ink.
