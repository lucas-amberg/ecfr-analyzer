(b) Code designator 0 is used to identify items not included in a shelf-life program.


(c) Code designator X shall be used to identify critical end-use items, military essential items, and medical items with a shelf life greater than 60 months. Agencies shall establish controls for such materials to prevent issuance of any unserviceable items.
