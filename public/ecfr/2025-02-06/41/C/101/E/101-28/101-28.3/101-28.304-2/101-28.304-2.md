# ยง 101-28.304-2   Determining items to be stocked.

(a) Each CSC will stock administrative items normally required by Federal agencies for day-to-day operations. In addition to those items, each CSC will stock additional items as determined by the requirements of the activities within the geographic area it serves.


(b) Regional FSS offices will canvass customer agencies periodically to identify items for which there is an official need within their support area.


(c) Customer agencies may request that specific items be stocked by their support CSC. The requests must be submitted in writing to the appropriate-FSS Bureau Director and must be signed by a customer agency official at a level of responsibility (division director or higher) acceptable to the GSA Regional Administrator. All requests must indicate the expected monthly usage of the item requested. Each request will be evaluated and the submitting activity notified of the results of the evaluation.
