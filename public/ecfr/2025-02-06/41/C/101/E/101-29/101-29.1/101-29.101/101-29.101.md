# § 101-29.101   Federal product descriptions.

Federal and interim Federal specifications, their associated Federal qualified products lists (QPL's), Federal and interim Federal standards and Commercial item descriptions (CID's) are referred to collectively as Federal product descriptions. They are developed by GSA or other Federal agencies under the Assigned Agency Plan described in the “Federal Standardization Handbook” issued by the Assistant Administrator for Federal Supply and Services (FSS). Product descriptions are coordinated with other Federal agencies having technical, statutory, or regulatory interest in the commodity or other subject matter covered. Generally, before they are issued, Federal product descriptions are reviewed by technical societies, individual industrial producers, and organizations representing industrial producers and consumers.
