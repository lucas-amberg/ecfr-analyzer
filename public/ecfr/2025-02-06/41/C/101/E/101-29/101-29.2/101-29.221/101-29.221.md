# ยง 101-29.221   Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Description Program (Federal Standardization Program).

The *Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Description Program* is a standardization program developed under authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 377) in consonance with the Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act (Sections 2451-2456, title 10, U.S.C. chapter 145), managed by the General Services Administration, for the purpose of coordinating civilian and military standardization functions to avoid unnecessary duplication. Within the program, procedures and controls govern the development, coordination, approval, issuance, indexing, management, and maintenance of product descriptions in the Federal series (Federal specifications, Federal standards, and CID's) that define commercial products and products that have high potential for common Federal agency use.
