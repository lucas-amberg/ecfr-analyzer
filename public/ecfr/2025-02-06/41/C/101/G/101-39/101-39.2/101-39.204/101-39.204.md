# ยง 101-39.204   Obtaining motor vehicles for indefinite assignment.

Motor vehicles and related services of the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) are provided to requesting agencies under the following procedures. When competing requests are received, priority will be given to a fully participating agency over an other than fully participating agency.


(a) Federal agencies or parts thereof that meet the following conditions are considered fully participating:


(1) All agency-owned motor vehicles have been consolidated into the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center, and no agency-owned vehicles, with the exception of approved exemptions, are operated in the defined mandatory use service area of the supporting GSA fleet management center;


(2) No vehicles were available to consolidate, but total reliance is placed on the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center or the GSA IFMS as a whole to meet all motor vehicle requirements, and no agency-owned vehicles are operated in the defined mandatory use service area of the supporting GSA fleet management center;


(3) The agency would otherwise qualify under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section but has been authorized by GSA to purchase or commercially lease motor vehicles because the GSA IFMS was unable to supply its requirements.


(b) Fully participating agencies may request indefinite assignment of vehicles, regardless of number, from the supporting IFMS fleet management center. Assignment may be made at that level, subject to availability. If the required vehicles are not available, a written request shall be sent to the General Services Administration, Attn: FBF, Washington, DC, 20406. To be considered, the request shall include the following:


(1) Certification that concurrence has been obtained from the designated agency fleet manager or other designated headquarters-level official and that other means of transportation are not feasible or cost-effective;


(2) The number and types of vehicles required, of which passenger vehicles are limited to compact or smaller unless the agency head or designee has certified that larger vehicles are essential to the agency's mission;


(3) Location where the vehicles are needed;


(4) Date required, including earliest and latest acceptable dates;


(5) Anticipated length of assignment;


(6) Projected utilization, normally in terms of miles per month or year;


(7) Certification of funding;


(8) Billing address and billed office address code (BOAC);


(9) Agency contact, including name, address, and telephone number;


(10) Office, program, or activity requiring the vehicles;


(11) A statement that the agency does or does not request authority to commercially lease, and the anticipated duration of the lease, should GSA be unable to provide the vehicles.


(c) Federal agencies that meet the following conditions are considered other than fully participating:


(1) Vehicles have been acquired from other sources for reasons other than the inability of the GSA IFMS to supply the required vehicles, except those designated as exempt vehicles as determined by the GSA IFMS;


(2) Cost reimbursable contractors authorized to utilize GSA IFMS motor vehicles when they represent participating agencies;


(3) Other authorized users of the GSA IFMS.


(d) Other than fully participating agencies must contact the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center to ascertain vehicle availability, regardless of the number required. If the vehicles are available, assignment shall be made. When the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center determines that the requested vehicles are not available, the requesting activity shall make a record of contact to document compliance with the mandatory first source of supply requirement. No further authorizations from GSA are required for the agency to execute a commercial lease from sources established by the GSA Automotive Commodity Center or the agency, provided that such agency has Congressional authority to lease motor vehicles and:


(1) All applicable procurement regulations (e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)) and internal agency acquisition regulations are observed;


(2) The requirements of part 101-38 of this chapter regarding fuel economy, Government identification and marking, etc., are adhered to;


(3) The agency fleet manager or designee retains responsibility for fleet oversight and reporting requirements under Public Law 99-272; and


(4) Other than fully participating agencies that choose not to commercially lease may utilize the procedures for full participants in paragraph (b) of this section, on the understanding that fully participating agencies will receive priority consideration.
