# ยง 101-39.208   Vehicles removed from defined areas.

(a) Normally, vehicles shall not be permanently operated outside the geographical area served by the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center. However, when agency programs necessitate vehicle relocation for a period exceeding 90 calendar days, the agency shall notify the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center of the following:


(1) The location at which the vehicles are currently in use;


(2) The date the vehicles were moved to the present location; and


(3) The expected date the vehicles will be returned to the original location.


(b) When vehicles will be permanently relocated outside the area served by the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center, the affected GSA IFMS fleet manager will ascertain if the using agency is fully participating at the new location (see ยง 101-39.204). If this criterion is met, the vehicle will normally be transferred to the GSA IFMS fleet management center nearest the new location. If the agency is other than a full participant, the transfer will be treated as a request for additional vehicles at the new location.
