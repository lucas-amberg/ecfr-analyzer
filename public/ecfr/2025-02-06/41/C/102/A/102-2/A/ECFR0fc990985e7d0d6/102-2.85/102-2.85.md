# ยง 102-2.85   What are the reasons for writing to GSA about FMR deviations?

The reasons for writing are to:


(a) Explain your agency's rationale for the deviation. Before it can adequately comment on a potential deviation from the FMR, GSA must know why it is needed. GSA will compare your need against the applicable policies and regulations.


(b) Obtain clarification from GSA as to whether statutes, Executive orders, or other controlling policies, which may not be evident in the regulation, preclude deviating from the FMR for the reasons stated.


(c) Establish a timeframe for using a deviation.


(d) Identify potential changes to the FMR.


(e) Identify the benefits and other results that the agency expects to achieve.
