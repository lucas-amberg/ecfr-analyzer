# ยง 102-2.120   How do I know whom to contact to discuss the regulatory requirements of programs addressed in the FMR?

Periodically, GSA will issue for your reference an FMR bulletin that lists program contacts with whom agencies can discuss regulatory requirements. At a minimum, the list will contain organization names and telephone numbers for each program addressed in the FMR.
