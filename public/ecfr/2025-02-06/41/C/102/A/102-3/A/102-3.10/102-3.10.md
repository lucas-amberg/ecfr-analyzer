# ยง 102-3.10   What is the purpose of the Federal Advisory Committee Act?

FACA governs the establishment, operation, administration, and termination of advisory committees within the executive branch of the Federal Government. The Act defines what constitutes a Federal advisory committee and provides general procedures for the executive branch to follow for the operation of these advisory committees. In addition, the Act is designed to assure that the Congress and the public are kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, recommendations, outcomes, and cost of advisory committees through reporting requirements. These requirements form the basis for implementing the Act at both the agency and Government-wide levels.
