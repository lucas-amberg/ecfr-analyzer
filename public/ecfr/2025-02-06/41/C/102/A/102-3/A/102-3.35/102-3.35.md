# ยง 102-3.35   What policies govern the use of subcommittees?

(a) In general, the requirements of the Act and the policies of this part do not apply to subcommittees of advisory committees that report to a parent advisory committee and not directly to a Federal officer or agency. However, this section does not preclude an agency from applying any provision of the Act and this part to any subcommittee of an advisory committee.


(b) If a subcommittee reports directly to a Federal officer or agency, it is no longer functioning as a subcommittee. In that case, the subcommittee must be chartered as a new advisory committee, must comply with all of the requirements of this part, and will be counted as a chartered advisory committee at an agency.


(c) Unless required by statute or Presidential directive, the creation and operation of subcommittees must be approved by the agency establishing the parent advisory committee in coordination with the DFO.
