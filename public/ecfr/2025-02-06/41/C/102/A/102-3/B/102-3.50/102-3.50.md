FACA identifies four sources of authority for establishing an advisory committee:


(a) *Required by statute.* By law where Congress establishes an advisory committee, or specifically directs the President or an agency to establish it (non-discretionary);


(b) *Presidential authority.* By E.O. of the President or other Presidential directive (non-discretionary);


(c) *Authorized by statute.* By law where Congress authorizes, but does not direct the President or an agency to establish it (discretionary); or


(d) *Agency authority.* By an agency under general authority in title 5 of the United States Code or under other agency-authorizing statutes (discretionary).
