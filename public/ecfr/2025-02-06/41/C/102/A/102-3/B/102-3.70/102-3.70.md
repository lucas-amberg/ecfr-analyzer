No advisory committee may meet or take any action until a charter has been filed by the CMO or by another agency official designated by the agency head.


(a) *Requirement for discretionary advisory committees.* To amend a charter, or establish (including due to a merger), renew, or reestablish a discretionary advisory committee, a charter must be filed with:


(1) The agency head;


(2) The standing committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction of the agency, the date of filing with which constitutes the official date of establishment for the advisory committee;


(3) The Library of Congress; and


(4) The Secretariat, indicating the date the charter was filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(b) *Requirement for non-discretionary advisory committees.* Charter filing requirements for non-discretionary advisory committees are the same as those in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the date of establishment, renewal, or reestablishment for a Presidential advisory committee is the date the charter is filed with the Secretariat.


(c) *Requirement for subcommittees that report directly to the Government.* Subcommittees that report directly to a Federal officer or agency must comply with this subpart and be chartered as a new advisory committee as they are no longer functioning as a subcommittee.
