# ยง 102-3.125   What is required to be included in an agency's administrative guidelines to implement an advisory committee?

An agency's administrative guidelines provide the details that advisory committee staff need to implement FACA requirements during the creation, operation, and termination of their advisory committees.


(a) *Advisory committee bylaws.* Advisory committee bylaws should be developed by the agency, with advisory committee input and buy-in. Agency guidelines should specify the content of bylaws and ensure that they provide clear operating procedures for advisory committee meetings, other committee activities, and the relationship between committee members, the DFO, and agency staff.


(b) *Advisory committee costs.* Agency guidelines must:


(1) Provide instructions on how to identify, calculate, and fully document advisory committee costs; and


(2) Ensure agency committee cost records match the data reported to Congress and the public through the FACA database.
