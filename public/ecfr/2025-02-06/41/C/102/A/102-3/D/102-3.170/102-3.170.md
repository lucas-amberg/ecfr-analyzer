# ยง 102-3.170   How does an interested party obtain access to advisory committee records?

Timely access to advisory committee records is an important element of the public access requirements of the Act. Section 10(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1009(b)) provides for the contemporaneous availability of advisory committee records that, when taken in conjunction with the ability to attend committee meetings, provide a meaningful opportunity to comprehend fully the work undertaken by the advisory committee. Although certain advisory committee records may be withheld under an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), agencies may not require members of the public or other interested parties to use FOIA procedures in order to obtain records available under sec. 10(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1009(b)).
