# ยง 102-3.185   What does this subpart require agencies to do?

(a) *Section 15 requirements.* An agency may not use any advice or recommendation provided to an agency by NAS or NAPA under an agreement between the agency and an academy, if such advice or recommendation was developed by use of a committee created by either academy, unless:


(1) The committee was not subject to any actual management or control by an agency or officer of the Federal Government; and


(2) In the case of NAS, the academy certifies that it has complied substantially with the requirements of sec. 15(b) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014(b)); or


(3) In the case of NAPA, the academy certifies that it has complied substantially with the requirements of sec. 15(b) (1), (2), and (5) of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014(b)(1), (2), and (5), respectively).


(b) *No agency management or control.* Agencies must not manage or control the specific procedures adopted by each academy to comply with the requirements of sec. 15 of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014) that are applicable to that academy. In addition, however, any committee created and used by an academy in the development of any advice or recommendation to be provided by the academy to an agency must be subject to both actual management and control by that academy and not by the agency.


(c) *Funding agreements.* Agencies may enter into contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with NAS or NAPA that are consistent with the requirements of this subpart to obtain advice or recommendations from such academy. These funding agreements require, and agencies may rely upon, a written certification by an authorized representative of the academy provided to the agency upon delivery to the agency of each report containing advice or recommendations required under the agreement that:


(1) The academy has adopted policies and procedures that comply with the applicable requirements of sec. 15 of the Act (codified at 5 U.S.C. 1014); and


(2) To the best of the authorized representative's knowledge and belief, these policies and procedures substantially have been complied with in performing the work required under the agreement.
