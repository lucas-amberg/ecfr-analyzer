# § 102-33.115   Are there requirements for acquiring military Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP)?

Yes, when you acquire military Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP), you must—


(a) Accept FSCAP only when it is documented or traceable to its original equipment manufacturer. A part's DOD FSCAP Criticality Code should be marked or tagged on the part or appear on its invoice/transfer document (see § 102-33.375 for further explanation of the FSCAP Criticality Codes); and


(b) Not install undocumented, but traceable FSCAP until you have the parts inspected and recertified by the original equipment manufacturer or other FAA-approved facility (see § 102-33.370 on FSCAP and AC 20-142).
