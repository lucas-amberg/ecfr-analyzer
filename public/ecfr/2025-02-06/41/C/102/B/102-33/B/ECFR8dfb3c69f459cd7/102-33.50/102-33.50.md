(iii) No commercial or other Governmental source is available to provide aviation services safely (*i.e.,* in compliance with applicable safety standards and regulations) and cost-effectively; and


(iv) Congress has specifically authorized your agency to purchase, lease, or transfer aircraft and to maintain and operate those aircraft (see 31 U.S.C. 1343);


(2) Acquire Commercial Aviation Services (CAS) when—


(i) Aircraft are the optimum means of supporting your agency's official business; and


(ii) Using commercial aircraft and services is safe (*i.e.,* conforms to applicable laws, safety standards, and regulations) and is more cost effective than using Federal aircraft, aircraft from any other Governmental source, or scheduled air carriers.
