# § 102-33.190   What are the aircraft operations and ownership costs for which we must account?

You must account for the operations and ownership costs of your Government aircraft, including your Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), as described in the “U.S. Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide” (CAG), available at (*http://www.gsa.gov/aviationpolicy*), which follows OMB Circular A-126 (*http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb*).

(b) Justify the use of Government aircraft in lieu of commercially available aircraft, and the use of one Government aircraft in lieu of another;


(c) Develop a variable cost rate for each aircraft or aircraft type (*i.e.,* make and model) in your inventory;


(d) Recover the costs of operating Government aircraft;


(e) Determine the cost effectiveness of various aspects of agency aircraft programs; and


(f) Accumulate aircraft program costs following the procedures defined in the CAG, available at (*http://www.gsa.gov/aviationpolicy*).
