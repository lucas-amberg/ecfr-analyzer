# ยง 102-33.145   Why must we establish Flight Program Standards?

You must establish Flight Program Standards because Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) may not cover or address all aspects of your agency's flight program, such as non-certificated aircraft, high-risk operations, special personnel requirements, etc.
