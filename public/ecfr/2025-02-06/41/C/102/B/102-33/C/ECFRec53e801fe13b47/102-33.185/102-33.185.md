# § 102-33.185   What standards must we establish or require (contractually, where applicable) for responding to aircraft accidents and incidents?

You must establish or require (contractually, where applicable) the following standards for responding to aircraft accidents and incidents:


(a) An aircraft accident/incident reporting policy to ensure that you will comply with the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) regulations (located in 49 CFR parts 830 and 831), including notifying NTSB immediately when you have an aircraft accident or an incident as defined in 49 CFR 830.5. In addition, this policy must contain a method of notifying the U.S. General Services Administration of an accident or incident that was reported to the NTSB. Refer to §§ 102-33.445 and 102-33.450 for further information;


(b) An agency, bureau, or field level accident/incident response plan, modeled on the NTSB's “Federal Plan for Aviation Accidents Involving Aircraft Operated by or Chartered by Federal Agencies,” and periodic disaster response exercises to test your plan. A copy of the NTSB's plan is available at *http://www.ntsb.gov.* The plan should also refer to or incorporate procedures (as outlined in FAA Advisory Circular 120-92) to identify the potential for accidents or incidents;


(c) Procedures (see 49 CFR 831.11) for participation as a party to NTSB accident or incident investigations involving aircraft that your agency either owns or hires, and for conducting parallel investigations, as appropriate;


(d) Training in investigating accidents/incidents for your agency's personnel who may be asked to participate in NTSB investigations or to conduct a parallel investigation; and


(e) Procedures for disseminating, in the event of an aviation disaster that involves one of your Government aircraft, information about eligibility for benefits contained in the disclosure statement in appendix A of this part to anyone injured, to the injured or deceased persons' points of contact (listed on the manifest), and to the families of injured or deceased crewmembers and qualified non-crewmembers.
