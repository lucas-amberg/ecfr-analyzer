If aircraft parts are excess to your needs, you must:


(a) Reassign the aircraft parts within your agency if any of your sub-agencies can use the parts; or


(b) Report the excess parts to GSA, using Standard Form (SF) 120, “Report of Excess Personal Property” (see § 102-2.135 for information to obtain this form). When reporting excess FSCAP, you must include the manufacturer's name, date of manufacture, part number, serial number, and the appropriate Criticality Code on the SF 120.
