# ยง 102-33.340   What are GSA's responsibilities in disposing of excess and surplus aircraft parts?

In disposing of excess aircraft parts, the GSA FAS office in your region:


(a) Reviews your SF 120, Report of Excess Personal Property (see ยง 102-2.135 for information to obtain this form) for completeness and accuracy (of status, condition, and FSCAP and demilitarization codes if applicable); and


(b) Ensures that the following certification is included on disposal documents (*e.g.,* transfer orders or purchasers' receipts):


Because of the critical nature of the failure of aircraft parts and the resulting potential safety threat, recipients of aircraft parts must ensure that any parts installed on an aircraft meet applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements and must obtain required certifications. GSA makes no representation as to a part's conformance with the FAA requirements.
