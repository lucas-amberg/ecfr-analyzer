# ยง 102-33.310   May we report as excess, or replace, unsalvageable aircraft parts?

No, you may not report unsalvageable aircraft parts as excess or exchange/sale them for replacements. You must mutilate unsalvageable parts. You may sell the mutilated parts only as scrap or report that scrap to GSA for sale.
