To declassify a Federal aircraft, you must—


(a) Send a letter to the Deputy Associate Administrator, Office of Asset and Transportation Management, Office of Government-wide Policy, General Services Administration, 1800 F St. NW., Washington, DC 20405, that requests approval to declassify the aircraft and states that the aircraft is non-operational (which includes lost or destroyed). In this letter you must—


(1) Identify the Federal Supply Classification (FSC) group(s) that the declassified aircraft/parts will fall under, if applicable;


(2) Describe the condition of the aircraft (crash-damaged, unrecoverable, parts unavailable, etc.); and


(3) Include photographs as appropriate.


(b) Within 14 calendar days of receiving GSA's approval to declassify the aircraft, following 14 CFR 45.13, request approval from your local FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) to remove the manufacturer's data plate;


(c) Within 14 calendar days of receiving approval from FAA to remove the data plate, inform GSA of FAA's approval, send the data plate by courier or registered mail to the FAA, as directed by your FSDO, and remove the certificate of airworthiness and the aircraft's registration form from the aircraft, complete the reverse side of the registration form, and send both documents to The FAA Aircraft Registration Branch, P.O. Box 25504, Oklahoma City, OK 73125-0504; and
