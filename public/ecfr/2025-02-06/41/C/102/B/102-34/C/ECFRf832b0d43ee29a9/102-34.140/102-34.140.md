# ยง 102-34.140   What records do we need to keep on U.S. Government license plates?

You must keep a central record of all U.S. Government license plates for Government motor vehicles. The GSA Fleet must also keep such a record for GSA Fleet vehicles. The record must:


(a) Identify the motor vehicle to which each set of plates is assigned; and


(b) List lost, stolen, destroyed, and voided license plate numbers.
