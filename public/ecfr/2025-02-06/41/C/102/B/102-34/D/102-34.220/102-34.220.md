# ยง 102-34.220   What does GSA do if it learns of unofficial use of a Government motor vehicle?

GSA reports the matter to the head of your agency. The agency investigates and may, if appropriate, take disciplinary action under 31 U.S.C. 1349 or may report the violation to the Attorney General for prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 641.
