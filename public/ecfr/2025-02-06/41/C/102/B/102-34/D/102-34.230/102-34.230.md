# ยง 102-34.230   How am I responsible for protecting Government motor vehicles?

When a Government motor vehicle is under your control, you must:


(a) Park or store the Government motor vehicle in a manner that reasonably protects it from theft or damage; and


(b) Lock the unattended Government motor vehicle. (The only exception to this requirement is when fire regulations or other directives prohibit locking motor vehicles in closed buildings or enclosures.)
