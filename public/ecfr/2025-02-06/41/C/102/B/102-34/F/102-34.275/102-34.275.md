# ยง 102-34.275   What kind of maintenance programs must we have?

You must have a scheduled maintenance program for each motor vehicle you own or lease commercially. This requirement applies to domestic fleets, and is recommended for foreign fleets. The GSA Fleet will develop maintenance programs for GSA Fleet vehicles. The scheduled maintenance program must:


(a) Meet Federal and State emissions and safety standards;


(b) Meet manufacturer warranty requirements;


(c) Ensure the safe and economical operating condition of the motor vehicle throughout its life; and


(d) Ensure that inspections and servicing occur as recommended by the manufacturer or more often if local operating conditions require.
