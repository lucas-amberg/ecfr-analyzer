# ยง 102-34.305   What forms do we use to transfer ownership when selling a motor vehicle?

Use the following forms to transfer ownership:


(a) SF 97, The United States Government Certificate to Obtain Title to a Motor Vehicle, if both of the following apply:


(1) The motor vehicle will be retitled by a State, Commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia; and


(2) The purchaser intends to operate the motor vehicle on highways.


(b) SF 97 is optional for foreign fleet motor vehicles because foreign governments may require the use of other forms.
