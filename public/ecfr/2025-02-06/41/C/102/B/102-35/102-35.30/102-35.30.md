# § 102-35.30   What actions must I take or am I authorized to take regardless of the property disposition method?

Regardless of the disposition method used:


(a) You must maintain property in a safe, secure, and cost-effective manner until final disposition.


(b) You have authority to use the abandonment/ destruction provisions at any stage of the disposal process (see §§ 102-36.305 through 102-36.330 and § 102-38.70 of this subchapter B).


(c) You must implement policies and procedures to remove sensitive or classified information from property prior to disposal. Agency-affixed markings should be removed, if at all possible, prior to personal property permanently leaving your agency's control.


(d) Government-owned personal property may only be used as authorized by your agency. Title to Government-owned personal property cannot be transferred to a non-Federal entity unless through official procedures specifically authorized by law.
