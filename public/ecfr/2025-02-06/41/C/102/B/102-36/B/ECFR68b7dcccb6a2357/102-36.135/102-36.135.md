# ยง 102-36.135   How much time do we have to pick up excess personal property that has been approved for transfer?

Normally, you have 15 calendar days from the date of GSA allocation to pick up the excess personal property for transfer, and you are responsible for scheduling and coordinating the property removal with the holding agency. If additional removal time is required, you are responsible for requesting such additional removal time.
