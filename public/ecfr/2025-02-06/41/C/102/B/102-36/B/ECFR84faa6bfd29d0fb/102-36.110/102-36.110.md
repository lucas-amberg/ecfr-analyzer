(a) Yes, when entering a federal facility, federal agency employees must present a valid Federal ID. Non-federal individuals will need proof of authorization from their sponsoring federal agency in addition to a valid picture identification. 


(b) Entry on some federal and contractor facilities may require special authorization from that facility. Persons wishing to screen excess personal property on such a facility must obtain approval from that agency. Contact your regional GSA Personal Property Management office for locations and accessibility.
