(a) GSA will generally approve transfers on a first-come, first-served basis. When more than one federal agency requests the same item, and the quantity available is not sufficient to meet the demand of all interested agencies, GSA will consider factors such as national defense requirements, emergency needs, avoiding the necessity of a new procurement, energy conservation, transportation costs, and retention of title in the government. GSA will normally give preference to the agency that will retain title in the Government. 


(b) Requests for property for the purpose of cannibalization will normally be subordinate to requests for use of the property in its existing form.
