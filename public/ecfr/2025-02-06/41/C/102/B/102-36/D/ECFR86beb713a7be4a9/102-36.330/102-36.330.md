# ยง 102-36.330   Are there occasions when public notice is not needed regarding abandonment/destruction of excess personal property?

Yes, you are not required to provide public notice when: 


(a) The value of the property is so little or the cost of its care and handling, pending abandonment/destruction, is so great that its retention for advertising for sale, even as scrap, is clearly not economical; 


(b) Abandonment or destruction is required because of health, safety, or security reasons; or 


(c) When the original acquisition cost of the item (estimated if unknown) is less than $500.
