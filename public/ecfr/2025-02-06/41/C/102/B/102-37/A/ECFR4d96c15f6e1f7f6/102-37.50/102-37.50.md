# ยง 102-37.50   What is the general process for requesting surplus property for donation?

The process for requesting surplus property for donation varies, depending on who is making the request. 


(a) Donees should submit their requests for property directly to the appropriate SASP. 


(b) SASPs and public airports should submit their requests to the appropriate GSA regional office. Requests must be submitted on a Standard Form (SF) 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property, or its electronic equivalent. Public airports must have FAA certify their transfer requests prior to submission to GSA for approval. GSA may ask SASPs or public airports to submit any additional information required to support and justify transfer of the property. 


(c) The American National Red Cross should submit requests to GSA as described in subpart G of this part when obtaining property under the authority of 40 U.S.C. 551.


(d) Public bodies, when seeking to acquire property that is being abandoned or destroyed, should follow rules and procedures established by the donor agency (see subpart H of this part).
