# § 102-37.110   What are a holding agency's responsibilities in the donation of surplus property?

Your donation responsibilities as a holding agency begin when you determine that property is to be declared excess. You must then: 


(a) Let GSA know if you have a donee in mind for foreign gift items or airport property, as provided for in §§ 102-37.525 and 102-42.95(h) of this chapter; 


(b) Cooperate with all entities authorized to participate in the donation program and their authorized representatives in locating, screening, and inspecting excess or surplus property for possible donation; 


(c) Set aside or hold surplus property from further disposal upon notification of a pending transfer for donation; (If GSA does not notify you of a pending transfer within 5 calendar days following the surplus release date, you may proceed with the sale or other authorized disposal of the property.)


(d) Upon receipt of a GSA-approved transfer document, promptly ship or release property to the transferee (or the transferee's designated agent) in accordance with pickup or shipping instructions on the transfer document; 


(e) Notify the approving GSA regional office if surplus property to be picked up is not removed within 15 calendar days after you notify the transferee (or its agent) of its availability. (GSA will advise you of further disposal instructions.); and 


(f) Perform and bear the cost of care and handling of surplus property pending its disposal, except as provided in § 102-37.115.
