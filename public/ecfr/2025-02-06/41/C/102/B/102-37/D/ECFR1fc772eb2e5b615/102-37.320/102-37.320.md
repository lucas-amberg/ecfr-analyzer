# ยง 102-37.320   Under what conditions may a SASP abandon or destroy undistributed surplus property?

(a) You may abandon or destroy undistributed surplus property when you have made a written finding that the property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale. The abandonment or destruction finding must be sent to the appropriate GSA regional office for approval. You must include in the finding: 


(1) The basis for the abandonment or destruction; 


(2) A detailed description of the property, its condition, and total acquisition cost; 


(3) The proposed method of destruction (burning, burying, etc.) or the abandonment location; 


(4) A statement confirming that the proposed abandonment or destruction will not be detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety and will not infringe on the rights of other persons; and 


(5) The signature of the SASP director requesting approval for the abandonment or destruction. 


(b) GSA will notify you within 30 calendar days whether you may abandon or destroy the property. GSA will provide alternate disposition instructions if it disapproves your request for abandonment or destruction. If GSA doesn't reply to you within 30 calendar days of notification, the property may be abandoned or destroyed.
