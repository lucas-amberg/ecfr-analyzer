Yes, you may distribute surplus property to eligible donees of another State, if you and the other SASP determine that such an arrangement will be of mutual benefit to you and the donees concerned. Where such determinations are made, an interstate distribution cooperative agreement must be prepared as prescribed in ยง 102-37.335 and submitted to the appropriate GSA regional office for approval. When acting under an interstate distribution cooperative agreement, you must: 


(a) Require the donee recipient to execute the distribution documents of its home SASP; and 


(b) Forward copies of executed distribution documents to the donee's home SASP.
