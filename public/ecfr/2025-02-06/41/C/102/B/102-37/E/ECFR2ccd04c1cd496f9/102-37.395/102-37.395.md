A SASP may accept the following documentation as evidence that an applicant has met established standards for the operation of its educational or health program: 


(a) A certificate or letter from a nationally recognized accrediting agency affirming the applicant meets the agency's standards and requirements. 


(b) The applicant's appearance on a list with other similarly approved or accredited institutions or programs when that list is published by a State, regional, or national accrediting authority. 


(c) Letters from State or local authorities (such as a board of health or a board of education) stating that the applicant meets the standards prescribed for approved or accredited institutions and organizations. 


(d) In the case of educational activities, letters from three accredited or State-approved institutions that students from the applicant institution have been and are being accepted. 


(e) In the case of public health institutions, licensing may be accepted as evidence of approval, provided the licensing authority prescribes the medical requirements and standards for the professional and technical services of the institution. 


(f) The awarding of research grants to the institution by a recognized authority such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Education, or by similar national advisory council or organization.
