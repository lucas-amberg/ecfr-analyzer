In general, you must maintain the records required by your State plan to document donee eligibility (see appendix B of this part). For SEAs, you must maintain separate records that include: 


(a) Documentation verifying that the activity has been designated as eligible by DOD to receive surplus DOD property. 


(b) A statement designating one or more donee representative(s) to act for the SEA in acquiring property. 


(c) A listing of the types of property that are needed or have been authorized by DOD for use in the SEA's program.
