You may alter or grant releases from State-imposed restrictions, provided your State plan of operation sets forth the standards by which such actions will be taken. You may not grant releases from, or amendments or corrections to: 


(a) The terms and conditions you are required by the Property Act to impose on the use of passenger motor vehicles and any item of property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more. 


(b) Any special handling condition or use limitation imposed by GSA, except with the prior written approval of GSA. 


(c) The statutory requirement that usable property be returned by the donee to the SASP if the property has not been placed in use for the purposes for which it was donated within 1 year of donation or ceases to be used by the donee for those purposes within 1 year of being placed in use, except that: 


(1) You may grant authority to the donee to cannibalize property items subject to this requirement when you determine that such action will result in increased use of the property and that the proposed action meets the standards prescribed in your plan of operation. 


(2) You may, with the written concurrence of GSA, grant donees: 


(i) A time extension to place property into use if the delay in putting the property into use was beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the donee. 


(ii) Authority to trade in one donated item for one like item having similar use potential.
