# ยง 102-37.505   How does a donee apply for and receive reimbursement for unneeded property returned to a SASP?

If the donee has incurred repair expenses for property it is returning to a SASP and wishes to be reimbursed for them, it will inform the SASP of this. The SASP will recommend for GSA approval a reimbursement amount, taking into consideration the benefit the donee has received from the use of the property and making appropriate deductions for that use. 


(a) If this property is subsequently transferred to a Federal agency, the receiving agency will be required to reimburse the donee as a condition of the transfer. 


(b) If the property is sold, the donee will be reimbursed from the sales proceeds.
