You must handle funds derived from compliance actions as follows: 


(a) *Enforcement of Federal restrictions.* You must promptly remit to GSA any funds derived from the enforcement of compliance involving a violation of any Federal restriction, for deposit in the Treasury of the United States. You must also submit any supporting documentation indicating the source of the funds and essential background information. 


(b) *Enforcement of State restrictions.* You may retain any funds derived from a compliance action involving violation of any State-imposed restriction and use such funds as provided in your State plan of operation.
