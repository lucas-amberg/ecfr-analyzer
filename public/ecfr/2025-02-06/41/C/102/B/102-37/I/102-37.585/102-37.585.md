# § 102-37.585   In transferring donated surplus vehicles, what is the responsibility of the holding agency?

(a) The holding agency is responsible for preparing Standard Form 97, *The United States Government Certificate to Obtain Title to a Vehicle* (SF 97) upon notification by GSA that a donee has been identified. The SF 97 may be prepared by GSA if mutually agreed upon by the holding agency and GSA. The holding agency is designated as the “transferor.”


(b) If the holding agency authorizes or requires any other entity, including a contractor or grantee, to complete this SF 97, the holding agency must first ensure compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act.


(c) The SF 97 is a serially numbered, controlled form, stock number 7540-00-634-4047, which can be obtained by executive agencies from GSA Global Supply or online at *www.gsaglobalsupply.gsa.gov.* Proper precautions shall be exercised by the agency to prevent blank copies of the SF 97 from being obtained by unauthorized persons.
