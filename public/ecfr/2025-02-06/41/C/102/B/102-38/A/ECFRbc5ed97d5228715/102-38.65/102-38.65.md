# ยง 102-38.65   What if we are or the holding agency is notified of a Federal requirement for surplus personal property before the sale is complete?

Federal agencies have first claim to excess or surplus personal property reported to the General Services Administration. When a bona fide need for the property exists and is expressed by a Federal agency, and when no like item(s) are located elsewhere, you or the holding agency must make the property available for transfer to the maximum extent practicable and prior to transfer of title to the property.
