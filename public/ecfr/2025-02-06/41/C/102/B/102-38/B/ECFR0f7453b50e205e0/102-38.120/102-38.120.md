# ยง 102-38.120   When may we conduct negotiated sales of personal property at fixed prices (fixed price sale)?

You may conduct negotiated sales of personal property at fixed prices (fixed price sale) under this section when:


(a) The items are authorized to be sold at fixed price by the Administrator of General Services, as reflected in GSA Bulletin FMR B-10 (located at *http://www.gsa.gov/fmrbulletin*). You may also contact the GSA Office of Travel, Transportation, and Asset Management (MT) at the address listed in ยง 102-38.115 to determine which items are on this list of authorized items;


(b) The head of your agency, or designee, determines in writing that such sales serve the best interest of the Government. When you are selling property on behalf of a holding agency, you must consult with the holding agency in determining whether a fixed price sale meets this criterion; and


(c) You must publicize such sales to the extent consistent with the value and nature of the property involved, and the prices established must reflect the estimated fair market value of the property. Property is sold on a first-come, first-served basis. You or the holding agency may also establish additional terms and conditions that must be met by the successful purchaser in accordance with ยง 102-38.75.
