# § 102-38.80   Which method of sale should we use?

(a) You may use any method of sale provided the sale is publicly advertised and the personal property is sold with full and open competition. Exceptions to the requirement for competitive bids for negotiated sales (including fixed price sales) are contained in §§ 102-38.100 through 102-38.125.

(1) Type and quantity of property;


(2) Location of property;


(3) Potential market;


(4) Cost to prepare and conduct the sale;


(5) Available facilities; and


(6) Sales experience of the selling activity.


(b) Methods of sale may include sealed bid sales, spot bid sales, auctions, or negotiated sales and may be conducted at a physical location or through any electronic media that is publicly accessible.
