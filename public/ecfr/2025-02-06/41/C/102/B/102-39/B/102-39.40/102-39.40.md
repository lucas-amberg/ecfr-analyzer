# ยง 102-39.40   How does the exchange/sale authority differ from the disposal process for excess/surplus personal property?

(a) The primary difference is that sales proceeds or exchange allowances may be used to acquire similar replacement personal property that is still needed under the exchange/sale authority as described in this part; whereas under the more frequently used excess/surplus disposal process, you would not be able to use sales proceeds or exchange allowances to acquire replacement personal property.


(b) Your use of the exchange/sale authority is optional and should be considered when needed replacement assets may be acquired under the provisions of this part. If exchange/sale is not practicable (for example, if conducting an exchange/sale transaction is not cost effective), you should dispose of the property through the excess/surplus disposal process by reporting the property as excess, as addressed in part 102-36 of this chapter.


(c) In the excess/surplus disposal process, any net proceeds from the sale of surplus property generally must be forwarded to the miscellaneous receipts account at the United States Treasury, and thus would not be available to you for use in acquiring similar replacement property or for any other purpose. You may use the exchange/sale authority in the acquisition of personal property even if the acquisition is under a services contract, as long as the property acquired under the services contract is similar to the property exchanged or sold (e.g., for a service life extension program (SLEP), exchange allowances or sales proceeds would be available for replacement of similar items, but not for services).
