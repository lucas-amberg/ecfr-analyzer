You must submit, within 90 calendar days after the close of each fiscal year (FY), an exchange/sale report using the online Personal Property Reporting Tool template found at *https://www.property.reporting.gov.* This template provides the specific information needed for your agency's report. You can contact the GSA Help Desk at *help.PPRT@gsa.gov* if you need assistance accessing the online reporting tool. All reports, including negative reports, must be submitted electronically through the Personal Property Reporting Tool. Transactions involving books and periodicals in your libraries need not be reported.
