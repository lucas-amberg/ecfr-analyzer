# ยง 102-40.50   What must we do when we no longer need personal property with special handling requirements?

Except for the items listed in ยง 102-40.55, you must report excess personal property with special handling requirements that you no longer need to GSA for Federal and donation screening (see ยง 102-36.215 of this subchapter for how to report excess personal property to GSA). The report to GSA must clearly identify property requiring special handling, and all related hazards, precautions, and handling requirements related to this property. You must dispose of property not required to be reported to GSA in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and your agency procedures. See ยง 102-40.125 for policy regarding disposal of property requiring special handling by abandonment or destruction. Disposal must be accomplished so as to preserve as much as possible, any civilian utility or commercial value of the property.
