(a) In accordance with EPA regulations (40 CFR 761.1 and 761.3), property defined by EPA as excluded polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) products may be transferred, donated or sold in accordance with parts 102-36, 102-37, or 102-38 of this subchapter. For additional guidance on PCB classifications and other Federal restrictions, contact: Director, National Program Chemicals Division (NPCD), (7404), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC or visit the EPA's Web site at: *http://www.epa.gov/waste/hazard/tsd/pcbs/index.htm.* You should also contact state regulatory agencies since some states regulate at a stricter level than the Federal Government.


(b) Property defined by the EPA in 40 CFR 761.3 as either a PCB item or PCB must be labeled or marked with a warning statement that the item contains PCB and must be handled and disposed of in accordance with EPA regulations (40 CFR part 761), DOT regulations (49 CFR parts 171 through 180), and applicable state laws.


(1) PCB items and PCBs may be transferred or donated, provided:


(i) The items are intact, non-leaking, and totally enclosed.


(ii) All transfers orders or transfer documents must cite the specific provision in 40 CFR part 761 that permits continued use of the item, and contains a certification that the property has been inspected by the transferee and complies with all the use, inspection, labeling, and other provisions of 40 CFR part 761.


(iii) The recipient must annotate its property accountability records to reflect the nature and extent of the PCB content and must provide the specific authorization covering the use of this item from 40 CFR part 761.

This information will be perpetuated on any notification or release document when the agency disposes of the property.
