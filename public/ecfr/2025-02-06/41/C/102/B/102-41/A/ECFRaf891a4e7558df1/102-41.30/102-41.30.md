# § 102-41.30   What is GSA's role in the disposition of property covered by this part?

(a) *Seized property subject to court proceedings for forfeiture.* (1) If the seizing agency files a request for the property for its official use, the GSA Region 3/National Capital Region will apply to the court for an order to turn the property over to the agency should forfeiture be decreed. If no such request has been filed, GSA will determine whether retention of the property for Federal official use is in the Government's best interest, and, if so, will apply to the court to order delivery of the property to—


(i) Any other Federal agency that requests it; or


(ii) The seizing agency to be retained for a reasonable time in case the property may later become necessary to any agency for official use.


(2) In the event that the property is not ordered by competent authority to be forfeited to the United States, it may be returned to the claimant.


(b) *Forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed property.* When forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed property is reported to GSA for disposal, GSA will direct its disposition by—


(1) Transfer to another Federal agency;


(2) Donation to an eligible recipient, if the property is not needed by a Federal agency and there are no requirements for reimbursement to satisfy the claims of owners, lien holders, or other lawful claimants;


(3) Sale; or


(4) Abandonment and destruction in accordance with § 102-36.305 of this subchapter B.
