# ยง 102-41.140   When do we report to GSA unclaimed personal property not retained for official use?

After you have held the property for 30 calendar days and no one has filed a claim for it, the title to the property vests in the Government. If you decide not to retain the property for official use, report it as excess to GSA in accordance with part 102-36 of this subchapter B.
