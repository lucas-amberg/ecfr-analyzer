# ยง 102-72.68   What preconditions must be satisfied before an Executive agency may exercise the delegated authority to perform an individual ancillary repair and alteration project?

The preconditions that must be satisfied before an Executive agency may perform ancillary repair and alteration work are as follows:


(a) The ordering agency must order both the products or services and the ancillary repair and alteration services under the same GSA Multiple Award Schedule from the same vendor;


(b) The value of the ancillary repair and alteration work must be less than or equal to $100,000 (for work estimated to exceed $100,000, the Executive agency must contact the GSA Assistant Regional Administrator, Public Buildings Service, in the region where the work is to be performed to request a specific delegation);


(c) All terms and conditions applicable to the acquisition of ancillary repair and alteration work as required by the GSA Multiple Award Schedule ordering procedures must be satisfied;


(d) The ancillary repair and alteration work must not be in a facility leased by GSA or in any other leased facility acquired under a lease delegation from GSA; and


(e) As soon as reasonably practicable, the Executive agency must provide the building manager with a detailed scope of work, including cost estimates, and schedule for the project, and such other information as may be reasonably requested by the building manager, so the building manager can determine whether or not the proposed work is reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on the operation and management of the building, the building's structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, or heating and air conditioning systems, the building's aesthetic or historic features, or the space or property of any other tenant in the building. The Executive agency must obtain written approval from the building manager prior to placing an order for any ancillary repair and alteration work.
