# ยง 102-72.90   What are Executive agencies' responsibilities under a security delegation of authority from GSA?

Law enforcement and related security functions were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security upon its establishment in 2002. The Homeland Security Act authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services, to issue regulations necessary for the protection and administration of property owned or occupied by the Federal Government and persons on the property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GSA retained all powers, functions and authorities necessary for the operation, maintenance, and protection of buildings and grounds owned and occupied by the Federal Government and under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA.
