# § 102-73.35   Is a prospectus required for all acquisition, construction, or alteration projects?

No, a prospectus is not required if the dollar value of a project does not exceed the prospectus threshold. 40 U.S.C. 3307 establishes a prospectus threshold, applicable to Federal agencies operating under, or subject to, the authorities of the Administrator of General Services, for the construction, alteration, purchase, and acquisition of any building to be used as a public building, and establishes a prospectus threshold to lease any space for use for public purposes. The current prospectus threshold value for each fiscal year can be accessed by entering GSA's Web site at *http://www.gsa.gov* and then inserting “prospectus thresholds” in the search mechanism in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
