Yes, the limitations on leasing certain types of space are as follows:


(a) In general, Federal agencies may not lease any space to accommodate computer and telecommunications operations; secure or sensitive activities related to the national defense or security; or a permanent courtroom, judicial chamber, or administrative office for any United States court, if the average annual net rental cost of leasing such space would exceed the prospectus threshold (40 U.S.C. 3307(f)(1)).


(b) However, Federal agencies may lease such space if the Administrator of General Services first determines that leasing such space is necessary to meet requirements that cannot be met in public buildings, and then submits such determination to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 3307(f)(2).
