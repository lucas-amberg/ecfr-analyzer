# § 102-73.265   What actions must Federal agencies take to facilitate land acquisition?

To facilitate land acquisition, Federal agencies must, among other things—


(a) Appraise the real property before starting negotiations and give the owner (or the owner's representative) the opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the inspection;


(b) Establish an amount estimated to be the just compensation before starting negotiations and promptly offer to acquire the property for this full amount;


(c) Try to negotiate with owners on the price;


(d) Pay the agreed purchase price to the property owner, or in the case of a condemnation, deposit payment in the registry of the court, for the benefit of the owner, before requiring the owner to surrender the property; and


(e) Provide property owners (and occupants) at least 90 days' notice of displacement before requiring anyone to move. If a Federal agency permits the owner to keep possession for a short time after acquiring the owner's property, Federal agencies must not charge rent in excess of the property's fair rental value to a short-term occupier.
