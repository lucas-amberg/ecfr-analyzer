# § 102-73.280   Where can Federal agencies find guidance on how to appraise the value of properties being acquired by the Federal Government?

The Interagency Land Acquisition Conference has developed, promulgated, and adopted the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, sometimes referred to as the “Yellow Book.” The Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, established on November 27, 1968, by invitation of the Attorney General, is a voluntary organization composed of the many Federal agencies engaged in the acquisition of real estate for public uses. The “Yellow Book” is published by the Appraisal Institute in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice and is available in hard copy or on the Department of Justice's internet Web site at *http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/land-ack/.*
