# § 102-74.45   When must Federal agencies provide concession services?

Federal agencies, upon approval from GSA, must provide concession services where building population supports such services and when the availability of existing commercial services is insufficient to meet Federal agency needs. Prior to establishing concessions, Federal agencies must ensure that—


(a) The proposed concession will be established and operated in conformance with applicable policies, safety, health and sanitation codes, laws, regulations, etc., and will not contravene the terms of any lease or other contractual arrangement; and


(b) Sufficient funds are legally available to cover all costs for which the Government may be responsible.
