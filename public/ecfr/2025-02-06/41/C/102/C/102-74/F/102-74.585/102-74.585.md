# ยง 102-74.585   What Federal facility telework policy must Executive agencies follow?

Executive agencies must follow these telework policies:


(a) In accordance with Section 359 of Public Law 106-346, each Executive agency must establish a policy under which eligible employees of the agency may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance. Public 106-346 became effective on October 23, 2000, and required the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to ensure the application and implementation of Section 359 to 25 percent of the Federal workforce by April 2001, and to an additional 25 percent of such workforce each year thereafter. Thus, the law provides that its requirements must be applied to 100 percent of the Federal workforce by April 2004.


(b) In accordance with 40 U.S.C. 587, when considering whether to acquire any space, quarters, buildings, or other facilities for use by employees of any Executive agency, the head of that agency shall consider whether the need for the facilities can be met using alternative workplace arrangements.
