# § 102-74.590   What steps must agencies take to implement these laws and policies?

(a) As interpreted by OPM Memorandum to agencies (February 9, 2001), Public Law 106-346 instructs Federal agencies to—


(1) Review telework barriers, act to remove them, and increase actual participation;


(2) Establish eligibility criteria; and


(3) Subject to any applicable agency policies or bargaining obligations, allow employees who meet the criteria and want to participate the opportunity if they are satisfactory performers.


(b) 40 U.S.C. 587 requires agencies considering the acquisition of facilities for use by Federal employees to consider whether the facility need can be met using alternative workplace arrangements, such as telecommuting, hoteling, virtual offices, and other distributive work arrangements. If the agency needs assistance in this investigation and/or subsequent application of alternative workplace arrangements, GSA will provide guidance, assistance, and oversight, as needed, regarding establishment and operation of alternative workplace arrangements.


(c) Agencies evaluating alternative workplace arrangements should also make these evaluations in coordination with Integrated Workplace policies and strategies. See § 102-79.110.
