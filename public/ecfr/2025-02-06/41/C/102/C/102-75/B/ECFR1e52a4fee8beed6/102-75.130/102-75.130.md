# § 102-75.130   If hazardous substance activity took place on the property, what specific information must an agency include in the title report?

If hazardous substance activity took place on the property, the reporting agency must include information on the type and quantity of such hazardous substance and the time at which such storage, release, or disposal took place. The reporting agency must also advise the disposal agency if all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to any such hazardous substance activity was taken before the date the property was reported excess. If such action was not taken, the reporting agency must advise the disposal agency when such action will be completed or how the agency expects to comply with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in the disposal. See §§ 102-75.340 and 102-75.345.
