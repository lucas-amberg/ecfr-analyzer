Before property can be transferred among Federal agencies, to mixed-ownership Government corporations, and to the municipal government of the District of Columbia, GSA must determine that—


(a) The transfer is in the best interest of the Government;


(b) The requesting agency is the appropriate agency to hold the property; and


(c) The proposed land use will maximize use of the real property, in terms of economy and efficiency, to minimize expenditures for the purchase of real property.
