# ยง 102-75.120   Is there any other information that needs to accompany (or be submitted with) the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118)?

Yes, in all cases where Government-owned land is reported excess, Executive agencies must include a title report, prepared or approved by a qualified employee of the landholding agency, documenting the Government's title to the property.
