# § 102-75.165   Should related personal property be designated real or personal property for disposition purposes?

Related personal property may, at the disposal agency's discretion, be designated as personal property for disposal purposes. However, for fine artwork and sculptures, GSA's policy is that artwork specifically created for a Federal building is considered as a fixture of the building. This also applies to sculptures created for a Federal building or a public park. Disposal agencies must follow the policies and guidance for disposal of artwork and sculptures developed by the GSA Office of the Chief Architect, Center for Design Excellence and the Arts, and the Bulletin dated March 26, 1934, entitled “Legal Title to Works Produced under the Public Works of Art Project.”
