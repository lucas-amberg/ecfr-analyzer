# § 102-75.140   In addition to the title report, and all necessary environmental information and certifications, what information must an Executive agency transmit with the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118)?

Executive agencies must provide—


(a) A legible, reproducible copy of all instruments in possession of the agency that affect the United States' right, title, or interest in the property reported or the use and operation of such property (including agreements covering and licenses to use, any patents, processes, techniques, or inventions). If it is impracticable to transmit the abstracts of title and related title evidence, agencies must provide the name and address of the custodian of such documents in the title report referred to in § 102-75.120;


(b) Any appraisal reports indicating or providing the fair market value or the fair annual rental of the property, if requested by the disposal agency; and


(c) A certification by a responsible person that the property does or does not contain polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) transformers or other equipment regulated by EPA under 40 CFR part 761, if requested by the disposal agency. If the property does contain any equipment subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR part 761, the certification must include the landholding agency's assurance that each piece of equipment is now and will continue to be in compliance with the EPA regulations until disposal of the property.
