# § 102-75.255   What are disposal agencies' specific responsibilities concerning the disposal of surplus property?

The disposal agency must determine that there is no further Federal need or requirement for the excess real property and the property is surplus to the needs of the Federal Government. After reaching this determination, the disposal agency must expeditiously make the surplus property available for acquisition by State and local governmental units and non-profit institutions (see § 102-75.350) or for sale by public advertising, negotiation, or other disposal action. The disposal agency must consider the availability of real property for public purposes on a case-by-case basis, based on highest and best use and estimated fair market value. Where hazardous substance activity is identified, see §§ 102-75.340 and 102-75.345 for required information that the disposal agency must incorporate into the offer to purchase and conveyance document.
