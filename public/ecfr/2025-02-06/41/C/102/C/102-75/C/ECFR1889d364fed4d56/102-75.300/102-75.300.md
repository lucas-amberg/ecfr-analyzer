# § 102-75.300   Are appraisals required for all real property disposal transactions?

Generally, yes, appraisals are required for all real property disposal transactions, except when—


(a) An appraisal will serve no useful purpose (e.g., legislation authorizes conveyance without monetary consideration or at a fixed price). This exception does not apply to negotiated sales to public agencies intending to use the property for a public purpose not covered by any of the special disposal provisions in subpart C of this part; or


(b) The estimated fair market value of property to be offered on a competitive sale basis does not exceed $300,000.
