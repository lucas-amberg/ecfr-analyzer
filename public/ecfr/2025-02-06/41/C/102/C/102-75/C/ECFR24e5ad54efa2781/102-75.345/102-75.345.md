# ยง 102-75.345   What is different about the statements in the offer to purchase and conveyance document if the sale is to a potentially responsible party with respect to the hazardous substance activity?

In the case where the purchaser or grantee is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to hazardous substance activity on the property under consideration, the United States is no longer under a general obligation to certify that the property has been successfully remediated, or to commit to return to the property to address contamination that is discovered in the future. Therefore, the statements of responsibility and commitments on behalf of the United States referenced in ยง 102-75.340 should not be used. Instead, language should be included in the offer to purchase and conveyance document that is consistent with any agreement that has been reached between the landholding agency and the PRP with regard to prior hazardous substance activity.
