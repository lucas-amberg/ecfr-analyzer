# ยง 102-75.938   May the easement and the land that benefited from the easement (dominant estate) be disposed of separately?

Yes. If the easement is no longer needed in connection with the dominant estate, it may be disposed of separately to the owner of the servient estate. However, if the dominant estate is also surplus, the easement should be disposed of with the dominant estate.
