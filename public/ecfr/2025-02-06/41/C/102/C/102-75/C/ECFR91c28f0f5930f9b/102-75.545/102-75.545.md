# ยง 102-75.545   What happens if property that was transferred to meet an educational or public health requirement is revested in the United States for noncompliance with the terms of sale, or other cause?

In each case of repossession under a terminated lease or reversion of title for noncompliance with the terms or conditions of sale or other cause, ED or HHS must, prior to repossession or reversion of title, provide the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office with an accurate description of the real and related personal property involved using the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118), and the appropriate schedules. After receiving a statement from ED or HHS that the property is proposed for revesting, GSA will review the statement and determine if title should be revested. If GSA, in conjunction with ED or HHS, determines that the property should be revested, ED or HHS must submit a Standard Form 118 to GSA. GSA will review and act upon the Standard Form 118, if acceptable. However, the grantee must provide protection and maintenance for the property until the title reverts to the Federal Government, including the period of any notice of intent to revert. Such protection and maintenance must, at a minimum, conform to the standards prescribed in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal.
