# ยง 102-75.585   What action must the disposal agency take after an eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use for property for a self-help housing or housing assistance requirement?

When an eligible public agency submits a plan of use for property for a self-help housing or housing assistance requirement, the disposal agency must transmit two copies of the plan to the appropriate HUD regional office. HUD must submit to the disposal agency, within 30 calendar days after the date the plan is transmitted, a recommendation for assignment of the property to the Secretary of HUD, or must inform the disposal agency, within the 30-calendar day period, that a recommendation will not be made for assignment of the property to HUD. If, after considering other uses for the property, the disposal agency approves the assignment recommendation from HUD, it must assign the property by letter or other document to the Secretary of HUD. The disposal agency must furnish to the landholding agency a copy of the assignment, unless the landholding agency is also the disposal agency. If the disposal agency disapproves the recommendation, the disposal agency must likewise notify the Secretary of HUD.
