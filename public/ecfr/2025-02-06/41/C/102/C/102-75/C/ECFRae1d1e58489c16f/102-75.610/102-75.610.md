HUD is responsible for enforcing compliance with the terms and conditions of transfer. HUD is also responsible for reforming, correcting, or amending any transfer instrument; granting releases; and for taking any necessary actions for recapturing the property using the provisions of 40 U.S.C. 550(b). These actions are subject to the approval of the head of the disposal agency. HUD must notify the head of the disposal agency of its intent to take action to recapture the property. The notice must identify the property affected, describe in detail the proposed action, and state the reasons for the proposed action.
