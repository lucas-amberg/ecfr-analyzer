# § 102-75.975   What happens if the property is not conveyed or disposed of during this time frame?

If the property is not transferred to a Federal agency or disposed of during the 15-month period mentioned in § 102-75.970, then the disposal agency must pay or reimburse the landholding agency for protection and maintenance expenses incurred from the expiration date of said time period to final disposal, unless—


(a) There is no written agreement between the landholding agency and the disposal agency specifying the maximum amount of protection and maintenance expenses for which the disposal agency is responsible;


(b) The disposal agency's appropriation, as authorized by Congress, does not contain a provision to allow for payment and/or reimbursement of protection and maintenance expenses; or


(c) The delay is caused by an Executive agency's request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement specified in § 102-75.205. In this latter case, the requesting agency becomes responsible for protection and maintenance expenses incurred because of the delay.
