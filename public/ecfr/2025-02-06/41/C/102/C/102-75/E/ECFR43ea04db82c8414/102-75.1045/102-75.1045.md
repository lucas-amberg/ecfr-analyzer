# § 102-75.1045   Are there exceptions to the policy that requires public notice be given before Federal agencies abandon or destroy improvements on land or related personal property?

Yes, property can be abandoned or destroyed without public notice if—


(a) Its value is so low or the cost of its care and handling so great that retaining the property to post public notice is clearly not economical;


(b) Health, safety, or security considerations require its immediate abandonment or destruction; or


(c) The assigned mission of the agency might be jeopardized by the delay, and a duly authorized Federal agency official finds in writing, with respect to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, and a reviewing authority approves this finding. The finding must be in addition to the determinations prescribed in §§ 102-75.1000, 102-75.1005, 102-75.1010, and 102-75.1025.
