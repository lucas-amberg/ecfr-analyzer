# § 102-75.1140   What is the policy governing the acceptance or rejection of a conditional gift of real property for a particular defense purpose?

Any Federal agency receiving an offer of a conditional gift of real property for a particular defense purpose within the purview of Chapter 582-Public Law 537 (July 27, 1954) must notify the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office and must submit to GSA a recommendation indicating whether the Government should accept or reject the gift. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as applicable to the acceptance of gifts under the provisions of other laws. Following receipt of such notification and recommendation, GSA must—


(a) Consult with the interested agencies before it may accept or reject such conditional gifts of real property on behalf of the United States or before it transfers such conditional gifts of real property to an agency; and


(b) Advise the donor and the agencies concerned of the action taken with respect to acceptance or rejection of the conditional gift and of its final disposition.
