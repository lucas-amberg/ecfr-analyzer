# § 102-75.1166   What is the policy concerning determination of availability statements for suitable properties?

Within 45 days after receipt of notification from HUD pursuant to § 102-75.1162(a) that a property has been determined to be suitable, each landholding agency or GSA must transmit to HUD a statement of one of the following:


(a) In the case of unutilized or underutilized property—


(1) An intention to declare the property excess;


(2) An intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless; or


(3) The reasons why the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use to assist the homeless. The reasons given must be different from those listed as suitability criteria in § 102-75.1165.


(b) In the case of excess property which has been reported to GSA—


(1) A statement that there is no compelling Federal need for the property, and, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or


(2) A statement that there is a further and compelling Federal need for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the homeless.
