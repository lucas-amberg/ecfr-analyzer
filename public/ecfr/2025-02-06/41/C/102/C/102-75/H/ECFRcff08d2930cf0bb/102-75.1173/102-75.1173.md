# ยง 102-75.1173   What action must be taken on properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance?

The landholding agency or GSA will defer action to dispose of properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance for 20 days after the date that notice of a property is posted on the HUD website. HUD will inform landholding agencies or GSA if an appeal of an unsuitability determination is filed by a representative of the homeless pursuant to ยง 102-75.1163(f). HUD will advise the agency to refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no appeal has been filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding agency may proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable law.
