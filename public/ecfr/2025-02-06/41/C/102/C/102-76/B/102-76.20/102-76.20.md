# § 102-76.20   What issues must Federal agencies consider in providing site planning and landscape design services?

In providing site planning and design services, Federal agencies must—


(a) Make the site planning and landscape design a direct extension of the building design;


(b) Make a positive contribution to the surrounding landscape;


(c) Consider requirements (other than procedural requirements) of local zoning laws and laws relating to setbacks, height, historic preservation, and aesthetic qualities of a building;


(d) Identify areas for future building expansion in the architectural and site design concept for all buildings where an expansion need is identified to exist;


(e) Create a landscape design that is a pleasant, dynamic experience for occupants and visitors to Federal facilities and, where appropriate, encourage public access to and stimulate pedestrian traffic around the facilities. Coordinate the landscape design with the architectural characteristics of the building;


(f) Comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.,* and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 470 *et seq.,* for each project; and


(g) Consider the vulnerability of the facility as well as the security needs of the occupying agencies, consistent with the Interagency Security Committee standards and guidelines.
