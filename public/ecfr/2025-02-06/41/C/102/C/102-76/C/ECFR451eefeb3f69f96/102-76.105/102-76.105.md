# ยง 102-76.105   What standard must public rights-of-way subject to the Architectural Barriers Act and covered under ยง 102-76.65(a) meet?

(a) GSA adopts the appendix to 36 CFR part 1190 without additions or modification as the accessibility standard for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way. Pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way subject to the Architectural Barriers Act (other than facilities in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) must meet the accessibility standard for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way so that pedestrian facilities located in the public right-of-way are readily accessible to and usable by pedestrians with disabilities. Compliance with this accessibility standard is mandatory; provided, however, that this standard does not address existing pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way under the Architectural Barriers Act unless the pedestrian facilities are altered at the discretion of a covered entity.


(b) Residential public rights-of-way subject to the Architectural Barriers Act must meet the standards prescribed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.


(c) Department of Defense and United States Postal Service public rights-of-way subject to the Architectural Barriers Act must meet the standards prescribed by those agencies.
