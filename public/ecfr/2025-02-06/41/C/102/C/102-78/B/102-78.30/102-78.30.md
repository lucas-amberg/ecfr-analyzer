# ยง 102-78.30   Who are consulting parties?

As more particularly described in 36 CFR 800.2(c), consulting parties are those parties having consultative roles in the Section 106 process (i.e., Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act), which requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties and afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. Specifically, consulting parties include the State Historic Preservation Officer; the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer; Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations; representatives of local governments; applicants for Federal assistance, permits, licenses, and other approvals; other individuals and organizations with a demonstrated interest in the undertaking; and the Advisory Council (if it elects to participate in the consultation).
