# § 102-78.65   What are Federal agencies' historic preservation responsibilities when disposing of real property under their control?

Federal agencies must—


(a) To the extent practicable, establish and implement alternatives for historic properties, including adaptive use, that are not needed for current or projected agency purposes. Agencies are required to get the Secretary of the Interior's approval of the plans of transferees of surplus Federally-owned historic properties; and


(b) Review all proposed excess actions to identify any properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register. Federal agencies must not perform disposal actions that could result in the alteration, destruction, or modification of an historic or cultural property until Federal agencies have consulted with the SHPO and the Advisory Council.
