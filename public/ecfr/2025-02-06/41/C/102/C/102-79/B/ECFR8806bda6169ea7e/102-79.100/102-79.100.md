# ยง 102-79.100   What must Federal agencies do with antenna siting fees that they collect?

The account into which an antenna siting fee is to be deposited depends on the authority under which the antenna site is made available and the fee assessed. For GSA-controlled property outleased under 40 U.S.C. 581(h) or section 412 of Division H of public law 108-447, the fee is to be deposited into GSA's Federal Building Fund. For surplus property outleased under 40 U.S.C. 543, the fee is to be deposited in accordance with the provisions of Subchapter IV of Chapter 5 of Subtitle I of Title 40 of the United States Code. For siting fees collected under other statutory authorities, the fees might be deposited into miscellaneous receipts, an account of the landholding agency, or as otherwise provided by law. Federal agencies should consult with their agency's legal advisors before depositing antenna proceed from sites on agency-controlled Federal property.
