# ยง 102-79.70   May Executive agencies assess fees against other Executive agencies for antenna placements and supporting services?

Yes. Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, may assess fees for placement of antennas and supporting services against other agencies (that own these antennas) under 40 U.S.C. 586(c) and 40 U.S.C. 121(e). Unless a differing rate has been approved by the Administrator, such fees or charges must approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services (i.e., market rates). The proceeds from such charges or fees must be credited to the appropriation or fund initially charged for providing the space or services. Any amounts in excess of actual operating and maintenance costs must be credited to miscellaneous receipts unless otherwise provided by law. The charges or fees assessed by the Administrator for the placement of antennas and supporting services in GSA-controlled space are generally credited to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.
