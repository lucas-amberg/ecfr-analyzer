# ยง 102-79.85   What policy must Executive agencies follow concerning the placement of commercial antennas on Federal property?

Executive agencies will make antenna sites available on a fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis. Collocation of antennas should be encouraged where there are multiple antenna siting requests for the same location. In cases where this is not feasible and space availability precludes accommodating all antenna siting applicants, competitive procedures may be used. This should be done in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns. In making antenna sites available, agencies must avoid electromagnetic intermodulations and interferences. To the maximum extent practicable, when placing antennas for the provision of telecommunication services to the Federal Government, agencies should use redundant and physically separate entry points into the building and physically diverse local network facilities in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget.
