# ยง 102-83.100   What flexibility do Federal agencies have to implement part 102-83 in high cost areas?

Agencies have flexibility in considering the differing costs among principal cities within a single CBSA and in setting delineated areas to incorporate lower-cost markets.


There may be some instances where the head of the responsible acquiring agency or the head of the agency's designee determines that cost and security issues take precedence over the hierarchy of consideration in this part. Federal agencies may deviate from the hierarchy only where doing so would represent significant cost savings or security advantages to the Government. In such cases, agencies must consult and engage with and consider the recommendations of local officials, review and affirm this determination, and document the file accordingly.


In every instance, agencies must seek to meet the intent of the governing authorities described in ยง 102-83.10, and they must incorporate their applicable process into their internal policies and procedures.
