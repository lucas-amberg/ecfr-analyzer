# ยง 102-83.140   Where may Federal agencies appeal GSA decisions and recommendations concerning the delineated area?

Agencies may appeal decisions and recommendations, in writing, to the GSA Regional Commissioner of Public Buildings in the region where the space acquisition is to take place or to the GSA Regional Commissioner's designee. The written request for review must include all relevant facts and other considerations and must justify the alternative delineated area identified by the requesting agency with regard to the location requirements set forth in all applicable statutes, E.O.s and regulations. Once submitted to the Regional Commissioner or the Regional Commissioner's designee, the requesting agency's appeal will proceed according to the process established internally by GSA.
