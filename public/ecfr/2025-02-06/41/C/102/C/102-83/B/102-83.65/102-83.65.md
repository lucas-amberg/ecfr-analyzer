# ยง 102-83.65   What is a principal city?

(a) A principal city is an incorporated place or census designated place within a CBSA that meets certain employment and population-based criteria. Major metropolitan areas typically have several principal cities.


(b) The principal city designation is established by OMB pursuant to the *Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas,* as updated periodically and published in the _Federal Register,_ pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1104(d) and 44 U.S.C. 3504(e). OMB regularly publishes an updated list of Principal Cities (OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, and succeeding). In this part, the principal city designation is used to help the Federal agency focus local consultation and engagement.
