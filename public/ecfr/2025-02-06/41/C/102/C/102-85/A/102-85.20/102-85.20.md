An OA defines GSA's relationship with each customer agency and: 


(a) Establishes specific financial terms, provisions, rights, and obligations of GSA and its customer for each space assignment; 


(b) Minimizes exposure to future unknown costs for both GSA and customer agencies; 


(c) Stabilizes Rent payments to the extent reasonable and desired by customers; and 


(d) Allows tailoring of space and related services to meet customer agency needs.
