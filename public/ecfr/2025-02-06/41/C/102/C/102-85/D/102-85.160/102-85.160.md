# ยง 102-85.160   How does a customer agency know how much to budget for Rent?

GSA normally provides customer agencies an estimate of Rent increases approximately 2 months prior to the agencies' Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submission for the fiscal year in which GSA will charge Rent. This gives the affected customer agencies an opportunity to budget for an increase or decrease. However, GSA must obtain the concurrence of OMB for such changes prior to notifying customer agencies. In the event GSA is unable to provide timely notice of a future Rent increase, customer agencies are nonetheless obligated to pay the increased Rent amount. For existing assignments in owned buildings, GSA charges for fully serviced shell Rent, in aggregate, shall not exceed the bureau level budget estimates provided to the customer agencies annually. This provision does not apply to: 


(a) New assignments; 


(b) Changes in current assignments; 


(c) Leased space; 


(d) New tenant improvement amortization; 


(e) Building specific security costs; and 


(f) New amortization of capital expenditures under ROI pricing due to changes in scope of proposed projects or repair and/or replacement of building components
