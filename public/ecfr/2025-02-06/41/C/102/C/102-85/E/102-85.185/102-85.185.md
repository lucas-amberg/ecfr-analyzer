# ยง 102-85.185   Can space be exempted from the standard levels of service

Yes, customer agencies may be excused from paying for standard service levels for space assignments when: 


(a) In GSA-delegated space, the customer agency provides for these services itself and thus pays Rent minus charges for these services; or


(b) In rare instances, standard service levels may be waived by the Administrator of General Services in instances where charging for such standard services would not be feasible or practical, e.g., in assignments of limited square footage or functional use.
