# ยง 102-117.30   What choices do I have when acquiring transportation or related services?

When you acquire transportation or related services you may: 


(a) Use the GSA tender of service; 


(b) Use another agency's contract or rate tender with a TSP only if allowed by the terms of that agreement or if the Administrator of General Services delegates authority to another agency to enter an agreement available to other Executive agencies; 


(c) Contract directly with a TSP using the acquisition procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1); or 


(d) Negotiate a rate tender under a Federal transportation procurement statute, 49 U.S.C. 10721 or 13712.
