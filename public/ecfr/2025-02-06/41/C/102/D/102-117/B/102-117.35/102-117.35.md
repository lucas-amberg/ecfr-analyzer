# ยง 102-117.35   What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GSA's tender of service?

(a) It is an advantage to use GSA's tender of service when you want to: 


(1) Use GSA's authority to negotiate on behalf of the Federal Government and take advantage of the lower rates and optimum service that result from a larger volume of business; 


(2) Use a uniform tender of service; 


(3) Obtain assistance with loss and damage claims; and 


(4) Use GSA's Transportation management and operations expertise.


(b) It is a disadvantage to use GSA's tender of service when: 


(1) You want an agreement that is binding for a longer term than the GSA tender of service; 


(2) You have sufficient time to follow FAR contracting procedures and are in position to make volume or shipment commitments under a FAR contract; and


(3) Rates are not cost effective, as determined by the agency.
