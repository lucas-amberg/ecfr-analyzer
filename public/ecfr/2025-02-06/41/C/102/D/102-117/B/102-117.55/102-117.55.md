# ยง 102-117.55   What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a rate tender?

(a) Using a rate tender is an advantage when you: 


(1) Have a shipment that must be made within too short a time frame to identify or solicit for a suitable contract;


(2) Have shipments recurring between designated places, but do not expect sufficient volume to obtain favorable rates; or 


(3) Are not in a position to make a definite volume and shipment commitment under a FAR contract.


(b) Using a rate tender may be a disadvantage when: 


(1) You have sufficient time to use the FAR and this would achieve better results; 


(2) You require transportation service for which no rate tender currently exists; or 


(3) A TSP may revoke or terminate the tender on short notice.
