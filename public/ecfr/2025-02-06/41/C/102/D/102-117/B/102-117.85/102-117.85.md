# § 102-117.85   What is the difference between a Government bill of lading (GBL) and a bill of lading?

(a) A Government bill of lading (GBL), Standard Form 1103, is a document that conveys specific terms and conditions to protect the Government interest and serves as the contract of carriage. 


(b) A GBL is used only for international shipments.


(c) A bill of lading, sometimes referred to as a commercial bill of lading, establishes the terms of contract between a shipper and TSP. It serves as a receipt of goods, a contract of carriage, and documentary evidence of title.


(d) Use a bill of lading for Government shipments if the specific terms and conditions of a GBL are included in any contract or rate tender (see § 102-117.65) and the bill of lading makes reference to that contract or rate tender (see § 102-117.75 and the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation Handbook”).
