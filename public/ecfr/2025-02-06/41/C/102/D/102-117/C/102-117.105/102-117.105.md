# ยง 102-117.105   What does best value mean when routing a shipment?

Best value to your agency when routing a shipment means using the mode or individual TSP that provides satisfactory service with the best combination of service factors and price that meets the agency's requirements. A lower price may not be the best value if the service offered fails to meet the requirements of the shipment.
