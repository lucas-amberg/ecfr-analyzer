# § 102-117.135   What are the international transportation restrictions?

Several statutes mandate the use of U.S. flag carriers for international shipments, such as 49 U.S.C. 40118, commonly referred to as the “Fly America Act”, and 46 U.S.C. 55305, the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, as amended. The principal restrictions are as follows:


(a) *Air cargo:* The use of foreign-flag air carriers when funded by the U.S. Government should be rare. International movement of cargo by air is subject to the Fly America Act, 49 U.S.C. 40118, which requires the use of U.S. flag air carrier service for all air cargo movements funded by the U.S. Government, including cargo shipped by contractors, grantees, and others at Government expense, except when one of the following exceptions applies:


(1) The transportation is provided under a bilateral or multilateral air transportation agreement to which the U.S. Government and the government of a foreign country are parties, and which the Department of Transportation has determined meets the requirements of the Fly America Act.


(i) Information on bilateral or multilateral air transport agreements impacting U.S. Government procured transportation can be accessed at *https://www.state.gov/civil-air-transport-agreements* and


(ii) If determined appropriate, GSA may periodically issue FMR Bulletins providing further guidance on bilateral or multilateral air transportation agreements impacting U.S. Government procured transportation. These bulletins may be accessed at *http://www.gsa.gov/bulletins;*

(2) When the costs of transportation are reimbursed in full by a third party, such as a foreign government, an international agency, or other organization; or


(3) Use of a foreign air carrier is determined to be a matter of necessity by your agency, on a case-by-case basis, when:


(i) No U.S. flag air carrier can provide the specific air transportation needed;


(ii) No U.S. flag air carrier can meet the time requirements in cases of emergency;


(iii) There is a lack of or inadequate U.S. flag air carrier aircraft;


(iv) There is an unreasonable risk to safety when using a U.S. flag carrier aircraft (*e.g.,* terrorist threats). Written approval of the use of foreign air carrier service based on an unreasonable risk to safety must be approved by your agency on a case-by-case basis and must be supported by a travel advisory notice issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of State, or the Transportation Security Administration; or


(v) No U.S. flag air carrier can accomplish the agency's mission.


(b) *Ocean cargo.* International movement of property by water is subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 55305, and the implementing regulations found at 46 CFR part 381, which require the use of a U.S. flag carrier for at least 50% of the tonnage shipped by each department or agency when service is available (see 46 CFR 381.7). The Maritime Administration (MARAD) monitors agency compliance with these laws. All departments or agencies shipping Government-impelled cargo must comply with the reporting provisions of 46 CFR 381.3.
