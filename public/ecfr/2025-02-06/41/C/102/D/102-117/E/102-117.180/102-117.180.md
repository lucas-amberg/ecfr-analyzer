To ship freight: 


(a) By land (domestic shipments), use a bill of lading; 


(b) By land (international shipments), you may, but are not required to, use the optional GBL;


(c) By ocean, use an ocean bill of lading, when suitable, along with the GBL. You only need an ocean bill of lading for door-to-door movements; and 


(d) By air, use a bill of lading.
