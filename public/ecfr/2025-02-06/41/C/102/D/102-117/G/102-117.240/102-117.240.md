# ยง 102-117.240   What is my agency's financial responsibility to an employee who chooses to move all or part of their HHG under the commuted rate system?

(a) Your agency is responsible for reimbursing the employee what it would cost the Government to ship the employee's HHG by the most cost-effective means available or the employee's actual moving expenses, whichever is less. 


(b) The employee is liable for the additional cost when the cost of transportation arranged by the employee is more than what it would cost the Government.
