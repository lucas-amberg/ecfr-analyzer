(a) Each agency should develop an evaluation survey for the employee to complete following the move. 


(b) Under the CHAMP program, you must counsel employees to fill out their portion of the GSA Form 3080, Household Goods Carrier Evaluation Report. This form reports the quality of the TSP's performance. TSPs generate the GSA Form 3080 within GSA's Transportation Management Services Solution (TMSS) system and send the employee a link to complete the form.
