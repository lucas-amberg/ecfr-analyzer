(a) Agency performance measures are indicators of how you are supporting your customers and doing your job. By tracking performance measures you can report specific accomplishments and your success in supporting the agency mission. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (31 U.S.C. 1115) requires agencies to develop business plans and set up program performance measures. 


(b) Examples of performance measurements in transportation would include how well you: 


(1) Increase the use of electronic commerce; 


(2) Adopt industry best practices and services to meet your agency requirements; 


(3) Use TSPs with a track record of successful past performance or proven superior ability; 


(4) Take advantage of competition in moving agency freight and household goods; 


(5) Assure that delivery of freight and household goods is on time against measured criteria; and 


(6) Create simplified procedures to be responsive and adaptive to the customer needs and concerns.
