Generally, no executive agency may appear on its own behalf in any proceeding before a transportation regulatory body, unless the Administrator of General Services delegates the authority to the agency. The statutory authority for the Administrator of General Services to participate in regulatory proceedings on behalf of all Federal agencies is in section 201(a)(4) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 501(c)(1)(B)).
