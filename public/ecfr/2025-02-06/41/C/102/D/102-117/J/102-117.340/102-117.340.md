# ยง 102-117.340   What other types of assistance may GSA provide agencies in dealing with regulatory bodies?

(a) GSA has oversight of all public utilities used by the Federal Government including transportation. There are specific regulatory requirements a TSP must meet at the State level, such as the requirement to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity. 


(b) GSA has a list of TSPs, which meet certain criteria regarding insurance and safety, approved by DOT. You must furnish GSA with an affidavit to determine if the TSP meets the basic qualification to protect the Government's interest. As an oversight mandate, GSA coordinates this function.
