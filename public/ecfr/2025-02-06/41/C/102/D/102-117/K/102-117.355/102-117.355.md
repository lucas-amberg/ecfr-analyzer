(a) Reporting your agency's prior fiscal year transaction level transportation data for freight and cargo, including HHG, procured either through contract or tender, as well as your transportation management information will enable GSA to:


(1) Assess the magnitude and key characteristics of transportation within the Government (*e.g.,* how much agencies spend; what type of commodity is shipped; most used lanes, etc.); and


(2) Analyze and recommend changes to Governmentwide policies, standards, practices, and procedures to improve Government transportation management.


(b) Agencies that choose to report may identify opportunities within their organization to improve transportation management program performance as a result of the data analytics.
