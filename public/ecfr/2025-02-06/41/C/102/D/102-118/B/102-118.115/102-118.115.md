No. Your agency is required to use commercial payment practices to the maximum extent possible. Your agency may use a GBL as needed for domestic shipments and should use a GBL for international shipments. When used for shipments, a GBL is a receipt of goods, evidence of title, and a contract of carriage for Government shipments and was developed to protect the interest of the U.S. Government.
