# § 102-118.140   What are the major mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of GBLs and bills of lading?

The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of GBLs and bills of lading are: 


(a) Unless otherwise permitted by statute and approved by the agency, the TSP may not demand prepayment or collect charges from the consignee. The TSP, providing service under the bill of lading, must present a legible copy of the bill of lading or an original, properly certified GBL attached to Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, to the paying office for payment. An agency may choose not to require that an SF 1113 be attached to the bill of lading and invoice if the TSP submits invoices using the agency's approved third-party payment system (TPPS); 


(b) The shipment must be made at the restricted or limited valuation specified in the tariff or classification or limited contract, arrangement or exemption at or under which the lowest rate is available, unless indicated on the GBL or bill of lading. (This is commonly referred to as an alternation of rates); 


(c) Receipt for the shipment is subject to the consignee's annotation of loss, damage, or shrinkage on the delivering TSP's documents and the consignee's copy of the same documents. If loss or damage is discovered after delivery or receipt of the shipment, the consignee must promptly notify the nearest office of the last delivering TSP and extend to the TSP the privilege of examining the shipment; 


(d) The rules and conditions governing commercial shipments for the time period within which notice must be given to the TSP, or a claim must be filed, or suit must be instituted, shall not apply if the shipment is lost, damaged or undergoes shrinkage in transit. Only with the written concurrence of the Government official responsible for making the shipment is the deletion of this item considered to be valid;


(e) Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on the overcharges made and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982 31 U.S.C. 3717); and 


(f) Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part and the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation—Handbook.”
