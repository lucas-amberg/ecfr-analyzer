# ยง 102-118.50   How does my agency pay for transportation services?

Your agency may pay for transportation services in three ways: 

 


(a) *Electronic funds transfer (EFT).* Your agency is required by statute (31 U.S.C. 3332, *et seq.*) to make all payments by EFT unless your agency receives a waiver from the Department of the Treasury.




(b) *Check.* For those situations where EFT is not possible and the Department of the Treasury has issued a waiver, your agency may make payments by check. 


(c) *Cash.* In very unusual circumstances and as a last option, your agency payments may be made in cash in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations.
