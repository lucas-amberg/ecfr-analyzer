# ยง 102-118.80   Who is responsible for keeping my agency's electronic commerce transportation billing records?

Your agency's internal financial regulations will identify responsibility for recordkeeping. In addition, the GSA Transportation Audits Division keeps a central repository of electronic transportation billing records for legal and auditing purposes. Therefore, your agency must utilize the Transportation Audits Management System (TAMS) (*https://tams.gsa.gov*) to submit all relevant electronic transportation billing documents or submit via email to: *qmcatariffs@gsa.gov.*
