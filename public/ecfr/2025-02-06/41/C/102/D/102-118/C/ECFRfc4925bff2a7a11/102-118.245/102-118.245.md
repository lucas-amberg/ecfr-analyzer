# ยง 102-118.245   How does my agency get an assigned set of GBL or GTR numbers?

GSA no longer assigns numbers to GBLs or GTRs. Pursuant to ยง 102-118.55(g) you must establish administrative procedures including creating a unique numbering system to prevent and detect duplicate payments. These procedures should include agency assigned unique numbers for GBLs and GTRs.
