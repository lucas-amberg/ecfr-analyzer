# § 102-118.210   May my agency use bills of lading other than the GBL for a transportation shipment?

Yes, as long as the mandatory terms and conditions contained in this part (as also stated on a GBL) apply. The TSP must agree in writing to the mandatory terms and conditions (also found in the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation Handbook”) contained in this part.
