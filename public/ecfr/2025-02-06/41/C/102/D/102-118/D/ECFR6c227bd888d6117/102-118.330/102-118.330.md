# ยง 102-118.330   Does a transportation prepayment audit waiver change any liabilities of the certifying officer?

Yes, a certifying official is not personally liable for verifying transportation rates, freight classifications, or other information provided on a bill of lading or passenger transportation request when the Administrator of General Services or designee waives the prepayment audit requirement and your agency uses postpayment audits.
