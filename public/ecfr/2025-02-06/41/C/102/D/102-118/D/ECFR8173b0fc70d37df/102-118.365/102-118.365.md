# ยง 102-118.365   Can my agency renew an exemption from the transportation prepayment audit requirements?

It may be possible for your agency to be granted a prepayment audit exemption extension. Your agency must submit a request for the extension to GSA Transportation Audits Division at least six months in advance of the current exemption expiration.
