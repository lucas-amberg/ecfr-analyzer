# ยง 102-118.320   What action should my agency take if the agency's transportation prepayment audit program changes?

(a) If your agency's transportation prepayment audit program changes in any way to include changes in prepayment auditors, your agency must submit the CFO-approved revised transportation prepayment audit program to GSA Transportation Audits Division via email at *Audit.Policy@gsa.gov,* Subject line: Agency PPA-Revised.


(b) If GSA determines the agency's approved plan is insufficient, GSA will contact the agency CFO to inform of the prepayment audit program deficiencies and request corrective action and resubmission to GSA Transportation Audits Division.
