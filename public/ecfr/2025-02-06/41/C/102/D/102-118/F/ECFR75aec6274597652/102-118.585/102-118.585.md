# ยง 102-118.585   May a TSP appeal a prepayment audit decision of the CBCA?

No, a ruling by the CBCA is the final administrative remedy available and the TSP has no statutory right of appeal. This subpart governs administrative actions only and does not affect any of the TSP's rights. A TSP may still pursue a legal remedy through the courts.
