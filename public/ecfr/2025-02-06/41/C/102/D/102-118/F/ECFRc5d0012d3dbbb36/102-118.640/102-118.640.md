# § 102-118.640   If a TSP fails to pay or to appeal an overcharge, what actions will GSA pursue to collect the debt?

GSA will pursue debt collection through one of the following methods: 


(a) When an indebted TSP files a claim, GSA will apply all or any portion of the amount it determines to be due the TSP, to the outstanding balance owed by the TSP, under the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR chapter IX) and 41 CFR part 105-55; 


(b) When the action outlined in paragraph (a) of this section cannot be taken by GSA, GSA will instruct one or more Government disbursing offices to deduct the amount due to the agency from an unpaid TSP's bill. A 3-year limitation applies on the deduction of overcharges from amounts due a TSP (31 U.S.C. 3726); 


(c) When collection cannot be accomplished through either of the procedures in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, GSA normally sends two additional demand letters to the indebted TSP requesting payment of the amount due within a specified time. Lacking a satisfactory response, GSA may place a complete stop order against amounts otherwise payable to the indebted TSP by adding the name of that TSP to the Department of the Army “List of Contractors Indebted to the United States”; and/or 


(d) When collection actions, as stated in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are unsuccessful, GSA may report the debt to the Department of Justice for collection, litigation, and related proceedings, as prescribed in 31 CFR chapter IX.
