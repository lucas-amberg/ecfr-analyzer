# ยง 102-118.645   Can a TSP file a claim on collection actions?

Yes, a TSP may file a claim involving collection actions resulting from the transportation audit performed by the GSA directly with the GSA Transportation Audits Division. Any claims submitted to GSA will be subject to the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, *et seq.*). The TSP must file all other transportation claims with the agency out of whose activities they arose. If this is not feasible (*e.g.,* where the responsible agency cannot be determined or is no longer in existence) claims may be sent to the GSA Transportation Audits Division for forwarding to the responsible agency or for direct settlement by the GSA Transportation Audits Division. Submit claims using Transportation Audits Management System (TAMS) at *https://tams.gsa.gov* or via email to *protests@gsa.gov.*
