# ยง 102-118.660   May a TSP appeal a postpayment audit decision of the CBCA?

No, a ruling by the CBCA is the final administrative remedy and the TSP has no statutory right of appeal. This subpart governs administrative actions only and does not affect any rights of the TSPs. A TSP may still pursue a legal remedy through the courts.
