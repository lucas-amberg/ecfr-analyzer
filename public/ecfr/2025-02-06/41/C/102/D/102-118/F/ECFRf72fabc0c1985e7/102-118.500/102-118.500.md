# ยง 102-118.500   How does my agency handle a voluntary refund submitted by a TSP?

(a) An agency must report all voluntary refunds to the GSA Transportation Audits Division (so that no Notice of Overcharge or financial offset occurs), unless other arrangements are made (*e.g.,* charge card refunds, etc.). These reports must be sent via email to: *audit.policy@gsa.gov.*

(b) Once a Notice of Overcharge is issued by the GSA Transportation Audits Division, then any refund is no longer considered voluntary and the agency must forward the refund to the GSA Transportation Audits Division.
