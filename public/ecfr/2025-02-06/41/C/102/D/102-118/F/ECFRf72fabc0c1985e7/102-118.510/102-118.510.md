# ยง 102-118.510   Can my agency revise or alter a Certificate of Settlement?

Generally, no, an agency must not revise or alter amounts on a Certificate of Settlement. The only change an agency can make to a Certificate of Settlement is to change the agency financial data to a correct cite. Any Certificate of Settlement1 that cannot be paid (e.g., an amount previously paid), must be immediately returned to the GSA Transportation Audits Division with an explanation.
