# ยง 102-118.530   Will GSA instruct my agency's disbursing offices to offset unpaid TSP billings?

Yes, GSA will instruct one or more of your agency's disbursing offices to deduct the amount due from an unpaid TSP's bill. A 3-year limitation applies on the deduction of overcharges from amounts due a TSP (31 U.S.C. 3726). For ordinary debt there is no limitation on the period within which an offset may be initiated or taken (31 U.S.C. 3716).
