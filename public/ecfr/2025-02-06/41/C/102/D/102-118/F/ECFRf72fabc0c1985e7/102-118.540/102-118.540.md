# ยง 102-118.540   Who has the authority to audit and settle bills for all transportation services provided for my agency?

(a) The Administrator of GSA has the authority and responsibility to audit and settle all transportation bills. The number and types of bills audited shall be based on the Administrator's judgment (31 U.S.C. 3726(b)). The Administrator has authority to administratively adjudicate transportation claims which cannot be resolved by the agency procuring the transportation services, or the carrier or freight-forwarder presenting the bill pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726(c).


(b) The Administrator has delegated the responsibility set out in paragraph (a) of this section to the Director of the GSA Transportation Audits Division because the Director has access to Governmentwide data including TSP rates, agency paid TSP invoices, and transportation billings with the Government. Your agency must correctly pay individual transportation invoices (see 31 U.S.C. 3351(4), *Improper Payment* definition).
