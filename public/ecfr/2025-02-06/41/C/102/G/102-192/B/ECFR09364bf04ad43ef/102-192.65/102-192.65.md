# § 102-192.65   What features must our finance systems have to keep track of mail expenditures?

All agencies must have an accountable system for making postage payments; that is, a system that allocates postage expenses at the program level within the agency and makes program level managers accountable for obligating and tracking those expenses. The agency will have to determine the appropriate program level for this requirement because the level at which it is cost beneficial differs widely. The agency's finance systems should track all mail expenditures separately to the program level or below, and should—


(a) Show expenses for postage and all other mail expenditures, payments to service providers, etc., separate from all other administrative expenses;


(b) Allow mail centers to establish systems to charge their customers for mail expenditures; and


(c) Identify and charge the mail expenditures that are part of printing contracts down to the program level.
