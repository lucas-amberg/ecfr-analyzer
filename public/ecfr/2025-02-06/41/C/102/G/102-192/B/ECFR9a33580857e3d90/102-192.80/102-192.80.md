Agency mail managers must coordinate with their agency security service and/or the FPS or the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to develop agency mail security policies and plans. The FPS has developed standards for building construction and management, including standards for mail centers. At a minimum, the agency mail security plan must address the following topics:


(a) Risk assessment;


(b) A plan to protect staff and all other occupants of agency facilities from hazards that might be delivered in the mail;


(c) Operating procedures;


(d) A plan to provide a visible mail screening operation;


(e) Training mail center personnel;


(f) Testing and rehearsing responses to various emergency situations by agency personnel;


(g) Managing threats;


(h) Communications plan;


(i) Occupant Emergency Plan;


(j) Continuity of Operations Plan; and


(k) Annual reviews of the agency's security plan.
