The specialized or technical services provided under this part may be provided, in the discretion of the Administrator of General Services, only under the following conditions: 


(a) Such services will be provided only to the States, political subdivisions thereof, and combinations or associations of such governments or their agencies and instrumentalities.

In addition, in accordance with the policies set forth in Circular No. A-76, the requesting entity must certify that such services cannot be procured reasonably and expeditiously through ordinary business channels.
