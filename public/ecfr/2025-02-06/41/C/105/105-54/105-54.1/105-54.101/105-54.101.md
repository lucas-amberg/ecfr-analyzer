# ยง 105-54.101   Applicability.

This part 105-54 applies to all advisory committees for which GSA has responsibility. This part also applies to any committee that advises GSA officials even if the committee were not established for that purpose. This applicability, however, is limited to the period of the committee's use as an advisory body. This part does not apply to:


(a) An advisory committee exempted by an Act of Congress; 


(b) A local civic group whose primary function is to render a public service in connection with a Federal program; 


(c) A State or local committee, council, board, commission, or similar group established to advise or make recommendations to State or local officials or agencies; 


(d) A meeting initiated by the President or one or more Federal official(s) for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations from one individual; 


(e) A meeting with a group initiated by the President or one or more Federal official(s) for the sole purpose of exchanging facts or information; 


(f) A meeting initiated by a group with the President or one or more Federal official(s) for the purpose of expressing the group's views, provided that the President or Federal official(s) does not use the group recurrently as a preferred source of advice or recommendations; 


(g) A committee that is established to perform primarily operational as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those specifically provided by law, such as making or implementing Government decisions or policy. An operational committee would be covered by the Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature; 


(h) A meeting initiated by a Federal official(s) with more than one individual for the purpose of obtaining the advice of individual attendees and not for the purpose of utilizing the group to obtain consensus advice or recommendations. However, such a group would be covered by the Act when an agency accepts the group's deliberations as a source of consensus advice or recommendations; 


(i) A meeting of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee members convened solely to gather information or conduct research for a chartered advisory committee, to analyze relevant issues and facts, or to draft proposed position papers for deliberation by the advisory committee or a subcommittee of the advisory committee; and 


(j) A committee composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government.
