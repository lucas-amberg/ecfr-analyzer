Requests to inspect or copy these records are processed under 41 CFR 105-60.4. Except where prohibited by a contract entered into before January 5, 1973, copies of transcripts, if any, of committee meetings are made available by the Government chairperson or Designated Federal Officer to any person at the cost of duplication. After the committee's work ends, disposition of the committee documents and the release of information from them are made in accordance with Federal records, statutes, and regulations.

Where appropriate, the chairperson also files copies of background papers that consultants to the advisory committee prepare with the Library of Congress. The transmittal letter identifies the materials being furnished, with a copy of the transmittal provided to the GSA Committee Management Officer.
