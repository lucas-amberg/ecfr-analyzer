(3) The contract provides that the private collection contractor is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and 


(4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all amounts collected. 


(b) GSA will use Governmentwide debt collection contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection contractors.
