# ยง 105-60.301   Acknowledging FOIA requests.

(a) To the extent practicable, GSA shall communicate with requesters electronically via the FOIAonline web portal and/or email.


(b) Upon receipt of a request, GSA shall send requesters an acknowledgement letter within 2 business days containing a brief description of the records sought so requesters may more easily keep track of their requests.


(c) When a request is submitted via FOIAonline, the system automatically generates a tracking number, which allows for easy identification of each request. This tracking number shall be included in the acknowledgement letter.


(d) When GSA receives a request not directly entered by the requester into FOIAonline (*i.e.,* email, fax, standard mail, etc.) the FOIA Requester Service Center shall immediately upload the request into the FOIAonline system and it shall be assigned a tracking number that shall be communicated to the requester.
