# ยง 105-60.302   Responding to FOIA requests.

(a) GSA shall provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, GSA may provide an interim response, meaning the agency releases the records on a rolling basis as the records are located and verified.


(b) In determining which records are responsive to a request, the agency shall include only the records in its possession as of the date the agency receives the perfected FOIA request. If any other date is used, GSA shall inform the requester accordingly. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.


(c) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552, GSA is not required to perform the following in response to a FOIA request:


(1) Answer questions or interrogatories posed as FOIA requests;


(2) Issue guidance/or opinions;


(3) Analyze and/or interpret documents for a requester;


(4) Create records;


(5) Conduct research; or


(6) Initiate investigations.


(d) The GSA Administrator and GSA Chief FOIA Officer and/or their assigned delegates are authorized to grant or deny any requests for records or portions thereof that are generated, maintained, or controlled by GSA.
