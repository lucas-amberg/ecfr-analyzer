(a) GSA shall provide a submitter with 10 business days, within which the submitter shall respond to the notice referenced in ยง 105-60.600.

(e) GSA shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.


(f) Whenever GSA decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the agency shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:
