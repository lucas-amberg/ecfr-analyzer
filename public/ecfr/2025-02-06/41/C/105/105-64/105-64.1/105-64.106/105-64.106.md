# ยง 105-64.106   What is GSA's policy on information accuracy in a system of records?

System managers will ensure that all Privacy Act records are accurate, relevant, necessary, timely, and complete. All GSA systems are reviewed annually. Those systems that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are reviewed to ensure they are relevant, necessary, accurate, up-to-date, and covered by the appropriate legal or regulatory authority. A listing of GSA Privacy Act Systems can be found at the following link (*http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_BASIC&contentId = 21567*).
