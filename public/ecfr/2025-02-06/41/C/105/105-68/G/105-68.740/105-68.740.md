# ยง 105-68.740   Are suspension proceedings formal?

(a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base a final suspension decision. 


(b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.
