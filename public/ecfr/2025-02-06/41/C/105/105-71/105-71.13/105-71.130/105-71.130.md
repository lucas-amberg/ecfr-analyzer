# § 105-71.130   Changes.

(a) *General.* Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior written approval of the awarding agency.


(b) *Relation to cost principles.* The applicable cost principles (see § 105-71.122) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.


(c) *Budget changes*—(1) *Non-construction projects.* Except as stated in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following changes is anticipated under a non-construction award:


(i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional funding.


(ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.


(iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).


(2) *Construction projects.* Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the need for additional funds.


(3) *Combined construction and non-construction projects.* When a grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and non-construction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from non-construction to construction or vice versa.


(d) *Programmatic changes.* Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following actions is anticipated:


(1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project (regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring prior approval).


(2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.


(3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the project director or principal investigator shall always require approval unless waived by the awarding agency.


(4) Under non-construction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of § 105-71.136 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, supplies, and general support services.


(e) *Additional prior approval requirements.* The awarding agency may not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(f) *Requesting prior approval.* (1) A request for prior approval of any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used in its application and shall be accomplished by a narrative justification for the proposed revision.


(2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost principles (see § 105-71.122) may be made by letter.


(3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.
