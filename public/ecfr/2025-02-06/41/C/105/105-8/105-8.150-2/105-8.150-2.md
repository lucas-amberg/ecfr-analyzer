# § 105-8.150-2   Methods.

(a) *General.* The agency may comply with the requirements of § 105-8.150 through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.


(b) *Historic preservation programs.* In meeting the requirements of § 105-8.105-1 in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to a historic property is not required because of § 105-8.105-1(b) or § 105-8.154 alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include— 


(1) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of a historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible; 


(2) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or 


(3) Adopting other innovative methods.
