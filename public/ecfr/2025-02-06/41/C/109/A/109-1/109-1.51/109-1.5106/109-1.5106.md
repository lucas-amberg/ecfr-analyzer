# ยง 109-1.5106   Segregation of personal property.

Generally, contractor-owned personal property shall be segregated from Government personal property. Commingling of Government and contractor-owned personal property may be allowed only when:


(a) The segregation of the property would materially hinder the progress of the work (*i.e.,* segregation is not feasible for reasons such as small quantities, lack of space, or increased costs); and


(b) Control procedures are adequate (*i.e.,* the Government property is specifically marked or otherwise identified as Government property).
