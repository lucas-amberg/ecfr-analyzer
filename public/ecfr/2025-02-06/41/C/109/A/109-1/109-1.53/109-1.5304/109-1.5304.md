(2) The projected stability of DOE and designated contractor operations; and


(3) The degree of confidence in the property control measures available at disposition.


(b) Certain transfers, sales, or other offerings of high risk personal property may require special conditions or specific restrictions as determined necessary by the property custodian or cognizant program office.


(c) Requests for deviations from the requirements of this subpart may be made through the cognizant PSO to the Office of Management.
