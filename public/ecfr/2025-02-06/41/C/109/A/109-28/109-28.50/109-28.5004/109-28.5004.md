Procedures shall provide for the following:


(a) The original decision to classify and retain equipment as EHFFP shall be justified in writing, providing sufficient detail to support the need for retention of the equipment. This justification will cite the project for which retained, the potential use to be made of the equipment, or other reasons for retention.


(b) The validity of the initial classification EHFFP shall be reviewed by management at a level above that of the individual making the initial determination.


(c) Retention of equipment as EHFFP must be rejustified annually to ensure that original justifications remain valid. The rejustifications will contain sufficient detail to support retention.


(d) When equipment is retained as EHFFP for longer than one year, the annual rejustification shall be reviewed at a level of management at least two levels above that of the individual making the determination to retain the EHFFP. Equipment retained as EHFFP for longer than three years should be approved by the head of the DOE field organization.
