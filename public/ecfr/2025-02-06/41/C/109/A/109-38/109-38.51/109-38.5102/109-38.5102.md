# ยง 109-38.5102   Utilization controls and practices.

Controls and practices to be used by DOE organizations and designated contractors for achieving maximum economical utilization of motor equipment shall include, but not be limited to:


(a) The maximum use of motor equipment pools, taxicabs, shuttle buses, or other common service arrangements;


(b) The minimum, practicable assignment of motor equipment to individuals, groups, or specific organizational components;


(c) The maintenance of individual motor equipment use records, such as trip tickets or vehicle logs, or hours of use, as appropriate, showing sufficiently detailed information to evaluate appropriateness of assignment and adequacy of use being made. If one-time use of a motor vehicle is involved, such as assignments from motor pools, the individual's trip records must, as a minimum, identify the motor vehicle and show the name of the operator, dates, destination, time of departure and return, and mileage;


(d) The rotation of motor vehicles between high and low mileage assignments where practicable to maintain the fleet in the best overall replacement age and mileage balance and operating economy;


(e) The charging, if considered feasible, to the user organization for the cost of operating and maintaining motor vehicles assigned to groups or organizational components. These charge-back costs should include all direct and indirect costs of the motor vehicle fleet operation as determined by the field organization and contractor finance and accounting functions;


(f) The use of dual-purpose motor vehicles capable of hauling both personnel and light cargo whenever appropriate to avoid the need for two motor vehicles when one can serve both purposes. However, truck-type or van vehicles shall not be acquired for passenger use merely to avoid statutory limitations on the number of passenger motor vehicles which may be acquired;


(g) The use of motor scooters and motorcycles in place of higher cost motor vehicles for certain applications within plant areas, such as mail and messenger service and small parts and tool delivery. Their advantage, however, should be weighed carefully from the standpoint of overall economy (comparison with cost for other types of motor vehicles) and increased safety hazards, particularly when mingled with other motor vehicle traffic; and


(h) The use of electric vehicles for certain applications. The use of these vehicles is encouraged wherever it is feasible to use them to further the goal of fuel conservation.
