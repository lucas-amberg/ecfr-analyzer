# ยง 109-38.5105   Motor vehicle local use objectives.

(a) Individual motor vehicle utilization cannot always be measured or evaluated strictly on the basis of miles operated or against any Department-wide mileage standard. For example, light trucks specifically fitted for use by a plumber, welder, etc., in the performance of daily work assignments, would have uniquely tailored use objectives, different from those set forth for a truck used for general purposes. Accordingly, efficient local use objectives, which represent practical units of measurement for motor vehicle utilization and for planning and evaluating future motor vehicle requirements, must be established and documented by the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager. The objectives should take into consideration past performance, future requirements, geographical disbursement, and special operating requirements.


(b) These objectives shall be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, but not less often than annually, by the motor equipment fleet manager. The reviews shall be documented. The Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager is responsible for reviewing and approving in writing all proposed local use objectives.
