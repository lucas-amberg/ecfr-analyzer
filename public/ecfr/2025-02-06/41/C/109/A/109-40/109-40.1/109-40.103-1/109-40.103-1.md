# ยง 109-40.103-1   Domestic transportation.

(a) Preferential treatment, normally, shall not be accorded to any mode of transportation (motor, rail, air, water) or to any particular carrier when arranging for domestic transportation services. However where, for valid reasons, a particular mode of transportation or a particular carrier within that mode must be used to meet specific program requirements and/or limitations, only that mode or carrier shall be considered. Examples of valid reasons for considering only a particular mode or carrier are:


(1) Where only a certain mode of transportation or individual carrier is able to provide the needed service or is able to meet the required delivery date; and


(2) Where the consignee's installation and related facilities preclude or are not conducive to service by all modes of transportation.


(b) The following factors are considered in determining whether a carrier or mode of transportation can meet DOE's transportation service requirements for each individual shipment:


(1) Availability and suitability of carrier equipment;


(2) Carrier terminal facilities at origin and destination;


(3) Pickup and delivery service, if required;


(4) Availability of required or accessorial and special services, if needed;


(5) Estimated time in transit;


(6) Record of past performance of the carrier; and


(7) Availability and suitability of transit privileges.
