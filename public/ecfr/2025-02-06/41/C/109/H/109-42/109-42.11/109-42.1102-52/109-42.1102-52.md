# ยง 109-42.1102-52   Low level contaminated personal property.

If monitoring of suspect personal property indicates that contamination does not exceed applicable standards, it may be utilized and disposed of in the same manner as uncontaminated personal property, provided the guidance in ยง 109-45.5005-1(a) of this chapter has been considered. However, recipients shall be advised where levels of radioactive contamination require specific controls for shipment as provided in Department of Transportation Regulations (49 CFR parts 171-179) for shipment of radioactive personal property. In addition, when any contaminated personal property is screened within DOE, reported to GSA, or otherwise disposed of, the kind and degree of contamination must be plainly indicated on all pertinent documents.
