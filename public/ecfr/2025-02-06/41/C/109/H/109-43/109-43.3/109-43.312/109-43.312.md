# ยง 109-43.312   Use of excess personal property on cost-reimbursement contracts.

(a) [Reserved]


(b) It is DOE policy for designated contractors to use Government excess personal property to the maximum extent possible to reduce contract costs. However, the determination required in 41 CFR 101-43.312(b) does not apply to such contracts, and a DOE official is not required to execute transfer orders for authorized designated contractors. The procedures prescribed in 41 CFR 101-43.309-5 for execution of transfer orders apply.
