# ยง 109-50.403   Need to establish DOE program benefit.

When approval for a proposed programmatic disposal of DOE personal property in a mixed facility is being sought, it must be established that the disposal will benefit a DOE program. For example, approval might be contingent on showing that:


(a) The entry of the contractor as a private concern into the energy program is important and significant from a programmatic standpoint; and


(b) The sale of property to the contractor will remove obstacles which otherwise discourage entry into the field.
