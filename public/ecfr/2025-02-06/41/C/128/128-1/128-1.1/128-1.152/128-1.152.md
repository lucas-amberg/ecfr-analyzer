# § 128-1.152   Citation.

The JPMR will be cited in accordance with the _Federal Register_ standards applicable to the FPMR. Accordingly, when this section is referred to formally in official documents, it should be cited as “41 CFR 128-1.152.” When a section of the JPMR is referred to informally, however, it may be identified simply by “JPMR” followed by the complete paragraph reference number, e.g., “JPMR 128-1.152.”
