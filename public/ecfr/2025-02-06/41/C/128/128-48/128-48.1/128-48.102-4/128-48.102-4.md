(b) Reimbursement for official use by the finding bureau or transfer for official use of abandoned or other unclaimed property that has been placed in a special fund by the bureau for more than three years shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts, or in such other bureau accounts as provided by law.
