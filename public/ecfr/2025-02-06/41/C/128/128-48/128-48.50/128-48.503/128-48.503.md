(a) Claims shall be sworn and shall include the following information in clear and concise terms:


(1) A complete description of the property including serial numbers, if any.


(2) The interest of the claimant in the property, as owner, mortgagee, or otherwise, to be supported by bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, or other satisfactory documentary evidence.


(3) The facts and circumstances, to be established by satisfactory proof, relied upon by the claimant to justify the granting of the claim.


(b) If the claim is filed before title has vested in the United States, the determining official shall not grant the claim for the abandoned or other unclaimed property unless the claimant establishes a valid, good faith interest in the property.


(c) If the claim is filed after title has vested in the United States, the determining official shall not grant the claim for abandoned or other unclaimed property unless the claimant:


(1) Establishes that he would have a valid, good faith interest in the property had not title vested in the United States; and


(2) Establishes that he had no actual or constructive notice, prior to the vesting of title in the United States, that the property was in the custody of a bureau and that title, after the appropriate time period, would vest in the United States. A claimant shall be presumed to have constructive notice upon publication in a suitable medium concerning the property unless he was in such circumstances as to prevent him from knowing of the status of the property or having the opportunity to see the notice.
