*Accompanied baggage*—Government property and personal property of the traveler necessary for official travel.


*Actual expense*—Payment of authorized actual expenses incurred, up to the limit prescribed by the Administrator of GSA or agency, as appropriate. Entitlement to reimbursement is contingent upon entitlement to per diem, and is subject to the same definitions and rules governing per diem. 


*Agency*—For purposes of chapter 302 *agency* means: 


(1) An executive agency as defined in Title 5 U.S.C. 105 (an executive department, an independent establishment, the Government Accountability Office, or a wholly owned Government corporation as defined in section 101 of the Government Corporation Control Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. 9101), but excluding a Government controlled corporation); 


(2) A military department; 


(3) A court of the United States; 


(4) The Administrative Office of the United States Courts;

*Aircraft management office*—An agency component that has management control of Federal aircraft used by the agency or of aircraft hired as commercial aviation services (CAS).


*Amended value sale*—Type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating employee receives a bona fide offer from a qualified buyer before the employee has accepted an appraised value offer from the relocation services company (RSC). The RSC amends its offer to match the outside sale price. An amended value sale is different from an amended from zero sale because an amended value sale occurs after an appraised value offer while an amended from zero sale occurs before an appraised value offer.


*Appraised value sale*—Type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating employee accepts the offer from the RSC to buy the employee's home based upon the average of a specific number of appraisals conducted by designated certified appraisers.


*Approved accommodation*—Any place of public lodging that is listed on the national master list of approved accommodations. The national master list of all approved accommodations is compiled, periodically updated, and published in the _Federal Register_ by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

*Buyer value option (BVO)*—Type of home sale program with procedures the same as the amended value program, except that the RSC does not initially appraise the employee's home or make a guaranteed buy-out offer. The buy-out offer from the contractor is based on a bona fide offer received by the employee from a qualified buyer after marketing by the employee. Once a bona fide offer is received by the employee, the contractor offers to buy the home from the employee at a price based on the outside sale price.




*Coach class*—The class of accommodation that is normally the lowest class of fare offered by common carriers regardless of terminology used. For reference purposes only, coach class may also be referred to as tourist class, economy class, steerage, or standard class.




*Coach class seating upgrade programs*—Under commercial air transportation seating upgrade programs, a passenger may obtain a preferable seat choice or increased amenities or services within the coach class seating area. These upgraded choices are generally available for a fee, as a program membership benefit (such as frequent flyer) or at an airport kiosk or gate. Coach class seating upgrade options are not considered a new or higher class of accommodation from coach as the seat is lower than other than coach class accommodations in terms of cost and amenities (*e.g.,* seating girth and pitch, priority boarding, luggage allowance, expedited food/drink service).






*Commercial Aviation Services (CAS)*—Commercial aviation services (CAS) include, for the exclusive use of an executive agency—

*Contract carriers*—U.S. certificated air carriers which are under contract with the government to furnish Federal employees and other persons authorized to travel at Government expense with passenger transportation service. This also includes GSA's scheduled airline passenger service between selected U.S. cities/airports and between selected U.S. and international cities/airports at reduced fares.




*Contract City Pair Program*—A mandatory use (see § 301-10.110 for required users) Government program that provides commercially available scheduled air passenger transportation services to persons authorized to travel directly at the Government's expense. The City Pair Program offers negotiated firm-fixed-price fares on one-way routes between airports that apply in either direction of travel. Fares may be issued using one of the following fare types, or others that the contract City Pair Program may solicit:




(1) *Capacity-controlled coach class contract fare* (_CA)—A contract City Pair Program coach class fare that is less expensive than the unrestricted contract City Pair Program coach class fare (YCA), but has limited inventory availability, meaning, once the flight reaches a certain capacity, _CA fares may no longer be available for booking. Unlike YCA fares, _CA fares are restricted by the availability of seats. Accordingly, early booking may increase the likelihood of booking a _CA fare. The first character of the three-character fare basis code varies by airline.




(2) *Unrestricted coach class contract fare* (YCA)—A contract City Pair Program coach class fare that is more expensive than a _CA fare, but offers last seat (inventory) availability (unless a flight is already sold out), meaning, as long as coach class inventory is available to sell on the flight, the Government traveler can purchase it.




(3) *Contract business fare* (_CB)—Contract fare offered by carriers in some domestic and international line item markets for business class service. The first character of the three-character fare basis code varies by airline.

If a crewmember is onboard for the purpose of travel, (*i.e.,* being transported from point to point) that crewmember must be authorized to travel in accordance with rules in 41 CFR 301-10.260 through 301-10.266 and 41 CFR 301-70.800 through 301-70.903.

(8) Are willing to certify, if required by the agency, that they understand that willful falsification of any documentation required to establish that an individual is in a domestic partnership may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification, as well as constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001, and that the method for securing such certification, if required, shall be determined by the agency; 


(9) Are willing promptly to disclose, if required by the agency, any dissolution or material change in the status of the domestic partnership; and

(b) *Limited open.* An authorization allowing an employee to travel on official business without further authorization under certain specific conditions, *i.e.,* travel to specific geographic area(s) for specific purpose(s), subject to trip cost ceilings, or for specific periods of time.


(c) *Trip-by-trip.* An authorization allowing an individual or group of individuals to take one or more specific official business trips, which must include specific purpose, itinerary, and estimated costs.


*Travel claim (Voucher)*—A written request, supported by documentation and receipts where applicable, for reimbursement of expenses incurred in the performance of official travel, including permanent change of station (PCS) travel.

A TMS may include a travel management center (TMC), Commercial Ticket Office (CTO), an electronically available system, other commercial methods of arranging travel, or an in-house system.
