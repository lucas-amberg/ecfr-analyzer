# ยง 300-70.101   What information must we report on the use of first class and business class transportation accommodations?

GSA issues FTR bulletins that inform you of the required information and reporting format(s) for each trip where you paid for at least one segment of first class or business class transportation accommodations that were more expensive than coach class accommodations for the same itinerary. FTR bulletins are updated as necessary and available at *https://www.gsa.gov/ftrbulletins.*
