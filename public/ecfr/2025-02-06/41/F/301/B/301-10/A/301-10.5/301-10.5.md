(a) *Common carrier.* Travel by common carrier is presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation and must be used when reasonably available.


(b) * Government-furnished automobile.* When your agency determines that your travel must be performed by automobile, a Government-furnished automobile is presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation.


(c) *Rental car.* If no Government-furnished automobile is available, but your agency has determined that travel must be performed by automobile, then a rental car should be authorized.


(d) *Privately Owned Vehicle (POV).* POVs should be determined to be the most advantageous method of transportation only after your agency evaluates the use of a common carrier, a Government-furnished automobile, and a rental car.
