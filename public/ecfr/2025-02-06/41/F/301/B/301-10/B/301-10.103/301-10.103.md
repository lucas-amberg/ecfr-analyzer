# § 301-10.103   When may I use other than coach class accommodations?

You are required to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business when making official travel arrangements. Therefore, you are required to use the least expensive class of accommodations necessary to meet your needs and accomplish the agency's mission. You may use the lowest other than coach class accommodations only when your agency specifically authorizes or approves such use as specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section.


(a) Your agency may authorize or approve premium economy class accommodations when:


(1) Required to accommodate a medical disability or other special need;


(i) A medical disability must be certified annually in a written statement by a competent medical authority. However, if the disability is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required. Certification statements must include at a minimum:


(A) A written statement by a competent medical authority stating that special accommodation is necessary;


(B) An approximate duration of the special accommodation; and


(C) A recommendation as to the suitable class of transportation accommodations based on the medical disability.


(ii) A special need must be certified annually in writing according to your agency's procedures. However, if the special need is a lifelong condition, then a one-time certification statement is required;


(iii) If you are authorized under § 301-13.3(a) of this subchapter to have an attendant accompany you, your agency may also authorize the attendant to use premium economy class accommodations if you require the attendant's services en route;


(2) Exceptional security circumstances, as determined by your agency, require premium economy class accommodations;


(3) Coach class accommodations on an authorized foreign carrier do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards;


(4) Regularly scheduled service between origin and destination points, including connecting points, provide only other than coach class accommodations and you certify such on your voucher;


(5) Your common carrier costs are paid in full through agency acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source in accordance with chapter 304 of this title;


(6) Your origin and/or destination is/are OCONUS and your scheduled flight time, including stopovers and change of planes, is in excess of eight hours;


(7) The use results in an overall cost savings to the Government by avoiding additional subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive time while awaiting coach class accommodations;


(8) No space is available in coach class accommodations that allows you to arrive in time to accomplish the mission, which is urgent and cannot be postponed; or


(9) Required because of agency mission, consistent with your agency's internal procedures pursuant to § 301-70.102(i).


(b) Your agency may authorize or approve business class accommodations under paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) and (7) through (9) of this section, or when:


(1) Your origin and/or destination are OCONUS;


(2) Your scheduled flight time, including stopovers and change of planes, is more than 14 hours;


(3) You are required to report to duty the following day or sooner; and


(4) Your agency has determined business class accommodations are more advantageous than authorizing a rest period en route or at your destination pursuant to § 301-11.20.


(c) Your agency may authorize or approve first class accommodations under paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (9) of this section, or when no coach class, premium economy class, or business class accommodations are reasonably available. “Reasonably available” means available on a common carrier that is scheduled to leave within 24 hours of your proposed departure time, or scheduled to arrive within 24 hours of your proposed arrival time.
