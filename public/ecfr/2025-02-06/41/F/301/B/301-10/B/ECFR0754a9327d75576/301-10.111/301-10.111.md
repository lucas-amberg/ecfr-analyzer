# ยง 301-10.111   Are there any exceptions to the use of a contract City Pair Program fare?

Yes, your agency may authorize use of a non-contract fare when:


(a) There are no accommodations available on any scheduled contract City Pair Program flight arriving to your destination in time to accomplish the purpose of your travel or use of contract service would require you to incur unnecessary overnight lodging costs which would increase the total cost of the trip;


(b) The contractor's flight schedule is inconsistent with explicit policies of your Federal department or agency with regard to scheduling travel during normal working hours;


(c) A non-contract carrier offers a lower fare to the general public that, if used, will result in a lower total trip cost to the Government (the combined costs of transportation, lodging, meals, and related expenses considered); or


(d) Cost effective rail transportation is available and is consistent with mission requirements.
