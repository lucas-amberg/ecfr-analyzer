# ยง 301-10.120   What must I do when different airlines furnish the same service at different fares?

When there is no contract City Pair Program fare and other carriers furnish the same service at different fares between the same points for the same type of accommodations, you must use the lowest cost service unless your agency determines that the use of higher cost service is more advantageous to the Government.
