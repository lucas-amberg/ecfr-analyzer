# ยง 301-10.123   May I keep compensation an airline gives me for voluntarily vacating my seat on my scheduled airline flight when the airline asks for volunteers?

(a) Yes, you may keep airline compensation if:


(1) Voluntarily vacating your seat will not interfere with performing your official duties; and


(2) Additional travel expenses, incurred as a result of vacating your seat, are borne by you and are not reimbursed by the Government.


(b) If volunteering delays your travel during duty hours, your agency will charge you with annual leave for the additional hours.
