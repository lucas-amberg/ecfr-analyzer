# ยง 301-10.305   How is reimbursement handled if another person(s) travels in a POV with me?

If another employee(s) travels with you on the same trip in the same POV, mileage is payable to only one of you. No deduction will be made from your mileage allowance if other passengers contribute to defraying your expenses.
