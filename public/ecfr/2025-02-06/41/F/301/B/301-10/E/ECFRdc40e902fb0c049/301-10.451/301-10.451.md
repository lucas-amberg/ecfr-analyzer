# § 301-10.451   May I be reimbursed for the cost of collision damage waiver (CDW) or theft insurance?

(a) *General rule—no.* You will not be reimbursed for CDW or theft insurance for travel within CONUS for the following reasons:


(1) The Government is a self-insurer.


(2) Rental vehicles available under agreement(s) with the Government includes full coverage insurance for damages resulting from an accident while performing official travel.


(3) Any deductible amount paid by you may be reimbursed directly to you or directly to the rental agency if the damage occurred while you were performing official business.


(b) *Exception.* You will be reimbursed for CDW or theft insurance, or both, when you travel OCONUS and such insurance is necessary because the rental or leasing agency requirements, foreign statute, or legal procedures could cause extreme difficulty for an employee involved in an accident.
