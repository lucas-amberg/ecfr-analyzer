# § 301-11.11   How do I select lodging and make lodging reservations?

(a) You must make your lodging reservations through your agency's travel management service.


(b) You should always stay in a “fire safe” facility. This is a facility that meets the fire safety requirements of the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (the Act), as amended (*see* 5 U.S.C. 5707a).


(c) When selecting a commercial lodging facility, first consideration should be given to government lodging agreement programs such as FedRooms® (*https://www.fedrooms.com*). The advantages of obtaining lodging using the FedRooms® program are:


(1) Lodging rates are set at or below per diem rates;


(2) There are no add-on fees;


(3) The room cancellation deadline is 4 p.m. (or later) on the day of arrival;


(4) Most hotels offer last standard room availability rates;


(5) There are no early departure fees; and


(6) Rates are available using all booking channels (e.g., E-Gov Travel Service, Travel Management Service, FedRooms® Web site, and hotel reservation call centers). The FedRooms® rate code (XVU) must be entered to get the program benefits.
