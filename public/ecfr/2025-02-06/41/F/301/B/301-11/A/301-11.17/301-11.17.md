# ยง 301-11.17   If my agency authorizes per diem reimbursement, will it reduce my M&IE allowance for a meal(s) provided by a common carrier or for a complimentary meal(s) provided by a hotel/motel?

No. A meal provided by a common carrier or a complimentary meal provided by a hotel/motel does not affect your per diem.
