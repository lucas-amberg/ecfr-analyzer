# ยง 301-11.3   Must my agency pay an allowance (either a per diem allowance or actual expense)?

Yes, unless:


(a) You perform travel to a training event under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4101-4118), and you agree not to be paid per diem expenses; or


(b) You perform pre-employment interview travel, and the interviewing agency does not authorize payment of per diem expenses.
