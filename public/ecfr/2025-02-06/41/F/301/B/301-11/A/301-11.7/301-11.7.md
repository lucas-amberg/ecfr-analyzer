# ยง 301-11.7   What determines my maximum per diem reimbursement rate?

Your TDY location determines your maximum per diem reimbursement rate. If you arrive at your lodging facility after 12 midnight, you claim lodging cost for the preceding calendar day. If no lodging is required, the applicable M&IE reimbursement rate is the rate for the TDY location. (See ยง 301-11.102.)
