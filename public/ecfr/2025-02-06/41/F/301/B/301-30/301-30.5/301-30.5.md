# ยง 301-30.5   Are there any limitations to the payment of these expenses?

Expenses are not payable when:


(a) Confined to:


(1) A medical facility within the proximity of your official station.


(2) The same medical facility you would have been admitted to if your incapacitating illness or injury occurred at your official station.


(b) The Government provides or reimburses you for hospitalization under any Federal statute (including hospitalization in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical center or military hospital). However, per diem expenses are payable if your hospitalization is paid under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (5 U.S.C. 8901-8913).
