# ยง 301-50.4   May I be granted an exception to the required use of TMS or ETS?

Yes, your agency head or their designee may grant an individual case exception to required use of your agency's TMS or to required use of ETS, but only when your travel meets one of the following conditions:


(a) Such use would result in an unreasonable burden on mission accomplishment (*e.g.,* emergency travel is involved and TMS or ETS is not accessible; you are performing invitational travel; or you have special needs or require disability accommodations under part 301-13 of this chapter).


(b) Such use would compromise a national security interest.


(c) Such use might endanger your life (*e.g.,* you are traveling under the Federal witness protection program, or you are a threatened law enforcement or investigative officer traveling under part 301-31 of this chapter).


(d) Such use is prevented due to extenuating circumstances (see ยง 301-50.6).
