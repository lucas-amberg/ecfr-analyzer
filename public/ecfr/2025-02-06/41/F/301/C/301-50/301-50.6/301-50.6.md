# ยง 301-50.6   Am I required to use the OBT offered by ETS?

Yes, you are required to use the OBT offered by ETS, or your agency's TMS (if an exception to ETS use is granted), unless extenuating circumstances prevent such use. Some extenuating circumstances for which you may not be able to use an OBT are:


(a) When you are attending a conference where the conference sponsor has negotiated with one or more lodging facilities to set aside a specific number of rooms for conference attendees and to ensure that a set aside room is available to you, you are required to book lodging directly with the lodging facility;


(b) When your travel is to a remote location and it is not possible to book lodging accommodations through the TMS or ETS; or


(c) When such travel arrangements are so complex and circumstances will not allow you to book your travel through an OBT.
