# ยง 301-53.6   Is a denied boarding benefit considered a promotional item for which I may retain compensation received from an airline whether voluntary or involuntary?

A denied boarding benefit (e.g., cash, free ticket coupon) is not a promotional item given by an airline. See the provisions of ยง 301-10.122 of this chapter when an airline denies you a seat (involuntary) and ยง 301-10.123 of this chapter when you vacate your seat (voluntary).
