# ยง 301-54.100   Are there any due process requirements with which my agency must comply before collecting undisputed delinquent amounts on behalf of the charge card contractor?

Yes, your agency must: 


(a) Provide you with written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention to collect the claim by deduction from your disposable pay, and an explanation of your rights as a debtor; 


(b) Give you the opportunity to inspect and copy their records related to the claim; 


(c) Allow an opportunity for a review within the agency of its decision to collect the amount; and 


(d) Provide you with an opportunity to make a written agreement with the contractor to repay the delinquent amount of the claim.
