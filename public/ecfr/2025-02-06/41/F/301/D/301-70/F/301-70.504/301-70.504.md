# ยง 301-70.504   When the employee is able to travel, should we continue the use of the existing travel authorization?

Not if the interrupted trip was authorized under a trip by trip authorization. If, when the employee's health has been restored, the agency decides that it is in the Government's interest to return the employee to the TDY location, such return is considered to be a new travel assignment at Government expense. An interrupted trip authorized under an open or limited open authorization may be continued without further authorization.
