# ยง 301-70.601   What factors should we consider in determining whether to authorize payment of transportation and subsistence expenses for threatened law enforcement/investigative employees?

You should consider:


(a) *The degree and seriousness of the threat.* You should pay transportation and subsistence expenses only if a situation poses a legitimate serious threat to life.


(b) *The option of relocating the employee.* You should consider whether relocating the employee permanently would be advantageous given the specific nature of the threat, the continued disruption of the family, and the alternative costs of a change of official station.
