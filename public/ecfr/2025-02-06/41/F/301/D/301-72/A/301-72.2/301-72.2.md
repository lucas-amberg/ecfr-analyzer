# ยง 301-72.2   May we utilize methods of transportation other than common carrier (e.g., POVs, chartered vehicles, etc.)?

Yes, but only when use of common carrier transportation:


(a) Would interfere with the performance of official business;


(b) Would impose an undue hardship upon the traveler; or


(c) When the total cost by common carrier would exceed the cost of the other method of transportation.
