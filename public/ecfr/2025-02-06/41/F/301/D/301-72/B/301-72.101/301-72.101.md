# ยง 301-72.101   What information should we provide an employee before authorizing the use of common carrier transportation?

You should provide the employee:


(a) Notice that the employee is accountable for all tickets, GTRs and other transportation documents;


(b) Your procedures for the control and accounting of common carrier transportation documents, including the procedures for submitting unused, partially used, downgraded/exchanged tickets, refund receipts or ticket refund applications, and denied boarding compensation; and


(c) A credit/refund address so the carrier can credit/refund the agency for unused tickets (when the tickets have been issued using an agency centrally billed account or by GTR).
