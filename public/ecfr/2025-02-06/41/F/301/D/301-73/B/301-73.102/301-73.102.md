# ยง 301-73.102   May we grant a traveler an exception from required use of TMS or ETS?

(a) Yes, your agency head or their designee may grant an individual case by case exception to required use of your agency's TMS or to required use of ETS, but only when travel meets one of the following conditions:


(1) Such use would result in an unreasonable burden on mission accomplishment (*e.g.,* emergency travel is involved and TMS or ETS is not accessible; the traveler is performing invitational travel; or the traveler has special needs or requires disability accommodations in accordance with part 301-13 of this chapter).


(2) Such use would compromise a national security interest.


(3) Such use might endanger the traveler's life (*e.g.,* the individual is traveling under the Federal witness protection program, or is a threatened law enforcement or investigative officer traveling under part 301-31 of this chapter).


(4) Such use is prevented due to extenuating circumstances (see ยง 301-50.6 of this chapter).


(b) Any exception granted must be consistent with any contractual terms applicable to your TMS or ETS, and must not cause a breach of contract terms.
