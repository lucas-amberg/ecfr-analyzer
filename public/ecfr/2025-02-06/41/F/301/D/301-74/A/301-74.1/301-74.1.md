# § 301-74.1   What policies must we follow in planning a conference?

When planning a conference, you must:


(a) Minimize all conference costs, including administrative costs, conference attendees' travel costs, and conference attendees' time costs;


(b) Maximize the use of Government-owned or Government provided conference facilities as much as possible;


(c) Identify opportunities to reduce costs in selecting a particular conference location and facility (e.g., through the availability of lower rates during the off-season at a site with seasonal rates); and


(d) Ensure that the conference planner or designee does not retain for personal use any promotional benefits or materials received from a travel service provider as a result of booking the conference (*see* §§ 301-53.2 and 301-53.3 of this chapter); and


(e) Develop and establish internal policies to ensure these standards are met.
