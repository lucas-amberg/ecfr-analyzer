# ยง 302-2.103   How must we administer the authorization for relocation of an employee?

To administer the authorization for relocation of an employee, you must: 


(a) Issue an employee a TA for relocation before the employee transfers to a new official station;


(b) Inform the employee of the transfer within a timeframe that will provide the employee sufficient time for preparation;








(c) Establish timeframes on when employees must submit a TA request; 


(d) Provide new employees with the applicable limitations of their travel benefits; and


(e) Provide counseling about relocation benefits to all relocating employees. In addition, you should offer counseling as early as possible during the relocation process and you should consider offering counseling to employees who are contemplating acceptance of a job that would require them to relocate.
