# ยง 302-3.215   Will I be reimbursed for tour renewal travel from a post of duty in Hawaii and return to a post of duty in Alaska or for such travel from a post of duty in Alaska and return to a post of duty in Hawaii?

No, you will not be reimbursed for tour renewal travel unless your return travel is to a post of duty in the same State that you traveled from.
