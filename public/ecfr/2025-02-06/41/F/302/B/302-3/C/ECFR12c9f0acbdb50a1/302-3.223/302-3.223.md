If you fail to complete your period of service under your new service agreement for reasons that are not acceptable to your agency, you must pay the Government: 


(a) All transportation and per diem expenses that you received during your service agreement period for tour renewal travel of you and your immediate family; 


(b) Transportation expenses for family members who traveled directly from your former post of duty to your current post of duty; and 


(c) All transportation expenses for shipment of household goods from your former post to your current post of duty.
