# ยง 302-3.311   May I receive reimbursement for travel and transportation from an alternate location other than the duty station?

You will only be reimbursed for expenses up to the cost of travel and transportation expenses from your authorized official station to the place in the U.S. you have elected to reside. Any additional cost you will have to pay.
