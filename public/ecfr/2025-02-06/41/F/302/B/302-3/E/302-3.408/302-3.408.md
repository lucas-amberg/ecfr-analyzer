# ยง 302-3.408   What is the effect on my TCS reimbursement if my assignment lasts more than 30 months?

If your assignment exceeds 30 months, your agency:


(a) Must permanently assign you to your temporary official station or return you to your previous official station; 


(b) May not pay for extended storage or property management services incurred after the last day of the thirtieth month; and 


(c) Must pay the expenses of returning you and your immediate family and household goods to your previous official station unless you are permanently assigned to your temporary official station.
