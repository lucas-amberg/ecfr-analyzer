# ยง 302-3.416   Is there any limitation on the combined weight of household goods I may transport and store at Government expense?

Yes, the maximum combined weight is 18,000 pounds net weight. If you transport and/or store household goods in excess of the maximum weight allowance, you will be responsible for any excess cost.
