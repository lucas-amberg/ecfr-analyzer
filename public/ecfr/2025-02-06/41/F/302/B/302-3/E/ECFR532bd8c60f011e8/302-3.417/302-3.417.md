# ยง 302-3.417   Will I have to pay any income tax if my agency pays for extended storage of my household goods?

You will be subject to income taxes on the amount of extended storage expenses your agency pays. However, your agency will pay you a relocation income tax allowance under part 302-17 of this chapter for substantially all of the additional Federal, State and local income taxes you incur on the expenses your agency pays.
