# ยง 302-3.421   What are the income tax consequences if my agency pays for property management services?

When your agency pays for property management services: 


(a) You will be taxed on the amount of property management expenses your agency pays, whether it reimburses you directly for your expenses or pays a relocation services company to manage your residence; and 


(b) Your agency will pay you a relocation income tax allowance under part 302-17 of this chapter for substantially all of the additional Federal, State and local income taxes you incur on the expenses your agency pays.
