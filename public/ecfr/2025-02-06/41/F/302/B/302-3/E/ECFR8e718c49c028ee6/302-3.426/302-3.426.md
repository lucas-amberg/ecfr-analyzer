# ยง 302-3.426   How is payment of my TCS expenses affected if I am permanently assigned to my temporary official station?

Payment of TCS expenses stops once your temporary official station becomes your permanent official station. Your agency may not pay any TCS expenses incurred beginning the day your temporary official station becomes your permanent official station.
