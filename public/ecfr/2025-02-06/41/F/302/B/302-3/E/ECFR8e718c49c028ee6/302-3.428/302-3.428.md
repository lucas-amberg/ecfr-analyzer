# ยง 302-3.428   If I am permanently assigned to my temporary official station, is there any limitation on the weight of household goods I may transport at Government expense to my official station?

Yes. If you are permanently assigned to your temporary official station, you are limited to 18,000 pounds net weight for household goods you may transport at Government expense to your official station. This maximum weight will be reduced by the weight of any household goods transported at Government expense to your temporary official station under your TCS authorization. Subject to the 18,000 pound limit, your agency will pay to transport any household goods in extended storage to your official station. Additionally, if you change your residence as a result of your permanent assignment to your temporary official station, your agency may pay for transporting your household goods, subject to the 18,000-pound limit, between the residence you occupied during your temporary assignment and your new residence.
