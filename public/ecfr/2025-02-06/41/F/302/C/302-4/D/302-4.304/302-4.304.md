# ยง 302-4.304   For relocation outside the continental United States (OCONUS), may my agency allow actual expense reimbursement instead of the POV mileage rate for PCS travel?

Yes, for an OCONUS relocation involving POV usage, your agency may allow reimbursement of certain actual expenses of using the POV (*i.e.*, fuel plus the additional expenses listed in ยง 301-10.304).
