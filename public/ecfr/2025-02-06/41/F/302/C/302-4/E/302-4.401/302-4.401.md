# ยง 302-4.401   Are there exceptions to this daily minimum?

Yes, your agency may authorize exceptions to the daily minimum driving distance when there is a delay beyond your control such as acts of God, restrictions by Governmental authorities, or other acceptable reasons (*e.g.,* the employee is an individual with a disability or has special needs; alternative fuel vehicle range capability and fueling availability limitations). Your agency must have a designated approving official to authorize the pre authorized exceptions.
