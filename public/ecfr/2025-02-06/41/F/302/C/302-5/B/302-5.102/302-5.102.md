# ยง 302-5.102   Under what circumstances may we authorize a househunting trip?

You may authorize a househunting trip on an individual-case basis when the employee has accepted the transfer and the employee's circumstances indicate that a househunting trip actually is needed. You may not authorize a househunting trip when the purpose of the trip is to assist the employee in deciding whether the employee will accept the transfer.
