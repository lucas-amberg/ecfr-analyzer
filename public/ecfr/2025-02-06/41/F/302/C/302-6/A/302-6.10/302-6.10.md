# ยง 302-6.10   Where may I/we occupy temporary quarters at Government expense?

You and/or your immediate family may occupy temporary quarters in the United States at Government expense within reasonable proximity (approximately 50 miles) of the geographical area of your old and/or new official stations. Neither you nor your immediate family may be reimbursed for occupying temporary quarters at any other location, unless justified by special circumstances (*e.g.,* the temporary quarters location is subject to a Presidentially-Declared Disaster) that are reasonably related to your transfer.
