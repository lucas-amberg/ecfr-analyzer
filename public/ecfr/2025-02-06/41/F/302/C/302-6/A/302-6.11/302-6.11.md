# ยง 302-6.11   May my immediate family and I occupy temporary quarters at different locations?

Yes. Under various circumstances, you and your immediate family may need to occupy temporary quarters at different locations (*e.g.,* if you must report to the new official station while the immediate family delays the relocation to have family members complete the school year) (see ยง 302-6.16 regarding concurrent TQSE).
