# ยง 302-6.14   When does my authorized period for TQSE reimbursement end?

The period for TQSE reimbursement ends at midnight on either the day before you and/or any member of your immediate family occupies permanent residence quarters (even if some, but not all household goods have been delivered such that the residence is suitable for permanent occupancy), or the day your authorized period for TQSE reimbursement expires, whichever occurs first. (See ยง 302-6.207 for details.)
