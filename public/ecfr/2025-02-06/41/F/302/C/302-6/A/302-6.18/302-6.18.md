# ยง 302-6.18   How is my TQSE allowance affected if my temporary quarters become my permanent residence quarters?

If your temporary quarters become your permanent residence quarters, you may receive a TQSE allowance only if you show in a manner satisfactory to your agency that you initially intended to occupy the quarters temporarily. You will not be entitled to TQSE once your agency determines that your temporary quarters are your permanent residence. (See ยง 302-6.207 for details.)
