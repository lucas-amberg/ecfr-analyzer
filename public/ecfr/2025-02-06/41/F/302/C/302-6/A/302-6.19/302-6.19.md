# ยง 302-6.19   May I receive a TQSE allowance if I am receiving another subsistence expenses allowance?

No, unless your immediate family is claiming TQSE and you are performing separate official TDY travel, or you receive a cost-of-living allowance payable under 5 U.S.C. 5941 in addition to a TQSE allowance. (See ยง 302-6.17 for partial days for en route travel days.)
