# ยง 302-6.20   May I be reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred while I am occupying temporary quarters?

Transportation expenses incurred in the vicinity of the temporary quarters, such as rental car or mileage for commuting to/from work, parking, and bus or mass transit, etc., are not TQSE expenses, and therefore, there is no authority to pay such expenses under TQSE.
