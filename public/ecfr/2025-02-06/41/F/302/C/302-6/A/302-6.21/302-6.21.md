# ยง 302-6.21   May I be reimbursed for TQSE while occupying my permanent residence quarters at my old official station?

Your agency may authorize TQSE for a reasonable time when your residence at your old official station becomes temporary and no longer suitable for permanent residence (*e.g.,* household goods have been shipped and are unavailable to you and your immediate family).
