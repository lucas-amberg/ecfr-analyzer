# § 302-6.22   What methods may my agency use to reimburse me for TQSE?

(a) Your agency may use one of the following TQSE methods:


(1) TQSE—Lodgings-Plus (TQSE-LP);


(2) TQSE—Actual Expense (TQSE-AE); or


(3) TQSE—Lump Sum (TQSE-LS).


(b) Your agency will reimburse you for TQSE under the “lodgings-plus” method unless it offers you one or more of the alternate methods. If your agency makes multiple methods available to you, you may select the one you prefer; however, once your travel has begun, the authorized TQSE method may not be changed.
