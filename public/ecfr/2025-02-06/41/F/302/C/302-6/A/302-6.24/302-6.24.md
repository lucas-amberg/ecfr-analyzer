# § 302-6.24   How may my TQSE reimbursement be affected if I relocate to, or currently occupy, temporary quarters in a Presidentially-Declared Disaster area?

Your agency should consider delaying all non-essential relocations to Presidentially-Declared Disaster areas because the ability to secure temporary quarters lodgings in those areas may be compromised. If relocation cannot be delayed, or if you are already occupying temporary quarters that have been affected by the disaster in a Presidentially-Declared Disaster area, for temporary quarters located within CONUS your agency may:


(a) Authorize you to occupy temporary quarters outside of the proximity requirements at § 302-6.10; and


(b) Authorize TQSE at the applicable locality per diem allowance under FTR §§ 301-11.100 through 301-11.102 of this subtitle or authorize actual expenses on an individual basis under FTR §§ 301-11.300 through 301-11.306 of this subtitle not to exceed 300 percent of the applicable per diem in accordance with § 301-11.303 of this subtitle; or


(c) Issue a blanket actual expense authorization for official relocation travel performed on or after the date of the Presidentially-Declared Disaster.


(d) The authorizations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must apply to a specific Presidential Disaster Declaration, and must end on the expiration date of the Declaration, or one year from the date the Declaration is issued, whichever is sooner. The maximum limit of 120 consecutive days that TQSE may be authorized is statutorily based and remains in effect in accordance with FTR § 302-6.29(a). A blanket authorization issued under this section shall not apply to any travel performed pursuant to chapter 301 of this subtitle and does not permit an agency to change the TQSE method authorized once the travel has begun. See § 302-6.22(b).
