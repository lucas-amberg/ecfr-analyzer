# ยง 302-6.32   May I interrupt occupancy of temporary quarters?

Yes, your authorized period for claiming TQSE-LP and TQSE-AE reimbursement is measured on consecutive days, and once begun, normally continues to run whether or not you continue to occupy temporary quarters. However, you may interrupt your authorized period for claiming reimbursement in the following instances:


(a) For the time allowed for official travel en route between the old and new official stations;


(b) For circumstances attributable to official necessity such as an intervening temporary duty assignment or military duty; or


(c) For a non-official necessary interruption such as hospitalization, approved sick leave, or other reasons beyond your control and acceptable to your agency.
