# ยง 302-6.6   Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance if I transfer to or from a foreign area?

(a) You may not receive a TQSE allowance under this part when you transfer to a foreign area. However, you may qualify for a comparable allowance under the Department of State Standardized Regulations (DSSR) (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) (see ยง 302-3.101 of this chapter).


(b) You may receive a TQSE allowance under this part when you transfer from a foreign area and occupy temporary quarters in the United States. You may also be authorized a comparable allowance, prescribed by the Department of State, at the foreign area preceding final departure subsequent to the necessary vacating of residence quarters (see ยง 302-3.101 of this chapter).
