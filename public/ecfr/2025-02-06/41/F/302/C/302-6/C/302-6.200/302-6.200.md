# ยง 302-6.200   How should we administer the TQSE allowance?

Temporary quarters should be authorized only if, and only for as long as necessary until the employee and the employee's immediate family can move into permanent residence quarters. You must administer the TQSE allowance to minimize or avoid other relocation expenses.
