# § 302-6.204   What factors should we consider in determining what TQSE method(s) to offer an employee?

When determining what TQSE method(s) to offer an employee the following factors should be considered:


(a) *Ease of administration.* You should consider the administrative requirements for each method of TQSE. Factors such as obtaining and reviewing receipts to verify validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense carry an administrative burden to the employee, their immediate family, and you.


(b) *Cost consideration.* You should weigh the cost of each alternative. TQSE-LP and TQSE-AE reimbursement may extend up to 120 days, while the TQSE-LS payment is limited to a maximum of 30 days.


(c) *Treatment of employee.* The employee will be reimbursed for TQSE under the “lodgings-plus” method unless you offer one or more of the alternate methods. If you make all methods available to the employee, the employee is allowed to select any one of the methods. You should therefore consider employee morale and productivity against actual cost in determining which method(s) to offer.
