# ยง 302-6.205   Must we require transferees to sign a statement that TQSE will be incurred?

(a) Transferees authorized TQSE-LP or TQSE-AE are not required to sign a statement asserting that they will occupy temporary quarters since they must document temporary quarters lodging expenses.


(b) Transferees electing the TQSE-LS payment option if offered by you, must sign a statement, which should be included as part of the service agreement, asserting that they will occupy temporary quarters and will incur TQSE. If a lump sum amount was paid, and if no TQSE are incurred, the transferee must return all monies received for the TQSE-LS payment to the agency.
