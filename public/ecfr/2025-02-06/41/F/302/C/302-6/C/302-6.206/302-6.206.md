# ยง 302-6.206   When must we make the TQSE-LS payment to the transferee?

You must pay the transferee the TQSE-LS payment before the occupancy of temporary quarters begins. You should make the TQSE-LS payment as close as is reasonably possible to the time that the transferee will begin occupancy of temporary quarters.
