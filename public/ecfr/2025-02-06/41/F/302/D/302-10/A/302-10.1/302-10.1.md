# ยง 302-10.1   May I be reimbursed for transporting my mobile home instead of an HHG shipment?

Yes, if you are eligible for the transportation of HHG, you will be reimbursed for transporting a mobile home instead of an HHG shipment, not to exceed what the Government would incur for the transportation of your HHG and 90-days temporary storage.
