# ยง 302-10.4   Are there any geographic limitations for transportation of a mobile home?

Yes, allowances for overland transportation of a mobile home may be made only for transportation within CONUS, within Alaska, and through Canada en route between Alaska and CONUS or through Canada between one CONUS point and another (e.g., between Buffalo, NY and Detroit, MI). Allowances for transportation within limits prescribed may be paid even though the transportation involved originates, terminates, or passes through locations not covered, provided the amount of the allowance shall be computed on the basis of that part of the transportation which is within CONUS, within Alaska, or through Canada en route between Alaska and CONUS or between one CONUS point and another. The cost to transport a mobile home may not exceed the cost of shipping 18,000 pounds of HHG and 90 days of temporary storage.
