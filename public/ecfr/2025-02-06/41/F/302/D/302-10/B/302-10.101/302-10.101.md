# ยง 302-10.101   Must I furnish actual odometer readings on the travel claim?

No, you do not need to furnish odometer readings on the travel claim but you must indicate the total miles traveled. Any deviation from the distances indicated in standard highway mileage guides or agency official table of distances must be fully explained and acceptable to your agency.
