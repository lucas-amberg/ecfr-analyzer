# ยง 302-7.14   What methods of transporting and paying for the movement of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are authorized?

There are two authorized methods of transporting and paying for the movement of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage. Your agency will determine which of the following methods will be authorized. 


(a) *Commuted rate system.* Under the commuted rate system you assume total responsibility for arranging and paying for, at least the following services: packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/deliver, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage of your HHG and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier or by renting self drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move. When any PBP&E is transported as an administrative expense of your agency, all arrangements (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) will be handled and paid for by your agency. 


(b) *Actual expense method.* Under the actual expense method, your agency assumes the responsibility for arranging and paying for all aspects (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, temporary storage, etc.), of transporting your HHG and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier.
