# ยง 302-7.16   Must I use the methods selected by my agency for transportation and temporary storage of my HHG and PBP&E?

No, you do not have to use the method selected (*see* ยง 302-7.401) by your agency for transportation and temporary storage of your HHG and PBP&E. You may pursue other methods; however, your reimbursement is limited to the actual cost incurred, not to exceed what the Government would have incurred under the method selected by your agency.
