# ยง 302-7.17   Is the maximum weight allowance for HHG and temporary storage limited when quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government OCONUS or upon return to CONUS?

When quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government OCONUS, your agency may limit the weight of HHG and temporary storage that can be transported to that location. Only the authorized weight allowance that was shipped to the OCONUS location may be returned to CONUS upon completion of the tour of duty, unless the agency makes an exception under conditions specified in agency internal regulations.
