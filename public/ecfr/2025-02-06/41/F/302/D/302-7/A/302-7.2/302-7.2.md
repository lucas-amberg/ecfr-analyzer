# ยง 302-7.2   What is the maximum weight of HHG that may be transported or stored at Government expense?

(a) The maximum weight allowance of HHG that may be shipped or stored at Government expense is 18,000 pounds net weight. For uncrated or van line shipments, a 2,000 pound allowance is added to the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance to cover packing materials for the shipment. In no case may a shipment weigh over 20,000 gross pounds (the 18,000 pounds net weight of the uncrated HHG plus the 2,000 pound allowance for packing materials). The relocating employee is responsible for reimbursing the Government for all costs incurred if the shipment is overweight. For determining the weight of crated shipments, containerized shipments, and constructive weight for other types of household good shipments, please *see* the chart in ยง 302-7.13.


(b) An agency may establish a lower net weight allowance and a lower allowance for packing materials in special circumstances, such as transferring an employee into government-furnished quarters.
