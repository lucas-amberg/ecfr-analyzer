# ยง 302-7.20   Should I include items that are irreplaceable or of extremely high monetary or sentimental value in my HHG shipment?

Generally no; items that are irreplaceable or of extremely high monetary or sentimental value should not be included in your HHG shipment. Additional insurance may be purchased, at your expense, to cover any loss or damage, however, such items are not necessarily provided special security. Accordingly, it is advisable that you or an immediate family member(s) transport such items personally.
