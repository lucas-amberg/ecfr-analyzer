# ยง 302-7.405   How must we arrange and pay for transportation of HHG and UAB, if we have authorized actual expense for transportation?

When arranging transportation of HHG and UAB under the actual expense method, you should:


(a) Determine the constructive cost of transporting the HHG plus the UAB, as follows:


(1) Compute the cost of transporting the HHG (not including the UAB) in one lot, by the most economical means; be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.


(2) Compute the cost of transporting the UAB.


(3) If the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then compute the cost of transporting only the net weight allowance as one shipment; again, be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.


(4) The constructive cost is either that described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, depending on whether the weight of the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the net weight allowance.


(b) Limit the employee's HHG plus UAB transportation payment to the constructive cost as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, so long as it is equal to or less than the 18,000 pound net limit of this Chapter;


(c) Make arrangements for transporting the employee's HHG and UAB under two separate bills of lading, with direct payment by the agency for both; and


(d) Advise employees of this relocation entitlement limitation and its potential to result in out-of-pocket expenses to the employee. That is, advise employees that they will have to use their personal funds to pay for transporting HHG (including UAB) in excess of 18,000 pounds net weight allowance.
