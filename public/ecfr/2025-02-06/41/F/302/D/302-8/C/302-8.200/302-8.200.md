Yes, you are eligible for extended storage during assignment OCONUS if your agency authorizes it, and if: 


(a) The official station is one to which you are not authorized to take, or at which you are unable to use, your HHG; or 


(b) Your agency authorizes it as being in the public interest; or 


(c) Your agency determines the estimated cost of storage would be less than the cost of round-trip transportation (including temporary storage) of the HHG to your new official station.
