# ยง 302-9.8   Must my agency authorize transportation or emergency or temporary storage of my POV?

No; however, if your agency does authorize transportation of a POV to your post of duty and you complete your service agreement, your agency must pay for the cost of returning the POV. Your agency determines the conditions under which it will pay for transportation and emergency or temporary storage and the procedures an employee must follow.
