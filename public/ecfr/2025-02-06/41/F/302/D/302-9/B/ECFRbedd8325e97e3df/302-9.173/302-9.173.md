# ยง 302-9.173   How many replacement POV's may my agency authorize me to transport to my post of duty at Government expense?

Your agency may authorize one emergency replacement POV within any 4-year period of continuous service. It may authorize one non-emergency replacement POV after every four years of continuous service beginning on the date you first have use of the POV being replaced.
