Your agency will pay to transport a POV from your post of duty when: 


(a) You are transferred back to the official station (including post of duty) from which you transferred to your current post of duty; 


(b) You are transferred to a new official station within CONUS; 


(c) You are transferred to a new post of duty, where your agency determines that use of a POV at that location is not in the interest of the Government; 


(d) You separate from Government service after completion of an agreed period of service at the post of duty where your agency determined the use of a POV to be in the interest of the Government; 


(e) You separate from Government service prior to completion of an agreed period of service at the post of duty where your agency determined the use of a POV to be in the interest of the Government, and the separation is for reasons beyond your control and acceptable to your agency; or 


(f) Conditions change at your post of duty such that use of the POV no longer is in the best interest of the Government.
