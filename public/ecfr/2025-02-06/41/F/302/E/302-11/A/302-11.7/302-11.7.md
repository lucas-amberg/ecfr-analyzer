When your unexpired lease (including month to month) is for residence quarters at your old official station, you may be reimbursed for settlement expenses for an unexpired lease, including but not limited to broker's fees for obtaining a sublease or charges for advertising if: 


(a) Applicable laws or the terms of the lease provide for payment of settlement expenses; or 


(b) Such expenses cannot be avoided by sublease or other arrangement; or 


(c) You have not contributed to the expenses by failing to give appropriate lease termination notice promptly after you have definite knowledge of your transfer; or 


(d) The broker's fees or advertising charges are not in excess of those customarily charged for comparable services in that locality.
