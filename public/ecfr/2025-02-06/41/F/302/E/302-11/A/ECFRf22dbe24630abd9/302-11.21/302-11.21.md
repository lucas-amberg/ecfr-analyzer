# ยง 302-11.21   How long do I have to submit my claim for reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with my residence transactions?

Your claim for reimbursement should be submitted to your agency as soon as possible after the transaction occurred. However, the settlement dates for the sale and purchase or lease termination transactions for which reimbursement is requested must occur not later than 1 year after the day you report for duty at your new official station. (See ยง 302-11.23.)
