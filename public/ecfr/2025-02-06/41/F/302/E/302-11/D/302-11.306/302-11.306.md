You are responsible for the determination of reasonableness for your claimed expenses. To determine if your expenses are reasonable, you should, in coordination with your agency, contact the local real estate association, or, if not available, at least three different realtors in the locality in which your expenses will be incurred and request: 


(a) The current schedule of closing costs which applies to the area in which you are buying or selling; 


(b) Information concerning local custom and practices with respect to charging of closing costs which relate to either your sale or purchase and whether such costs are customarily paid by the seller or purchaser; and 


(c) Information on the local terminology used to describe the costs specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
