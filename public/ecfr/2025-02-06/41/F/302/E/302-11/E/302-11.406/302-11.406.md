To administer an employee's claim: 


(a) You must: 


(1) Review the employee's claim to determine whether the expenses claimed are reasonable in amount and customarily paid by the buyer/seller in the locality where the property is located; 


(2) Disallow any portion of the employee's claim that is inflated or are higher than normal for similar services in the locality; 


(3) Execute final administrative approval of payment of a claim by an appropriate agency approving official; and 


(4) Return disapproved applications to the employee with a memorandum of explanation. 


(b) The approving official must determine if: 


(1) The aggregate amount of expenses claimed in connection with a sale or purchase of a residence is within the prescribed limitation for either; 


(2) All conditions and requirements under which allowances may be paid have been met; and 


(3) The expenses themselves are those which are reimbursable.
