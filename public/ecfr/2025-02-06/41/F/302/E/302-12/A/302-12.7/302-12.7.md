# ยง 302-12.7   What expenses will my agency pay if I use a relocation services company to ship household goods in excess of the maximum weight allowance?

If you use a relocation services company to ship HHG in excess of the maximum weight allowance, your agency will pay the portion of the fee attributable to 18,000 pounds net weight. You must pay the rest.
