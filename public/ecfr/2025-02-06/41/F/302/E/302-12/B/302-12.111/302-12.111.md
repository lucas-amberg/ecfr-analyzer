# ยง 302-12.111   May we require an employee to use a real estate broker specified by the RSC?

Yes, you may require, through your contract with the RSC, that every employee enrolled in the homesale program use a real estate broker specified by the RSC. This provision is not part of the standard terms for a homesale program, but it may provide a pricing advantage in negotiations with potential RSC, as well as an opportunity for better management of the homesale process.
