# ยง 302-12.119   Under a home sale program, may we pay an employee for losses the employee incurs on the sale of a residence?

No, under a home sale program, you may not pay an employee for losses the employee incurs on the sale of a residence, but this does not preclude you reimbursing a relocation services company for losses incurred while the contractor holds the property.
