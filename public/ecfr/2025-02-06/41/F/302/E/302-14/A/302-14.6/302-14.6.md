# ยง 302-14.6   How much may my agency pay me for a home marketing incentive?

Your agency will determine the amount of your home marketing incentive payment. The incentive payment, however, may not exceed the lesser of: 


(a) Five percent of the price the relocation services company paid when it purchased the residence from you; or 


(b) The savings your agency realized from the reduced fee/expenses it paid as a result of you finding a bona fide buyer.
