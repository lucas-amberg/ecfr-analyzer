# ยง 302-14.103   What factors should we consider in determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment?

In determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment, you should consider the: 


(a) Amount of savings from reduced fee/expenses paid to the relocation services company. The home marketing incentive payment program is intended to reduce your relocation costs. The amount of each home marketing incentive payment you make, therefore, must not exceed the savings you realize from the reduced fee you pay to the relocation services company; and 


(b) Employee's efforts in marketing the residence. The purpose of a home marketing incentive payment program is to encourage a transferred employee who participates in a homesale program to independently and aggressively market the employee's residence and find a bona fide buyer.
