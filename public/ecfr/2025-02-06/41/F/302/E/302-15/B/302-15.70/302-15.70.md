# ยง 302-15.70   What governing policies must we establish for the allowance for property management services?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:


(a) When you will authorize payment for property management services for an employee who transfers in the interest of the Government;


(b) When it is appropriate to authorize this service on a reimbursable basis to the employee, rather than paying the property management company directly, as long as any reimbursement is equal to or less than the agency negotiated rate for this service (agencies may require that employees hire only licensed and/or certified property managers).


(c) Who will determine, for relocations to official duty stations in the United States, whether payment for property management services is more advantageous and cost effective than sale of an employee's residence at Government expense;


(d) If and when you will allow an employee who was offered and accepted payment for property management services to change the employee's residence at Government expense in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; and


(e) How you will offset expenses you have paid for property management services against payable expenses for sale of the employee's residence when an eligible employee who elected payment for property management services later changes their mind and elects instead to sell their residence at Government expense.
