# ยง 302-17.7   What limitations and Federal income tax treatments apply to various relocation reimbursements?

(a) Some relocation expenses reimbursed to you or paid directly by the Government on or after January 1, 2018, and on or before December 31, 2025, must be reported as income and you cannot claim them as deductible expenses on your Federal tax return.


(b) A table summarizing the FTR allowances, limitations, and tax treatment of each reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a service provider or vendor is published at *https://gsa.gov/ftrbulletins.* The table also cites relevant FTR paragraphs for details. GSA will revise the table to reflect any changes as quickly as possible; however, users of this part may wish to consult with a tax advisor to determine what limitations and Federal income tax treatments apply to your relocation reimbursement(s).
