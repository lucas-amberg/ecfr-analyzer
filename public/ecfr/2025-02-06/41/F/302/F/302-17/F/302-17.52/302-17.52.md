# § 302-17.52   When should I file an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” under the one-year process?

You should submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” to your agency under the one-year process whenever the information on it changes, and you should continue to amend it until you have received the last W-2 from your agency in connection with a specific relocation. In particular, you should file an amended version of this statement whenever:


(a) Your filing status changes;


(b) Your income changes enough that your income, including WTA and RITA, might put you into a different tax bracket; or


(c) You have taxable relocation expenses in a second or third calendar year.
