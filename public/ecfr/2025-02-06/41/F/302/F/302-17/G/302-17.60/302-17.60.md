# § 302-17.60   How are the terms “Year 1” and “Year 2” used in the two-year RITA process?

(a) Year 1 is the calendar year in which the agency reimburses you for a specific expense, provides an allowance, or pays a vendor directly. If your reimbursements, allowances, and/or direct payments to vendors occur in more than one calendar year, you will have more than one Year 1.


(b) Year 2 is the calendar year in which you submit your RITA claim and your agency pays your RITA to you.


(c) In most cases:


(1) For every Year 1 you will have a corresponding Year 2;


(2) Every Year 2 immediately follows a Year 1; and


(3) Year 2 is the year in which you file a tax return reflecting your remaining tax liability for taxable reimbursement(s), allowance(s), and/or direct payments to vendors in each Year 1.
