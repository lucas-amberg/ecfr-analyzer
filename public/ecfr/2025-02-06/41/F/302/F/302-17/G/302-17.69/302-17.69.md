# ยง 302-17.69   How do I pay taxes on my RITA under the two-year process?

When income taxes are due for Year 2, you must report your RITA, if any, as taxable income on your Federal, state, and local tax returns.


(a) If your relocation process results in only one Year 2, or if the previous year was your last Year 1, your RITA is the only amount that you report as income resulting from your relocation for that Year 2.


(b) If, on the other hand, your relocation process results in more than one Year 2 (if, for example, you incurred relocation expenses during more than one calendar year), then, except for your last Year 2, you will need to report reimbursements, allowances, direct payments to vendors, and WTA(s), if any, for succeeding Year 1's at the same time that you report each Year 2's RITA.


(c) See the table in ยง 302-17.60 for a graphic explanation of Year 1 and Year 2.
