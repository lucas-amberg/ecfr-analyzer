# ยง 303-70.700   When an employee dies as a result of personal injury sustained while in the performance of the employee's law enforcement duties, either on official travel duties away from the official station, or at the current official station, must we provide transportation for the employee's immediate family, baggage, and household goods to a alternate residential destination?

Yes. If the head of the agency concerned (or a designee) determines that the employee died as a result of personal injury sustained while in the performance of the employee's duties, and the employee was:


(a) A law enforcement officer as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5541;


(b) An employee in or under the Federal Bureau of Investigation who is not described in paragraph (a); or


(c) A Customs and Border Protection officer as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8331(31).
