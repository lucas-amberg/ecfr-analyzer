# ยง 304-3.19   Are there other situations when I may accept payment from a non-Federal source for my travel expenses?

Yes, you may also accept payment of travel expenses from a non-Federal source under the following authorities, in addition to this part: 


(a) Under 5 U.S.C. 4111 for acceptance of contributions, awards, and other payments from tax-exempt entities for non-Government sponsored training or meetings (see regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management at 5 CFR part 410).


(b) Under 5 U.S.C. 7342 for travel taking place entirely outside the United States which is paid by a foreign government, where acceptance is permitted by your agency and any regulations which may be prescribed by your agency. 


(c) Under 5 U.S.C. 7324(b) when payment is for travel to be performed for a partisan rather than an official purpose in accordance with the Hatch Act (5 U.S.C. 7321-7326); or 


(d) Pursuant to the applicable standards of ethical conduct regulations concerning personal acceptance of gifts. For example, under 5 CFR 2635.204(e), which authorizes executive branch employees to accept gifts based on outside business employment relationships. (Note: You may also be able to accept attendance at, but not other travel expenses to, a widely attended gathering under 5 CFR 2635.204(g) when the gathering is not a meeting, as defined in this part, and you are not attending in your official capacity. Unless authorized to do so by your agency, you may not accept travel, subsistence, or related expenses, including meals, offered by a non-Federal source for participation as a speaker, panelist, or presenter at a meeting or similar function that takes place away from your permanent duty station. Such expenses are considered payments in kind and must be accepted, if at all, in accordance with this part.)
