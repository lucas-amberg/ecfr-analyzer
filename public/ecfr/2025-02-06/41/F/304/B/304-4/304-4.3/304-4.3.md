# ยง 304-4.3   Under what other authority may we accept payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source?

You may accept payment for travel expenses to events other than meetings from a non-Federal source pursuant to an agency gift statute or similar statutory authority. However, this part 304 is the only authority you may use to accept (or authorize your employee to accept on your behalf) payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source to attend a meeting. For example, you could not pay the travel expenses for an employee to attend a meeting and then authorize the employee to use the widely attended gathering exception in 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(2) to accept free attendance at that same meeting. You would only be able to accept payment for the employee's attendance at that meeting under this part 304.
