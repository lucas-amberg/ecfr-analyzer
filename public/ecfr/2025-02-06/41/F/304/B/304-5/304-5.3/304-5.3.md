# § 304-5.3   What does our approving official need to consider before authorizing acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel expenses for a meeting?

(a) The approving official must not authorize acceptance of the payment if the approving official determines that acceptance of the payment under the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts relevant to a particular case to question the integrity of agency programs or operations. The approving official must be guided by all relevant considerations, including but not limited to the—


(1) Identity of the non-Federal source; 


(2) Purpose of the meeting; 


(3) Identity of other expected participants; 


(4) Nature and sensitivity of any matter pending at the agency which may affect the interest of the non-Federal source; 


(5) Significance of the employee's role in any such matter; and 


(6) Monetary value and character of the travel benefits offered by the non-Federal source. 


(b) The agency official may find that, while acceptance from the non-Federal source is permissible, it is in the interest of the agency to qualify acceptance of the offered payment by, for example, authorizing attendance at only a portion of the event or limiting the type or character of benefits that may be accepted.
