# ยง 2.34   Uses and Disclosures to prevent multiple enrollments.

(a) *Restrictions on disclosure.* A part 2 program, as defined in ยง 2.11, may disclose patient records to a central registry or to any withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program not more than 200 miles away for the purpose of preventing the multiple enrollment of a patient only if:


(1) The disclosure is made when:


(i) The patient is accepted for treatment;


(ii) The type or dosage of the drug is changed; or


(iii) The treatment is interrupted, resumed or terminated.


(2) The disclosure is limited to:


(i) Patient identifying information;


(ii) Type and dosage of the drug; and


(iii) Relevant dates.


(3) The disclosure is made with the patient's written consent meeting the requirements of ยง 2.31, except that:


(i) The consent must list the name and address of each central registry and each known withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program to which a disclosure will be made; and


(ii) The consent may authorize a disclosure to any withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program established within 200 miles of the program, but does not need to individually name all programs.






(b) *Use of information in records limited to prevention of multiple enrollments.* A central registry and any withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program to which information is disclosed to prevent multiple enrollments may not use or redisclose patient identifying information for any purpose other than the prevention of multiple enrollments or to ensure appropriate coordinated care with a treating provider that is not a part 2 program unless authorized by a court order under subpart E of this part.


(c) *Permitted disclosure by a central registry to prevent a multiple enrollment.* When a member program asks a central registry if an identified patient is enrolled in another member program and the registry determines that the patient is so enrolled, the registry may disclose:


(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the member program(s) in which the patient is already enrolled to the inquiring member program; and


(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the inquiring member program to the member program(s) in which the patient is already enrolled. The member programs may communicate as necessary to verify that no error has been made and to prevent or eliminate any multiple enrollments.


(d) *Permitted disclosure by a central registry to a non-member treating provider, to prevent a multiple enrollment.* When, for the purpose of preventing multiple program enrollments or duplicative prescriptions, or to inform prescriber decision making regarding prescribing of opioid medication(s) or other prescribed substances, a provider with a treating provider relationship that is not a member program asks a central registry if an identified patient is enrolled in a member program, the registry may disclose:


(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the member program(s) in which the patient is enrolled;


(2) Type and dosage of any medication for substance use disorder being administered or prescribed to the patient by the member program(s); and


(3) Relevant dates of any such administration or prescription. The central registry and non-member program treating prescriber may communicate as necessary to verify that no error has been made and to prevent or eliminate any multiple enrollments or improper prescribing.


(e) *Permitted disclosure by a withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program to prevent a multiple enrollment.* A withdrawal management or maintenance treatment program which has received a disclosure under this section and has determined that the patient is already enrolled may communicate as necessary with the program making the disclosure to verify that no error has been made and to prevent or eliminate any multiple enrollments.
