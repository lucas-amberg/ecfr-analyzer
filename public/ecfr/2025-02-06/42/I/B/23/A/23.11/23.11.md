# ยง 23.11   Under what circumstances may the Secretary sell equipment or other property of the United States used by the National Health Service Corps site?

(a) Upon expiration of the assignment of all Corps personnel to a health manpower shortage area, the Secretary may sell equipment and other property of the United States used by the assigned personnel. The equipment may be sold at the fair market value or less than the fair market value to any entity providing health services in or to a health manpower shortage area if the Secretary determines that an entity is unable to pay the fair market value. In determining whether an entity is financially unable to purchase equipment or property at fair market value, the Secretary will consider (1) the present financial resources of the entity available to purchase the equipment or property based upon its current liabilities, and (2) the entity's ability to obtain the funds necessary to purchase the equipment or property. However, the Secretary will not sell the equipment or property for less than fair market value to a profitmaking organization unless the organization gives reasonable assurance that it will use the equipment or property to provide health services in or to the health manpower shortage area.


(b) The Secretary will give priority to sales to an entity providing reasonable assurance that it will use the equipment or property for the purpose of retaining within the health manpower shortage area National Health Service Corps personnel who have completed their assignments.
