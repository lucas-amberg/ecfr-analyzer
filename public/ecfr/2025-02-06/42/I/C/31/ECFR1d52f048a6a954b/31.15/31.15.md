# ยง 31.15   Continuance of medical relief after loss of status.

If a person is separated while undergoing treatment by the Service, his treatment shall be discontinued immediately unless the physician or dentist in charge determines that the condition of the patient does not permit interruption of treatment, in which case the treatment shall be discontinued as soon as practicable and the condition of the patient permits. At that time he shall be discharged from treatment and shall not thereafter be afforded medical relief by the Service by reason of his previous service.
