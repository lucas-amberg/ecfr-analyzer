(a) The Director shall convene a board of medical officers to reexamine an alien:


(1) Upon the request of DHS for a reexamination by such a board; or


(2) Upon an appeal to DHS by an alien who, having received a medical examination in connection with the determination of admissibility to the United States (including examination on arrival and adjustment of status as provided in the immigration laws and regulations) has been certified for a Class A condition.


(b) The board shall reexamine an alien certified as:


(1) Having a communicable disease of public health significance;


(2) Lacking documentation of having received vaccination against “vaccine-preventable diseases” for an alien who seeks admission as an immigrant, or who seeks adjustment of status to one lawfully admitted for permanent residence, which shall include at least the following diseases: Mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, pertussis, *Haemophilus influenza* type B and hepatitis B, and any other vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) for which HHS/CDC determines, by applying criteria published in the _Federal Register,_ there is a public health need at the time of immigration or adjustment of status. *Provided, however,* that in no case shall a Class A medical notification be issued for an adopted child who is 10 years of age or younger if, prior to the admission of the child, an adoptive or prospective adoptive parent, who has sponsored the child for admission as an immediate relative, has executed an affidavit stating that the parent is aware of the vaccination requirement and will ensure that the child will be vaccinated within 30 days of the child's admission, or at the earliest time that is medically appropriate.


(3)(i) Having a current physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with the disorder that may pose, or has posed, a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others; or


(ii) Having a history of a physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with the disorder, which behavior has posed a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others and which behavior is likely to recur or lead to other harmful behavior; or


(iii) Having drug abuse or drug addiction;


(c) The board shall consist of the following:


(1) In circumstances covered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the board shall consist of at least one medical officer who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the communicable disease for which the medical notification has been made;


(2) In circumstances covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the board shall consist of at least one medical officer who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the vaccine-preventable disease for which the medical notification has been made;


(3) In circumstances covered by paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the board shall consist of at least one medical officer who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the physical or mental disorder, or substance-related disorder for which medical notification has been made.


(d) The decision of the majority of the board shall prevail, provided that at least two medical officers concur in the judgment of the board.


(e) Reexamination shall include:


(1) Review of all records submitted by the alien, other witnesses, or the board;


(2) Use of any laboratory or additional studies which are deemed clinically necessary as a result of the physical examination or pertinent information elicited from the alien's medical history;


(3) Consideration of statements regarding the alien's physical or mental condition made by a physician after his/her examination of the alien; and


(4) A physical or psychiatric examination of the alien performed by the board, at the board's discretion;


(f) An alien who is to be reexamined shall be notified of the reexamination not less than 5 days prior thereto.


(g) The alien, at his/her own cost and expense, may introduce as witnesses before the board such physicians or medical experts as the board may in its discretion permit; provided that the alien shall be permitted to introduce at least one expert medical witness. If any witnesses offered are not permitted by the board to testify (either orally or through written testimony), the record of the proceedings shall show the reason for the denial of permission.


(h) Witnesses before the board shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the medical notification and other records involved in the reexamination and to present all relevant and material evidence orally or in writing until such time as the reexamination is declared by the board to be closed. During the course of the reexamination the alien's attorney or representative shall be permitted to question the alien and he/she, or the alien, shall be permitted to question any witnesses offered in the alien's behalf or any witnesses called by the board. If the alien does not have an attorney or representative, the board shall assist the alien in the presentation of his/her case to the end that all of the material and relevant facts may be considered.


(i) Any proceedings under this section may, at the board's discretion, be conducted based on the written record, including through written questions and testimony.


(j) The findings and conclusions of the board shall be based on its medical examination of the alien, if any, and on the evidence presented and made a part of the record of its proceedings.


(k) The board shall report its findings and conclusions to DHS, and shall also give prompt notice thereof to the alien if his/her reexamination has been based on his/her appeal. The board's report to DHS shall specifically affirm, modify, or reject the findings and conclusions of prior examining medical officers.


(l) The board shall issue its medical notification in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part if it finds that an alien it has reexamined has a Class A or Class B condition.


(m) If the board finds that an alien it has reexamined does not have a Class A or Class B condition, it shall issue its medical notification in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part.


(n) After submission of its report, the board shall not be reconvened, nor shall a new board be convened, in connection with the same application for admission or for adjustment of status, except upon the express authorization of the Director.
