# ยง 37.102   Transfer of affected miner to less dusty area.

(a) Any miner who, in the judgment of NIOSH, has evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis, must be afforded the option of transferring from his or her position to another position in an area of the mine where the concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere is in compliance with the MSHA requirements in 30 CFR part 90. A classification of one or more of the miner's chest radiographs as showing category 1 (
1/0, 
1/1, 
1/2), category 2 (
2/1, 
2/2, 
2/3), or category 3 (
3/2, 
3/3, 3/+) simple pneumoconiosis, or complicated pneumoconiosis (ILO Classification) will be accepted as such evidence. NIOSH will, at its discretion, also accept other medical examinations provided to NIOSH for review, such as computed tomography scans of the chest or lung biopsies, as evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis.


(b) Any transfer under this section shall be in accordance with the procedures specified in 30 CFR part 90.
