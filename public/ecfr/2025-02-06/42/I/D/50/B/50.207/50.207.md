(a) Programs or projects to which this subpart applies shall not perform or arrange for the performance of any hysterectomy solely for the purpose of rendering an individual permanently incapable of reproducing or where, if there is more than one purpose to the procedure, the hysterectomy would not be performed but for the purpose of rendering the individual permanently incapable of reproducing.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, programs or projects to which this subpart applies may perform or arrange for the performance of a hysterectomy not covered by paragraph (a) of this section only if:


(1) The person who secures the authorization to perform the hysterectomy has informed the individual and her representative, if any, orally and in writing, that the hysterectomy will make her permanently incapable of reproducing; and


(2) The individual or her representative, if any, has signed a written acknowledgment of receipt of that information.


(c)(1) A program or project is not required to follow the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section if either of the following circumstances exists:


(i) The individual is already sterile at the time of the hysterectomy.


(ii) The individual requires a hysterectomy because of a life-threatening emergency in which the physician determines that prior acknowledgment is not possible.


(2) If the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section are not followed because one or more of the circumstances of paragraph (c)(1) exist, the physician who performs the hysterectomy must certify in writing:


(i) That the woman was already sterile, stating the cause of that sterility; or


(ii) That the hysterectomy was performed under a life-threatening emergency situation in which he or she determined prior acknowledgment was not possible. He or she must also include a description of the nature of the emergency.
