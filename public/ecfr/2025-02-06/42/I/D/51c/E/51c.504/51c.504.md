(1) *Assurances.* Comply with the assurances provided pursuant to this subpart. 


(2) *Approval of estimated cost.* Not enter into any contract for the acquisition and/or modernization funded under this subpart where the cost of such acquisition and/or modernization exceeds the estimates in the application, without the prior approval of the Secretary. 


(3) *Non-default.* Make every effort to prevent any default on any loan secured by the building and, in the event of a default, promptly notify the Secretary of the default and make every effort on a timely basis to cure the default. 


(b) *Requirements for acquisition grants.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a grantee which has received a grant under section 330 of the Act for a project which includes the acquisition of an existing building must: 


(1) *Bona-fide sale.* Acquire or, in the case of a grant solely for amortization of principal and payment of interest on an existing loan, have acquired the existing building pursuant to a bona-fide sale involving an actual cost to the applicant and resulting in additional or improved facilities for the purposes of the project. 


(2) *Standards of construction and equipment.* Except in the case of a grant solely for amortization of principal and payment of interest on an existing loan, obtain a determination by the Secretary that the facility conforms (or upon completion of any necessary alteration and renovation or modernization will conform) to the standards set forth in § 51c.503(a)(7)(iii) of this subpart before entering into a final or unconditional contract for the acquisition. Where the Secretary finds that exceptions to or modifications of any such standards would be consistent with the purposes of the Act and of the program, he may authorize such exceptions or modifications. 


(3) *Financing.* Where the grantee will obtain a loan secured by the building in order to acquire the building, obtain such financing at the lowest current rate prevailing in the area for comparable loans on comparable facilities.

(1) *Costs in excess of approved costs.* Finance all costs in excess of the estimated costs approved in the application and submit to the Secretary for prior approval any changes that substantially alter the scope of the function, utilities, or safety of the facility. 


(2) *Competitive bids.* (i) Obtain the approval of the Secretary before the project is advertised or placed on the market for bidding; such approval must include a determination by the Secretary that the final plans and specifications conform to the standards set forth in § 51c.503(a)(7)(iii) of these regulations. 


(ii) Except as otherwise provided by State or local law, contract for construction (including the purchase and installation of built-in equipment) on a lump sum fixed-price basis, and award contracts on the basis of competitive bidding obtained by public advertising with award of the contracts to the lowest responsive and responsible bidders. The provision for exceptions based on State and local law shall not be invoked to give local contractors or suppliers a percentage preference over non-local contractors bidding for the same contract. Such practices are precluded by this paragraph. 


(3) *Construction contracts.* (i) Include the following conditions and provisions in all construction contracts for the modernization project: 


(A) The provisions set forth in “DHHS Requirements for Federally Assisted Construction Contracts Regarding Labor Standards and Equal Employment Opportunities,” Form DHHS 514 (rev. 7/76) (issued by the Office of Grants Administration Policy, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) pertaining to the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contract Work Hours Standards Act, and the Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback) Regulations, except in the case of contracts in the amount of $2,000 or less; and pertaining to Executive Order 11246, 30 FR 12319 (September 24, 1965), as amended, relating to nondiscrimination in construction contract employment, except in the case of contracts in the amount of $10,000 or less;
