# ยง 51d.5   How is an emergency determined to exist?

(ii) Result in significant:


(A) Death,


(B) Injury,


(C) Exposure to life-threatening circumstances,


(D) Hardship,


(E) Suffering,


(F) Loss of property, or

(3) No other local, State, Tribal or Federal funding is available to adequately address the specific level of need resulting from the precipitating event and resulting emergency mental health and/or substance abuse service needs of the impacted community.


(b) In making a determination that a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists, the Secretary will consider the certification and written statements provided in accordance with ยง 51d.4(a)(1) or (b)(1), and other information independently available to the Secretary.


(c) Once the Secretary determines that a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists, the Secretary may exercise discretion to make awards to enable public entities to respond to the emergency, within the limits of funds available.
