# ยง 52d.6   Grant awards.

(a) Within the limits of funds available, after consultation with the Board, the Director, NCI, may award grants to applicants with proposed programs which in the NCI Director's judgment best promote the purposes of this part, taking into consideration among other pertinent factors: 


(1) The relevance of the proposed program to the objectives of this part; 


(2) The extent to which the program would involve innovative teaching techniques; 


(3) The availability of adequate staff, facilities, and resources (including where necessary cooperative arrangements with other institutions or hospitals) to carry out the program; 


(4) The qualifications and experience of the program director; 


(5) The authority of the program director to ensure that the program is planned with multidisciplinary input and that multidisciplinary aspects of the program are carried out; 


(6) The extent to which the cancer education committee is broadly representative of the disciplines concerned with cancer care and teaching and is allowed to participate in the planning, organization, operation, and evaluation of the program; 


(7) If the program is to be offered at the pre-doctoral level, the extent to which its objectives are designed to aid students: 


(i) To acquire a basic understanding of fundamental principles of cancer biology, epidemiology, detection, diagnosis, prevention, treatment and control; 


(ii) To interest students in learning more about cancer; and 


(iii) To develop an appreciation of the need for a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to the care of cancer patients; 


(8) The administrative and managerial capability of the applicant; 


(9) The reasonableness of the proposed budget in relation to the proposed program; 


(10) The adequacy of the methods for monitoring and evaluating the program on a continuing basis; and 


(11) The degree to which the application adequately provides for the requirements set forth in ยง 52d.5. 


(b) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to support the program without requiring the program to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 years. 


(c) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of the government. 


(d) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.
