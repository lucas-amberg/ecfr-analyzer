# § 56.303   Project elements.

A migrant health center supported under this subpart must: 


(a) Provide the health services of the center so that such services are available and accessible promptly, as appropriate, and in a manner which will assure continuity of service to the migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their families within the center's catchment area.

(2) Periodic assessment of the appropriateness of the utilization of services and the quality of services provided or proposed to be provided by the center, and by other providers through contract or other cooperative arrangement with the center. Such assessments must: 


(i) Be conducted by physicians or by other appropriate health professionals under the supervision of physicians or, as appropriate, by health professionals who are peers of the health professionals who provided the services;

(d) Develop management and control systems which are in accordance with sound financial management procedures, including the provision for an audit (1) conducted in accordance with the “Guide for Audits of Migrant Health Grants” of the DHHS Audit Agency, and (2) conducted with reasonable frequency, usually annually but not less frequently than every two years (unless waived for cause by the Secretary), to be made by qualified individuals who are sufficiently independent of those who authorize the expenditure of Federal funds to produce unbiased opinions, conclusions, or judgments, and to determine, at a minimum, the fiscal integrity of grant financial transactions and reports, and compliance with the applicable regulations of this part and the terms and conditions of the grant. 


(e) Where the cost of care and services furnished by or through the center is to be reimbursed under title XIX or title XX of the Social Security Act, obtain or make every reasonable effort to obtain a written agreement with the title XIX or title XX State agency for such reimbursement. 


(f) Have prepared a schedule of fees or payments for the provision of its services designed to cover its reasonable costs of operation and a corresponding schedule of discounts adjusted on the basis of the patient's ability to pay. The schedule of discounts must provide for a full discount to individuals and families with annual incomes at or below those set forth in the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the _Federal Register_ by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2); (except that nominal fees for service may be collected from such individuals and families) and for no discount to individuals and families with annual incomes greater than twice those set forth in such Guidelines.

(1) Provides for an annual operating budget and a three-year financial management plan which includes all anticipated income and expenses related to items which would, under generally accepted accounting principles, be considered income and expense items; 


(2) Provides for a capital expenditure plan for at least a three-year period (including the year to which the operating budget described in paragraph (h)(i)(1) is applicable) which includes and identifies in detail the anticipated sources of financing for, and the objective of, each anticipated expenditure in excess of $100,000 related to the acquisition of land, the improvement of land, buildings, and equipment and the replacement, modernization and expansion of buildings and equipment which would, under generally accepted accounting principles, be considered capital items; 


(3) Provides for plan review and updating at least annually; and 


(4) Is prepared under the direction of the governing board by a committee consisting of representatives of the governing board, the administrative staff, and the medical staff, if any, of the center. 


(j) Establish basic statistical data, cost accounting, management information, and reporting or monitoring systems which will enable the center to provide such statistics and other information as the Secretary may reasonably require relating to the center's costs of operation, patterns of utilization of services, and the availability, accessibility, and acceptability of its services, and to make such reports to the Secretary in a timely manner with such frequency as the Secretary may reasonably require. 


(k) Review its catchment area annually to insure that the criteria set out in § 56.104(b)(2) are met and, if criteria are not met, revise its catchment area, with the approval of the Secretary, to conform with such criteria to the extent feasible. 


(l) In the case of a center which serves a population including a substantial proportion of individuals of limited English-speaking ability, have developed a plan and made arrangements responsive to the needs of such populations for providing services to the extent practicable in the language and cultural context most appropriate to such individuals, and have identified an individual on its staff who is fluent in both that language and in English and whose responsibilities include providing guidance to such individuals and to appropriate staff members with respect to cultural sensitivities and bridging linguistic and cultural differences. If more than one non-English language is spoken by such group or groups, an individual or individuals fluent in those languages and English must be so identified. 


(m) Be operated in a manner calculated to preserve human dignity and to maximize acceptability and effective utilization of services. 


(n) To the extent possible, coordinate and integrate project activities with the activities of other federally funded, as well as State and local, health services delivery projects and programs serving the same population. 


(o) Establish means for evaluating progress toward the achievement of the specific objectives of the project. 


(p) Provide sufficient staff, qualified by training and experience, to carry out the activities of the center. 


(q) Assure that facilities utilized in the performance of the project meet applicable fire and life safety codes. 


(r) Utilize, to the maximum extent feasible, other Federal, State and local, and private resources available for support of the project, prior to use of project funds under this part.

(t) Where the center will provide services through contract or other cooperative arrangements with other providers of services, the center must: 


(1) Enter into the contract or arrangement only if the provider of services will provide the services in a timely manner and make the services accessible and acceptable to the population to be served; 


(2) Make payment for services so provided only pursuant to agreements with the providers in accordance with a schedule of rates and payment procedures established and maintained by the center. The center must be prepared to substantiate that such rates are reasonable and necessary; 


(3) Directly provide at least primary care unless the center has made arrangements for the provision of primary care which include transfer of all medical and financial information relating to such care to the center; and 


(4) Enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of primary health services only if alternative resources are reasonably available to provide these services in the event of termination of such arrangements. 


(u) Operate in a manner such that no migratory or seasonal agricultural worker or member of their family will be denied service by reason of his or her inability to pay therefor. *Provided, however,* That a charge for the provision of services will be made to the extent that a third party (including a Government agency) is authorized or is under legal obligation to pay such charges.
