(a) Each Federal capital contribution and Federal capital loan is subject to the condition that the school must maintain those records and file with the Secretary those reports relating to the operation of its health professions student loan funds as the Secretary may find necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act and these regulations. A school must submit required reports to the Secretary within 45 days of the close of the reporting period.


(1) A school which fails to submit a required report for its Federal capital contribution fund within 45 days of the close of the reporting period:


(i) Shall be prohibited from receiving new Federal capital contributions;


(ii) Must place the revolving fund and all subsequent collections in an insured interest-bearing account; and


(iii) May make no loan disbursements.


(2) A school that fails to submit a complete report within 6 months of the close of the reporting period will be subject to termination. The Secretary will provide the school with a written notice specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:


(i) The request for a hearing is untimely (i.e., fails to meet the 30-day requirement);


(ii) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or
