# § 57.1505   Approval of applications.

(a) *General.* Any application for loan guarantee or interest subsidies, or for a combination of both, may be approved by the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, only if he makes each of the applicable determinations set forth in section 721(c) of the Act. In addition:


(1) Any such approval shall be subject to compliance by the applicant with the applicable provisions set forth in §§ 57.106, 57.107, 57.108, and  *Provided however,* That for purposes of the title assurance in § 57.107(a) the period shall be not less than 20 years or the term of the guaranteed loan, whichever is longer or in the case of interim facilities, the term of the guaranteed loan, and


(2) Any such application may be approved by the Secretary only if he determines:


(i) That the applicant will have sufficient financial resources to enable him to comply with the terms and conditions of the loan;


(ii) That the applicant has the necessary legal authority to finance, construct, and maintain the proposed project, to apply for and receive the loan, and to pledge or mortgage any assets or revenues to be given as security for such loan;


(iii) That the loan will be made only with respect to the initial permanent financing of the project;


(iv) That the loan will be secured by a lien against the facilities to be constructed or against other security satisfactory to the Secretary specified in § 57.2210;


(v) That the rate of interest on the loan does not exceed such percent per annum as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States; and


(vi) Such additional determinations as the Secretary finds necessary with respect to particular applications in order to protect the financial interests of the United States.


(b) *Loan guarantees.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, any application for a loan guarantee may be approved by the Secretary only if he determines that the loan with respect to which such guarantee is sought would not be available to the applicant on reasonable terms and conditions without such guarantee. To assist the Secretary in making such determination, each applicant for a loan guarantee shall submit statements from at least three non-Federal institutions normally engaged in making long-term loans for construction, describing whether, and the terms and conditions under which, each institution would make a loan to the applicant for the project described in the application.


(c) *Interest subsidies.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, any application for interest subsidies may be approved by the Secretary only if he determines that without such interest subsidy payments the applicant would not, over a substantial portion of the loan term, be able to repay the principal and interest of the loan without jeopardizing the quality of the educational program.
