In determining whether there is good cause for waiver of any right of recovery which he may have against any applicant by reason of any payments made pursuant to a loan guarantee under this subpart, the Secretary shall take into consideration the extent to which:


(a) The facility with respect to which the loan guarantee was made will continue to be devoted by the applicant or other owner to the teaching of health professions personnel, or to other purposes in the sciences related to health for which funds are available under part B of title VII of the act and these regulations;


(b) A hospital or outpatient facility will be used as provided for under title VI of the act;


(c) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of the repayment period of the loan other facilities not previously utilized for the purpose for which the facility was constructed will be so utilized and are substantially equivalent in nature and extent for such purposes; and


(d) Such recovery would seriously curtail the training of qualified health professions personnel in the area served by the facility.
