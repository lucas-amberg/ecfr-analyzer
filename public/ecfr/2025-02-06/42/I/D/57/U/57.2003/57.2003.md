# ยง 57.2003   Determinations of increased enrollment solely for the program.

In the event the Secretary of Defense decides to enter into one or more contracts under 10 U.S.C. 2127(d), his determination as to whether an institution has increased its total enrollment in any fiscal year for the sole purpose of accepting members of the program will take into account the following considerations:


(a) A comparison of the total enrollment in said fiscal year with the total enrollments in immediately preceding fiscal years;


(b) Any increases in enrollment to which the institution has directly or indirectly committed itself in said fiscal year under: (1) Other Federal programs, such as those set forth in title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292 *et seq.*), the Veterans' Administration Medical School Assistance and Health Manpower Training Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-541, 86 Stat. 1100 (38 U.S.C. 5070 *et seq.*)) and section 225 of the Public Health Service Act (sec. 5, Pub. L. 92-585, 86 Stat. 1293 (42 U.S.C. 234)); (2) programs of State or local governments or other public or private agencies, or (3) any legally binding arrangement: *Provided,* That insofar as a single increase may be applied to satisfy the commitments under two or more programs and/or other arrangements, said increase shall be considered to meet all such commitments;


(c) Any unusual factors, such as: (1) An institution having been newly established or (2) an institution experiencing what is for it an abnormal rate of attrition and/or admission.
