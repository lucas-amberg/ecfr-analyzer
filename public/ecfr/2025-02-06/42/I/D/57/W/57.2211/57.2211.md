# § 57.2211   Waiver or suspension.

(a) Any obligation of any individual under this subpart will be cancelled upon the death of such individual as documented by a certification of death, or such other official proof as is conclusive under State law, and submitted to the Secretary.


(b) Subject to the provision of paragraph (f) of this section, where an individual fails to complete the practice required by § 57.2209(a) within the period prescribed in § 57.2209(b), the Secretary may waive or suspend for such period as determined by the Secretary the obligation of such individual to repay pursuant to § 57.2210 where the Secretary determines that compliance by such individual with such obligation (1) is impossible, or (2) would involve extreme hardship to such individual and enforcement of such obligation with respect to such individual would be against equity and good conscience.


(c) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, compliance by an individual will be deemed impossible where the Secretary determines, on the basis of such information and documentation as he may require, that the individual is permanently and totally disabled.


(d) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in determining whether compliance by an individual would involve extreme hardship to such individual and would be against equity and good conscience, the Secretary will take into consideration the following:


(1) The individual's present financial resources and obligations;


(2) The individual's estimated future financial resources and obligations;


(3) The reasons for the individual's failure to complete such practice within the prescribed period, such as problems of a personal nature; and


(4) The extent to which the individual is practicing his profession in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 784 of the Act.


(e) Where the Secretary determines that compliance by an individual with his obligation to engage in the practice of primary care in a specified shortage area pursuant to § 57.2209(a) is impossible or would involve extreme hardship to such individual and enforcement of such obligation with respect to such individual would be against equity and good conscience, the Secretary may waive such obligation and permit the individual at his option to practice either in any then current physician shortage area, or in such place or places, facility or facilities, and in such manner as the Secretary finds necessary to assure that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or members of their families. The Secretary will take into consideration in determining whether to grant a waiver under this paragraph the extent to which the individual has problems of a personal nature, e.g., physical or mental disability, terminal illness in the family, or need for financial support that cannot be supplied by the required service, which intrude upon the individual's ability to perform the required service in the specified shortage area.


(f) The Secretary may extend the period (prescribed in § 57.2209(b)) within which an individual must complete the practice required pursuant to § 57.2209(a) for a period not to exceed one year where the Secretary finds that (1) such individual is unable to complete such practice within such period because of a temporary physical or mental disability, or (2) completion by such individual of such practice within such period would involve extreme hardship to such individual and that failure to so extend such period would be against equity and good conscience.
