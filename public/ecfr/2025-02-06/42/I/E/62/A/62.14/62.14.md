# § 62.14   What are the special provisions relating to recipients of awards under the PH/NHSC scholarship training program who will also receive awards under the scholarship program?

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if a participant has previously received an award under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and also receives an award under the Scholarship Program, the terms and conditions of these regulations will apply to the participant's entire obligation incurred under both the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program.


(b) If a participant has received an award under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and also receives an award under the Scholarship Program, the following conditions apply:


(1) *Period of obligated service—carry over.* The period of obligated service owed by the participant is equal to the total number of school years for which scholarship support was awarded under both the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program without regard to either Program's minimum support requirement under 42 CFR 62.7(a) (1976) as adopted on May 22, 1974 (see 39 FR 17962), and under § 62.8(c) of this part.


(2) *Credit for internship and residency training.* (i) If a participant received a scholarship under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program for any school year beginning before October 12, 1976, the participant will receive credit toward satisfying the periods of obligated service incurred under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and under § 62.8 of this part for any periods of internship or residency training served in a Service or National Health Service Corps facility.


(ii) If a participant received a scholarship for the first time during the 1977-78 school year under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program, the participant will only receive 1 year of credit toward satisfying the period of obligated service incurred under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program for internship or residency training served in a Service or National Health Service Corps facility.


(3) *Default penalties.* The PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program default penalty will apply to a participant who fails to begin or complete the active duty service obligation incurred under that Program, and the § 62.10 default penalties will apply to a participant who fails to begin or complete the service obligation incurred under § 62.8 of these regulations. In determining which default penalty to apply when an individual who has received a Scholarship award under both the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program fails to begin or complete his service obligation, the service obligations will be considered to have been served in the order in which they were incurred.
