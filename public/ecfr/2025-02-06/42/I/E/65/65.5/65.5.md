A second level of review will be conducted for program relevance.


(b) Within the limits of funds available, the Director may award training grants to carry out those projects which have satisfied the requirements of the regulations of this part; are determined by the Director to be technically meritorious; and in the judgment of the Director best promote the purposes of the grant programs authorized by section 126(g) of the SARA or section 118 of the HMTA, the regulations of this part, and program priorities.
