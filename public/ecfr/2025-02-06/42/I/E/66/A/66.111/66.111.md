# § 66.111   Suspension, waiver, and cancellation.

(a) The Secretary may extend the period for undertaking service described in § 66.110(c), permit breaks in the continuous service required under § 66.110(c), or extend the period of repayment under § 66.110(e) if the Secretary determines that:


(1) An extension or break in service is necessary so the individual may complete his or her research training;


(2) Completion during the period would be impossible because the individual is temporarily disabled; or


(3) Completion during the period would involve a substantial hardship to the individual and failure to extend to the period would be against equity and good conscience.

(1) Fulfillment would be impossible because the individual is permanently and totally disabled; or


(2) Fulfillment would involve a substantial hardship to the individual and enforcement of the obligation would be against equity and good conscience.

(1) The individual's present financial resources and obligations;


(2) The individual's estimated future financial resources and obligations;
