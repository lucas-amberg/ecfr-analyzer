# § 67.15   Peer review of applications.

(a) *General procedures for peer review.* (1) All applications for support under this subpart will be submitted by the Administrator for review to a peer review group, in accordance with section 922(a) of the PHS Act, except that applications eligible for review under section 922(d)(2) of the PHS Act (“small grants”) may be reviewed under adjusted procedures in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(2) Members of the peer review group will be selected based upon their training and experience in relevant scientific and technical fields, taking into account, among other factors:


(i) The level of formal education (e.g., M.A., Ph.D., M.D., D.N.Sc.) completed by the individual and/or the individual's pertinent experience and expertise;


(ii) The extent to which the individual has engaged in relevant research, the capacities (e.g., principal investigator, assistant) in which the individual has done so, and the quality of such research;


(iii) The extent of the professional recognition received by the individual as reflected by awards and other honors received from scientific and professional organizations outside the Department of Health and Human Services;


(iv) The need of the peer review group to include within its membership experts representing various areas of specialization within relevant scientific and technical fields, or specific health care issues; and


(v) Appropriate representation based on gender, racial/ethnic origin, and geography.


(3) Review by the peer review group under paragraph (a) of this section is conducted by using the criteria set out in paragraph (c) of this section.


(4) The peer review group to which an application has been submitted under paragraph (a) of this section shall make a written report to the Administrator on each application, which shall contain the following parts:


(i) The first part of the report shall consist of a factual summary of the proposed project, including a description of its purpose, scientific approach, location, and total budget.


(ii) The second part of the report shall address the scientific and technical merit of the proposed project with a critique of the proposed project with regard to the factors described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(x) or (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vii) of this section as applicable. This portion of the report shall include a set of recommendations to the Administrator with respect to the disposition of the application based upon its scientific and technical merit. The peer review panel may recommend to the Administrator that an application:


(A) Be given consideration for funding,


(B) Be deferred for a later decision, pending receipt of additional information, or


(C) Not be given further consideration.


(iii) For each application recommended for further consideration by the Administrator, the report shall also provide a priority score based on the scientific and technical merit of the proposed project, and make recommendations on the appropriate project period and level of support. The report may also address, as applicable, the degree to which the proposed project relates to AHCPR-announced priorities.


(b) *Procedural adjustments for small grants.* (1) The Administrator may make adjustments in the peer review procedures established in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section for grant applications with total direct costs that do not exceed the amount specified in section 922(d)(2) of the PHS Act, hereafter referred to as “small grants.”


(2) Non-Federal and Federal experts will be selected by the Administrator for the review of small grant applications on the basis of their training and experience in particular scientific and technical fields, their knowledge of health services research and the application of research findings, and their special knowledge of the issue(s) being addressed or methods and technology being used in the specific proposal.


(3) Review of applications for small grants may be by a review group established in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, or by individual field readers, or by an ad hoc group of reviewers.


(4) The review criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section shall be used for the review of small grant applications.


(5) Each reviewer or group of reviewers to whom an application has been submitted under paragraph (b) of this section shall make a written report to the Administrator on each application. Each report shall summarize the findings of the review and provide a recommendation to the Administrator on whether the application should be given further consideration. For applications recommended for further consideration, the report may also address, as applicable, the degree to which the proposed project relates to AHCPR-announced priorities.


(c) *Review criteria.* The review criteria set out in this paragraph apply to both applications reviewed by peer review panels in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and applications for small grants reviewed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(xi) In addition to the scientific and technical criteria above, peer reviewers may be asked to consider the degree to which a proposed project addresses any special AHCPR priorities that have been announced by the Administrator, as applicable.


(2) *Review criteria for conference grants.* In carrying out reviews of conference grants under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the following review criteria will be taken into account, as appropriate:

An ad hoc group selected in accordance with § 67.15(a), or § 67.15(b) as applicable, may also be used for the review. Any individual reviewer to whom the conditions of this paragraph apply would also be disqualified as a reviewer.
