(a) All contract proposals for AHCPR support will be submitted by the Administrator for review to a peer review group, as required in section 922(a) of the PHS Act. Proposals will be reviewed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR Ch. I and III) and the requirements of the pertinent Request for Proposal.

(c) *Composition of peer review groups.* The peer review groups shall be composed of individuals, in accordance with section 922(c) of the PHS Act, as amended, who by virtue of their training or experience are eminently qualified to carry out the duties of such a peer review group. Officers and employees of the United States may not constitute more than 25 percent of the membership of any such group. Members of the peer review group will be selected based upon their training or experience in relevant scientific and technical fields, taking into account, among other factors:


(1) The level of formal education (e.g., M.A., Ph.D., M.D., D.N.Sc.) completed by the individual and/or, as appropriate, the individual's pertinent experience and expertise;


(2) The extent to which the individual has engaged in relevant research, the capacities (e.g., principal investigator, assistant) in which the individual has done so, and the quality of such research;


(3) The extent of the professional recognition received by the individual as reflected by awards and other honors received from scientific and professional organizations outside the Department of Health and Human Services;


(4) The need of the peer review group to include in its membership experts representing various areas of specialization in relevant scientific and technical fields, or specific health care issues; and


(5) Appropriate representation based on gender, racial/ethnic origin, and geography, to the extent practicable.


(d) *Term of peer review group members.* Notwithstanding section 922(c)(3) of the PHS Act, members of peer review groups appointed to review contract proposals will be appointed to such groups for a limited period of time, as determined by the Administrator; such as on an annual basis, or until the peer review of the contract proposals is completed, or until the expiration of the contract(s) awarded as a result of the peer review.


(e) *Conflict of interest.* (1) Members of peer review groups will be screened for potential conflicts of interest prior to appointment and will be required to follow Department policies and procedures consistent with the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635) and Executive Order 12674 (as modified by Executive Order 12731).


(2) In addition to any restrictions referenced under paragraph (e)(1) of this section:


(i) No member of a peer review group may participate in or be present during any review by such group of a contract proposal in which, to the member's knowledge, any of the following has a financial interest:


(A) The member or his or her spouse, minor child, or partner;


(B) Any organization in which the member is serving as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee; or


(C) Any organization with which the member is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment or other similar association, and further;


(ii) In the event any member of a peer review group or his or her spouse, parent, child, or partner is currently or expected to be the project director or member of the staff responsible for carrying out any contract requirements as specified in the contract proposal, that member is disqualified and will be replaced as appropriate.
