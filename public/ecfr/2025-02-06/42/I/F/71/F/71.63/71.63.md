(a) The Director may suspend the entry into the United States of animals, articles, or things from designated foreign countries (including political subdivisions and regions thereof) or places whenever the Director determines that such an action is necessary to protect the public health and upon a finding that:


(1) There exists in a foreign country (including one or more political subdivisions and regions thereof) or place a communicable disease the introduction, transmission, or spread of which would threaten the public health of the United States; and


(2) The entry of imports from that country or place increases the risk that the communicable disease may be introduced, transmitted, or spread into the United States.


(b) The Director shall designate the foreign countries or places and the period of time or conditions under which the introduction of imports into the United States shall be suspended. The Secretary or Director will coordinate in advance with other Federal agencies that have overlapping authority in the regulation of entry of animals, articles, or other things, as may be necessary to implement and enforce this provision.
