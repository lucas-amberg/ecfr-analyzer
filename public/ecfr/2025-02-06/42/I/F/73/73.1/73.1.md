(3) Availability, which means ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.


*Occupational exposure* means any reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, parenteral contact, or respiratory aerosol exposure to select agents or toxins that may result from the performance of an employee's duties.


*Overlap select agent and/or toxin* means a biological agent or toxin listed in § 73.4 and 9 CFR part 121.4.

*Proficiency testing* means the process of determining the competency of an individual or laboratory to perform a specified test or procedure.


*Recombinant nucleic acids* means:


(1) Molecules that are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and that can replicate in a living cell or


(2) Molecules that result from the replication of those described in paragraph (1) of this definition.


*Responsible Official* means the individual designated by an entity with the authority and control to ensure compliance with the regulations in this part.


*Security barrier* means a physical structure that is designed to prevent entry by unauthorized persons.


*Select agent and/or toxin* means unless otherwise specified, all of the biological agents or toxins listed in §§ 73.3 and 73.4.


*Specimen* means samples of material from humans, animals, plants or the environment or isolates or cultures from such samples for the diagnosis, verification, or proficiency testing.


*State* means any of the several States of the United States, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, or any other territory or possession of the United States.


*Synthetic nucleic acids* means:


(1) Molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules (*i.e.,* synthetic nucleic acids) or


(2) Molecules that result from the replication of those described in paragraph (1) of this definition.


*Toxin* means the toxic material or product of plants, animals, microorganisms (including, but not limited to, bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsiae, or protozoa), or infectious substances, or a recombinant or synthesized molecule, whatever their origin and method of production, and includes any poisonous substance or biological product that may be engineered as a result of biotechnology, produced by a living organism; or any poisonous isomer or biological product, homolog, or derivative of such a substance.


*United States* means all of the States.


*USDA* means the United States Department of Agriculture.


*Validated inactivation procedure* means a procedure, whose efficacy is confirmed by data generated from a viability testing protocol, to render a select agent non-viable but allows the select agent to retain characteristics of interest for future use; or to render any nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus non-infectious for future use.


*Viability testing protocol* means a protocol to confirm the validated inactivation procedure by demonstrating the material is free of all viable select agent.


*Verification* means the demonstration of obtaining established performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, and the analytical sensitivity and specificity) specifications for any procedure used for diagnosis.
