# Appendix A to Part 75—Standards for Accreditation of Educational Programs for Radiographers


The radiographer shall perform effectively by:


1. Applying knowledge of the principles of radiation protection for the patient, self, and others.


2. Applying knowledge of anatomy, positioning, and radiographic techniques to accurately demonstrate anatomical structures on a radiograph.


3. Determining exposure factors to achieve optimum radiographic technique with a minimum of radiation exposure to the patient.


4. Examining radiographs for the purpose of evaluating technique, positioning, and other pertinent technical qualities.


5. Exercising discretion and judgment in the performance of medical imaging procedures.


6. Providing patient care essential to radiologic procedures.


7. Recognizing emergency patient conditions and initiating lifesaving first aid.


1. Accreditation will be granted to the institution that assumes primary responsibility for curriculum planning and selection of course content; coordinates classroom teaching and supervised clinical education; appoints faculty to the program; receives and processes applications for admission; and grants the degree or certificate documenting completion of the program.


2. Educational programs may be established in:


(a) Community and junior colleges, senior colleges, and universities;


(b) Hospitals;


(c) Medical schools;


(d) Postsecondary vocational/technical schools and institutions; and


(e) Other acceptable institutions which meet comparable standards.


3. The sponsoring institutions and affiliate(s) must be accredited by a recognized agency. When the sponsoring institution and affilitate(s) are not so recognized, they may be considered as meeting the requirements of accreditation if the institution meets or exceeds established equivalent standards.


1. *General.* Appropriate classroom and clinical space, modern equipment, and supplies for supervised education shall be provided.


2. *Laboratory.* Energized laboratories utilized for teaching purposes shall be certified as required for compliance with Federal and/or State radiation safety regulations. The use of laboratories shall be governed by established educational objectives.


3. *Reference Materials.* Adequate up-to-date scientific books, periodicals, and other reference materials related to the curriculum and profession shall be readily accessible to students.


1. The clinical phase of the educational program shall provide an environment for supervised competency-based clinical education and experience and offer a sufficient and well-balanced variety of radiographic examinations and equipment.


2. An acceptable ratio of students to registered technologists shall be maintained in the clinical teaching environment.


3. A clinical instructor(s), who shall be responsible for supervising students according to objectives, shall be identified for each primary clinical education center.


4. The maximum student enrollment shall not exceed the capacity recommended on the basis of volume and variety of radiographic procedures, resources, and personnel available for teaching purposes.


5. In programs where didactic and clinical experience are not provided in the same institution, accreditation shall be given only to the institution responsible for admissions, curriculum, and academic credit. The accredited institution shall be responsible for coordinating the program and assuring that the activities assigned to the students in the clinical setting are educational. There shall be a uniform contract between the accredited institution and each of its affiliate hospitals, clearly defining the responsibilities and obligations of each.


1. The structure of the curriculum shall be based on not less than two calendar years of full-time study or its equivalent.


2. Instruction shall follow a planned outline that includes:


(a) The assignment of appropriate instructional materials;


(b) Classroom presentations, discussions and demonstrations; and


(c) Examinations in the didactic and clinical aspects of the program.


3. All professional courses, including clinical education, must include specific curriculum content that shall include, but shall not be limited to:


(a) Introduction to radiologic technology;


(b) Medical ethics;


(c) Imaging;


(d) Radiographic processing technique;


(e) Human structure and function;


(f) Medical terminology;


(g) Principals of radiographic exposure;


(h) Radiographic procedures;


(i) Principles of radiation protection;


(j) Radiographic film evaluation;


(k) Methods of patient care;


(l) Pathology;


(m) Radiologic physics; and


(n) Radiation biology.


Related subjects added to the professional curriculum shall meet the requirements of the degree-granting institution.


Financial resources for operation for the educational program shall be assured through regular budgets, gifts, grants, endowments, or fees.


1. *Program Director.* A program director shall be designated who is credentialed in radiography. The program director's responsibilities in teaching, administration, and coordination of the educational program in radiography shall not be adversely affected by educationally unrelated functions.


(a) *Minimum qualifications.* A minimum of two years of professional experience and proficiency in instructing, curriculum design, program planning, and counseling.


(b) *Responsibilities.* (1) The program director, in consultation with the medical director/advisor (G. 2.) shall be responsible for the organization, administration, periodic review, records, continued development, and general policy and effectiveness of the program.


(2) Opportunities for continuing education shall be provided for all faculty members.


2. *Medical Director/Medical Advisor*—(a) *minimum qualifications.* The medical director/ medical advisor shall be a qualified radiologist, certified by the American Board of Radiology, or shall possess suitable equivalent qualifications.


(b) *Responsibilities.* The medical director/medical advisor shall work in consultation with the program director in developing the goals and objectives of the program and implementing the standards for their achievement.


3. *Instructors.* All instructors shall be qualified through academic preparation and experience to teach the assigned subjects.


(a) Candidates for admission shall satisfy the following minimum requirements: Completion of four years of high school; successful completion of a standard equivalency test; or certification of equivalent education by an organization recognized by the United States Department of Education. Courses in physics, chemistry, biology, algebra, and geometry are strongly recommended.


(b) The number of students enrolled in each class shall be commensurate with the most effective learning and teaching practices and should also be consistent with acceptable student-teacher ratios.


Records shall be maintained as dictated by good educational practices.
