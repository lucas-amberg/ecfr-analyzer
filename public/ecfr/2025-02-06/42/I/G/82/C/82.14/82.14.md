# ยง 82.14   What types of information could be used in dose reconstructions?

NIOSH will obtain the types of information described in this section for dose reconstructions, as necessary and available: 


(a) *Subject and employment information,* including: 


(1) Gender; 


(2) Date of birth; and, 


(3) DOE and/or AWE employment history, including: job title held by year, and work location(s): including site names(s), building numbers(s), technical area(s), and duration of relevant employment or tasks. 


(b) *Worker monitoring data,* including: 


(1) External dosimetry data, including external dosimeter readings (film badge, TLD, neutron dosimeters); and, 


(2) Pocket ionization chamber data. 


(c) *Internal dosimetry data,* including: 


(1) Urinalysis results; 


(2) Fecal sample results; 


(3) In Vivo measurement results; 


(4) Incident investigation reports; 


(5) Breath radon and/or thoron results; 


(6) Nasal smear results; 


(7) External contamination measurements; and 


(8) Other measurement results applicable to internal dosimetry. 


(d) *Monitoring program data,* including: 


(1) Analytical methods used for bioassay analyses; 


(2) Performance characteristics of dosimeters for different radiation types; 


(3) Historical detection limits for bioassay samples and dosimeter badges; 


(4) Bioassay sample and dosimeter collection/exchange frequencies; 


(5) Documentation of record keeping practices used to record data and/or administratively assign dose; and, 


(6) Other information to characterize the monitoring program procedures and evaluate monitoring results. 


(e) *Workplace monitoring data,* including: 


(1) Surface contamination surveys; 


(2) General area air sampling results; 


(3) Breathing zone air sampling results; 


(4) Radon and/or thoron monitoring results; 


(5) Area radiation survey measurements (beta, gamma and neutron); and, 


(6) Fixed location dosimeter results (beta, gamma and neutron); and, 


(7) Other workplace monitoring results. 


(f) *Workplace characterization data,* including: 


(1) Information on the external exposure environment, including: radiation type (gamma, x-ray, proton, neutron, beta, other charged particle); radiation energy spectrum; uniformity of exposure (whole body vs partial body exposure); irradiation geometry; 


(2) Information on work-required medical screening x rays; and, 


(3) Other information useful for characterizing workplace radiation exposures. 


(g) *Information characterizing internal exposures,* including: 


(1) Radionuclide(s) and associated chemical forms; 


(2) Results of particle size distribution studies; 


(3) Respiratory protection practices; and 


(4) Other information useful for characterizing internal exposures. 


(h) *Process descriptions for each work location,* including: 


(1) General description of the process; 


(2) Characterization of the source term (i.e., the radionuclide and its quantity); 


(3) Extent of encapsulation; 


(4) Methods of containment; 


(5) Other information to assess potential for irradiation by source or airborne dispersion radioactive material.
