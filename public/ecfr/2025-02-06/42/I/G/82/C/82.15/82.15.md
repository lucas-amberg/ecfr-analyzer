# ยง 82.15   How will NIOSH evaluate the completeness and adequacy of individual monitoring data?

(a) NIOSH will evaluate the completeness and adequacy of an individual's monitoring data provided by DOE through one or more possible measures including, but not limited to: 


(1) Comparisons with information provided by claimants, co-workers, and other witnesses; 


(2) Comparisons with available information on area monitoring, production processes, and radiologic protection programs; 


(3) Comparisons with information documented in the records of unions representing covered employees; 


(4) Comparisons with data available on co-workers; and 


(5) Reviews of DOE contractor record systems. 


(b) NIOSH will evaluate the instruments and procedures used to collect individual monitoring data to determine whether they adequately characterized the radiation environments in which the covered employee worked, (adequately for the purpose of dose reconstruction,) based on present-day scientific understanding. For external dosimeter measurements, this includes an evaluation of the dosimeter response to the radiation types (gamma, x-ray, neutron, beta, or other charged particle) and the associated energy spectrum. For internal exposure, the methods used to analyze bioassay samples will be reviewed to determine their ability to detect the radionuclides present in the work environment. An analysis of the monitoring or exchange frequencies for the monitoring programs will also be conducted to determine the potential for undetected dose.
