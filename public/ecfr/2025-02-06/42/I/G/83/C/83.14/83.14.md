# ยง 83.14   How will NIOSH evaluate a petition by a claimant whose dose reconstruction NIOSH could not complete under 42 CFR part 82?

(a) NIOSH may establish two classes for evaluation, to permit the timely adjudication of the existing cancer claim: 


(1) A class of employees defined using the research and analyses already completed in attempting the dose reconstruction for the employee identified in the claimant's petition; and 


(2) A class of co-workers similar to the class defined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to be defined by NIOSH on the basis of further research and analyses, using the procedures under ยง 83.13. 


(b) NIOSH will determine the health endangerment criteria for adding the class under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the Cohort, using the procedures under ยง 83.13. NIOSH will report to the Board and to petitioner(s) the results of this determination, together with its finding under 42 CFR part 82 that there was insufficient information to complete the dose reconstruction. HHS will consider this finding under 42 CFR part 82 sufficient, without further consideration, to determine that it is not feasible to estimate the levels of radiation doses of individual members of the class with sufficient accuracy. 


(c) NIOSH will evaluate the petition as it may concern a class of co-workers, as described under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the procedures under ยง 83.13.
