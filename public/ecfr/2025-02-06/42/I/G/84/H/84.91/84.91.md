# ยง 84.91   Breathing resistance test; exhalation.

(a) Resistance to exhalation airflow will be measured in the facepiece or mouthpiece of open-circuit apparatus with air flowing at a continuous rate of 85 liters per minute.


(b) The exhalation resistance of demand apparatus shall not exceed 25 mm. (1 inch) water-column height.


(c) The exhalation resistance of pressure-demand apparatus shall not exceed the static pressure in the facepiece by more than 51 mm. (2 inches) water-column height.


(d) The static pressure (at zero flow) in the facepiece shall not exceed 38 mm. (1.5 inches) water-column height.


(e) Resistance to exhalation airflow will be measured in the facepiece or mouthpiece of closed-circuit apparatus with a breathing machine as described in ยง 84.88, and the exhalation resistance shall not exceed 51 mm. (2 inches) water-column height.
