# ยง 84.93   Gas flow test; open-circuit apparatus.

(a) A static-flow test will be performed on all open-circuit apparatus.


(b) The flow from the apparatus shall be greater than 200 liters per minute when the pressure in the facepiece of demand-apparatus is lowered by 51 mm. (2 inches) water-column height when full container pressure is applied.


(c) Where pressure demand apparatus are tested, the flow will be measured at zero gage pressure in the facepiece.


(d) Where apparatus with compressed-breathing-gas containers are tested, the flow test shall also be made with 3,450 kN/m.
2 (500 p.s.i.g.) container pressure applied.
