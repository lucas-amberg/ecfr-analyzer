(a) The completely assembled respirator will be worn in a chamber containing 0.1 ±0.025 percent isoamyl acetate vapor, the intake of the hose will be connected to a suitable source of respirable air, and not more than 25 percent of the hose length will be located in isoamyl acetate-free air.


(b) The minimum flow of air required to maintain a positive pressure in the respiratory-inlet covering throughout the entire breathing cycle will be supplied to the wearer, provided however, that airflow shall not be less than 115 liters per minute for tight-fitting and not less than 170 liters per minute for loose-fitting respiratory inlet-coverings.


(c) The test will be repeated with the maximum rate of flow attainable within specified operating pressures.
