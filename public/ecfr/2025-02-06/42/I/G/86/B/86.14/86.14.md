(d) The amount of any award shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of his estimate of the sum necessary for all or a designated portion of direct project costs plus an additional amount for indirect costs, if any, which will be calculated by the Secretary either (1) on the basis of his estimate of the actual indirect costs reasonably related to the project, or (2) on the basis of a percentage, not to exceed 8 percent, of all, or a portion of, the estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an estimated provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs (such as travel or supply costs) subject to upward (within the limits of available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has been determined by the Secretary.


(e) All grant awards shall be in writing, shall set forth the amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.


(f) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved project or portion thereof. For continuation support, grantees must make separate application annually at such times and in such form as the Secretary may direct.
