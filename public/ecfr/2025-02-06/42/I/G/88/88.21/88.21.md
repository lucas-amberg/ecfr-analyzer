(a) *Right to appeal.* A WTC Health Program member or the member's designated representative (appointed pursuant to ยง 88.2(a)) may appeal the following four types of decisions made by the WTC Health Program:


(1) To deny certification of a health condition as a WTC-related health condition;


(2) To deny certification of a health condition as medically associated with a WTC-related health condition;


(3) To decertify a WTC-related health condition or a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition; or


(4) To deny authorization of treatment for a certified health condition based on a finding that the treatment is not medically necessary.


(b) *Appeal request.* (1) A letter requesting an appeal must be postmarked within 120 calendar days of the date of the letter from the Administrator of the WTC Health Program notifying the member of the adverse decision. Electronic versions of a signed letter will be accepted if transmitted within 120 calendar days of the date of the Administrator's notification letter.


(2) A valid request for an appeal must:


(i) Be made in writing and signed;


(ii) Identify the member and designated representative (if applicable);


(iii) Describe the decision being appealed and the reason(s) why the member or designated representative believes the decision is incorrect and should be reversed. The description may include, but is not limited to, the following: Scientific or medical information correcting factual errors that may have been submitted to the WTC Health Program by the CCE or NPN; information demonstrating that the WTC Health Program did not correctly follow or apply relevant WTC Health Program policies or procedures; or any information demonstrating that the WTC Health Program's decision was not reasonable given the facts of the case. The basis provided in the appeal request must be sufficiently detailed and supported by information to permit a review of the appeal. Any new information not previously considered by the WTC Health Program must be included with the appeal request, unless later requested by the WTC Health Program; and


(iv) Be sent to the WTC Health Program at the address specified in the notice of denial.


(3) The appeal request may also state an intent to make a 15-minute oral statement by telephone. The WTC Health Program member or designated representative will have a second opportunity to schedule an oral statement after being contacted by the WTC Health Program regarding the appeal.


(c) *Appeal process.* Upon receipt of a valid appeal, the Administrator will appoint a Federal Official independent of the WTC Health Program to review the case. The Federal Official will review all available records relevant to the WTC Health Program's decision to deny certification of a health condition as a WTC-related health condition, deny certification of a health condition as medically associated with a WTC-related health condition, decertify the WTC-related health condition or health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition, or deny treatment authorization, and assess whether the appeal should be granted. The Federal Official's consideration will include the following: Whether the WTC Health Program substantially complied with all relevant WTC Health Program policies and procedures; whether the information supporting the WTC Health Program's decision was factually accurate; and whether the WTC Health Program's decision was reasonable as applied to the facts of the case.


(1) In conducting his or her review, the Federal Official will review the case record, including any oral statement made by the WTC Health Program member or the member's designated representative, as well as additional relevant new information submitted with the appeal request or provided by the WTC Health Program member or the member's designated representative at the request of the WTC Health Program.


(2) The Federal Official may consult one or more qualified experts to review the WTC Health Program's decision and any additional information provided by the WTC Health Program member or the member's designated representative. The expert reviewer(s) will submit their findings to the Federal Official.


(3) The Federal Official will provide his or her recommendation regarding the disposition of the appeal, including his or her findings and any supporting materials (including the transcript of any oral statement and any expert reviewers' findings), to the Administrator.


(d) *Final decision and notification.* The Administrator will review the Federal Official's recommendation and any relevant information and make a final decision on the appeal. The Administrator will notify the WTC Health Program member and/or the member's designated representative of the following in writing:


(1) The recommendation and findings made by the Federal Official as a result of the review;


(2) The Administrator's final decision on the appeal;


(3) An explanation of the reason(s) for the Administrator's final decision on the appeal; and


(4) Any administrative actions taken by the WTC Health Program in response to the Administrator's final decision.
