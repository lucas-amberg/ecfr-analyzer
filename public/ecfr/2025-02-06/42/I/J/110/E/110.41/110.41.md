# ยง 110.41   How to file a Request Package.

A Request Package comprises all the forms and documentation that are submitted to enable the Secretary to determine eligibility and calculate benefits. Request Packages may be submitted through the U.S. Postal Service, commercial carrier, or private courier service. The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program will not accept Request Packages that are hand-delivered. Electronic submissions are not currently accepted, but may be in the future. The Program will publish a notice if electronic filing becomes available. Requesters (or their representatives) should send all forms and documentation to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, Room 11C-26, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. All documentation to the Program must include the case number once one has been assigned to the requester.
