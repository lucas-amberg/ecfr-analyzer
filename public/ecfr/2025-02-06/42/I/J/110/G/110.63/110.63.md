# § 110.63   Documentation a legal or personal representative must submit when filing on behalf of a minor or on behalf of an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits.

Before benefits will be paid by the Program to an eligible requester who is a minor or an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits, his or her legal or personal representative must submit the following, in addition to the documentation required under Subpart F of this part and, as applicable, §§ 110.60-110.62:


(a) For an eligible requester who is a minor:


(1) Documentation showing that the requester is a minor (*e.g.,* birth certificate); and


(2) Documentation showing that the representative is the legal guardian of the property or estate of the minor (*e.g.,* appointment of guardianship by a court of competent jurisdiction). If a minor has more than one legal guardian, this documentation is required only of one legal guardian. In the alternative, documentation showing that the minor is considered emancipated under applicable State law. In accordance with § 110.83(b), the Program reserves the right to waive the requirement of documentation of guardianship for good cause.


(b) For an eligible requester who is an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits:


(1) Documentation showing that the requester is an adult who lacks this legal capacity (e.g., declaration of legal incapacity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or comparable documentation); and


(2) A decree by a court of competent jurisdiction establishing a guardianship or conservatorship of the requester's estate under applicable State law, or durable power of attorney, if applicable. In accordance with § 110.83(b), the Program reserves the right to waive this requirement for good cause.
