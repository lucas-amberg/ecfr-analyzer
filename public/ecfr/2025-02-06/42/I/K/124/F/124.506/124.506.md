(iv) If services will be made available to Category B persons at a reduced charge, specify the method used for reducing charges, and provide that the method is applicable to all persons in Category B;


(v) With respect to nursing homes only, if services will be made available to Category C persons at a reduced charge, specify the method used for reducing charges, provided that such method may not result in greater reductions than those afforded to Category B persons, and provide that this method is applicable to all persons in Category C; and


(vi) Provide that the facility provides uncompensated services to all persons eligible under the plan who request uncompensated services.


(2) A facility must adopt an allocation plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) by publishing the plan in a newspaper of general circulation in its area. The plan may take effect no earlier than 60 days following the date of publication.


(b)(1) If in any fiscal year a facility fails to adopt and publish a plan in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it shall provide uncompensated services in accordance with the last plan it published in a newspaper of general circulation in its area.


(2) If no plan was previously published in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the facility must provide uncompensated services without charge to all applicants in Category A and Category B, and, with respect to nursing homes, Category C, who request service in the facility.
