(5) The compatibility of the proposed project with the published goals and responsibilities of the IHS in carrying out its statutory mission.


(b) The Notice of Grant Awards specifies how long the Secretary intends to support the project period without requiring the project to re-compete for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for one to two years. The total project period comprises the original project period and any extension. Generally the grant will be for a one-year budget period, any subsequent award will also be a one-year budget period. A grantee must submit a separate application for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all cases, awards require a determination by the Secretary that funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.


(c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.
