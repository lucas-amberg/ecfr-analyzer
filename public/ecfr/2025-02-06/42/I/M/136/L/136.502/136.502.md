# § 136.502   Purpose of this subpart.

The CHEF is authorized by section 202 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) [25 U.S.C. 1621a]. The CHEF is administered by the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (“the Secretary”) acting through the Headquarters of IHS, solely for the purpose of meeting extraordinary medical costs associated with treatment of victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses who are within the responsibility of the Service. This subpart:


(a) Establishes definitions of terms governing the CHEF, including definitions of disasters and catastrophic illnesses for which the cost of treatment provided under contract would qualify for payment from the CHEF;


(b) Establishes a threshold level for reimbursement for the cost of treatment;


(c) Establishes procedures for reimbursement of the portion of the costs incurred by Service Units that exceeds such threshold costs, including procedures for when the exigencies of the medical circumstances warrant treatment prior to the authorization of such treatment by the Service; and


(d) Establishes procedures for reimbursements pending the outcome or payment by alternate resources.
