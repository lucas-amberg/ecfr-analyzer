# ยง 137.210   What happens if self-governance activities under Title V reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings?

To the extent that PSFAs carried out by Self-Governance Tribes under Title V reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that have not otherwise been included in the amount of Tribal shares and other funds determined under section 508(c) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-7(c)], the Secretary must make such savings available to the Self-Governance Tribes, for the provision of additional services to program beneficiaries in a manner equitable to directly served, contracted, and compacted programs.
