# ยง 137.200   Are there reporting requirements for Self-Governance Tribes under Title V?

Yes, compacts or funding agreements negotiated between the Secretary and a Self-Governance Tribe must include a provision that requires the Self-Governance Tribe to report on health status and services delivery. These reports may only impose minimal burdens on the Self-Governance Tribes.
