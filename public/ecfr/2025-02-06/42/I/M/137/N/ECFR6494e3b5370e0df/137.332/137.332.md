# ยง 137.332   On what basis may the Secretary reject a final construction project proposal?

(a) The only basis for rejection of project activities in a final construction project proposal are: 


(1) The amount of funds proposed in the final construction project proposal exceeds the applicable funding level for the construction project as determined under sections 508(c) [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-7(c)] and 106 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450j-1]. 


(2) The final construction project proposal does not meet the minimum content requirements for construction project agreements set forth in section 501(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa(a)(2)]; and 


(3) The final construction project proposal on its face clearly demonstrates that the construction project cannot be completed as proposed. 


(b) For construction programs proposed to be included in a construction project agreement, the Secretary may also reject that portion of the proposal that proposes to assume an inherently Federal function that cannot legally be delegated to the Self-Governance Tribe.
