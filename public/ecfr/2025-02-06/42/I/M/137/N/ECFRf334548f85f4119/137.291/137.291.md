# ยง 137.291   May Self-Governance Tribes carry out construction projects without assuming these Federal environmental responsibilities?

Yes, but not under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]. Self-Governance Tribes may otherwise elect to perform construction projects, or phases of construction projects, under other legal authorities (see ยง 137.272).
