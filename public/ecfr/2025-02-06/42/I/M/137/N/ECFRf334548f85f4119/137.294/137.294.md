# ยง 137.294   What is the typical IHS environmental review process for construction projects?

(a) Most IHS construction projects normally do not have a significant impact on the environment, and therefore do not require environmental impact statements (EIS). Under current IHS procedures, an environmental review is performed on all construction projects. During the IHS environmental review process, the following activities may occur: 


(1) Consult with appropriate Tribal, Federal, state, and local officials and interested parties on potential environmental effects; 


(2) Document assessment of potential environmental effects; (IHS has developed a form to facilitate this process.) 


(3) Perform necessary environmental surveys and inventories; 


(4) Consult with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, acting through the SHPO or THPO, to ensure compliance with the NHPA; 


(5) Determine if extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist that would prevent the project from meeting the criteria for categorical exclusion from further environmental review under NEPA, or if an environmental assessment is required; 


(6) Obtain environmental permits and approvals; and 


(7) Identify methods to avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects;
