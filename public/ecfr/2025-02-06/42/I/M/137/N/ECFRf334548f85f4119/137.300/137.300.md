# ยง 137.300   Since Federal environmental responsibilities are new responsibilities, which may be assumed by Tribes under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8], are there additional funds available to Self-Governance Tribes to carry out these formerly inherently Federal responsibilities?

Yes, the Secretary must transfer not less than the amount of funds that the Secretary would have otherwise used to carry out the Federal environmental responsibilities assumed by the Self-Governance Tribe.
