# ยง 137.311   Are Self-Governance Tribes entitled to determine the nature and scope of the limited immunity waiver required under section 509(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8(a)(2)]?

(a) Yes, Section 509(a)(2) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8(a)(2)] only requires that the waiver permit a civil enforcement action to be brought against the Tribal certifying officer in his or her official capacity in Federal district court for declaratory and injunctive relief in a procedure that is substantially equivalent to an APA enforcement action against a Federal agency. Self-Governance Tribes are not required to subject themselves to suit in their own name, to submit to trial by jury or civil discovery, or to waive immunity for money damages, attorneys fees, or fines. 


(b) Self-Governance Tribes may base the grant of a limited waiver under this subpart on the understanding that: 


(1) Judicial review of the Tribal certifying official's actions are based upon the administrative record prepared by the Tribal official in the course of performing the Federal environmental responsibilities; and 


(2) Actions and decisions of the Tribal certifying officer will be granted deference on a similar basis as Federal officials performing similar functions.
