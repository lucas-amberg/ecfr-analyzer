# ยง 137.441   Will there be a hearing?

Yes, unless the Self-Governance Tribe waives its right to a hearing in writing. The Deputy Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals must appoint an Administrative Law Judge to hold a hearing,


(a) The hearing must be held within 10 days of the date of the notice referred to in ยง 137.440 unless the Self-Governance Tribe agrees to a later date. 


(b) If possible, the hearing will be held at the office of the Self-Governance Tribe. If the hearing is held more than 50 miles from the office of the Self-Governance Tribe, the Secretary must arrange to pay transportation costs and per diem for incidental expenses. This will allow for adequate representation of the Self-Governance Tribe.
