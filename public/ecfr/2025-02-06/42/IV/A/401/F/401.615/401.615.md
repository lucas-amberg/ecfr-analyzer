# ยง 401.615   Payment of compromise amount.

(a) *Time and manner of compromise.* Payment by the debtor of the amount that CMS has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a claim must be made within the time and in the manner prescribed by CMS. Accordingly, CMS will not settle a claim until the full payment of the compromise amount has been made.


(b) *Effect of failure to pay compromise amount.* Failure of the debtor to make payment, as provided by the compromise agreement, reinstates the full amount of the claim, less any amounts paid prior to the default.


(c) *Prohibition against grace periods.* CMS will not agree to inclusion of a provision in an installment agreement that would permit grace periods for payments that are late under the terms of the agreement.
