# § 401.617   Suspension of collection action.

(a) *General conditions.* CMS may temporarily suspend collection action on a claim if the following general conditions are met—


(1) *Amount of future recovery.* CMS determines that future collection action may result in a recovery of an amount sufficient to justify periodic review and action on the claim by CMS during the period of suspension.


(2) *Statute of limitations.* CMS determines that—


(i) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled, waived or has started running anew; or


(ii) Future collections may be made by CMS through offset despite an applicable statute of limitations.


(b) *Basis for suspension.* Bases on which CMS may suspend collection action on a particular claim include the following—


(1) A debtor cannot be located; or


(2) A debtor—


(i) Owns no substantial equity in property;


(ii) Is unable to make payment on CMS's claim or is unable to effect a compromise; and 


(iii) Has future prospects that justify retention of the claim.


(c) *Locating debtors.* CMS will make every reasonable effort to locate missing debtors sufficiently in advance of the bar of an applicable statute of limitations to permit timely filing of a lawsuit to recover the amount of the claim.


(d) *Effect of suspension on liquidation of security.* CMS will liquidate security, obtained in partial recovery of a claim, despite a decision under this section to suspend collection action against the debtor for the remainder of the claim.
