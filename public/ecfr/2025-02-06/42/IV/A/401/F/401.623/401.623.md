# ยง 401.623   Joint and several liability.

(a) *Collection action.* CMS will liquidate claims as quickly as possible. In cases of joint and several liability among two or more debtors, CMS will not allocate the burden of claims payment among the debtors. CMS will proceed with collection action against one debtor even if other liable debtors have not paid their proportionate shares.


(b) *Compromise.* Compromise with one debtor does not release a claim against remaining debtors. Furthermore, CMS will not consider the amount of a compromise with one debtor to be a binding precedent concerning the amounts due from other debtors who are jointly and severally liable on the claim.
