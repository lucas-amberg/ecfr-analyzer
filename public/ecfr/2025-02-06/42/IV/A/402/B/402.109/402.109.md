# ยง 402.109   Statistical sampling.

(a) *Purpose.* CMS or OIG may introduce the results of a statistical sampling study to show the number and amount of claims subject to sanction under this part that the respondent presented or caused to be presented.


(b) *Prima facie evidence.* The results of the statistical sampling study, if based upon an appropriate sampling and computed by valid statistical methods, constitute prima facie evidence of the number and amount of claims or requests for payment subject to sanction under ยง 402.1.


(c) *Burden of proof.* Once CMS or OIG has made a prima facie case, the burden is on the respondent to produce evidence reasonably calculated to rebut the findings of the statistical sampling study. CMS or OIG then has the opportunity to rebut this evidence.
