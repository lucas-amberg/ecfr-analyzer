# § 402.302   Basis for reinstatement.

(a) The initiating agency authorizes reinstatement if it determines that—


(1) The period of exclusion has expired;


(2) There are reasonable assurances that the types of actions that formed the basis for the original exclusion did not recur and will not recur; and


(3) There is no additional basis under title XVIII of the Act that justifies the continuation of the exclusion.


(b) The initiating agency does not authorize reinstatement if it determines that submitting claims or causing claims to be submitted or payments to be made by the Medicare program for items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed, may serve as a basis for denying reinstatement. This section applies regardless of whether the excluded person has obtained a Medicare provider number (or equivalent), either as an individual or as a member of a group, before being reinstated.


(c) In making a determination regarding reinstatement, the initiating agency considers the following:


(1) Conduct of the excluded person occurring before the date of the notice of the exclusion, if that conduct was not known to the initiating agency at the time of the exclusion;


(2) Conduct of the excluded person after the date of the exclusion;


(3) Whether all fines and all debts due and owing (including overpayments) to any Federal, State, or local government that relate to Medicare, Medicaid, or, where applicable, any Federal, State, or local health care program are paid in full, or satisfactory arrangements are made to fulfill these obligations;


(4) Whether the excluded person complies with, or has made satisfactory arrangements to fulfill, all of the applicable conditions of participation or conditions of coverage under the Medicare statutes and regulations; and


(5) Whether the excluded person has, during the period of exclusion, submitted claims, or caused claims to be submitted or payment to be made by Medicare, Medicaid, and, where applicable, any other Federal health care program, for items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed, and the conditions under which these actions occurred.


(d) Reinstatement is not effective until the initiating agency grants the request and provides notices under § 402.304. Reinstatement is effective as provided in the notice.


(e) A determination for a denial of reinstatement is not appealable or reviewable except as provided in § 402.306.


(f) An ALJ may not require reinstatement of an excluded person in accordance with this chapter.
