# § 402.304   Approval of request for reinstatement.

(a) If the initiating agency grants a request for reinstatement, the initiating agency—


(1) Gives written notice to the excluded person specifying the date of reinstatement; and


(2) Notifies appropriate Federal and State agencies, and, to the extent possible, all others that were originally notified of the exclusion, that the person is reinstated into the Medicare program.


(b) A determination by the initiating agency to reinstate an excluded person has no effect if Medicare, Medicaid, or, where applicable, any other Federal health care program has imposed a longer period of exclusion under its own authorities.
