# § 405.503   Determining customary charges.

(a) *Customary charge defined.* The term “customary charges” will refer to the uniform amount which the individual physician or other person charges in the majority of cases for a specific medical procedure or service. In determining such uniform amount, token charges for charity patients and substandard charges for welfare and other low income patients are to be excluded. The reasonable charge cannot, except as provided in § 405.506, be higher than the individual physician's or other person's customary charge. The customary charge for different physicians or other persons may, of course, vary. Payment for covered services would be based on the actual charge for the service when, in a given instance, that charge is less than the amount which the carrier would otherwise have found to be within the limits of acceptable charges for the particular service. Moreover, the income of the individual beneficiary is not to be taken into account by the carrier in determining the amount which is considered to be a reasonable charge for a service rendered to him. There is no provision in the law for a carrier to evaluate the reasonableness of charges in light of an individual beneficiary's economic status. 


(b) *Variation of charges.* If the individual physician or other person varies his charges for a specific medical procedure or service, so that no one amount is charged in the majority of cases, it will be necessary for the carrier to exercise judgment in the establishment of a “customary charge” for such physician or other person. In making this judgment, an important guide, to be utilized when a sufficient volume of data on the physician's or other person's charges is available, would be the median or midpoint of his charges, excluding token and substandard charges as well as exceptional charges on the high side. A significant clustering of charges in the vicinity of the median amount might indicate that a point of such clustering should be taken as the physician's or other person's “customary” charge. Use of relative value scales will help in arriving at a decision in such instances. 


(c) *Use of relative value scales.* If, for a particular medical procedure or service, the carrier is unable to determine the customary charge on the basis of reliable statistical data (for example, because the carrier does not yet have sufficient data or because the performance of the particular medical procedure or service by the physician or other person is infrequent), the carrier may use appropriate relative value scales to determine the customary charge for such procedure or service in relation to customary charges of the same physician or person for other medical procedures and services. 


(d) *Revision of customary charge.* A physician's or other person's customary charge is not necessarily a static amount. Where a physician or other person alters his charges, a revised pattern of charges for his services may develop. Where on the basis of adequate evidence, the carrier finds that the physician or other person furnishing services has changed his charge for a service to the public in general, the customary charge resulting from the revised charge for the service should be recognized as the customary charge in making determinations of reasonable charges for such service when rendered thereafter to supplementary insurance beneficiaries. If the new customary charge is not above the top of the range of prevailing charges (see § 405.504(a)), it should be deemed to be reasonable by the carrier, subject to the provisions of § 405.508.
