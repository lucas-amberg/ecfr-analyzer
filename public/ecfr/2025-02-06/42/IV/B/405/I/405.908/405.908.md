# ยง 405.908   Medicaid State agencies.

When a beneficiary is enrolled to receive benefits under both Medicare and Medicaid, the Medicaid State agency may file a request for an appeal with respect to a claim for items or services furnished to a dually eligible beneficiary only for services for which the Medicaid State agency has made payment, or for which it may be liable. A Medicaid State agency is considered a party only when it files a timely redetermination request with respect to a claim for items or services furnished to a beneficiary in accordance with 42 CFR parts 940 through 958. If a State agency files a request for redetermination, it may retain party status at the QIC, OMHA, Council, and judicial review levels.
