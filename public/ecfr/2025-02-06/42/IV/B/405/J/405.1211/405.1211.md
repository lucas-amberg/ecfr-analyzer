(1) A hospital changes a beneficiary's status from an inpatient to an outpatient receiving observation services; and


(2) The beneficiary meets other eligibility criteria as specified in § 405.1210(a)(3).


(b) *Requesting an expedited determination.* (1) An eligible beneficiary who wishes to exercise the right to an expedited determination must submit a request to the QIO that has an agreement with the hospital as specified in § 476.78 of this chapter.

(5) An eligible beneficiary who fails to make a timely request for an expedited determination by a QIO, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may still request an untimely expedited QIO determination at any time. The QIO issues a decision in accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, but the billing protection under paragraph (e) of this section does not apply.

(7) If the QIO does not receive the information specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, it may make its determination based on the evidence at hand, or it may defer a decision until it receives the requested information.


(8) When the QIO issues an expedited determination, the QIO must notify the eligible beneficiary, the hospital, and SNF (if applicable) of its decision by telephone, followed by a written notice that must include the following information:

(ii) The hospital must furnish this information as soon as possible, but no later than by noon of the calendar day after the QIO notifies the hospital of the request for an expedited determination.


(iii) At the discretion of the QIO, the hospital must make the information available by phone or in writing (with a written record of any information not transmitted initially in writing).

(f) *Effect of an expedited QIO determination.* The QIO determination is binding for payment purposes upon the eligible beneficiary, hospital, and MAC, except if the eligible beneficiary is dissatisfied with the determination, he or she may request a reconsideration according to the procedures described in § 405.1212.
