# § 405.1869   Scope of Board's authority in a hearing decision.

(a) If the Board has jurisdiction to conduct a hearing on a specific matter at issue under section 1878(a) or (b) of the Act and § 405.1840 of this subpart, and the legal authority to fully resolve the matter in a hearing decision (as described in §§ 405.1842(f), 405.1867, and 405.1871 of this subpart), section 1878 of the Act, and paragraph (a) of this section give the Board the power to affirm, modify, or reverse the contractor's findings on each specific matter at issue in the contractor determination for the cost reporting period under appeal, and to make additional revisions on specific matters regardless of whether the contractor considered the matters in issuing the contractor determination. The Board's power to make additional revisions in a hearing decision does not authorize the Board to consider or decide a specific matter at issue for which it lacks jurisdiction (as described in § 405.1840(b) of this subpart) or which was not timely raised in the provider's hearing request. The Board's power under section 1878(d) of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section to make additional revisions is limited to those revisions necessary to resolve fully a specific matter at issue if—


(1) The Board has jurisdiction to grant a hearing on the specific matter at issue under section 1878(a) or (b) of the Act and § 405.1840 of this subpart; and


(2) The specific matter at issue was timely raised in an initial request for a Board hearing filed in accordance with § 405.1835 or § 405.1837 of this subpart, as applicable, or in a timely request to add issues to a single provider appeal submitted in accordance with § 405.1835(c) of this subpart.


(b)(1) If the Board has jurisdiction to conduct a hearing on a specific matter at issue solely under §§ 405.1840 and 405.1835 or § 405.1837 of this subpart, as applicable, and the legal authority to fully resolve the matter in a hearing decision (as described in §§ 405.1842(f), 405.1867, and 405.1871 of this subpart), the Board is authorized to do the following:


(i) Affirm, modify, or reverse the contractor's or Secretary's findings on each specific matter at issue in the contractor or Secretary determination under appeal.


(ii) Make additional revisions on each specific matter at issue regardless of whether the contractor considered these revisions in issuing the contractor determination under appeal, provided the Board does not consider or decide a specific matter for which it lacks jurisdiction (as described in § 405.1840(b) of this subpart) or that was not timely raised in the provider's hearing request.


(2) The Board's authority under this section to make the additional revisions is limited to those revisions necessary to resolve a specific matter at issue.
