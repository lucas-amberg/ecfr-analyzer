# ยง 405.2110   Designation of ESRD networks.

CMS designated ESRD networks in which the approved ESRD facilities collectively provide the necessary care for ESRD patients.


(a) *Effect on patient choice of facility.* The designation of networks does not require an ESRD patient to seek care only through the facilities in the designated network where the patient resides, nor does the designation of networks limit patient choice of physicians or facilities, or preclude patient referral by physicians to a facility in another designated network.


(b) *Redesignation of networks.* CMS will redesignate networks, as needed, to ensure that the designations are consistent with ESRD program experience, consistent with ESRD program objectives specified in ยง 405.2101, and compatible with efficient program administration.
