# § 407.20   Special enrollment period related to coverage under group health plans.

(a) *Terminology*—(1) *Group health plan (GHP) and large group health plan (LGHP).* These terms have the meanings given them in § 411.101 of this chapter except that the “former employee” language of those definitions does not apply with respect to SEPs for the reasons specified in § 406.24(a)(3) of this chapter. 


(2) *Special enrollment period (SEP).* This term has the meaning set forth in § 406.24(a)(4) of this chapter. In order to use a SEP, an individual must meet the conditions of paragraph (b) and of paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate. 


(b) *General rule.* All individuals must meet the following conditions: 


(1) They are eligible to enroll for SMI on the basis of age or disability, but not on the basis of end-stage renal disease. 


(2) When first eligible for SMI coverage (4th month of their initial enrollment period), they were covered under a GHP or LGHP on the basis of current employment status or, if not so covered, they enrolled in SMI during their initial enrollment period; and 


(3) For all months thereafter, they maintained coverage under either SMI or a GHP or LGHP. (Generally, if an individual fails to enroll in SMI during any available SEP, he or she is not entitled to any additional SEPs. However, if an individual fails to enroll during a SEP because coverage under the same or a different GHP or LGHP was restored before the end of that particular SEP, that failure to enroll does not preclude additional SEPs.) 


(c) *Special rule: Individual age 65 or over.* For an individual who is or was covered under a GHP, coverage must be by reason of the current employment status of the individual or the individual's spouse. 


(d) *Special rules: Disabled individual.*4 Individuals entitled on the basis of disability (but not on the basis of end-stage renal disease) must meet conditions that vary depending on whether they were covered under a GHP or an LGHP. 


(1) For a disabled individual who is or was covered under a GHP, coverage must be on the basis of the current employment status of the individual or the individual's spouse. 


(2) For a disabled individual who is or was covered under an LGHP, coverage must be as follows: 


(i) Before August 10, 1993, as an “active individual”, that is, as an employee, employer, self-employed individual (such as the employer), individual associated with the employer in a business relationship, or as a member of the family of any of those persons. 


(ii) On or after August 10, 1993, by reason of current employment status of the individual or a member of the individual's family. 


(e) *Effective date of coverage.* The rule set forth in § 406.24(d) for Medicare Part A applies equally to Medicare Part B.
