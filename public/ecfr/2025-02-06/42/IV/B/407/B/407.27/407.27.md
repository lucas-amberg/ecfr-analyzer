# ยง 407.27   Termination of entitlement: Individual enrollment.

An individual's entitlement will terminate for any of the following reasons: 


(a) *Death.* Entitlement to SMI ends on the last day of the month in which the individual dies. 


(b) *Termination of hospital insurance benefits.* If an individual's entitlement to hospital insurance ends before the month in which he or she attains age 65, entitlement to SMI will end on the same day unless it has been previously terminated in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. 


(c) *Request by individual.* An individual may at any time give CMS or SSA written notice that he or she no longer wishes to participate in SMI, and request disenrollment. 


(1) Before July 1987, entitlement ended at the end of the calendar quarter after the quarter in which the individual filed the disenrollment request. 


(2) For disenrollment requests filed in or after July 1987, entitlement ends at the end of the month after the month in which the individual files the disenrollment request. 


(d) *Nonpayment of premiums.* If an individual fails to pay the premiums, entitlement will end as provided in the rules for SMI premiums, set forth in part 408 of this chapter.
