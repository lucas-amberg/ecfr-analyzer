# ยง 408.43   Deduction from social security benefits.

SSA, acting as CMS's agent, deducts the premiums from the monthly social security benefits if the enrollee is not entitled to railroad retirement benefits. (If the benefit is less than the monthly premium, the benefit is withheld and the enrollee is required to pay the balance through direct remittance.)
