# § 408.53   Change from partial direct remittance to full deduction.

If a benefit that was less than the premium (and therefore required direct remittance of the difference) is increased to an amount equal to, or greater than, the premium—


(a) The full premium is paid from the benefit; and


(b) Any amounts the enrollee had paid toward premiums not yet due are refunded.
