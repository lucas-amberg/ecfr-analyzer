# ยง 409.85   Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care coinsurance.

(a) *General provisions.* (1) SNF care coinsurance is the amount chargeable to a beneficiary after the first 20 days of SNF care in a benefit period.


(2) For each day from the 21st through the 100th day, the coinsurance is 
1/8 of the applicable inpatient hospital deductible.


(3) For coinsurance days before January 1, 1982, the coinsurance amount is based on the deductible applicable for the year in which the benefit period began. The coinsurance amounts do not change during a beneficiary's benefit period even though the coinsurance days may fall in a subsequent year for which a higher deductible amount has been determined.


(4) For coinsurance days after December 31, 1981, the coinsurance amount is based on the deductible applicable for the calendar year in which the services were furnished.


(b) *Specific coinsurance amounts.* The specific SNF coinsurance amounts for each calendar year are published in the _Federal Register_ no later than October 1 of the preceding year.


(c) *Exception to published amounts.* If the actual charge to the patient is less than the coinsurance amount applicable for the calendar year in which the services were furnished, the actual charge per day is the daily coinsurance.
