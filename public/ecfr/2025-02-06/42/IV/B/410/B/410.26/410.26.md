(2) *Direct supervision* means, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the level of supervision by the physician (or other practitioner) of auxiliary personnel as defined in § 410.32(b)(3)(ii). For the following services furnished after December 31, 2025, the presence of the physician (or other practitioner) required for direct supervision may include virtual presence through audio/video real-time communications technology (excluding audio-only):


(i) Services furnished incident to the services of a physician or other practitioner when provided by auxiliary personnel employed by the billing practitioner and working under their direct supervision and for which the underlying Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code has been assigned a PC/TC indicator of `5'.


(ii) Office or other outpatient visits for the evaluation and management of an established patient that may not require the presence of a physician or other qualified health care practitioner.


(3) * General supervision* means the service is furnished under the physician's (or other practitioner's) overall direction and control, but the physician's (or other practitioner's) presence is not required during the performance of the service.


(4) *Independent contractor* means an individual (or an entity that has hired such an individual) who performs part-time or full-time work for which the individual (or the entity that has hired such an individual) receives an IRS-1099 form.


(5) *Leased employment* means an employment relationship that is recognized by applicable State law and that is established by two employers by a contract such that one employer hires the services of an employee of the other employer.


(6) *Noninstitutional setting* means all settings other than a hospital or skilled nursing facility.


(7) *Practitioner* means a non-physician practitioner who is authorized by the Act to receive payment for services incident to his or her own services.


(8) *Services and supplies* means any services or supplies (including drugs or biologicals that are not usually self-administered) that are included in section 1861(s)(2)(A) of the Act and are not specifically listed in the Act as a separate benefit included in the Medicare program.


(b) Medicare Part B pays for services and supplies incident to the service of a physician (or other practitioner).


(1) Services and supplies must be furnished in a noninstitutional setting to noninstitutional patients.


(2) Services and supplies must be an integral, though incidental, part of the service of a physician (or other practitioner) in the course of diagnosis or treatment of an injury or illness.

Designated care management services can be furnished under general supervision of the physician (or other practitioner) when these services or supplies are provided incident to the services of a physician (or other practitioner). Behavioral health services can be furnished under general supervision of the physician (or other practitioner) when these services or supplies are provided by auxiliary personnel incident to the services of a physician (or other practitioner). The physician (or other practitioner) supervising the auxiliary personnel need not be the same physician (or other practitioner) who is treating the patient more broadly. However, only the supervising physician (or other practitioner) may bill Medicare for incident to services.






(6) Services and supplies must be furnished by the physician, practitioner with an incident to benefit, or auxiliary personnel.
