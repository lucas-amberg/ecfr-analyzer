(d) *Bundled payments for opioid use disorder treatment services furnished by opioid treatment programs.* (1) CMS will establish categories of bundled payments for opioid treatment programs for an episode of care as follows:


(i) Categories for each type of opioid agonist and antagonist treatment medication;


(ii) A category for medication not otherwise specified, which will be used for new FDA-approved opioid agonist or antagonist treatment medications for which CMS has not established a category; and


(iii) A category for episodes of care in which no medication is provided.


(2) The bundled payment for episodes of care in which a medication is provided consists of payment for a drug component, reflecting payment for the applicable FDA-approved opioid agonist or antagonist medication in the patient's treatment plan, and a non-drug component, reflecting payment for all other opioid use disorder treatment services reflected in the patient's treatment plan (including dispensing/administration of the medication, if applicable). The payments for the drug component and non-drug component are added together to create the bundled payment amount. The bundled payment for episodes of care in which no medication is provided consists of a single payment amount for all opioid use disorder treatment services reflected in the patient's treatment plan (excluding medication and dispensing/administration of medication).


(i) *Drug component.* The payment for the drug component for an episode of care will be determined as follows, using the most recent data available at time of ratesetting for the applicable calendar year:


(A) *Implantable and injectable medications.* For implantable and injectable medications, the payment is determined using the methodology set forth in section 1847A of the Act, except that the payment amount must be 100 percent of the ASP, if ASP is used; and the payment must be 100 percent of the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), if WAC is used.


(B) *For oral medications.* (*1*) Except as provided under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section, if ASP data are available, the payment amount is 100 percent of ASP, which will be determined based on ASP data that have been calculated consistent with the provisions in part 414, subpart J of this chapter and voluntarily submitted by drug manufacturers. If ASP data are not available, the payment amount for methadone will be based on the TRICARE rate and for buprenorphine will be calculated using the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost.


(*2*) For CY 2022, the payment amount for methadone is the payment amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section for methadone in CY 2021. For CY 2023 and subsequent years, the payment amount for methadone will be based on the payment amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section for methadone in CY 2021 and updated by the PPI for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (Prescription).




(C) *Exception.* For the drug component of bundled payments in the medication not otherwise specified category under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the payment amount is be based on the applicable methodology under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section (applying the most recent available data for such new medication), or invoice pricing until the necessary data become available.


(ii) *Non-drug component.* The payment for CY 2020 for the non-drug component of the bundled payment for an episode of care is the sum of:


(A) The CY 2019 Medicare physician fee schedule non-facility rates for the following items and services:


(*1*) Psychotherapy, 30 minutes with patient


(*2*) Group psychotherapy


(*3*) Alcohol and/or substance (other than tobacco) abuse structured assessment and brief intervention at the non-physician practitioner rate.


(*4*) For administration of an injectable medication, if applicable, drug administration (Therapeutic, prophylactic).


(*5*) For the insertion, removal, or insertion and removal of the implantable medication, if applicable, the applicable rate.


(B) For dispensing oral medication, if applicable, an approximation of the average dispensing fees under state Medicaid programs.


(C) One fourth of the sum of the CY 2019 Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule rate for two drug tests, presumptive, capable of being read by direct optical observation only and for a drug test, definitive, 1-7 drug classes.


(iii) *No medication provided episodes of care.* The bundled payment amount for CY 2020 for an episode of care in which no medication is provided is based on the non-drug component rate for an episode of care in which a drug is dispensed or administered, not including any amounts reflecting the cost of dispensing or administration of a drug.


(iv) *Increased level of psychotherapy.* For CY 2023 and subsequent years, the payment for the non-drug component of the bundled payment for an episode of care under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is adjusted to reflect the CY 2019 Medicare physician fee schedule non-facility rate for psychotherapy, 45 minutes with patient.






(3) At least one OUD treatment service described in paragraphs (i) through (v) of the definition of *opioid use disorder treatment service* in paragraph (b) of this section must be furnished to bill for the bundled payment for an episode of care.


(4) Adjustments will be made to the bundled payment for the following:


(i) If the opioid treatment program furnishes:


(A) Counseling or therapy services in excess of the amount specified in the beneficiary's treatment plan and for which medical necessity is documented in the medical record, an adjustment will be made for each additional 30 minutes of counseling or individual therapy furnished during the episode of care.


(B) Intake activities described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, an adjustment will be made when intake activities are furnished.


(C) Periodic assessments described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, an adjustment will be made when this service is furnished.


(D) Additional take home supply of oral drugs of up to 21 days, in increments of 7 days, an adjustment will be made when oral medications are dispensed.


(E) Take-home supply of opioid antagonist medications that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration under section 505 of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose and overdose education furnished in conjunction with opioid antagonist medication, an adjustment will be made when these medications are dispensed. This adjustment will be limited to once every 30 days, except when a further take home supply of these medications is medically reasonable and necessary. The opioid treatment program must document in the medical record the reason(s) for the exception. The amount of the drug component of the adjustment will be determined using the methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. The amount of the non-drug component of the adjustment will be determined based on the CY 2020 Medicare payment rate for CPT code 96161.


(F) For OTP intensive outpatient services, an adjustment will be made when at least nine OTP intensive outpatient services described in paragraph (ix) of the definition of *opioid use disorder treatment service* in paragraph (b) of this section are furnished in a week. This adjustment will be based on the per diem payment rate for intensive outpatient services at hospital-based programs defined at § 410.44(c) and multiplied by a factor of three for a weekly payment adjustment.


(G) Coordinated care and/or referral services described in paragraph (x) of the definition of opioid use disorder treatment service in paragraph (b) of this section, an adjustment will be made when each additional 30 minutes of these services are furnished.


(H) Patient navigational services and/or peer recovery support services described in paragraph (xi) of the definition of opioid use disorder treatment service in paragraph (b) of this section, an adjustment will be made when each additional 30 minutes of these services are furnished.


(ii) The payment amounts for the non-drug component of the bundled payment for an episode of care, the adjustments for counseling or therapy, intake activities, periodic assessments, OTP intensive outpatient services, coordinated care and/or referral services, patient navigational services and/or peer recovery support services, and the non-drug component of the adjustment for take-home supplies of opioid antagonist medications will be geographically adjusted using the Geographic Adjustment Factor described in § 414.26 of this subchapter. For purposes of this adjustment, OUD treatment services that are furnished via an OTP mobile unit will be treated as if they were furnished at the physical location of the OTP registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and certified by SAMHSA.


(iii) The payment amounts for the non-drug component of the bundled payment for an episode of care, the adjustments for counseling or therapy, intake activities, periodic assessments, OTP intensive outpatient services, coordinated care and/or referral services, patient navigational services and/or peer recovery support services, and the non-drug component of the adjustment for take-home supplies of opioid antagonist medications will be updated annually using the Medicare Economic Index described in § 405.504(d) of this subchapter.


(5) Payment for medications delivered, administered or dispensed to a beneficiary as part of the bundled payment or an adjustment to the bundled payment under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section is considered a duplicative payment if a claim for delivery, administration or dispensing of the same medications for the same beneficiary on the same date of service was also separately paid under Medicare Part B or Part D. CMS will recoup the duplicative payment made to the opioid treatment program.


(6) For purposes of the adjustment to the bundled payment under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section, after the end of the Public Health Emergency as defined in § 400.200 of this chapter, when services are furnished using audio-only technology the practitioner must certify, in a form and manner specified by CMS, that they had the capacity to furnish the services using two-way, audio/video communication technology, but used audio-only technology because audio/video communication technology was not available to the beneficiary.


(e) *Beneficiary cost-sharing.* A beneficiary copayment amount of zero will apply.
