# § 410.78   Telehealth services.

(a) *Definitions.* For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:


(1) *Asynchronous store and forward technologies* means the transmission of a patient's medical information from an originating site to the physician or practitioner at the distant site. The physician or practitioner at the distant site can review the medical case without the patient being present. An asynchronous telecommunications system in single media format does not include telephone calls, images transmitted via facsimile machines and text messages without visualization of the patient (electronic mail). Photographs visualized by a telecommunications system must be specific to the patient's medical condition and adequate for furnishing or confirming a diagnosis and or treatment plan. Dermatological photographs, for example, a photograph of a skin lesion, may be considered to meet the requirement of a single media format under this provision.


(2) *Distant site* means the site at which the physician or practitioner delivering the service is located at the time the service is provided via a telecommunications system.


(3) *Interactive telecommunications system* means, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), multimedia communications equipment that includes, at a minimum, audio and video equipment permitting two-way, real-time interactive communication between the patient and distant site physician or practitioner. Interactive telecommunications system may also include two-way, real-time audio-only communication technology for any telehealth service furnished to a patient in their home if the distant site physician or practitioner is technically capable of using an interactive telecommunications system as defined in the previous sentence, but the patient is not capable of, or does not consent to, the use of video technology. The following modifiers must be appended to a claim for telehealth services furnished using two-way, real-time audio-only communication technology to verify that the conditions set forth in the prior sentence have been met:


(i) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) modifier “93”; and


(ii) For rural health clinics (RHCs) and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), Medicare modifier “FQ”.


(4) *Originating site* means the location of an eligible Medicare beneficiary at the time the service being furnished via a telecommunications system occurs. For asynchronous store and forward telecommunications technologies, the only originating sites are Federal telemedicine demonstration programs conducted in Alaska or Hawaii.


(b) *General rule.* Medicare Part B pays for covered telehealth services included on the telehealth list when furnished by an interactive telecommunications system if the following conditions are met, except that for the duration of the Public Health Emergency as defined in § 400.200 of this chapter, Medicare Part B pays for office and other outpatient visits, professional consultation, psychiatric diagnostic interview examination, individual psychotherapy, pharmacologic management and end stage renal disease related services included in the monthly capitation payment furnished by an interactive telecommunications system if the following conditions are met:


(1) The physician or practitioner at the distant site must be licensed to furnish the service under State law. The physician or practitioner at the distant site who is licensed under State law to furnish a covered telehealth service described in this section may bill, and receive payment for, the service when it is delivered via a telecommunications system.
