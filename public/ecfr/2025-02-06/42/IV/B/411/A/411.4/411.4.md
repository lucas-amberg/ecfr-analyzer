(a) *General rule.* Except in the case of federally qualified health center services and as provided in § 411.8(b) (for services paid by a governmental entity), Medicare may not pay for an item or service under Part A or Part B if—


(1) The individual has no legal obligation to pay for the item or service; and


(2) No other person (by reason of such individual's membership in a prepayment plan or otherwise) has a legal obligation to provide or pay for the item or service.


(b) *Special conditions for payment for items or services furnished to an individual in the custody of a penal authority.* (1) An individual in the custody of a penal authority is considered to have a legal obligation to pay for items or services furnished to the individual only if the following conditions are met:


(i) State or local law requires the individual to pay the cost of items and services that the individual receives;


(ii) The penal authority enforces the requirement to pay for items or services by billing all individuals who receive such items or services, whether or not covered by Medicare or any other health insurance; and


(iii) The penal authority pursues collection of amounts owed for items or services received in the same way and with the same vigor that it pursues the collection of other debts.
