# § 411.40   General provisions.

(a) *Definition. “Workers' compensation plan of the United States”* includes the workers' compensation plans of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, as well as the systems provided under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act and the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.


(b) *Limitations on Medicare payment.* (1) Medicare does not pay for any services for which—


(i) Payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made under a workers' compensation law or plan of the United States or a state; or 


(ii) Payment could be made under the Federal Black Lung Program, but is precluded solely because the provider of the services has failed to secure, from the Department of Labor, a provider number to include in the claim.


(2) If the payment for a service may not be made under workers' compensation because the service is furnished by a source not authorized to provide that service under the particular workers' compensation program, Medicare pays for the service if it is a covered service.


(3) Medicare makes secondary payments in accordance with §§ 411.32 and 411.33.
