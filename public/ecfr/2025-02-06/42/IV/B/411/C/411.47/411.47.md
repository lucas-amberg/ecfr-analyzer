# ยง 411.47   Apportionment of a lump-sum compromise settlement of a workers' compensation claim.

(a) *Determining amount of compromise settlement considered as a payment for medical expenses.* (1) If a compromise settlement allocates a portion of the payment for medical expenses and also gives reasonable recognition to the income replacement element, that apportionment may be accepted as a basis for determining Medicare payments.


(2) If the settlement does not give reasonable recognition to both elements of a workers' compensation award or does not apportion the sum granted, the portion to be considered as payment for medical expenses is computed as follows:


(i) Determine the ratio of the amount awarded (less the reasonable and necessary costs incurred in procuring the settlement) to the total amount that would have been payable under workers' compensation if the claim had not been compromised.


(ii) Multiply that ratio by the total medical expenses incurred as a result of the injury or disease up to the date of the settlement. The product is the amount of the workers' compensation settlement to be considered as payment for medical expenses.


(b) *Determining the amount of the Medicare overpayment.* When conditional Medicare payments have been made, and the beneficiary receives a compromise settlement payment, the Medicare overpayment is determined as set forth in this paragraph (b). The amount of the workers' compensation payment that is considered to be for medical expenses (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) is applied, at the workers' compensation rate of payment prevailing in the particular jurisdiction, in the following order:


(1) First to any beneficiary payments for services payable under workers' compensation but not covered under Medicare.


(2) Then to any beneficiary payments for services payable under workers' compensation and also covered under Medicare Part B. (These include deductible and coinsurance amounts and, in unassigned cases, the charge in excess of the reasonable charge.)


(3) Last to any beneficiary payments for services payable under workers' compensation and also covered under Medicare Part A. (These include Part A deductible and coinsurance amounts and charges for services furnished after benefits are exhausted.)
