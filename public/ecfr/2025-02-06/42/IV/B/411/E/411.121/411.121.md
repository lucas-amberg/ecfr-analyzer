# § 411.121   Hearing procedures.

(a) *Nature of hearing.* (1) If any of the parties requests a hearing within 65 days from the date on the notice of the determination of nonconformance, the CMS Administrator appoints a hearing officer. 


(2) If no party files a request within the 65-day period, the initial determination of nonconformance is binding upon all parties unless it is reopened in accordance with § 411.126. 


(3) If more than one party requests a hearing the hearing officer conducts a single hearing in which all parties may participate. 


(4) *On the record review.* Ordinarily, the hearing officer makes a decision based upon review of the data and documents on which CMS based its determination of nonconformance and any other documentation submitted by any of the parties within 65 days from the date on the notice. 


(5) *Oral hearing.* The hearing officer may provide for an oral hearing either on his or her own motion or in response to a party's request if the party demonstrates to the hearing officer's satisfaction that an oral hearing is necessary. Within 30 days of receipt of the request, the hearing officer gives all known parties written notice of the request and whether the request for oral hearing is granted. 


(b) *Notice of time and place of oral hearing.* If the hearing officer provides an oral hearing, he or she gives all known parties written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least 30 days before the scheduled date. 


(c) *Prehearing discovery.* (1) The hearing officer may permit prehearing discovery if it is requested by a party at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the hearing. 


(2) If the hearing officer approves the request, he or she—


(i) Provides a reasonable time for inspection and reproduction of documents; and 


(ii) In ruling on discovery matters, is guided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (28 U.S.C.A. Rules 26-37) 


(3) The hearing officer's orders on all discovery matters are final. 


(d) *Conduct of hearing.* The hearing officer determines the conduct of the hearing, including the order in which the evidence and the allegations are presented. 


(e) *Evidence at hearing.* (1) The hearing officer inquires into the matters at issue and may receive from all parties documentary and other evidence that is pertinent and material, including the testimony of witnesses, and evidence that would be inadmissible in a court of law. 


(2) Evidence may be received at any time before the conclusion of the hearing. 


(3) The hearing officer gives the parties opportunity for submission and consideration of evidence and arguments and, in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, excludes irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. 


(4) The hearing officer's ruling on admissibility of evidence is final and not subject to further review.


(f) *Subpoenas.* (1) The hearing officer may, either on his or her own motion or upon the request of any party, issue subpoenas for either or both of the following if they are reasonably necessary for full presentation of the case: 


(i) The attendance and testimony of witnesses. 


(ii) The production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are relevant and material to any matter at issue. 


(2) A party that wishes the issuance of a subpoena must, at least 10 days before the date fixed for the hearing, file with the hearing officer a written request that identifies the witnesses or documents to be produced and describes the address or location in sufficient detail to permit the witnesses or documents to be found. 


(3) The request for a subpoena must state the pertinent facts that the party expects to establish by the witnesses or documents and whether those facts could be established by other evidence without the use of a subpoena. 


(4) The hearing officer issues the subpoenas at his or her discretion, and CMS assumes the cost of the issuance and the fees and mileage of any subpoenaed witness, in accordance with section 205(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 405(d)).


(g) *Witnesses.* Witnesses at the hearing testify under oath or affirmation, unless excused by the hearing officer for cause. The hearing officer may examine the witnesses and shall allow the parties to examine and cross-examine witnesses. 


(h) *Record of hearing.* A complete record of the proceedings at the hearing is made and transcribed in all cases. It is made available to the parties upon request. The record is not closed until a decision has been issued. 


(i) *Sources of hearing officer's authority.* In the conduct of the hearing, the hearing officer complies with all the provisions of title XVIII of the Act and implementing regulations, as well as with CMS Rulings issued under § 401.108 of this chapter. The hearing officer gives great weight to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice established by CMS.
