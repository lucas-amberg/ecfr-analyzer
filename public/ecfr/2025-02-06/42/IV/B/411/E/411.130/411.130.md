(a) *CMS responsibility.* After CMS determines that a plan has been a nonconforming GHP in a particular year, it refers its determination to the IRS, but only after the parties have exhausted all CMS appeal rights with respect to the determination. 


(b) *IRS responsibility.* The IRS administers section 5000 of the IRC, which imposes a tax on employers (other than governmental entities) and employee organizations that contribute to a nonconforming GHP. The tax is equal to 25 percent of the employer's or employee organization's expenses, incurred during the calendar year in which the plan is a nonconforming GHP, for each GHP, both conforming and nonconforming, to which the employer or employee organization contributes.
