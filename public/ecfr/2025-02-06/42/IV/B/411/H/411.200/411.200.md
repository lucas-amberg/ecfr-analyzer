# § 411.200   Basis.

(a) This subpart is based on certain provisions of section 1862(b) of the Act, which impose specific requirements and limitations with respect to—


(1) Individuals who are entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability; and 


(2) Large group health plans (LGHPs) that cover those individuals. 


(b) Under these provisions, the LGHP may not take into account the Medicare entitlement of a disabled individual who is covered (or seeks to be covered) under the plan by virtue of his or her own current employment status or that of a member of his or her family. (§ 411.108 gives examples of actions that constitute taking into account.)
