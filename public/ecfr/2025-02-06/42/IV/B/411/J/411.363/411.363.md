# § 411.363   Process for requesting an exception from the prohibition on facility expansion.

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section—


*Baseline number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds* means the number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds for which the applicable hospital or high Medicaid facility is licensed as of March 23, 2010 (or, in the case of a hospital that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of March 23, 2010, but does have a provider agreement in effect on December 31, 2010, the date of effect of such agreement). For purposes of determining the number of beds in a hospital's baseline number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds, a bed is included if the bed is considered licensed for purposes of State licensure, regardless of the specific number of beds identified on the physical license issued to the hospital by the State.


*External data source* means a data source that—


(i) Is generated, maintained, or under the control of a State Medicaid agency;


(ii) Is reliable and transparent;


(iii) Maintains data that, for purposes of the process described in this section, are readily available and accessible to the requesting hospital, comparison hospitals, and CMS; and


(iv) Maintains or generates data that, for purposes of the process described in this section, are accurate, complete, and objectively verifiable.


*Main campus of the hospital* means “campus” as defined at § 413.65(a)(2) of this chapter.


*Procedure room* has the meaning set forth at § 411.362(a).

(2) A hospital that meets the criteria for an applicable hospital or a high Medicaid facility is eligible to request an exception from the prohibition on facility expansion for consideration by CMS, provided that—


(i) CMS has not previously approved a request for an exception from the prohibition on facility expansion that would allow the hospital's number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds for which the hospital is licensed to reach 200 percent of the hospital's baseline number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds if the full expansion is utilized; and


(ii) It has been at least 2 calendar years from the date of the most recent decision by CMS approving or denying the hospital's most recent request for an exception from the prohibition on facility expansion.


(c) *Criteria for an applicable hospital.* An applicable hospital is a hospital that meets the following criteria:


(1) *Population increase.* The hospital is located in a county that has a percentage increase in population that is at least 150 percent of the percentage increase in population of the State in which the hospital is located during the most recent 5-year period for which data are available as of the date that the hospital submits its request. To calculate State and county population growth, a hospital must use Bureau of the Census estimates.


(2) *Medicaid inpatient admissions.* The hospital has an annual percent of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid that is equal to or greater than the average percent with respect to such admissions for all hospitals (including the requesting hospital) that have Medicare participation agreements with CMS and are located in the county in which the hospital is located during the most recent 12-month period for which data are available as of the date that the hospital submits its request. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the most recent 12-month period for which data are available means the most recent 12-month period for which the data source used contains all data from the requesting hospital and each other hospital that has a Medicare participation agreement with CMS and is located in the county in which the requesting hospital is located.


(i) With respect to requests submitted before October 1, 2023, a hospital may use filed Medicare hospital cost report data from the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) or data from an external data source (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) to estimate its annual percent of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid and the average percent with respect to such admissions for all hospitals (including the requesting hospital) that have Medicare participation agreements with CMS and are located in the county in which the hospital is located.


(ii) With respect to requests submitted on or after October 1, 2023, a hospital may use only filed Medicare hospital cost report data from HCRIS to estimate its annual percent of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid and the average percent with respect to such admissions for all hospitals (including the requesting hospital) that have Medicare participation agreements with CMS and are located in the county in which the hospital is located.


(3) *Nondiscrimination.* The hospital does not discriminate against beneficiaries of Federal health care programs and does not permit physicians practicing at the hospital to discriminate against such beneficiaries.


(4) *Average bed capacity.* The hospital is located in a State in which the average bed capacity in the State is less than the national average bed capacity during the most recent fiscal year for which HCRIS, as of the date that the hospital submits its request, contains data from a sufficient number of hospitals to determine a State's average bed capacity and the national average bed capacity.


(i) CMS will provide on its website State average bed capacities and the national average bed capacity.


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), *sufficient number* means the number of hospitals, as determined by CMS that would ensure that the determination under this paragraph (c)(4) would not materially change after additional hospital data are reported.


(5) *Average bed occupancy.* The hospital has an average bed occupancy rate that is greater than the average bed occupancy rate in the State in which the hospital is located during the most recent fiscal year for which HCRIS, as of the date that the hospital submits its request, contains data from a sufficient number of hospitals to determine the requesting hospital's average bed occupancy rate and the relevant State's average bed occupancy rate.


(i) A hospital must use filed hospital cost report data from HCRIS to determine its average bed occupancy rate.


(ii) CMS will provide on its website State average bed occupancy rates. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5), *sufficient number* means the number of hospitals, as determined by CMS that would ensure that the determination under this paragraph (c)(5) would not materially change after additional hospital data are reported.


(6) *Hospital location.* For purposes of this paragraph (c), a hospital is located in the county and State in which the main campus of the hospital is located.

(2) *Medicaid inpatient admissions.* With respect to each of the three most recent 12-month periods for which data are available as of the date the hospital submits its request, the hospital has an annual percent of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid that is estimated to be greater than such percent with respect to such admissions for each other hospital that has a Medicare participation agreement with CMS and is located in the county in which the hospital is located. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the most recent 12-month period for which data are available means the most recent 12-month period for which the data source used contains all data from the requesting hospital and each other hospital that has a Medicare participation agreement with CMS and is located in the county in which the requesting hospital is located.


(i) With respect to requests submitted before October 1, 2023, a hospital may use filed Medicare hospital cost report data from HCRIS or data from an external data source (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) to estimate its annual percentage of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid and the annual percentages of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid for each other hospital that has a Medicare participation agreement with CMS and is located in the county in which the hospital is located.
