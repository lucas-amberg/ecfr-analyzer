(4) Nonparticipating hospitals furnishing emergency services to Medicare beneficiaries.


(d) *Changes in hospitals' status.* For purposes of exclusion from the prospective payment systems under this subpart, the status of each currently participating hospital (excluded or not excluded) is determined at the beginning of each cost reporting period and is effective for the entire cost reporting period. Any changes in the status of the hospital are made only at the start of a cost reporting period.


(e) *Hospitals-within-hospitals.* A hospital-within-a-hospital is a hospital that occupies space in a building also used by another hospital, or in one or more separate buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital. Prior to October 1, 2017, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(vi) and (f) of this section, a hospital-within-a-hospital must meet the following criteria in order to be excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1). On or after October 1, 2017, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(vi) and (f) of this section, a hospital-within-hospital that is excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1) that occupies space in a building also used by a hospital which is not excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1), or in one or more separate buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by a hospital not excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1) must meet the following criteria in order to be excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1).


(1) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997— 


(i) *Separate governing body.* The hospital has a governing body that is separate from the governing body of the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus. The hospital's governing body is not under the control of the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus, or of any third entity that controls both hospitals.


(ii) *Separate chief medical officer.* The hospital has a single chief medical officer who reports directly to the governing body and who is responsible for all medical staff activities of the hospital. The chief medical officer of the hospital is not employed by or under contract with either the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus or any third entity that controls both hospitals.


(iii) *Separate medical staff.* The hospital has a medical staff that is separate from the medical staff of the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus. The hospital's medical staff is directly accountable to the governing body for the quality of medical care provided in the hospital, and adopts and enforces by-laws governing medical staff activities, including criteria and procedures for recommending to the governing body the privileges to be granted to individual practitioners.


(iv) *Chief executive officer.* The hospital has a single chief executive officer through whom all administration authority flows, and who exercises control and surveillance over all administrative activities of the hospital. The chief executive officer is not employed by, or under contract with, either the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus or any third entity that controls both hospitals.


(v) *Performance of basic hospital functions.* Prior to October 1, 2017, the hospital meets one of the following criteria:


(A) The hospital performs the basic functions specified in §§ 482.21 through 482.27, 482.30, 482.42, 482.43, and 482.45 of this chapter through the use of employees or under contracts or other agreements with entities other than the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus, or a third entity that controls both hospitals. Food and dietetic services and housekeeping, maintenance, and other services necessary to maintain a clean and safe physical environment could be obtained under contracts or other agreements with the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus, or with a third entity that controls both hospitals.


(B) For the same period of at least 6 months used to determine compliance with the criterion regarding the age of patients in § 412.23(d)(2) or the length-of-stay criterion in § 412.23(e)(2), or for hospitals other than children's or long-term care hospitals, for a period of at least 6 months immediately preceding the first cost reporting period for which exclusion is sought, the cost of the services that the hospital obtains under contracts or other agreements with the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus, or with a third entity that controls both hospitals, is no more than 15 percent of the hospital's total inpatient operating costs, as defined in § 412.2(c). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(v)(B), however, the costs of preadmission services are those specified under § 413.40(c)(2) rather than those specified under § 412.2(c)(5).


(C) For the same period of at least 6 months used to determine compliance with the criterion regarding the age of inpatients in § 412.23(d)(2) or the length-of-stay criterion in § 412.23(e)(2), or for hospitals other than children's or long-term care hospitals, for the period of at least 6 months immediately preceding the first cost reporting period for which exclusion is sought, the hospital has an inpatient population of whom at least 75 percent were referred to the hospital from a source other than another hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus.


(vi) Effective October 1, 2008, if a State hospital that is occupying space in the same building or on the same campus as another State hospital cannot meet the criterion under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section solely because its governing body is under the control of the State hospital with which it shares a building or a campus, or is under the control of a third entity that also controls the State hospital with which it shares a building or a campus, the State hospital can nevertheless qualify for an exclusion if it meets the other applicable criteria in this section and—


(A) Both State hospitals occupy space in the same building or on the same campus and have been continuously owned and operated by the State since October 1, 1995;


(B) Is required by State law to be subject to the governing authority of the State hospital with which it shares space or the governing authority of a third entity that controls both hospitals; and


(C) Was excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system before October 1, 1995, and continues to be excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system through September 30, 2008.


(2) Effective for long-term care hospitals-within-hospitals for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2004, the hospital must meet the governance and control requirements at paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv) of this section.


(3) *Notification of co-located status.* A long-term care hospital that occupies space in a building used by another hospital, or in one or more entire buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital and that meets the criteria of paragraphs (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section must notify its fiscal intermediary and CMS in writing of its co-location and identify by name, address, and Medicare provider number those hospital(s) with which it is co-located.


(f) *Application for certain hospitals.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if a hospital was excluded from the prospective payment systems under the provisions of this section on or before September 30, 1995, and at that time occupied space in a building also used by another hospital, or in one or more buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital, the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section do not apply to the hospital as long as the hospital— 


(1) Continues to operate under the same terms and conditions, including the number of beds, unless the hospital is a children's hospital as defined at § 412.23(d), and square footage considered to be part of the hospital for purposes of Medicare participation and payment in effect on September 30, 1995; or


(2) In the case of a hospital that changes the terms and conditions under which it operates after September 30, 1995, but before October 1, 2003, continues to operate under the same terms and conditions, including the number of beds, unless the hospital is a children's hospital as defined at § 412.23(d), and square footage considered to be part of the hospital for purposes of Medicare participation and payment in effect on September 30, 2003.

(i) If a hospital to which the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section applies decreases its number of beds below the number of beds considered to be part of the hospital on September 30, 1995, it may subsequently increase the number of beds at any time as long as the resulting total number of beds considered to be part of the hospital does not exceed the number of beds at the hospital on September 30, 1995.


(ii) If a hospital to which the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section applies decreases its number of beds below the number of beds considered to be part of the hospital on September 30, 2003, it may subsequently increase the number of beds at any time as long as the resulting total number of beds considered to be part of the hospital does not exceed the number of beds at the hospital on September 30, 2003.
