# § 412.83   Payment for extraordinarily high-cost day outliers.

For discharges occurring before October 1, 1997, if a discharge that qualifies for an additional payment under the provisions of § 412.82 has charges adjusted to costs that exceed the cost outlier threshold criteria for an extraordinarily high-cost case as set forth in § 412.80(a)(1)(ii), the additional payment made for the discharge is the greater of—


(a) The applicable per diem payment computed under § 412.82 (c) or (d); or


(b) The payment that would be made under § 412.84 (i) or (j) if the case had not met the day outlier criteria threshold set forth in § 412.80(a)(1)(i).
