# § 412.80   Outlier cases: General provisions.

(a) *Basic rule*—(1) *Discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994 and before October 1, 1997.* For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, and before October 1, 1997, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section concerning transferring hospitals, CMS provides for additional payment, beyond standard DRG payments, to a hospital for covered inpatient hospital services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary if either of the following conditions is met: 


(i) The beneficiary's length-of-stay (including days at the SNF level of care if a SNF bed is not available in the area) exceeds the mean length-of-stay for the applicable DRG by the lesser of the following: 


(A) A fixed number of days, as specified by CMS; or 


(B) A fixed number of standard deviations, as specified by CMS. 


(ii) The beneficiary's length-of-stay does not exceed criteria established under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, but the hospital's charges for covered services furnished to the beneficiary, adjusted to operating costs and capital costs by applying cost-to-charge ratios as described in § 412.84(h), exceed the DRG payment for the case plus a fixed dollar amount (adjusted for geographic variation in costs) as specified by CMS. 


(2) *Discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 and before October 1, 2001.* For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 and before October 1, 2001, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section concerning transfers, CMS provides for additional payment, beyond standard DRG payments, to a hospital for covered inpatient hospital services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary if the hospital's charges for covered services, adjusted to operating costs and capital costs by applying cost-to-charge ratios, as described in § 412.84(h), exceed the DRG payment for the case, payments for indirect costs of graduate medical education (§ 412.105), and payments for serving disproportionate share of low-income patients (§ 412.106), plus a fixed dollar amount (adjusted for geographic variation in costs) as specified by CMS.


(3) *Discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2001.* For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2001, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section concerning transfers, CMS provides for additional payment, beyond standard DRG payments and beyond additional payments for new medical services or technology specified in §§ 412.87 and 412.88, to a hospital for covered inpatient hospital services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary if the hospital's charges for covered services, adjusted to operating costs and capital costs by applying cost-to-charge ratios as described in § 412.84(h), exceed the DRG payment for the case (plus payments for indirect costs of graduate medical education (§ 412.105), payments for serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients (§ 412.106), and additional payments for new medical services or technologies) plus a fixed dollar amount (adjusted for geographic variation in costs) as specified by CMS. 


(b) *Outlier cases in transferring hospitals.* CMS provides cost outlier payments to a transferring hospital for cases paid in accordance with § 412.4(f), if the hospital's charges for covered services furnished to the beneficiary, adjusted to costs by applying cost-to-charge ratios as described in § 412.84(h), exceed the DRG payment for the case plus a fixed dollar amount (adjusted for geographic variation in costs) as specified by CMS, divided by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG, and multiplied by an applicable factor determined as follows:


(1) For transfer cases paid in accordance with § 412.4(f)(1), the applicable factor is equal to the length of stay plus 1 day.


(2) For transfer cases paid in accordance with § 412.4(f)(2), the applicable factor is equal to 0.5 plus the product of the length of stay plus 1 day multiplied by 0.5.


(c) *Publication and revision of outlier criteria.* CMS will issue threshold criteria for determining outlier payment in the annual notice of the prospective payment rates published in accordance with § 412.8(b).
