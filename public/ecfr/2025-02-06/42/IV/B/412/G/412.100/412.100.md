# ยง 412.100   Special treatment: Kidney transplant programs.

(a) *Adjustments for kidney transplant programs.* (1) CMS adjusts the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) rates for inpatient operating costs determined under subparts D and E of this part for hospitals with approved kidney transplant programs (discussed at ยง 482.104 of this chapter) to remove the net costs associated with kidney acquisition.


(2)(i) Payment for Medicare kidney acquisition costs, as set forth in subpart L of part 413 of this chapter, is made on a reasonable cost basis apart from the prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs.


(ii) IPPS payment to the hospital is adjusted in each cost reporting period to reflect an amount necessary to compensate the hospital for reasonable costs of Medicare kidney acquisition.


(b) Costs of kidney acquisition. Kidney acquisition costs include allowable costs incurred in the acquisition of a kidney from a living or a deceased donor by the hospital, or from a deceased donor by an organ procurement organization. These costs are listed in ยง 413.402(b) of this chapter.
