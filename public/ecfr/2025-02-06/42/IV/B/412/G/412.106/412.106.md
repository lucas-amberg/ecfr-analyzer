# § 412.106   Special treatment: Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.

(a) *General considerations.* (1) The factors considered in determining whether a hospital qualifies for a payment adjustment include the number of beds, the number of patient days, and the hospital's location. 


(i) The number of beds in a hospital is determined in accordance with § 412.105(b). 


(ii) For purposes of this section, the number of patient days in a hospital includes only those days attributable to units or wards of the hospital providing acute care services generally payable under the prospective payment system and excludes patient days associated with— 


(A) Beds in excluded distinct part hospital units; 


(B) Beds otherwise countable under this section used for outpatient observation services, skilled nursing swing-bed services, or inpatient hospice services;


(C) Beds in a unit or ward that is not occupied to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system at any time during the 3 preceding months (the beds in the unit or ward are to be excluded from the determination of available bed days during the current month); and


(D) Beds in a unit or ward that is otherwise occupied (to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system) that could not be made available for inpatient occupancy within 24 hours for 30 consecutive days.


(iii) The hospital's location, in an urban or rural area, is determined in accordance with the definitions in § 412.64, except that a reclassification that results from an urban hospital reclassified as rural as set forth in § 412.103 is classified as rural. 


(2) The payment adjustment is applied to the hospital's DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs, excluding outlier payments for inpatient operating costs under subpart F of this part and additional payments made under the provisions of § 412.105.


(b) *Determination of a hospital's disproportionate patient percentage*—(1) *General rule.* A hospital's disproportionate patient percentage is determined by adding the results of two computations and expressing that sum as a percentage. 


(2) *First computation: Federal fiscal year.* For each month of the Federal fiscal year in which the hospital's cost reporting period begins, CMS— 


(i) Determines the number of patient days that—


(A) Are associated with discharges occurring during each month; and


(B) Are furnished to patients who during that month were entitled to both Medicare Part A (including Medicare Advantage (Part C)) and SSI, excluding those patients who received only State supplementation; 


(ii) Adds the results for the whole period; and 


(iii) Divides the number determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section by the total number of days that—


(A) Are associated with discharges that occur during that period; and


(B) Are furnished to patients entitled to Medicare Part A (including Medicare Advantage (Part C)). 


(3) *First computation: Cost reporting period.* If a hospital prefers that CMS use its cost reporting period instead of the Federal fiscal year, it must furnish to CMS, through its intermediary, a written request including the hospital's name, provider number, and cost reporting period end date. This exception will be performed once per hospital per cost reporting period, and the resulting percentage becomes the hospital's official Medicare Part A/SSI percentage for that period.


(4) *Second computation.* The fiscal intermediary determines, for the same cost reporting period used for the first computation, the number of the hospital's patient days of service for patients who were not entitled to Medicare Part A, and who were either eligible for Medicaid on such days as described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section or who were regarded as eligible for Medicaid on such days and the Secretary has determined to include those days in this computation as described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. The fiscal intermediary then divides that number by the total number of patient days in the same period. For purposes of this second computation, the following requirements apply:


(i) For purposes of this computation, a patient is eligible for Medicaid on a given day if the patient is eligible on that day for inpatient hospital services under a State Medicaid plan approved under title XIX of the Act, regardless of whether particular items or services were covered or paid for on that day under the State plan.


(ii) For purposes of this computation, a patient is regarded as eligible for Medicaid on a given day if the patient receives health insurance authorized by a demonstration approved by the Secretary under section 1115(a)(2) of the Act for that day, where the cost of such health insurance may be counted as expenditures under section 1903 of the Act, or the patient has health insurance for that day purchased using premium assistance received through a demonstration approved by the Secretary under section 1115(a)(2) of the Act, where the cost of the premium assistance may be counted as expenditures under section 1903 of the Act, and in either case regardless of whether particular items or services were covered or paid for on that day by the health insurance. Of these patients regarded as eligible for Medicaid on a given day, only the days of patients meeting the following criteria on that day may be counted in this second computation:


(A) Patients who are provided by a demonstration authorized under section 1115(a)(2) of the Act health insurance that covers inpatient hospital services; or


(B) Patients who purchase health insurance that covers inpatient hospital services using premium assistance provided by a demonstration authorized under section 1115(a)(2) of the Act and the premium assistance accounts for 100 percent of the premium cost to the patient.


(iii) Patients whose health care costs, including inpatient hospital services costs, for a given day are claimed for payment by a provider from an uncompensated, undercompensated, or other type of funding pool authorized under section 1115(a) of the Act to fund providers' uncompensated care costs are not regarded as eligible for Medicaid for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section on that day and the days of such patients may not be included in this second computation.


(iv) The hospital has the burden of furnishing data adequate to prove eligibility for each Medicaid patient day claimed under this paragraph, and of verifying with the State that a patient was eligible for Medicaid during each claimed patient hospital day.


(v) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2009, the hospital must report the days in the numerator of the fraction in the second computation in a cost reporting period based on the date of discharge, the date of admission, or the dates of service. If a hospital seeks to change its methodology for reporting days in the numerator of the fraction in the second computation, the hospital must notify CMS, through its fiscal intermediary or MAC, in writing at least 30 days before the beginning of the cost reporting period in which the change would apply. The written notification must specify the methodology the hospital will use, the cost reporting period to which the requested change would apply, and the current methodology being used. Such a change will be effective only on the first day of a cost reporting period. If a hospital changes its methodology for reporting such days, CMS or the fiscal intermediary or MAC may adjust the number of days reported for a cost reporting period if it determines that any of those days have been counted in a prior cost reporting period.


(5) *Disproportionate patient percentage.* The intermediary adds the results of the first computation made under either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section and the second computation made under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and expresses that sum as a percentage. This is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, and is used in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(c) *Criteria for classification.* A hospital is classified as a “disproportionate share” hospital under any of the following circumstances: 


(1) The hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, as determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, is at least equal to one of the following: 


(i) 15 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area, and has 100 or more beds, or is located in a rural area and has 500 or more beds. 


(ii) 30 percent for discharges occurring before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in a rural area and either has more than 100 beds and fewer than 500 beds or is classified as a sole community hospital under § 412.92.


(iii) 40 percent for discharges before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in an urban area and has fewer than 100 beds. 


(iv) 45 percent for discharges before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in a rural area and has 100 or fewer beds.


(2) The hospital is located in an urban area, has 100 or more beds, and can demonstrate that, during its cost reporting period, more than 30 percent of its net inpatient care revenues are derived from State and local government payments for care furnished to indigent patients. 


(d) *Payment adjustment factor*—(1) *Method of adjustment.* Subject to the reduction factor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, if a hospital serves a disproportionate number of low-income patients, its DRG revenues for inpatient operating costs are increased by an adjustment factor as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(*1*) 18 percent, the percent of such individuals who are uninsured in 2013, based on the March 20, 2010, estimate of the “Insured Share of the Nonelderly Population Including All Residents” by the Congressional Budget Office.


(*2*) The percent of such individuals who are uninsured in the applicable fiscal year, based on the most recent estimate of the “Insured Share of the Nonelderly Population Including All Residents” by the Congressional Budget Office available at the time of development of the annual final rule for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system.


(B) For FY 2018 and subsequent fiscal years, a factor equal to 1 minus the percent change in the percent of individuals who are uninsured (and subtracting from the factor 0.2 percentage point for each of fiscal years 2018 and 2019), as determined by comparing the percent of individuals who are uninsured in—


(*1*) 2013 (as estimated by the Secretary, based on data from the Census Bureau or other sources the Secretary determines appropriate, and certified by the Chief Actuary of the CMS); and


(*2*) The most recent period for which data is available (as so estimated and certified).






(iii) *Factor 3.* A factor equal to the percent, for each inpatient prospective payment system hospital, that represents the quotient of:


(A) The amount of uncompensated care for such hospital as estimated by CMS.


(B) The aggregate amount of uncompensated care as estimated by CMS for all hospitals that are estimated to receive a payment under this section.


(C)(*1*) For fiscal years 2014 and 2015, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on the most recent available data on utilization for Medicaid and Medicare SSI patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (4) of this section.


(*2*) For fiscal year 2016, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare SSI patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2012 or 2011 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract, the 2012 cost report data submitted to CMS by IHS hospitals, and the most recent available data on Medicare SSI utilization.


(*3*) For fiscal year 2017, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare SSI patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2011, 2012, and 2013 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract, the 2011 and 2012 cost report data submitted to CMS by IHS hospitals, and the most recent available 3 years of data on Medicare SSI utilization (or, for Puerto Rico hospitals, a proxy for Medicare SSI utilization data).

(*5*) For fiscal year 2019, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare SSI patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2013 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract and the most recent available year of data on Medicare SSI utilization (or, for Puerto Rico hospitals, a proxy for Medicare SSI utilization data), and for hospitals other than Puerto Rico hospitals, IHS or Tribal hospitals, and all-inclusive rate providers, data on uncompensated care costs, defined as charity care costs plus non-Medicare and nonreimbursable Medicare bad debt costs from 2014 and 2015 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract.


(*6*) For fiscal year 2020, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on data on uncompensated care costs, defined as charity care costs plus non-Medicare and non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt costs from 2015 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract, except that, for Puerto Rico hospitals and Indian Health Service or Tribal hospitals, CMS will base its estimates on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare SSI patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2013 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract and the most recent available year of data on Medicare SSI utilization (or, for Puerto Rico hospitals, a proxy for Medicare SSI utilization data).


(*7*) For fiscal year 2021, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on data on uncompensated care costs, defined as charity care costs plus non-Medicare and non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt costs from 2017 cost reports from the most recent Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) database extract, except that, for Puerto Rico hospitals and Indian Health Service or Tribal hospitals, CMS will base its estimates on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare Supplemental Security Income (SSI) patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2013 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract and the most recent available year of data on Medicare SSI utilization (or, for Puerto Rico hospitals, a proxy for Medicare SSI utilization data).


(*8*) For fiscal year 2022, for all eligible hospitals, except Indian Health Service and Tribal hospitals and Puerto Rico hospitals that have a cost report for 2013, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on data on uncompensated care costs, defined as charity care costs plus non-Medicare and non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt costs from cost reports from the most recent cost reporting year for which audits have been conducted.


(*9*) For fiscal year 2022, for Indian Health Service and Tribal hospitals and Puerto Rico hospitals that have a cost report for 2013, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare Supplemental Security Income (SSI) patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2013 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract and the most recent available year of data on Medicare SSI utilization (or, for Puerto Rico hospitals, a proxy for Medicare SSI utilization data).




(*10*) For fiscal year 2023, for all eligible hospitals, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on data on uncompensated care costs, defined as charity care costs plus non-Medicare and non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt costs from cost reports from the two most recent cost reporting years for which audits have been conducted. If a hospital is a new hospital (that is, a hospital that began participation in the Medicare program after the two most recent cost reporting years for which audits have been conducted) or if the hospital is treated as a new hospital for purposes of Factor 3, the Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) will determine Factor 3 as the ratio of the hospital's uncompensated care costs from its FY 2023 cost report to the sum of uncompensated care costs for all DSH-eligible hospitals as estimated by CMS from the most recent cost reporting year for which audits have been conducted.




(*11*) For fiscal year 2024 and subsequent fiscal years, for all eligible hospitals, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on data on uncompensated care costs, defined as charity care costs plus non-Medicare and non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt costs from cost reports from the three most recent cost reporting years for which audits have been conducted. If a hospital is a new hospital (that is, a hospital that began participation in the Medicare program after the three most recent cost reporting years for which audits have been conducted) or if the hospital is treated as a new hospital for purposes of Factor 3, the Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) will determine Factor 3 as the ratio of the hospital's uncompensated care costs from its cost report for the applicable fiscal year to the sum of uncompensated care costs for all disproportionate share hospital (DSH)-eligible hospitals as estimated by CMS from the most recent cost reporting year for which audits have been conducted.




(2) *Preclusion of administrative and judicial review.* There is no administrative or judicial review under sections 1869 or 1878 of the Act, or otherwise, of the following:


(i) Any estimate of the Secretary for the purpose of determining the factors in paragraph (g)(1) of this section; and


(ii) Any period selected by the Secretary for such purposes.




(h) *Supplemental payment for Indian Health Service and Tribal hospitals and Puerto Rico hospitals.* (1) For fiscal year 2023 and each subsequent fiscal year, Indian Health Service and Tribal Hospitals and Puerto Rico hospitals that qualify for an additional payment for uncompensated care under paragraph (g) of this section for the applicable fiscal year may also qualify to receive a supplemental payment.


(2) Indian Health Service and Tribal Hospitals and Puerto Rico hospitals that do not have a Factor 3 amount for fiscal year 2022 determined under paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(C)(*9*) of this section are not eligible to receive a supplemental payment under this paragraph (h).


(3) The amount of the supplemental payment for a fiscal year is determined as the difference between the following:


(i) A base year amount defined as the FY 2022 uncompensated care payment determined for the hospital, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, adjusted by 1 plus the percent change in the aggregate amount of uncompensated care payments as estimated by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section between fiscal year 2022 and the applicable fiscal year. If the hospital did not qualify for an additional payment for uncompensated care under paragraph (g) of this section for fiscal year 2022, CMS uses the Factor 3 determined for the hospital under paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(C)(*9*) of this section to estimate the amount of the additional payment for uncompensated care that the hospital would have received in fiscal year 2022 if the hospital had qualified for an additional payment for uncompensated care under paragraph (g)(1) of this section for that fiscal year.


(ii) The additional payment for uncompensated care determined for the hospital for the applicable fiscal year, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(4) If the base year amount under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section is equal to or lower than the additional payment for uncompensated care determined for the hospital for the applicable fiscal year in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the hospital will not receive a supplemental payment under paragraph (h) of this section for that fiscal year.




(i) *Manner and timing of payments.* (1) Interim payments are made during the payment year to each hospital that is estimated to be eligible for payments under this section at the time of the annual final rule for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, subject to the final determination of eligibility at the time of cost report settlement for each hospital. For FY 2025, interim uncompensated care payments are calculated based on an average of the most recent 2 years of available historical discharge data. For FY 2026 and subsequent years, interim uncompensated care payments are calculated based on an average of the most recent 3 years of available historical discharge data.


(2) Final payment determinations are made at the time of cost report settlement, based on the final determination of each hospital's eligibility for payment under this section.
