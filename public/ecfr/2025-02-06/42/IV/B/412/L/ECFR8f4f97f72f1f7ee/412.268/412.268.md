# ยง 412.268   Subpoenas.

(a) *In general.* When reasonably necessary for the full presentation of a case, and only after a pre-decision request for information or data has failed to produce the necessary evidence, either upon its own motion or upon the request of a party, the MGCRB may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, for an oral hearing or the production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are relevant and material to any matter at issue.


(b) *Content of request.* The request must designate which witnesses or documents are to be produced, and describe addresses or locations with sufficient particularly to permit these witnesses or documents to be found. The request for a subpoena must state the pertinent facts that the party expects to establish by the requested witnesses or documents and whether these facts could be established by other evidence without the use of a subpoena.


(c) *Issuance.* Subpoenas are issued as provided in section 205(d) of the Act.


(d) *Payment for subpoena cost.* CMS pays for the cost of issuing subpoenas and the fees and mileage of any witness who is subpoenaed, as provided in section 205(d) of the Act.
