# § 412.273   Withdrawing an application, terminating an approved 3-year reclassification, or canceling a previous withdrawal or termination.

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.


*Termination* refers to the termination of an already existing 3-year MGCRB reclassification where such reclassification has already been in effect for 1 or 2 years, and there are 1 or 2 years remaining on the 3-year reclassification. A termination is effective only for the full fiscal year(s) remaining in the 3-year period at the time the request is received. Requests for terminations for part of a fiscal year are not considered.


*Withdrawal* refers to the withdrawal of a 3-year MGCRB reclassification that has not yet gone into effect or where the MGCRB has not yet issued a decision on the application.


(b) *General rule.* The MGCRB allows a hospital, or group of hospitals, to withdraw its application or to terminate an already existing 3-year reclassification, in accordance with this section.


(c) *Timing.* (1) A request for withdrawal must be received by the MGCRB—


(i) At any time before the MGCRB issues a decision on the application; or


(ii) After the MGCRB issues a decision, provided that the request for withdrawal is received by the MCGRB within 45 days of the date of filing for public inspection of the proposed rule at the website of the Office of the Federal Register, or within 7 calendar days of receiving a decision of the Administrator's in accordance with § 412.278, whichever is later concerning changes to the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and proposed payment rates for the fiscal year for which the application has been filed.


(2) A request for termination must be received by the MGCRB within 45 days of the date of filing for public inspection of the proposed rule at the website of the Office of the Federal Register, or within 7 calendar days of receiving a decision of the Administrator's in accordance with § 412.278, whichever is later concerning changes to the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and proposed payment rates for the fiscal year for which the termination is to apply.


(d) *Reapplication within the approved 3-year period, cancellations of terminations and withdrawals, and prohibition on overlapping reclassification approvals*—(1) *Cancellation of terminations or withdrawals.* Subject to the provisions of this section, a hospital (or group of hospitals) may cancel a withdrawal or termination in a subsequent year and request the MGCRB to reinstate the wage index reclassification for the remaining fiscal year(s) of the 3-year period. (Withdrawals may be cancelled only in cases where the MGCRB issued a decision on the geographic reclassification request.)


(2) *Timing and process of cancellation request.* Cancellation requests must be submitted in writing to the MGCRB according to the method prescribed by the MGCRB no later than the deadline for submitting reclassification applications for the following fiscal year, as specified in § 412.256(a)(2).


(3) *Reapplications.* A hospital may apply for reclassification to a different area (that is, an area different from the one to which it was originally reclassified for the 3-year period). If the application is approved, the reclassification will be effective for 3 years. Once a 3-year reclassification becomes effective, a hospital may no longer cancel a withdrawal or termination of another 3-year reclassification, regardless of whether the withdrawal or termination request is made within 3 years from the date of the withdrawal or termination.


(4) *Termination of existing 3-year reclassification.* In a case in which a hospital with an existing 3-year wage index reclassification applies to be reclassified to another area, its existing 3-year reclassification will be terminated when a second 3-year wage index reclassification goes into effect for payments for discharges on or after the following October 1.


(e) *Written request only.* (1) A request to withdraw an application must be submitted in writing to the MGCRB according to the method prescribed by the MGCRB by all hospitals that are party to the application.


(2) A request to terminate an approved reclassification must be submitted in writing to the MGCRB according to the method prescribed by the MGCRB by an individual hospital or by an individual hospital that is party to a group classification.




(f) *Appeal of the MGCRB's denial of a hospital's request for withdrawal or termination, or for cancellation of a withdrawal or termination.* (1) A hospital may file an appeal of the MGCRB's denial of its request for withdrawal or termination, or of the MGCRB's denial of its request for a cancellation of such withdrawal or termination, to the Administrator. The appeal must be received within 15 days of the date of the notice of the denial.


(2) Within 20 days of receipt of the hospital's request for appeal, the Administrator affirms or reverses the denial.
