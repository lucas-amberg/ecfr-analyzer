(2) *Operating inpatient prospective payment system standardized amount.* The hospital inpatient prospective payment system operating standardized amount—


(i) Is adjusted for the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system DRG weighting factors;


(ii) Is adjusted for different area wage levels based on the geographic classifications set forth at § 412.503 and the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system labor-related share, using the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index value for non-reclassified hospitals. For LTCHs located in Alaska and Hawaii, this amount is also adjusted by the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system cost of living adjustment factors;


(iii) Includes, where applicable, adjustments for indirect medical education costs and the costs of serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients.


(3) *Hospital inpatient prospective payment system capital Federal rate.* The hospital inpatient prospective payment system capital Federal rate—


(i) Is adjusted for the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system DRG weighting factors;


(ii) Is adjusted by the applicable geographic adjustment factors, including local cost variation based on the applicable geographic classifications set forth at § 412.503 and the applicable full hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index value for nonreclassified hospitals, applicable large urban location and cost of living adjustment factors for LTCHs for Alaska and Hawaii, if applicable; 


(iii) Includes, where applicable, capital inpatient prospective payment system adjustments for indirect medical education costs and the costs of serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients.


(4) *High cost outlier.* An additional payment for high cost outlier cases is based on the fixed loss amount established for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system.


(g) *Transition period for long-term care hospitals and satellite facilities paid under this subpart.* Except as specified in paragraph (h)(2), in the case of a long-term care hospital or a satellite facility that is paid under the provisions of this subpart on October 1, 2004 or of a hospital that is paid under the provisions of this subpart and whose qualifying period under § 412.23(e) began on or before October 1, 2004, the amount paid is calculated as specified below:
