(d) *Special treatment of urban single or MSA dominant hospitals.* (1) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, in the case of a long-term care hospital or long-term care hospital satellite facility that admits Medicare patients from the only other hospital in the MSA or from a referring MSA dominant hospital as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, that are not co-located with the long-term care hospital or with the satellite of a long-term care hospital for any cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 2007, in which the long-term care hospital or satellite facility has a discharged Medicare inpatient population of whom more than the percentage calculated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section were admitted to the hospital from the single or MSA-dominant referring hospital, payment for the Medicare discharges who are admitted from the referring hospital and who cause the long-term care hospital or long-term care hospital satellite facility to exceed the applicable threshold for Medicare discharges who have been admitted from the referring hospital is the lesser of the amount otherwise payable under this subpart or the amount under this subpart that is equivalent, as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, to the amount that otherwise would be determined under subpart A, § 412.1(a). Payments for the remainder of the long-term care hospital's or satellite facility's Medicare discharges admitted from that referring hospital are made under the rules in this subpart at §§ 412.500 through 412.541 with no adjustment under this section.


(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the percentage threshold is equal to the percentage of total Medicare discharges in the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the hospital is located that are from the referring hospital, but in no case is less than 25 percent or more than 50 percent.


(3) In determining the percentage of patients admitted from the referring hospital under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, patients on whose behalf a Medicare outlier payment was made at the referring hospital are not counted toward the applicable threshold.

(e) *Calculation of adjusted payment*—(1) *Calculation of adjusted long-term care hospital prospective payment system amount.* CMS calculates an amount payable under subpart O equivalent to an amount that would otherwise be paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system at subpart A, § 412.1(a). The amount is based on the sum of the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system operating standardized amount and capital Federal rate in effect at the time of the long-term care hospital discharge.


(2) *Operating inpatient prospective payment system standardized amount.* The hospital inpatient prospective payment system operating standardized amount—


(i) Is adjusted for the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system DRG weighting factors;


(ii) Is adjusted for different area wage levels based on the geographic classifications defined at § 412.503 and the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system labor-related share, using the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index value for nonreclassified hospitals. For long-term care hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii, this amount is also adjusted by the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system cost of living adjustment factors; 


(iii) Includes, where applicable, adjustments for indirect medical education costs and for the costs of serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients.


(3) *Hospital inpatient prospective payment system capital Federal rate.* The hospital inpatient prospective payment system capital Federal rate—


(i) Is adjusted for the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system DRG weighting factors;


(ii) Is adjusted by the applicable geographic adjustment factors, including local cost variation based on the applicable geographic classifications set forth at § 412.503 and the applicable full hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index value for non-reclassified hospitals, applicable large urban location and cost of living adjustment factors for long-term care hospitals for Alaska and Hawaii, if applicable; 


(iii) Includes, where applicable, capital inpatient prospective payment system adjustments for indirect medical education costs and the costs of serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients.


(4) *High cost outlier.* An additional payment for high cost outlier cases is based on the applicable fixed loss amount established for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system.


(f) *Transition period for long-term care hospitals and satellites paid under this section.* In the case of a long-term care hospital or satellite of a long-term care hospital that is paid under the provisions of this section, the thresholds applied under paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section will not be less than the percentages specified below:


(1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2007 and before July 1, 2008, the lesser of 75 percent of the total number of Medicare discharges that were admitted to the long-term care hospital or satellite facility of a long-term care hospital from all referring hospitals not co-located with the long-term care hospital or with the satellite facility of a long-term care hospital during the cost reporting period or the percentage of Medicare discharges that had been admitted to the long-term care hospital or satellite of a long-term care hospital from that referring hospital during the long-term care hospital's or satellite's RY 2005 cost reporting period.


(2) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2008 and before July 1, 2009, the lesser of 50 percent of the total number of Medicare discharges that were admitted to the long-term care hospital or to the satellite facility of a long-term care hospital from all referring hospitals not co-located with the long-term care hospital or with the satellite facility of a long-term care hospital during the cost reporting period or the percentage of Medicare discharges that had been admitted from that referring hospital during the long-term care hospital's or satellite's RY 2005 cost reporting period.


(3) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2009, 25 percent of the total number of Medicare discharges that were admitted to the long-term care hospital or to the satellite facility of a long-term care hospital from all referring hospitals not co-located with the long-term care hospital or with the satellite facility of a long-term care hospital to the long-term care hospital during the cost reporting period.


(4) In determining the percentage of Medicare discharges admitted from the referring hospital under this paragraph, patients on whose behalf a Medicare high cost outlier payment was made at the referring hospital are not counted toward this threshold.
