(a) With respect to renal dialysis services as defined under § 413.171, except for those renal dialysis services furnished during payment year 2022, in the case of an ESRD facility that does not earn enough points under the program described at § 413.178 to meet or exceed the minimum total performance score (as defined at § 413.178(a)(8)) established by CMS for a payment year (as defined at § 413.178(a)(10)), payments otherwise made to the facility under § 413.230 for renal dialysis services during the payment year will be reduced by up to 2 percent as follows:


(1) For every 10 points that the total performance score (as defined at § 413.178(a)(14)) earned by the ESRD facility falls below the minimum total performance score, the payments otherwise made will be reduced by 0.5 percent.


(2) [Reserved]


(b) Any payment reduction will apply only to the payment year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the single payment amount under this subpart for services provided in a subsequent payment year.
