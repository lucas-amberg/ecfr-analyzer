(b) *Other appeals.* (1) A facility that has requested higher payment per treatment in accordance with § 413.180 may request review from the contractor or the PRRB if CMS has denied the request in whole or in part. In such a case, the procedure in subpart R of part 405 of this chapter is followed to the extent that it is applicable.


(2) The PRRB has the authority to review the action taken by CMS on the facility's requests. However, the PRRB's decision is subject to review by the Administrator under § 405.1875 of this chapter.

(2) The facility may not submit to the reviewing entity, whether it is the contractor or the PRRB, any additional information or cost data that had not been submitted to CMS at the time CMS evaluated the exception request.


(d) *Determining amount in controversy.* For purposes of determining PRRB jurisdiction under subpart R of part 405 of this chapter for the appeals described in paragraph (b) of this section—


(1) The amount in controversy per treatment is determined by subtracting the amount of program payment from the amount the facility requested under § 413.180; and
