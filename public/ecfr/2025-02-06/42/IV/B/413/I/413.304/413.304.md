# ยง 413.304   Eligibility for prospectively determined payment rates.

(a) *General rule.* An SNF is eligible to receive a prospectively determined payment rate for a cost reporting period if it had fewer than 1,500 Medicare covered inpatient days as reported on a Medicare cost report in its immediately preceding cost reporting period. This criterion applies even if the SNF received a prospectively determined payment rate during the preceding cost reporting period. 


(b) *Less than a full cost reporting period.* If the cost reporting period that precedes an SNF's request for prospectively determined payment is not a full cost reporting period, the SNF is eligible to receive prospectively determined payment rates only if the average daily Medicare census for the period (Medicare inpatient days divided by the total number of days in the cost reporting period) is not greater than 4.1. 


(c) *Newly-participating SNFs.* An SNF is eligible to receive prospectively determined payment rates for its first cost reporting period for which it is approved to participate in Medicare.
