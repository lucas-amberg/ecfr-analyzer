# § 413.335   Basis of payment.

(a) *Method of payment.* Under the prospective payment system, SNFs receive a per diem payment of a predetermined rate for inpatient services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. The per diem payments are made on the basis of the Federal payment rate described in § 413.337 and, during a transition period, on the basis of a blend of the Federal rate and the facility-specific rate described in § 413.340. These per diem payment rates are determined according to the methodology described in §§ 413.337 and 413.340.


(b) *Payment in full.* (1) The payment rates represent payment in full (subject to applicable coinsurance as described in subpart G of part 409 of this chapter) for all costs (routine, ancillary, and capital-related) associated with furnishing inpatient SNF services to Medicare beneficiaries other than costs associated with approved educational activities as described in § 413.85.


(2) In addition to the Federal per diem payment amounts, SNFs receive payment for bad debts of Medicare beneficiaries, as specified in § 413.89 of this part.
