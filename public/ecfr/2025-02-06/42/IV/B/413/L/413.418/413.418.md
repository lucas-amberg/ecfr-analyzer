(a) *General.* A donor community hospital (a Medicare-certified non-TH) and a TH incur costs for hospital services attributable to a deceased donor or a donor whose death is imminent. These services must not be part of medical treatment that primarily offers a medical benefit to the patient as determined by a healthcare team, must be authorized by the OPO, and are included as organ acquisition costs when:


(1) There is consent to donate; and


(2) Declaration of death has been made, or if a declaration of death has not been made, death is imminent and it is necessary that the services be provided prior to declaration of death in order to avoid compromising the viability of the organs for transplant.


(b) *Amounts billed for organ acquisition costs.* When a donor community hospital or TH incurs costs for services furnished to a deceased donor, or a donor whose death is imminent as described in paragraph (a) of this section, as authorized by the OPO, the donor community hospital or TH must bill the OPO the lesser of its customary charges that are reduced to cost by applying its most recently available hospital specific inpatient operating cost-to-charge ratio for the period in which the service was rendered, or a negotiated rate.
