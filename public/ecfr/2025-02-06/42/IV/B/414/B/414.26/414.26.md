# § 414.26   Determining the GAF.

CMS establishes a GAF for each service in each fee schedule area. 


(a) *Geographic indices.* CMS uses the following indices to establish the GAF: 


(1) An index that reflects one-fourth of the difference between the relative value of physicians' work effort in each of the different fee schedule areas as determined under § 414.22(a) and the national average of that work effort. 


(2) An index that reflects the relative costs of the mix of goods and services comprising practice expenses (other than malpractice expenses) in each of the different fee schedule areas as determined under § 414.22(b) compared to the national average of those costs. 


(3) An index that reflects the relative costs of malpractice expenses in each of the different fee schedule areas as determined under § 414.22(c) compared to the national average of those costs. 


(b) *Class-specific practice cost indices.* If the application of a single index to different classes of services would be substantially inequitable because of differences in the mix of goods and services comprising practice expenses for the different classes of services, more than one index may be established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 


(c) *Adjusting the practice expense index to account for the Frontier State floor*—(1) *General criteria.* Effective on or after January 1, 2011, CMS will adjust the practice expense index for physicians' services furnished in qualifying States to recognize the practice expense index floor established for Frontier States. A qualifying State must meet the following criteria:


(i) At least 50 percent of counties located within the State have a population density less than 6 persons per square mile.


(ii) The State does not receive a non-labor related share adjustment determined by the Secretary to take into account the unique circumstances of hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii.


(2) *Amount of adjustment.* The practice expense value applied for physicians' services furnished in a qualifying State will be not less than 1.00.


(3) *Process for determining adjustment.* (i) CMS will use the most recent population estimate data published by the U.S. Census Bureau to determine county definitions and population density. This analysis will be periodically revised, such as for updates to the decennial census data.


(ii) CMS will publish annually a listing of qualifying Frontier States receiving a practice expense index floor attributable to this provision.


(d) *Computation of GAF.* The GAF for each fee schedule area is the sum of the physicians' work adjustment factor, the practice expense adjustment factor, and the malpractice cost adjustment factor, as defined in this section:


(1) The geographic physicians' work adjustment factor for a service is the product of the proportion of the total relative value for the service that reflects the RVUs for the work component and the geographic physicians' work index value established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(2) The geographic practice expense adjustment factor for a service is the product of the proportion of the total relative value for the service that reflects the RVUs for the practice expense component, multiplied by the geographic practice cost index (GPCI) value established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(3) The geographic malpractice adjustment factor for a service is the product of the proportion of the total relative value for the service that reflects the RVUs for the malpractice component, multiplied by the GPCI value established under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
