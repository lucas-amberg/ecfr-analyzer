(a) *General rule.* CMS establishes uniform national definitions of services, codes to represent services, and payment modifiers to the codes. 


(b) *Specific types of policies.* CMS establishes uniform national ancillary policies necessary to implement the fee schedule for physician services. These include, but are not limited to, the following policies: 


(1) Global surgery policy (for example, post- and pre-operative periods and services, and intra-operative services). 


(2) Professional and technical components (for example, payment for services, such as an EEG, which typically comprise a technical component (the taking of the test) and a professional component (the interpretation)). 


(3) Payment modifiers (for example, assistant-at-surgery, multiple surgery, bilateral surgery, split surgical global services, team surgery, and unusual services).
