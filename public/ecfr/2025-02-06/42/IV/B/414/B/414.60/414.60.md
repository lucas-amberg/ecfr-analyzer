(b) *To whom payment may be made.* Payment for an anesthesia service furnished by a CRNA may be made to the CRNA or to any individual or entity (such as a hospital, critical access hospital, physician, group practice, or ambulatory surgical center) with which the CRNA has an employment or contract relationship that provides for payment to be made to the individual or entity. 


(c) *Condition for payment.* Payment for the services of a CRNA may be made only on an assignment related basis, and any assignment accepted by a CRNA is binding on any other person presenting a claim or request for payment for the service.
