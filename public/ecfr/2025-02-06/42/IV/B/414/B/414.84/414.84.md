*Attendance payment* means a payment that is made to an MDPP supplier for furnishing services to an MDPP beneficiary when the MDPP beneficiary attends an MDPP core or core maintenance session. CMS will allow up to 22 sessions (alone or in combination with other codes, not to exceed 22 sessions in a 12- month timeframe).

(b) *Performance payment.* CMS makes one or more types of performance payments to an MDPP supplier as specified in this paragraph (b). Each type of performance payment is made only if the beneficiary achieves the applicable performance goal. Certain performance goals are allowed only once per MDPP beneficiary and include the performance goals in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(2)(i) of this section.

As a condition of payment, the MDPP supplier must report the NPI of the coach who furnished the session on the claim for the MDPP session. The two types of performance payments are as follows:
