# § 414.240   Procedures for making benefit category determinations and payment determinations for new durable medical equipment, prosthetic devices, orthotics and prosthetics, surgical dressings, and therapeutic shoes and inserts.

(a) *Definitions.* For the purpose of this subpart—


*Benefit category determination* means a national determination regarding whether an item or service meets the Medicare definition of durable medical equipment at section 1861(n) of the Act, a prosthetic device at section 1861(s)(8) of the Act and further defined under section 1834(h)(4) of the Act, an orthotic or leg, arm, back or neck brace, a prosthetic or artificial leg, arm or eye at section 1861(s)(9) of the Act, is a surgical dressing, or is a therapeutic shoe or insert subject to sections 1834(a), (h), or (i) of the Act and the rules of this subpart and is not otherwise excluded from coverage by statute.


(b) *General rule.* The procedures for determining whether new items and services addressed in a request for a HCPCS Level II code(s) or by other means meet the definition of items and services paid for in accordance with this subpart are as follows:


(1) At the start of a HCPCS coding cycle, CMS performs an analysis to determine if the item or service is statutorily excluded from coverage under Medicare under section 1862 of the Act, and, if not excluded by statute, whether the item or service is durable medical equipment, a prosthetic device as further defined under section 1834(h)(4) of the Act, an orthotic or prosthetic, a surgical dressing, or a therapeutic shoe or insert.


(2) If a preliminary determination is made that the item or service is durable medical equipment, a prosthetic device, an orthotic or prosthetic, a surgical dressing, or a therapeutic shoe or insert, CMS makes a preliminary payment determination for the item or service.


(3) CMS posts preliminary benefit category determinations and payment determinations on *CMS.gov* approximately 2 weeks prior to a public meeting.


(4) After consideration of public consultation provided at a public meeting on preliminary benefit category determinations and payment determinations for items and services, CMS establishes the benefit category determinations and payment determinations for items and services through program instructions.
