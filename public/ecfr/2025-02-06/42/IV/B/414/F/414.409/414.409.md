# ยง 414.409   Special payment rules.

(a) *Payment on a bundled, continuous rental basis.* In no more than 12 CBAs, in conjunction with competitions that begin after January 1, 2015, payment is made on a bundled, continuous monthly rental basis for standard power wheelchairs and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices. The CBAs and competitions where these payment rules apply are announced in advance of each competition, with the payment rules in this section used in lieu of the payment rules at ยง 414.408(f) thru (h), (j)(2), (j)(3), and (j)(7), and (k). The single payment amounts are established based on bids submitted and accepted for furnishing rented standard power wheelchairs and CPAP devices on a monthly basis for each month of medical need during the contract period. The single payment amount for the monthly rental of the DME includes payment for the rented equipment, maintenance and servicing of the rented equipment, and replacement of supplies and accessories necessary for the effective use of the rented equipment. Separate payment for replacement of equipment, repair or maintenance and servicing of equipment, or for replacement of accessories and supplies necessary for the effective use of equipment is not allowed under any circumstance.


(b) *Payment for grandfathered DME items paid on a bundled, continuous rental basis.* Payment to a supplier that elects to be a grandfathered supplier of DME furnished in CBPs where these special payment rules apply is made in accordance with ยง 414.408(a)(1).


(c) *Supplier transitions for DME paid on a bundled, continuous rental basis.* Changes from a non-contract supplier to a contract supplier at the beginning of a CBP where payment is made on a bundled, continuous monthly rental basis results in the contract supplier taking on responsibility for meeting all of the monthly needs for furnishing the covered DME. In the event that a beneficiary relocates from a CBA where these special payment rules apply to an area where rental cap rules apply, a new period of continuous use begins for the capped rental item as long as the item is determined to be medically necessary.


(d) *Responsibility for repair and maintenance and servicing of power wheelchairs.* In no more than 12 CBAs where payment for power wheelchairs is made on a capped rental basis, for power wheelchairs furnished in conjunction with competitions that begin after January 1, 2015, contract suppliers that furnish power wheelchairs under contracts awarded based on these competitions shall continue to repair power wheelchairs they furnish following transfer of title to the equipment to the beneficiary. The responsibility of the contract supplier to repair, maintain and service beneficiary-owned power wheelchairs does not apply to power wheelchairs that the contract supplier did not furnish to the beneficiary. For power wheelchairs that the contract supplier furnishes during the contract period, the responsibility of the contract supplier to repair, maintain and service the power wheelchair once it is owned by the beneficiary continues until the reasonable useful lifetime of the equipment expires, coverage for the power wheelchair ends, or the beneficiary relocates outside the CBA where the item was furnished. The contract supplier may not charge the beneficiary or the program for any necessary repairs or maintenance and servicing of a beneficiary-owned power wheelchair it furnished during the contract period.
