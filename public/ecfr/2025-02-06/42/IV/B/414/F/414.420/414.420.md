# § 414.420   Physician or treating practitioner authorization and consideration of clinical efficiency and value of items.

(a) *Prescription for a particular brand item or mode of delivery.* (1) A physician or treating practitioner may prescribe, in writing, a particular brand of an item for which payment is made under a competitive bidding program, or a particular mode of delivery for an item, if he or she determines that the particular brand or mode of delivery would avoid an adverse medical outcome for the beneficiary.


(2) When a physician or treating practitioner prescribes a particular brand or mode of delivery of an item under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the physician or treating practitioner must document the reason in the beneficiary's medical record why the particular brand or mode of delivery is medically necessary to avoid an adverse medical outcome.


(b) *Furnishing of a prescribed particular brand item or mode of delivery.* If a physician or treating practitioner prescribes a particular brand of an item or mode of delivery, the contract supplier must—


(1) Furnish the particular brand or mode of delivery as prescribed by the physician or treating practitioner;


(2) Consult with the physician or treating practitioner to find an appropriate alternative brand of item or mode of delivery for the beneficiary and obtain a revised written prescription from the physician or treating practitioner; or


(3) Assist the beneficiary in locating a contract supplier that can furnish the particular brand of item or mode of delivery prescribed by the physician or treating practitioner.


(c) *Payment for a particular brand of item or mode of delivery.* Medicare does not make an additional payment to a contract supplier that furnishes a particular brand or mode of delivery for an item, as directed by a prescription written by the beneficiary's physician or treating practitioner.


(d) *Prohibition on billing for an item different from the particular brand of item or mode of delivery prescribed.* A contract supplier is prohibited from submitting a claim to Medicare if it furnishes an item different from that specified in the written prescription received from the beneficiary's physician or treating practitioner. Payment will not be made to a contract supplier that submits a claim prohibited by this paragraph.
