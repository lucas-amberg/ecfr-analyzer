# § 414.522   Payment for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests.

(a) The payment rate for a new ADLT—


(1) During the new ADLT initial period, is equal to its actual list charge.


(2) Prior to the new ADLT initial period, is determined by the Medicare Administrative Contractor based on information provided by the laboratory seeking new ADLT status for its laboratory test.


(b) After the new ADLT initial period, the payment rate for a new ADLT is equal to the weighted median established under the payment methodology described in § 414.507(b).


(c) If, after the new ADLT initial period, the actual list charge of a new ADLT is greater than 130 percent of the weighted median established under the payment methodology described in § 414.507, CMS will recoup the difference between the ADLT actual list charge and 130 percent of the weighted median.


(d) If CMS does not receive any applicable information for a new ADLT by the last day of the second quarter of the new ADLT initial period, the payment rate for the test is determined either by the gapfilling or crosswalking method as described in § 414.508(b)(1) and (2).
