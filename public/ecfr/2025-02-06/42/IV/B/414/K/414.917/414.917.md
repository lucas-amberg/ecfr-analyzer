# § 414.917   Dispute resolution and process for suspension or termination of approved CAP contract and termination of physician participation under exigent circumstances.

(a) *General rule.* If a participating CAP physician finds an approved CAP vendor's service, or the quality of a CAP drug supplied by the approved CAP vendor to be unsatisfactory, then the physician may address the issue first through the approved CAP vendor's grievance process, and second through an alternative dispute resolution process administered by the designated carrier and CMS. If CMS suspends an approved CAP vendor's CAP contract for noncompliance or terminates the CAP contract in accordance with § 414.914(a), the approved CAP vendor may request a reconsideration in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Dispute resolution.* (1) When a participating CAP physician is dissatisfied with an approved CAP vendor's service or the quality of a CAP drug supplied by the approved CAP vendor, then the participating CAP physician may use the approved CAP vendor's grievance process.

(i) Review the approved CAP vendor's performance; and


(ii) Potentially recommend termination of the approved CAP vendor's CAP contract.

(i) Gathers information from the local carrier, the participating CAP physician, the beneficiary, and the approved CAP vendor; and

A determination must be made as to whether the approved CAP vendor has been meeting the service and quality obligations of its CAP contract. The approved CAP vendor's contract will remain suspended during the reconsideration process.
