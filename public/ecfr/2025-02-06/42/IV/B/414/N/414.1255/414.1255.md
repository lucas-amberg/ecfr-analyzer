# ยง 414.1255   Benchmarks for cost measures.

(a) For the CY 2015 payment adjustment period, the benchmark for each cost measure is the national mean of the performance rates calculated among all groups of physicians for which beneficiaries are attributed to the group of physicians that are subject to the value-based payment modifier. In calculating the national benchmark, groups of physicians' performance rates are weighted by the number of beneficiaries used to calculate the group of physician's performance rate.


(b) Beginning with the CY 2016 payment adjustment period, the benchmark for each cost measure is the national mean of the performance rates calculated among all groups and solo practitioners that meet the minimum number of cases for that measure under ยง 414.1265(a). In calculating the national benchmark, groups and solo practitioners' performance rates are weighted by the number of beneficiaries used to calculate the group or solo practitioner's performance rate.
