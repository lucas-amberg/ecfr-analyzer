(1) *For Medicare Part B claims measures, MIPS CQMs, eCQMs, or QCDR measures.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, submits data on at least six measures, including at least one outcome measure.

If an applicable outcome measure is not available, report one other high priority measure. If the set contains fewer than six measures or if fewer than six measures within the set apply to the MIPS eligible clinician, group, virtual group, or APM Entity, report on each measure that is applicable.


(A) For eCQMs, the submission of data requires the utilization of CEHRT, as defined at § 414.1305.

(ii) [Reserved]


(4) *For Medicare CQMs.* (i) A MIPS eligible clinician, group, and APM Entity reporting on the Medicare CQMs (reporting quality data on beneficiaries eligible for Medicare CQMs as defined at § 425.20) within the APP measure set and administering the CAHPS for MIPS Survey as required under the APP.
