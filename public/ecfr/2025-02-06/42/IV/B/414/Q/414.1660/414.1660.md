# ยง 414.1660   Continuity of pricing when HCPCS codes are divided or combined.

(a) *General rule.* If HCPCS codes for lymphedema compression treatment items are divided or combined, the payment amounts for the old codes are mapped to the new codes to ensure continuity of pricing.


(b) *Mapping of payment amounts.* (1) If there is a single code that describes two or more distinct complete items (for example, two different but related or similar items), and separate codes are subsequently established for each item, then the payment amounts that applied to the single code continue to apply to each of the items described by the new codes.


(2) If the codes for several different items are combined into a single code, then the payment amounts for the new code are established using the average (arithmetic mean), weighted by allowed services, of the payment amounts for the formerly separate codes.
