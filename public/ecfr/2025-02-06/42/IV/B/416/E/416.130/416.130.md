# ยง 416.130   Publication of revised payment methodologies.

Whenever CMS proposes to revise the payment rate for ASCs, CMS publishes a notice in the _Federal Register_ describing the revision. The notice also explains the basis on which the rates were established. After reviewing public comments, CMS publishes a notice establishing the rates authorized by this section. In setting these rates, CMS may adopt reasonable classifications of facilities and may establish different rates for different types of surgical procedures.
