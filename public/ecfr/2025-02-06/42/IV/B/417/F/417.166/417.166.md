# § 417.166   Waiver of assurances.

(a) *General rule.* CMS may release an HMO from compliance with any assurances the HMO gives under subpart D of this part if—


(1) The qualification requirements are changed by Federal law; or


(2) The HMO shows good cause, consistent with the purposes of title XIII of the PHS Act.


(b) *Basis for finding of good cause.* (1) Grounds upon which CMS may find good cause include but are not limited to the following:


(i) The HMO has filed for reorganization under Federal bankruptcy provisions and the reorganization can only be approved with the waiver of the assurances.


(ii) State laws governing the entity have been changed after it signed the assurances so as to prohibit the HMO from being organized and operated in a manner consistent with the signed assurances.


(2) Changes in State laws do not constitute good cause to the extent that the changes are preempted by Federal law under section 1311 of the PHS Act.


(c) *Consequences of waiver.* If CMS waives any assurances regarding compliance with section 1301 of the PHS Act, CMS concurrently revokes the HMO's qualification unless the waiver is based on paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
