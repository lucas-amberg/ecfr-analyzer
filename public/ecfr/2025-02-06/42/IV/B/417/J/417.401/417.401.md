(1) The other entity agrees to furnish specified services to the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees; 


(2) The HMO or CMP retains responsibility for the services; and 


(3) Medicare payment to the HMO or CMP discharges the beneficiary's obligation to pay for the services. 


*Benefit stabilization fund* means a fund established by CMS, at the request of a risk HMO or CMP, to withhold a portion of the per capita payments available to the HMO or CMP and pay that portion in a subsequent contract period for the purpose of stabilizing fluctuations in the availability of the additional benefits the HMO or CMP provides to its Medicare enrollees.
