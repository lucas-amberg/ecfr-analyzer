# § 417.424   Denial of enrollment.

(a) *Basis for denial.* An HMO or CMP may deny enrollment to an individual who meets the criteria of § 417.422 if acceptance would—


(1) Cause the number of enrollees who are Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries to exceed 50 percent of the HMO's or CMP's total enrollment;


(2) Prevent the HMO or CMP from complying with any of the other contract qualifying conditions set forth in subpart J of this part; 


(3) Require the HMO or CMP to exceed its enrollment capacity; or 


(4) Cause the enrollment to become substantially nonrepresentative of the general population in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area.


(b) *Selection policies.* (1) Denial under paragraph (a)(4) of this section must be in accordance with written selection policies approved by CMS. (2) Enrollment of individuals will not be considered to make the enrollment of the HMO or CMP substantially nonrepresentative of the general population in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area unless, as a result of the enrollment, the proportion of the subgroup of enrollees to which the enrollee belongs as compared to the HMO's or CMP's total enrollment exceeds by at least ten percent the subgroup's proportion of the general population in the geographic area of the HMO or CMP. (A subgroup is a class of Medicare enrollees of an HMO or CMP that CMS constructs on the basis of actuarial factors.)
