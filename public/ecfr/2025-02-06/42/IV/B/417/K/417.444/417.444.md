# § 417.444   Special rules for certain enrollees of risk HMOs and CMPs.

(a) *Applicability.* This section applies to any Medicare enrollee of a risk HMO or CMP who meets the following conditions: 


(1) On February 1, 1985, was enrolled—


(i) In an HMO or CMP that had in effect a cost contract entered into under section 1876 of the Act in accordance with regulations in effect before February 1, 1985; or 


(ii) In an HCPP that was being reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis under section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the Act. 


(2) Has continued enrollment in the same entity without interruption or disenrolled after February 1, 1985, and later reenrolled in the same entity. 


(b) *Retention of nonrisk status*—(1) A “nonrisk” enrollee is a Medicare beneficiary who meets the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section and is enrolled in an entity that enters into a risk contract as an HMO or CMP. A “nonrisk” enrollee may retain nonrisk status indefinitely unless CMS determines under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that the enrollee's status must be changed, or the enrollee requests the change, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 


(2) A nonrisk enrollee of a risk HMO or CMP is not entitled to additional benefits under § 417.442. 


(c) *Conversion to risk status*—(1) *Conversion based on CMS determination.* If CMS determines that, for administrative reasons or because there are fewer than 75 current nonrisk Medicare enrollees remaining in the HMO or CMP, all of its nonrisk Medicare enrollees must be covered under the risk provisions of the contract, the conversion process is as follows: 


(i) CMS notifies each affected enrollee of the decision at least 90 days prior to the effective date. 


(ii) The nonrisk Medicare enrollees complete and sign forms stating that they understand and accept the new rules and benefits that will be applicable to them. 


(iii) The HMO or CMP notifies each affected enrollee, in writing, at least 30 days in advance, of the date upon which his or her coverage under the risk portion of the contract takes effect. 


(2) *Conversion based on enrollee's request.* A nonrisk Medicare enrollee requests, using a form identical or similar to the form described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that he or she be covered under the risk portion of the contract. 


(d) *Notification.* An HMO or CMP converting from a cost contract to a risk contract must, within 60 days of signing the risk contract, inform nonrisk enrollees of their right to remain nonrisk Medicare enrollees or to convert to risk enrollment at any time in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
