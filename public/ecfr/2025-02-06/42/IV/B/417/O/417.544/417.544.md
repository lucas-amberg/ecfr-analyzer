# ยง 417.544   Physicians' services furnished directly by the HMO or CMP.

(a) *Principles.* (1) Compensation paid by an HMO or CMP to physicians is an allowable cost to the extent that it is commensurate with the compensation paid for similar services performed by similar physicians practicing in the same or a similar locality.


(2) Physician compensation may take various forms, but the aggregate compensation allowable must be reasonable in relation to the services personally furnished.


(3) If aggregate physician compensation costs exceed what is normally incurred, the excess is not a reasonable cost.


(b) *Application.* (1) In determining the allowability of the costs of physicians' services, the cost of personal services (for example, expenses attributable to salaries, wages, incentive payments, fringe benefits) must be distinguished from the cost of nonpersonal services (for example, expenses attributable to facilities, equipment, support personnel, supplies).


(2) To be allowable, compensation must be reasonable in relation to the personal services furnished.
