*General principle.* The amount paid by an HMO or CMP for physicians' services and other Part B supplier services furnished under arrangements is an allowable cost to the extent it is reasonable. Costs are considered reasonable if they—

(b) Are comparable to costs incurred for similar services furnished by similar physicians or other suppliers in the same or a similar geographic area.
