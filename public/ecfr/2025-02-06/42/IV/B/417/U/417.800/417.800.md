# § 417.800   Payment to HCPPs: Definitions and basic rules.

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this subpart, unless the context indicates otherwise—


*Covered Part B services* means physicians' services, diagnostic X-ray tests, laboratory, other diagnostic tests, and any additional medical and other health services, that the HCPP furnishes to its Medicare enrollees.


*Health care prepayment plan (HCPP)* means an organization that meets the following conditions:


(1) Effective January 1, 1999, (or on the effective date of the HCPP agreement in the case of a 1998 applicant) either—


(A) Is union or employer sponsored; or


(B) Does not provide, or arrange for the provision of, any inpatient hospital services.


(2) Is responsible for the organization, financing, and delivery of covered Part B services to a defined population on a prepayment basis.


(3) Meets the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.


(4) Elects to be reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis.


*Medicare enrollee* means a beneficiary under Part B of Medicare who has been identified on CMS records as an enrollee of the HCPP. *Reporting period* means the period specified by CMS for which an HCPP must report its costs and utilization. 


(b) *Qualifying conditions.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an organization wishing to participate as an HCPP must—


(i) Enter into a written agreement with CMS as specified in § 417.801;


(ii) Furnish physicians' services through its employees or under a formal arrangement with a medical group, independent practice association or individual physicians; and 


(iii) Furnish covered Part B services to its Medicare enrollees through institutions, entities, and persons that have qualified under the applicable requirements of title XVIII of the Social Security Act and section 353 of the PHS Act.


(2) An organization that, as of January 31, 1983, was being reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis under section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the Act, and that would not otherwise meet the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may receive reimbursement on a reasonable cost basis as an HCPP, provided it files an agreement with CMS as required by § 417.801.


(c) *Payment of reasonable cost.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, CMS pays an HCPP on the basis of the reasonable cost it incurs, as specified in subpart O of this part, for the covered Part B services furnished to its Medicare enrollees.


(2) *Payment for Part B services: Basic rules*—(i) *Cost basis payment.* Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, CMS pays an HCPP on the basis of the reasonable costs it incurs, as specified in subpart O of this part, for the covered Part B services furnished to its Medicare enrollees. 


(ii) *Deductions.* In determining the amount due an HCPP for covered Part B services furnished to its Medicare enrollees, CMS deducts, from the reasonable cost actually incurred by the HCPP, the following: 


(A) The actuarial value of the Part B deductible. 


(B) An amount equal to 20 percent of the cost incurred for any service that is subject to the Medicare coinsurance.


(d) *Covered services not reimbursed to an HCPP.* (1) Services reimbursed under Part A are not reimbursable to an HCPP. CMS makes payment for these services directly to the hospital, or other provider of services, on a reasonable cost basis through the provider's Medicare fiscal intermediary (for more details, see parts 412 and 413 of this chapter). 


(2) Covered Part B services furnished by a provider of services to an HCPP's Medicare enrollees are not payable to the HCPP. CMS makes payment for these services to the provider on behalf of the Medicare enrollee through the provider's Medicare fiscal intermediary. This requirement does not affect Medicare payment to the HCPP for physicians' services furnished to its Medicare enrollees for which the physicians are compensated by the HCPP. 


(e) *Payment for services to nonenrollees.* CMS makes payment to an HCPP for covered Part B services furnished by the HCPP to a Medicare beneficiary who is not enrolled in the HCPP if the beneficiary assigns his rights to payment in accordance with § 424.55 of this chapter. Payment is made on a reasonable charge basis through the HCPP's Medicare carrier.
