# § 418.56   Condition of participation: Interdisciplinary group, care planning, and coordination of services.

The hospice must designate an interdisciplinary group or groups as specified in paragraph (a) of this section which, in consultation with the patient's attending physician, must prepare a written plan of care for each patient. The plan of care must specify the hospice care and services necessary to meet the patient and family-specific needs identified in the comprehensive assessment as such needs relate to the terminal illness and related conditions.


(a) *Standard: Approach to service delivery.* (1) The hospice must designate an interdisciplinary group or groups composed of individuals who work together to meet the physical, medical, psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual needs of the hospice patients and families facing terminal illness and bereavement. Interdisciplinary group members must provide the care and services offered by the hospice, and the group, in its entirety, must supervise the care and services. The hospice must designate a registered nurse that is a member of the interdisciplinary group to provide coordination of care and to ensure continuous assessment of each patient's and family's needs and implementation of the interdisciplinary plan of care. The interdisciplinary group must include, but is not limited to, individuals who are qualified and competent to practice in the following professional roles:


(i) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy (who is an employee or under contract with the hospice).


(ii) A registered nurse.


(iii) A social worker, marriage and family therapist, or a mental health counselor.


(iv) A pastoral or other counselor.


(2) If the hospice has more than one interdisciplinary group, it must identify a specifically designated interdisciplinary group to establish policies governing the day-to-day provision of hospice care and services.


(b) *Standard: Plan of care.* All hospice care and services furnished to patients and their families must follow an individualized written plan of care established by the hospice interdisciplinary group in collaboration with the attending physician (if any), the patient or representative, and the primary caregiver in accordance with the patient's needs if any of them so desire. The hospice must ensure that each patient and the primary care giver(s) receive education and training provided by the hospice as appropriate to their responsibilities for the care and services identified in the plan of care.


(c) *Standard: Content of the plan of care.* The hospice must develop an individualized written plan of care for each patient. The plan of care must reflect patient and family goals and interventions based on the problems identified in the initial, comprehensive, and updated comprehensive assessments. The plan of care must include all services necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related conditions, including the following:


(1) Interventions to manage pain and symptoms.


(2) A detailed statement of the scope and frequency of services necessary to meet the specific patient and family needs.


(3) Measurable outcomes anticipated from implementing and coordinating the plan of care.


(4) Drugs and treatment necessary to meet the needs of the patient.


(5) Medical supplies and appliances necessary to meet the needs of the patient.


(6) The interdisciplinary group's documentation of the patient's or representative's level of understanding, involvement, and agreement with the plan of care, in accordance with the hospice's own policies, in the clinical record.


(d) *Standard: Review of the plan of care.* The hospice interdisciplinary group (in collaboration with the individual's attending physician, if any) must review, revise and document the individualized plan as frequently as the patient's condition requires, but no less frequently than every 15 calendar days. A revised plan of care must include information from the patient's updated comprehensive assessment and must note the patient's progress toward outcomes and goals specified in the plan of care.


(e) *Standard: Coordination of services.* The hospice must develop and maintain a system of communication and integration, in accordance with the hospice's own policies and procedures, to—


(1) Ensure that the interdisciplinary group maintains responsibility for directing, coordinating, and supervising the care and services provided.


(2) Ensure that the care and services are provided in accordance with the plan of care.


(3) Ensure that the care and services provided are based on all assessments of the patient and family needs.


(4) Provide for and ensure the ongoing sharing of information between all disciplines providing care and services in all settings, whether the care and services are provided directly or under arrangement.


(5) Provide for an ongoing sharing of information with other non-hospice healthcare providers furnishing services unrelated to the terminal illness and related conditions.
