The individual is liable for the Medicare deductibles and coinsurance payments and for the difference between the reasonable and actual charge on unassigned claims on other covered services that are not considered hospice care. Examples of services not considered hospice care include: Services furnished before or after a hospice election period; services of the individual's attending physician, if the attending physician is not an employee of or working under an arrangement with the hospice; or Medicare services received for the treatment of an illness or injury not related to the individual's terminal condition.
