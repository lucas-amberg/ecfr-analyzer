# ยง 418.405   Effect of coinsurance liability on Medicare payment.

The Medicare payment rates established by CMS in accordance with ยง 418.306 are not reduced when the individual is liable for coinsurance payments. Instead, when establishing the payment rates, CMS offsets the estimated cost of services by an estimate of average coinsurance amounts hospices collect.
