# § 419.62   Transitional pass-through payments: General rules.

(a) *General.* CMS provides for additional payments under §§ 419.64 and 419.66 for certain innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologicals. 


(b) *Budget neutrality.* CMS establishes the additional payments under §§ 419.64 and 419.66 in a budget neutral manner. 


(c) *Uniform prospective reduction of pass-through payments.* (1) If CMS estimates before the beginning of a calendar year that the total amount of pass-through payments under §§ 419.64 and 419.66 for the year would exceed the applicable percentage (as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) of the total amount of Medicare payments under the outpatient prospective payment system. CMS will reduce, pro rata, the amount of each of the additional payments under §§ 419.64 and 419.66 for that year to ensure that the applicable percentage is not exceeded. 


(2) The applicable percentages are as follows: 


(i) For a year before CY 2004, the applicable percentage is 2.5 percent. 


(ii) For 2004 and subsequent years, the applicable percentage is a percentage specified by CMS up to (but not to exceed) 2.0 percent. 


(d) *CY 2002 incorporated amount.* For the portion of CY 2002 affected by these rules, CMS incorporated 75 percent of the estimated pass-through costs (before the incorporation and any pro rata reduction) for devices into the procedure APCs associated with these devices.
