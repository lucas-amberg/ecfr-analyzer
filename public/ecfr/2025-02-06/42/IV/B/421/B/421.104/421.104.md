(a) Beginning October 1, 2005, CMS assigns providers of services and other entities that may bill Part A benefits to intermediaries in a manner that will best support the transition to Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) under section 1874A of the Act in accordance with subpart E of this part.

These providers or entities must continue to bill the intermediary until one of the events in paragraph (b) of this section occurs.


(d) Providers or entities will only be granted exceptions to the provisions of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section if CMS deems the exception to be in the compelling interest of the Medicare program.
