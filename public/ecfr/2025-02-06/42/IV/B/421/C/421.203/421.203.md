(b) Notwithstanding whether or not a carrier meets the criteria and standards specified in ยง 421.201, if the cost incurred by the carrier to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the amount that CMS finds to be reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically operated carrier, those high costs may also be grounds for adverse action.
