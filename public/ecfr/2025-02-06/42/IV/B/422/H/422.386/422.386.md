(b) To determine whether the PSO meets the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, CMS will examine the following—

(3) The availability of outside financial resources to the PSO.


(c) If CMS determines that a PSO fails to meet the requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, CMS will require the PSO to initiate corrective action and pay all overdue obligations.


(d) If CMS determines that a PSO fails to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, CMS may require the PSO to initiate corrective action to—


(1) Change the distribution of its assets;


(2) Reduce its liabilities; or


(3) Make alternative arrangements to secure additional funding to restore the PSO's current ratio to 1:1.
