(i) The dual eligible special needs plan must offer to assist an enrollee in that dual eligible special needs plan with obtaining Medicaid covered services and resolving grievances, including requesting authorization of Medicaid services, as applicable, and navigating Medicaid appeals and grievances in connection with the enrollee's own Medicaid coverage, regardless of whether such coverage is in Medicaid fee-for-service or a Medicaid managed care plan, such as a Medicaid MCO, PIHP, or PAHP as defined in § 438.2 of this chapter. If the enrollee accepts the offer of assistance, the plan must provide the assistance. Examples of such assistance include the following:

(iv) The dual eligible special needs plan must, upon request from CMS, provide documentation demonstrating its compliance with this paragraph (a)(5).
