# § 422.630   Integrated grievances.

(a) *General rule.* In lieu of complying with § 422.564, and the grievance requirements of §§ 438.402, 438.406, 438.408, 438.414, and 438.416 of this chapter, each applicable integrated plan must comply with this section. Each applicable integrated plan must provide meaningful procedures for timely hearing and resolving integrated grievances between enrollees and the applicable integrated plan or any other entity or individual through which the applicable integrated plan provides covered items and services.


(b) *Timing.* An enrollee may file an integrated grievance at any time with the applicable integrated plan.


(c) *Filing.* An enrollee may file an integrated grievance orally or in writing with the applicable integrated plan, or with the State for an integrated grievance related to a Medicaid benefit, if the State has a process for accepting Medicaid grievances.


(d) *Expedited grievances.* An applicable integrated plan must respond to an enrollee's grievance within 24 hours if the complaint involves the applicable integrated plan's—


(1) Decision to invoke an extension relating to an integrated organization determination or integrated reconsideration; or


(2) Refusal to grant an enrollee's request for an expedited integrated organization determination under § 422.631 or expedited integrated reconsideration under § 422.633.


(e) *Resolution and notice.* (1) The applicable integrated plan must resolve standard integrated grievances as expeditiously as the case requires, based on the enrollee's health status, but no later than 30 calendar days from the date it receives the integrated grievance.


(i) All integrated grievances submitted in writing must be responded to in writing.


(ii) Integrated grievances submitted orally may be responded to either orally or in writing, unless the enrollee requests a written response.


(iii) All integrated grievances related to quality of care, regardless of how the integrated grievance is filed, must be responded to in writing. The response must include a description of the enrollee's right to file a written complaint with the QIO with regard to Medicare covered services. For any complaint submitted to a QIO, the applicable integrated plan must cooperate with the QIO in resolving the complaint.


(2) The timeframe for resolving the integrated grievance may be extended by 14 calendar days if the enrollee requests an extension or if the applicable integrated plan justifies the need for additional information and documents how the delay is in the interest of the enrollee. When the applicable integrated plan extends the timeframe, it must—


(i) Make reasonable efforts to promptly notify the enrollee orally of the reasons for the delay; and


(ii) Send written notice to the enrollee of the reasons for the delay immediately, but no later than within 2 calendar days of making the decision to extend the timeframe to resolve the integrated grievance. This notice must explain the right to file an integrated grievance if the enrollee disagrees with the decision to delay.
