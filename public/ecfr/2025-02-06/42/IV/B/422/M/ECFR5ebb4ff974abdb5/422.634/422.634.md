# § 422.634   Effect.

(a) *Failure of the applicable integrated plan to send timely notice of a determination.* If the applicable integrated plan fails to adhere to the notice and timing for an integrated organization determination or integrated reconsideration, this failure constitutes an adverse determination for the enrollee.


(1) For an integrated organization determination, this means that the enrollee may request an integrated reconsideration.


(2) For integrated reconsiderations of Medicare benefits, this means the applicable integrated plan must forward the case to the independent review entity, in accordance with the timeframes under paragraph (b) of this section and § 422.592. For integrated reconsiderations of Medicaid benefits, this means that an enrollee or other party may file for a State fair hearing in accordance with § 438.408(f) of this chapter, or if applicable, a State external medical review in accordance with § 438.402(c) of this chapter.


(b) *Adverse integrated reconsiderations.* (1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when the applicable integrated plan affirms, in whole or in part, its adverse integrated organization determination involving a Medicare benefit—


(i) The issues that remain in dispute must be reviewed and resolved by an independent, outside entity that contracts with CMS, in accordance with §§ 422.592 and 422.594 through 422.619;


(ii) For standard integrated reconsiderations, the applicable integrated plan must prepare a written explanation and send the case file to the independent review entity contracted by CMS, as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 30 calendar days from the date it receives the request (or no later than the expiration of an extension described in § 422.633(f)(3)). The applicable integrated plan must make reasonable and diligent efforts to assist in gathering and forwarding information to the independent entity; and


(iii) For expedited integrated reconsiderations, the applicable integrated plan must prepare a written explanation and send the case file to the independent review entity contracted by CMS as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than within 24 hours of its affirmation (or no later than the expiration of an extension described in § 422.633(f)(3)). The applicable integrated plan must make reasonable and diligent efforts to assist in gathering and forwarding information to the independent entity.


(2) When the applicable integrated plan affirms, in whole or in part, its adverse integrated organization determination involving a Medicaid benefit, the enrollee or other party (that is not the applicable integrated plan) may initiate a State fair hearing in the timeframe specified in § 438.408(f)(2) following the integrated plan's notice of resolution. If a provider is filing for a State fair hearing on behalf of the enrollee as permitted by State law, the provider needs the written consent of the enrollee, if he or she has not already obtained such consent.


(c) *Final determination.* The reconsidered determination of the applicable integrated plan is binding on all parties unless it is appealed to the next applicable level. In the event that the enrollee pursues the appeal in multiple forums and receives conflicting decisions, the applicable integrated plan is bound by, and must act in accordance with, decisions favorable to the enrollee.


(d) *Services not furnished while the appeal is pending.* (1) If an applicable integrated plan reverses its decision to deny, limit, or delay services that were not furnished while the appeal was pending, the applicable integrated plan must authorize or provide the disputed services promptly and as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires but no later than the earlier of—


(i) 72 hours from the date it reverses its decision; or


(ii)(A) With the exception of a Part B drug, 30 calendar days after the date the applicable integrated plan receives the request for the integrated reconsideration (or no later than upon expiration of an extension described in § 422.633(f)); or


(B) For a Part B drug, 7 calendar days after the date the applicable integrated plan receives the request for the integrated reconsideration.


(2) For a Medicaid benefit, if a State fair hearing officer reverses an applicable integrated plan's integrated reconsideration decision to deny, limit, or delay services that were not furnished while the appeal was pending, the applicable integrated plan must authorize or provide the disputed services promptly and as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires but no later than 72 hours from the date it receives notice reversing the determination.


(3) Reversals by the Part C independent review entity, an administrative law judge or attorney adjudicator at the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, or the Medicare Appeals Council must be effectuated under same timelines applicable to other MA plans as specified in §§ 422.618 and 422.619.


(e) *Services furnished while the appeal is pending.* If the applicable integrated plan or the State fair hearing officer reverses a decision to deny, limit, or delay Medicaid-covered benefits, and the enrollee received the disputed services while the integrated reconsideration was pending, the applicable integrated plan or the State must pay for those services, in accordance with State policy and regulations. If the applicable integrated plan reverses a decision to deny, limit, or delay Medicare-covered benefits, and the enrollee received the disputed services while the integrated reconsideration was pending, the applicable integrated plan must pay for those services.
