# § 422.756   Procedures for imposing intermediate sanctions and civil money penalties.

(a) *Notice of intermediate sanction and opportunity to respond*—(1) *Notice of intent.* Before imposing the intermediate sanction, CMS—


(i) Sends a written notice to the MA organization stating the nature and basis of the proposed intermediate sanction and the MA organization's right to a hearing as specified in paragraph (b) of this section; and


(ii) Sends the OIG a copy of the notice.


(2) *Opportunity to respond.* CMS allows the MA organization 10 calendar days after receipt of the notice to provide a written rebuttal. CMS considers receipt of the notice as the day after notice is sent by fax, e-mail, or submitted for overnight mail.


(b) *Hearing.* (1) The MA organization may request a hearing before a CMS hearing officer.


(2) A written request must be received by the designated CMS office within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the notice.


(3) A request for a hearing under § 422.660 does not delay the date specified by CMS when the sanction becomes effective.


(4) The MA organization must follow the right to a hearing procedure as specified at subpart N of this part..


(c) *Effective date and duration of sanctions*—(1) *Effective date.* The effective date of the sanction is the date specified by CMS in the notice. 


(2) *Exception.* If CMS determines that the MA organization's conduct poses a serious threat to an enrollee's health and safety, CMS may make the sanction effective on an earlier date that CMS specifies. 


(3) *Duration of sanction.* The sanction remains in effect until CMS is satisfied that the deficiencies that are the basis for the sanction determination have been corrected and are not likely to recur.


(i) CMS may require that the MA organization hire an independent auditor to provide CMS with additional information to determine if the deficiencies that are the basis for the sanction determination have been corrected and are not likely to recur. The independent auditor must work in accordance with CMS specifications and must be willing to attest that a complete and full independent review has been performed.


(ii) In instances where intermediate sanctions have been imposed, CMS may require an MA organization to market or to accept enrollments or both for a limited period of time in order to assist CMS in making a determination as to whether the deficiencies that are the bases for the intermediate sanctions have been corrected and are not likely to recur.


(A) If, following this time period, CMS determines the deficiencies have not been corrected or are likely to recur, the intermediate sanctions will remain in effect until such time that CMS is assured the deficiencies have been corrected and are not likely to recur.


(B) The MA organization does not have a right to a hearing under § 422.660(a)(4) of this part to challenge CMS' determination to keep the intermediate sanctions in effect.


(C) During the limited time period, sanctioned sponsoring organizations offering Part D plans under the benchmark that would normally participate in the annual and monthly auto enrollment process for enrollees receiving the low income subsidy will not be allowed to receive or process these types of enrollments.


(d) *Non-renewal or termination by CMS.* In addition to or as an alternative to the sanctions described in § 422.750, CMS may—


(1) Decline to authorize the renewal of an organization's contract in accordance with § 422.506(b); or


(2) Terminate the contract in accordance with § 422.510.

(e) Notice to impose *civil money penalties*—(1) *CMS notice to OIG.* If CMS determines that an MA organization has failed to comply with a requirement as described in 422.752, CMS notifies the OIG of this determination. OIG may impose a civil money penalty upon an MA organization as specified at 422.752(c)(2).
