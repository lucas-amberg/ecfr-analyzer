# § 423.521   Final settlement process and payment.

(a) *Notice of final settlement.* After the calculation of the final settlement amount, CMS sends the Part D sponsor a notice of final settlement. The notice of final settlement contains at least the following information:


(1) A final settlement amount for the contract that has been consolidated, nonrenewed, or terminated, which may be one of the following:

(3) Relevant CMS contact information.


(4) A description of the steps for requesting an appeal of the final settlement amount calculation, in accordance with the requirements specified in § 423.522.


(b) *Request for an appeal.* A Part D sponsor that disagrees with the final settlement amount has 15 calendar days from issuance of the notice of final settlement, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, to request an appeal of the final settlement amount under the process described in § 423.522.


(1) If a Part D sponsor agrees with the final settlement amount, no response is required.


(2) If a Part D sponsor disagrees with the final settlement amount but does not request an appeal within 15 calendar days from the date of the issuance of the notice of final settlement, CMS does not consider subsequent requests for appeal.
