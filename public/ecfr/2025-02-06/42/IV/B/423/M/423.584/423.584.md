# § 423.584   Expediting certain redeterminations.

(a) *Who may request an expedited redetermination.* An enrollee or an enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber may request that a Part D plan sponsor expedite a redetermination that involves the issues specified in § 423.566(b) or an at-risk determination made under a drug management program in accordance with § 423.153(f). (This does not include requests for payment of drugs already furnished.)


(b) *Procedure and timeframe for filing a request.* A request for a redetermination must be filed within 60 calendar days after receipt of the written coverage determination notice or at-risk determination notice. (1) To ask for an expedited redetermination, an enrollee or a prescribing physician or other prescriber acting on behalf of an enrollee must submit an oral or written request directly to the Part D plan sponsor or, if applicable, to the entity responsible for making the redetermination, as directed by the Part D plan sponsor.


(2) A prescribing physician or other prescriber may provide oral or written support for an enrollee's request for an expedited redetermination.


(3) The date of receipt of the coverage determination or at-risk determination is presumed to be 5 calendar days after the date of the written coverage determination or at-risk determination, unless there is evidence to the contrary.


(4) For purposes of meeting the 60-calendar day filing deadline, the request is considered as filed on the date it is received by the Part D plan sponsor or delegated entity specified in the Part D plan sponsor's written coverage determination or at-risk determination.


(c) *How the Part D plan sponsor must process requests.* The Part D plan sponsor must establish and maintain the following procedures for processing requests for expedited redetermination:


(1) *Handling of requests.* The Part D plan sponsor must establish an efficient and convenient means for individuals to submit oral or written requests, document all oral requests in writing, and maintain the documentation in the case file.


(2) *Prompt decision making.* The Part D plan sponsor must promptly decide whether to expedite the redetermination or follow the timeframe for standard redetermination based on the following requirements:


(i) For a request made by an enrollee, the Part D plan sponsor must provide an expedited redetermination if it determines that applying the standard timeframe for making a redetermination may seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function.


(ii) For a request made or supported by a prescribing physician or other prescriber, the Part D plan sponsor must provide an expedited redetermination if the physician or other prescriber indicates that applying the standard timeframe for conducting a redetermination may seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function.


(d) *Actions following denial of a request.* If a Part D plan sponsor denies a request for expedited redetermination, it must take the following actions:


(1) Make the determination within the 7 calendar day timeframe established in § 423.590(a). The 7 calendar day period begins the day the Part D plan sponsor receives the request for expedited redetermination.


(2) Give the enrollee prompt oral notice of the denial that—


(i) Explains that the Part D plan sponsor processes the enrollee's request using the 7 calendar day timeframe for standard redetermination;


(ii) Informs the enrollee of the right to file an expedited grievance if he or she disagrees with the decision by the Part D plan sponsor not to expedite;


(iii) Informs the enrollee of the right to resubmit a request for an expedited redetermination with the prescribing physician's or other prescriber's support; and 


(iv) Provides instructions about the expedited grievance process and its timeframes.


(3) Subsequently deliver, within three calendar days, equivalent written notice.


(e) *Action following acceptance of a request.* If a Part D plan sponsor grants a request for expedited redetermination, it must conduct the redetermination and give notice in accordance with § 423.590(d).


(f) *Dismissing a request.* The Part D plan sponsor dismisses an expedited redetermination in accordance with § 423.582.
