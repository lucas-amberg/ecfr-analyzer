# ยง 423.2062   Applicability of policies not binding on the ALJ and Council.

(a) ALJs or attorney adjudicators and the Council are not bound by CMS program guidance, such as program memoranda and manual instructions, but will give substantial deference to these policies if they are applicable to a particular case.


(b) If an ALJ or attorney adjudicator or Council declines to follow a policy in a particular case, the ALJ or attorney adjudicator or Council decision must explain the reasons why the policy was not followed. An ALJ or attorney adjudicator or Council decision to disregard a policy applies only to the specific coverage determination or at-risk determination being considered and does not have precedential effect.
