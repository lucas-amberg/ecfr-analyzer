# § 423.2325   Provision of applicable discounts.

(a) *General rule.* On behalf of the manufacturers, Part D sponsors must provide applicable beneficiaries with applicable discounts on applicable drugs at the point-of-sale.


(b) *Discount determination.* (1) Part D sponsors must determine the following:


(i) Whether an enrollee is an applicable beneficiary (as defined in § 423.100).


(ii) Whether a Part D drug is an applicable drug (as defined in § 423.100).


(iii) The amount of the applicable discount (as defined in § 423.2305) to be provided at the point-of-sale.


(2) Part D sponsors must make retroactive adjustments to the applicable discount as necessary to reflect changes to the claim or beneficiary eligibility determined after the date of dispensing.


(3) Part D sponsors must determine whether any affected beneficiaries need to be notified by the Part D sponsor that an applicable drug is eligible for Part D coverage whenever CMS specifies a retroactive effective date for a labeler code and notify such beneficiaries.


(c) *Exception to point-of-sale requirement.* Part D sponsors must provide an applicable discount for applicable drugs submitted by applicable beneficiaries via paper claims, including out-of-network and in-network paper claims, if such claims are payable under the Part D plan.


(d) *Collection of data.* Part D sponsors must provide CMS with appropriate data on the applicable discounts provided by the Part D sponsors in a manner specified by CMS.


(e) *Supplemental benefits.* (1) An applicable discount must be applied to beneficiary cost-sharing after supplemental benefits (as defined in § 423.100) have been applied to the claim for an applicable drug.


(2) No applicable discount is available if supplemental benefits (as defined in § 423.100) eliminate the coverage gap so that a beneficiary has zero cost-sharing.


(f) *Other health or prescription drug coverage.* An applicable discount must be applied to beneficiary cost-sharing when Part D is the primary payer before any other health or prescription drug coverage is applied.


(g) *Pharmacy prompt payment.* Part D sponsors must reimburse a network pharmacy (as defined in § 423.100) the amount of the applicable discount no later than the applicable number of calendar days after the date of dispensing of an applicable drug. For long-term care and home infusion pharmacies, the date of dispensing can be interpreted as the date the pharmacy submits the discounted claim for reimbursement.


(h) *Treatment of employer group waiver plans.* As of 2014, Part D sponsors offering employer group waiver plans must provide applicable discounts to applicable beneficiaries who are employer group waiver plan enrollees as determined consistent with the defined standard benefit.
