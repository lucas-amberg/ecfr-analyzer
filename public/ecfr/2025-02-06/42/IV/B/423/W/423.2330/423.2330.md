(3) The manufacturer must have the right to audit a statistically significant sample of data and information held by the TPA that were used to determine applicable discounts for applicable drugs having NDCs with the manufacturer's FDA-assigned labeler code(s). Such data and information will be made available on-site, and with the exception of work papers, such information cannot be removed from the audit site.
