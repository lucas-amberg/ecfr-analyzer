# § 424.11   General procedures.

(a) *Responsibility of the provider.* The provider must—


(1) Obtain the required certification and recertification statements; 


(2) Keep them on file for verification by the intermediary, if necessary; and 


(3) Certify, on the appropriate billing form, that the statements have been obtained and are on file. 


(b) *Obtaining the certification and recertification statements.* No specific procedures or forms are required for certification and recertification statements. The provider may adopt any method that permits verification. The certification and recertification statements may be entered on forms, notes, or records that the appropriate individual signs, or on a special separate form. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for delayed certifications, there must be a separate signed statement for each certification or recertification. If supporting information for the signed statement is contained in other provider records (such as physicians' progress notes), it need not be repeated in the statement itself.


(c) *Required information.* The succeeding sections of this subpart set forth specific information required for different types of services.


(d) *Timeliness.* (1) The succeeding sections of this subpart also specify the timeframes for certification and for initial and subsequent recertifications.


(2) A hospital or SNF may provide for obtaining a certification or recertification earlier than required by these regulations or vary the timeframe (within the prescribed outer limits) for different diagnostic or clinical categories.


(3) Delayed certification and recertification statements are acceptable when there is a legitimate reason for delay. (For instance, the patient was unaware of his or her entitlement when he or she was treated.) Delayed certification and recertification statements must include an explanation of the reasons for the delay.


(4) A delayed certification may be included with one or more recertifications on a single signed statement.


(5) For all inpatient hospital services, including inpatient psychiatric facility services, a delayed certification may not extend past discharge.


(e) *Limitation on authorization to sign statements.* A certification or recertification statement may be signed only by one of the following: 


(1) A physician who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy. 


(2) A dentist in the circumstances specified in § 424.13(d). 


(3) A doctor of podiatric medicine if his or her certification is consistent with the functions he or she is authorized to perform under State law.


(4) A nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist as defined in paragraph (e)(5) or (e)(6) of this section, or a physician assistant as defined in section 1861(aa)(5)(A) of the Act, in the circumstances specified in § 424.20(e).


(5) For purposes of this section, to qualify as a nurse practitioner, an individual must—
