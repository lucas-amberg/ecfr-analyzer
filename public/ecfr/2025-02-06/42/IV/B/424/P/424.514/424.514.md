# § 424.514   Application fee.

(a) *Application fee requirements for prospective institutional providers.* Beginning on or after March 25, 2011, prospective institutional providers that are submitting an initial application or currently enrolled institutional providers that are submitting an application to establish a new practice location must submit either or both of the following:


(1) The applicable application fee.


(2) A request for a hardship exception to the application fee at the time of filing a Medicare enrollment application.


(b) *Application fee requirements for revalidating institutional providers.* Beginning March 25, 2011, institutional providers that are subject to CMS revalidation efforts must submit either or both of the following:


(1) The applicable application fee.


(2) A request for a hardship exception to the application fee at the time of filing a Medicare enrollment application.


(c) *Hardship exception for disaster areas.* CMS will assess on a case-by-case basis whether institutional providers enrolling in a geographic area that is a Presidentially-declared disaster under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5206 (Stafford Act) should receive an exception to the application fee.


(d) *Application fee.* The application fee and associated requirements are as follows:


(1) For 2010, $500.00.


(2) For 2011 and subsequent years—


(i) Is adjusted by the percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average) for the 12-month period ending with June of the previous year;


(ii) Is effective from January 1 to December 31 of a calendar year;


(iii) Is based on the submission of an initial application, application to establish a new practice location or the submission of an application in response to a CMS revalidation request;


(iv) Must be in the amount calculated by CMS in effect for the year during which the application for enrollment is being submitted;


(v) Is nonrefundable, except if submitted with one of the following:


(A) A request for hardship exception that is subsequently approved;


(B) An application that is rejected prior to initiation of screening processes;


(C) An application that is subsequently denied as a result of the imposition of a temporary moratorium;


(e) *Denial or revocation based on application fee.* A Medicare contractor may deny or revoke Medicare billing privileges of a provider or supplier based on noncompliance if, in the absence of a written request for a hardship exception from the application fee that accompanies a Medicare enrollment application, the bank account on which the check that is submitted with the enrollment application is drawn does not contain sufficient funds to pay the application fee.


(f) *Information needed for submission of a hardship exception request.* A provider or supplier requesting an exception from the application fee must include with its enrollment application a letter that describes the hardship and why the hardship justifies an exception.


(g) *Failure to submit application fee or hardship exception request.* A Medicare contractor may—


(1) Reject an enrollment application from a newly-enrolling institutional provider that, with the exceptions described in § 424.514(b), is not accompanied by the application fee or by a letter requesting a hardship exception from the application fee.


(2) Revoke the billing privileges of a currently enrolled institutional provider that, with the exceptions described in § 424.514(b), is not accompanied by the application fee or by a letter requesting a hardship exception from the application fee.


(3)(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contractor must first inform the provider that the application fee was not submitted in accordance with this section.


(ii) Within 30 days after the date of the notification, the contractor may reject the application of the newly-enrolling institutional provider or revoke the billing privileges of the currently enrolled institutional provider that has not submitted the fee.


(h) *Consideration of hardship exception request.* CMS has 60 days in which to approve or disapprove a hardship exception request. If a provider submits a request for hardship exception to the fee and the provider or supplier has not already submitted the fee consistent with provisions in § 424.514(a) and (b), and the request for hardship exception is not approved, CMS notifies the provider or supplier that the hardship exception request was not approved and allows the provider or supplier 30 days from the date of notification to submit the application fee.


(1) A Medicare contractor does not—


(i) Begin processing an enrollment application that is accompanied by a hardship exception request until CMS has made a decision to approve or disapprove the hardship exception request; and


(ii) Deny an enrollment application that is accompanied by a hardship exception request unless the hardship exception request is denied by CMS and the provider or supplier fails to submit the required application fee within 30 days of being notified that the request for a hardship exception was denied.


(2) A hardship exception determination made by CMS is appealable using § 405.874 of this chapter.
