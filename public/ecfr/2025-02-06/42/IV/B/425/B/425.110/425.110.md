# § 425.110   Number of ACO professionals and beneficiaries.

(a)(1) The ACO must include primary care ACO professionals that are sufficient for the number of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries assigned to the ACO under subpart E of this part. The ACO must have at least 5,000 assigned beneficiaries.


(2) CMS deems an ACO to have initially satisfied the requirement to have at least 5,000 assigned beneficiaries as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if 5,000 or more beneficiaries are historically assigned to the ACO participants in each of the 3 benchmark years, as calculated using the assignment methodology set forth in subpart E of this part. In the case of the third benchmark year, CMS uses the most recent data available to estimate the number of assigned beneficiaries.


(b) If at any time during the performance year, an ACO's assigned population falls below 5,000, the ACO may be subject to the actions described in §§ 425.216 and 425.218.


(1) While under a CAP, the ACO remains eligible for shared savings and liable for shared losses.


(2) For performance years starting before January 1, 2025, if the ACO's assigned population is not at least 5,000 by the end of the performance year specified by CMS in its request for a corrective action plan (CAP), CMS terminates the participation agreement and the ACO is not eligible to share in savings for that performance year.


(3) In determining financial performance for an ACO with fewer than 5,000 assigned beneficiaries, the MSR/MLR is calculated as follows:


(i) For ACOs with a variable MSR and MLR (if applicable), the MSR and MLR (if applicable) are set at a level consistent with the number of assigned beneficiaries.


(ii) For performance years starting before July 1, 2019, for ACOs with a fixed MSR/MLR, the MSR/MLR remains fixed at the level consistent with the choice of MSR and MLR that the ACO made at the start of the agreement period.


(iii) For performance years starting on July 1, 2019 and in subsequent years, for ACOs that selected a fixed MSR/MLR at the start of the agreement period or prior to entering a two-sided model during their agreement period, the MSR/MLR is calculated as follows:


(A) The MSR/MLR is set at a level based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the ACO.


(*1*) The MSR is the same as the MSR that would apply in a one-sided model under § 425.604(b) (for Track 2 ACOs) or § 425.605(b)(1) (for BASIC track and ENHANCED track ACOs) and is based on the number of assigned beneficiaries.


(*2*) The MLR is equal to the negative MSR.


(B) The MSR and MLR revert to the fixed level previously selected by the ACO for any subsequent performance year in the agreement period in which the ACO's assigned beneficiary population is 5,000 or more.
