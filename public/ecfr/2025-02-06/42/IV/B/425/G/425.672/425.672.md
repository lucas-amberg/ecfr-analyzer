(b) *Significant, anomalous, and highly suspect billing activity for a HCPCS or CPT code impacting Shared Savings Program calculations.* CMS, at its sole discretion, may determine that the billing of one or more specified HCPCS or CPT codes represents significant, anomalous, and highly suspect billing activity for a calendar year that warrants adjustment to calculations made under this part.
