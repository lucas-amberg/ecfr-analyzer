# § 426.340   Procedures for review of new evidence.

(a) The process for review of new evidence is initiated once the ALJ/Board completes the taking of evidence. 


(b) If an aggrieved party has submitted new evidence pertaining to the LCD/NCD provision(s) in question, and the ALJ or the Board finds that evidence admissible, the ALJ or the Board reviews the record as a whole and decide whether the new evidence has the potential to significantly affect the ALJ's or the Board's evaluation of the LCD/NCD provision(s) in question under the reasonableness standard. 


(c) If the ALJ or the Board determines that the new evidence does not have the potential to significantly affect the ALJ's or the Board's evaluation of the LCD/NCD provision(s) in question under the reasonableness standard, this evidence is included in the review record, and the review goes forward to a decision on the merits. 


(d) If the ALJ or the Board determines that the new evidence has the potential to significantly affect the ALJ's or the Board's evaluation of the LCD or NCD provision(s) in question under the reasonableness standard, then the ALJ or the Board— 


(1) Stays the proceedings and ensures that the contractor or CMS, whichever is appropriate, has a copy of the new evidence for its examination; and 


(2) Allows the contractor/CMS 10 days, generally, to examine the new evidence, and to decide whether the contractor or CMS initiates a reconsideration. 


(e) If the contractor or CMS informs the ALJ or the Board by the end of the 10 days that a reconsideration is initiated, and then the ALJ or the Board— 


(1) Continues the stay in proceedings; and 


(2) Sets a reasonable timeframe—


(i) For LCDs, of not more than 90 days, by which the contractor completes the reconsideration; or


(ii) For NCDs, in compliance with the timeframes specified in section 1862(1) of the Act, by which CMS completes the reconsideration.


(f) The ALJ or Board lifts the stay in proceedings and continues the review on the challenged provision(s) of the original LCD or NCD, including the new evidence in the review record, if the contractor or CMS— 


(1) Informs the ALJ or Board that a reconsideration is not initiated; or 


(2) Does not meet—


(i) For LCDs, the 90-day reconsideration timeframe; or


(ii) For NCDs, the reconsideration timeframe specified by the Board, in compliance with section 1862(l) of the Act.


(g) If an LCD or NCD is reconsidered and revised within the timeframe allotted by the ALJ or Board, then the revised LCD or NCD and any supplement to the LCD or NCD record is forwarded to the ALJ or the Board and all parties and the review proceeds on the LCD or NCD.
