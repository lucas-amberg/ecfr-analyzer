(b) *The Board's decision upholds an ALJ determination that the LCD is invalid.* If the Board's decision upholds an ALJ determination that the LCD is invalid, then the contractor, the M + C organization, or other Medicare managed care organization implements the decision as described in ยง 426.460(b).
