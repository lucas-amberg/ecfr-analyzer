# ยง 427.302   Calculation of the per unit Part B drug rebate amount.

(a) *Formula for calculating the per unit Part B rebate amount.* CMS will calculate the per unit Part B rebate amount for a Part B rebatable drug and applicable calendar quarter by determining the amount by which the specified amount, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section, exceeds the inflation-adjusted payment amount, as determined under paragraph (g) of this section.


(b) *Identification of the specified amount for the applicable calendar quarter.* For each applicable calendar quarter, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the specified amount is equal to the amount determined under section 1847A(i)(3)(A)(ii)(I)(aa) or (bb) of the Act, as applicable, for the calendar quarter.


(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the first applicable calendar quarter for a Part B rebatable drug shall be no earlier than the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 2023 and shall be the later of one of the following:


(i) The first full calendar quarter that is at least the third calendar quarter after the payment amount benchmark quarter identified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.


(ii) The calendar quarter beginning January 1, 2023.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for a Part B rebatable drug that was billed under a NOC code during the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2021, or the third full calendar quarter after the effective date of the drug's assigned billing and payment code other than a NOC code, whichever is later, the first applicable calendar quarter is the first full calendar quarter that follows the payment amount benchmark quarter identified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.


(3) If all NDCs in the billing and payment code have neither manufacturer-reported ASP nor Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) price data available for the applicable calendar quarter, CMS will use WAC price data from other public sources, if available, to calculate 106 percent of WAC, which will serve as the specified amount.


(c) *Identification of the payment amount benchmark quarter.* For each Part B rebatable drug, CMS will identify the applicable payment amount benchmark quarter as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable, subject to paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this section, using the earliest first marketed date of any NDC ever marketed under any FDA application under which any NDCs that have ever been assigned to the billing and payment code as of the applicable calendar quarter have been marketed, and using the earliest approval or licensure date of any FDA application under which any NDCs that have ever been assigned to the billing and payment as of the applicable calendar quarter have been marketed:


(1) For a Part B rebatable drug first approved or licensed by the FDA on or before December 1, 2020, and with a first marketed date on or before December 1, 2020, the payment amount benchmark quarter is the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2021.


(2) For a Part B rebatable drug first approved or licensed by the FDA after December 1, 2020, the payment amount benchmark quarter is the third full calendar quarter after a drug's first marketed date.


(3) For a Part B rebatable drug first approved or licensed by the FDA on or before December 1, 2020, but with a first marketed date after December 1, 2020, the payment amount benchmark quarter is the third full calendar quarter after a drug's first marketed date.


(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for a Part B rebatable drug that was billed under a NOC code during the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2021, or the third full calendar quarter after such drug's first marketed date, whichever is later, the payment amount benchmark quarter is the third full calendar quarter after the Part B rebatable drug is assigned a billing and payment code other than a NOC code.


(5) For a Part B rebatable drug that is a selected drug (as defined in section 1192(c) of the Act) with respect to a price applicability period (as defined in section 1191(b)(2) of the Act), in the case such Part B rebatable drug is no longer considered to be a selected drug, for each applicable quarter beginning after the price applicability period with respect to such drug, the payment amount benchmark quarter is the calendar quarter beginning January 1 of the last year during such price applicability period with respect to such selected drug.


(d) *Identification of the payment amount in the payment amount benchmark quarter.* CMS will identify the payment amount in the payment amount benchmark quarter using the published payment limit for the billing and payment code for the applicable payment amount benchmark quarter identified as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.


(1) For a Part B rebatable drug, subject to paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CMS will identify the payment amount in the payment amount benchmark quarter using the published payment limit for the billing and payment code for the applicable payment amount benchmark quarter determined under section 1847A of the Act.


(i) If a published payment limit is not available for the applicable payment amount benchmark quarter, CMS will use the lower of 106 percent of manufacturer-reported ASP or 106 percent of manufacturer-reported WAC.


(ii) If neither a published payment limit nor manufacturer-reported ASP or WAC data are available, CMS will use WAC data from other public sources to calculate 106 percent of WAC, which, solely for the purposes of this section, CMS will consider to be the payment amount for the payment amount benchmark quarter.


(2) For a Part B rebatable drug previously billed under a grouped billing and payment code during the payment amount benchmark quarter and later billed under a unique billing and payment code, CMS will use the grouped billing and payment code payment limit as the payment amount in the payment amount benchmark quarter.


(e) *Identification of the benchmark period CPI-U.* For each Part B rebatable drug, CMS will identify the applicable benchmark period CPI-U at the billing and payment code level as set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, subject to paragraphs (e)(3) through (5) of this section:


(1) For a Part B rebatable drug first approved or licensed by the FDA on or before December 1, 2020, and with a first marketed date on or before December 1, 2020, the benchmark period CPI-U is the CPI-U for January 2021.


(2) For a Part B rebatable drug first approved or licensed by the FDA after December 1, 2020, the benchmark period CPI-U is the CPI-U for the first month of the first full calendar quarter after a drug's first marketed date.


(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for a Part B rebatable drug first approved or licensed by FDA on or before December 1, 2020, and with a first marketed date after December 1, 2020, the benchmark period CPI-U is the CPI-U for the first month of the first full calendar quarter after a drug's first marketed date.


(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(3) of this section, for a Part B rebatable drug that was billed under a NOC code during the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2021, or the third full calendar quarter after such drug's first marketed date, whichever is later, the benchmark period CPI-U is the CPI-U for the first month of the first full calendar quarter after the Part B rebatable drug is assigned a billing and payment code other than a NOC code.


(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(4) of this section, for a Part B rebatable drug that is a selected drug (as defined in section 1192(c) of the Act) with respect to a price applicability period (as defined in section 1191(b)(2) of the Act), in the case such Part B rebatable drug is no longer considered to be a selected drug, the benchmark period CPI-U is the CPI-U for the July of the year preceding the last year during such price applicability period.


(f) *Identification of the rebate period CPI-U.* For each Part B rebatable drug by billing and payment code, CMS will identify and use the greater of the benchmark period CPI-U index level or the CPI-U index level for the first month of the calendar quarter that is two calendar quarters before the applicable calendar quarter in which the Part B rebatable drug is furnished.


(g) *Determination of inflation-adjusted payment amount.* For each applicable calendar quarter and for each Part B rebatable drug by billing and payment code, CMS will calculate the inflation-adjusted payment amount by dividing the rebate period CPI-U by the benchmark period CPI-U and then multiplying the quotient by the payment amount in the payment amount benchmark quarter, determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
