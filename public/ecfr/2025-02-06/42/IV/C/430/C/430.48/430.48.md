# § 430.48   Repayment of Federal funds by installments.

(a) *Basic conditions.* When Federal payments have been made for claims that are later found to be unallowable, the State may repay the Federal funds by installments if all of the following conditions are met:

(2) The State has given the Regional Office written notice, before total repayment was due, of its intent to repay by installments.


(b) *Annual State share determination.* CMS determines whether the amount to be repaid exceeds 0.25 percent of the annual State share as follows:


(1) If the Medicaid program is ongoing, CMS uses the annual estimated State share of Medicaid expenditures for the current year, as shown on the State's latest Medicaid Program Budget Report (CMS-37). The current year is the year in which the State requests the repayment by installments.


(2) If the Medicaid program has been terminated by Federal law or by the State, CMS uses the actual State share that is shown on the State's CMS-64 Quarterly Expense Report for the last four quarters filed.


(c) *Standard Repayment amounts, schedules, and procedures*—(1) *Repayment amount.* The repayment amount may not include any amount previously approved for installment repayment.

(ii) A State may choose to make payment by Automated Clearing House (ACH) direct deposit, by check, or by Fedwire transfer.


(6) *Reductions.* If the State chooses to repay amounts representing higher percentages during the early quarters, any corresponding reduction in required minimum percentages is applied first to the last scheduled payment, then to the next to the last payment, and so forth as necessary.

(B) The remaining amount of the repayment is in quarterly amounts equal to 8
1/3 percent of the estimated State share of current annual expenditures until fully repaid.
