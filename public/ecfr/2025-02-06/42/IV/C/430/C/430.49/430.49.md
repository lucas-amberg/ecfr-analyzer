# § 430.49   Corrective action plans, suspensions of procedural disenrollments, and civil money penalties.

(a) *Statutory basis.* This section interprets and implements section 1902(tt)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act.


(b) *Corrective action plans*—(1) *Basis for corrective action.* After consideration of any mitigating circumstances in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and notwithstanding whether an FMAP reduction has been imposed under § 435.928 of this subchapter, CMS will determine whether to require the State to submit a corrective action plan if CMS finds that the State is not in compliance during the period beginning on April 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024, with either of the following requirements:


(i) The requirement to submit data required under section 1902(tt)(1) of the Act in accordance with § 435.927 of this subchapter; or


(ii) Federal redetermination requirements described at § 430.5.


(2) *Notice of need for corrective action plan.* If, after considering mitigating circumstances as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator decides to require the State to submit and implement a corrective action plan for noncompliance described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or to revise or resubmit such a plan, the Administrator will provide the State with a written notice directing the State to submit a corrective action plan to correct the identified areas of noncompliance. Such notice will—


(i) Explain the violation of Federal redetermination or reporting requirements that CMS has identified and the basis for CMS' finding;


(ii) Inform the State of the requirement to submit and implement a corrective action plan:


(iii) Include instructions on the method and deadline by which the State must submit a corrective action plan to CMS; and


(iv) Explain the enforcement actions that CMS may pursue if the State fails to submit or implement an approved corrective action plan, including if CMS disapproves the State's submitted CAP or if the State fails to meet the requirements set forth in the approved CAP, in accordance with this section.


(3) *Content of corrective action plan.* A corrective action plan must describe in detail—


(i) The actions the State will take immediately, if needed to prevent further harm or risk of harm to beneficiaries while it implements the corrective action plan, including to prevent increased burden for beneficiaries in completing the renewal process, loss of coverage at renewal for individuals who continue to meet the substantive eligibility criteria and whose eligibility should otherwise be retained but for failure to meet a procedural requirement, and delays in access to coverage or care;


(ii) The steps the State will take to ensure compliance with Federal requirements, including but not limited to new policies, procedures, operational processes or systems changes it will implement;


(iii) Key milestones and a detailed timeline for achieving compliance; and


(iv) A plan for communicating the steps the State will take to prevent actual harm or risk of harm to beneficiaries and to ensure compliance with Federal requirements per paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section to State staff, including staff of non-Medicaid agencies or entities to which the agency has delegated authority to conduct redeterminations of eligibility in accordance with § 431.10(c)(1)(i) of this subchapter; CMS; and beneficiaries, as applicable.


(4) *Timeframes for submission, approval, and implementation of corrective action plan*—(i) *Submission.* A State that receives a notice described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must submit a corrective action plan, including the elements in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, not later than 14 calendar days from the date of the notice of noncompliance.


(ii) *Approval.* CMS must approve or disapprove a corrective action plan submitted by the State within 21 calendar days of the date it is submitted. If CMS does not approve or disapprove the corrective action plan within 21 calendar days of submission, the corrective action plan will be deemed approved.


(iii) *Implementation.* A State must begin implementation of the corrective action plan not later than 14 calendar days after the date that either the State receives CMS approval, or the corrective action plan is deemed approved.


(5) *Approval or disapproval of corrective action plan.* A corrective action plan will be approved if CMS determines that the plan-


(i) Meets the requirements at paragraph (b)(3) of this section;


(ii) Promptly eliminates or minimizes any harm or risk of harm to beneficiaries, including increased burden for beneficiaries in completing the renewal process, loss of coverage at renewal for individuals who continue to meet the substantive eligibility criteria and whose eligibility should otherwise be retained but for failure to meet a procedural requirement, and delays in access to coverage or care due to the noncompliance to be addressed by the plan; and


(iii) Results in the State achieving compliance in a reasonable time, taking into account systems challenges and circumstances faced by the agencies involved.


(c) *Suspensions of procedural disenrollments and civil money penalties.* (1) After considering any applicable mitigating circumstances in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and notwithstanding whether the State is subject to an FMAP reduction under § 435.928 of this subchapter, CMS may take one or both of the following actions if the State fails to submit or implement an approved corrective action plan, including if CMS disapproves the State's submitted corrective action plan due to the State's failure to include required elements in accordance with the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section, or if the State fails to meet the requirements set forth in the approved corrective action plan:


(i) Require the State to suspend some or all procedural disenrollments, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; and


(ii) Impose civil money penalties in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.


(2) *Notice.* (i) Prior to requiring the State to suspend procedural disenrollments of Medicaid eligibility or imposing civil money penalties, CMS will issue a notice to the State. Such notice will include—


(A) A description of the enforcement action(s) CMS is taking and the basis for such action(s);


(B) Whether CMS is requiring the State to suspend some or all procedural disenrollments and, in the case of a partial suspension, the affected populations;


(C) The date on which the State must begin suspending procedural disenrollments, if applicable;


(D) The daily amount owed for any civil money penalties imposed, the date the penalties will begin to be charged, the timeline for payment (including information on how the timeline for payment would be affected by an appeal), and instructions on how to submit payment;


(E) The steps the State must take to cure its noncompliance and for CMS to lift the enforcement action(s); and


(F) Information on the State's appeal rights as described in paragraph (f) of this section, including the deadline to submit an appeal request, and the effect of requesting an appeal on the applicability of any enforcement actions pending the decision in such appeal. The notice must also provide that the decision outlined in the notice is final unless it is timely appealed as described in paragraph (f) of this section.


(ii) CMS may issue additional notices requiring a State to take additional actions (including paying increased civil money penalties or implementing or broadening the scope of a required suspension of procedural disenrollments) if CMS identifies additional violations of corrective action plan provisions. Such notices will meet the requirements outlined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(3) *Scope of actions*—(i) *Suspensions of procedural disenrollments.* (A) If the noncompliance determined by CMS under paragraph (b)(1) of this section impacts a substantial number of (meaning all or nearly all) individuals who are or should have been found eligible for Medicaid, CMS will require the State to suspend all procedural disenrollments.


(B) If the impact of the noncompliance is limited (for example, to a specific population or geographic area), CMS may limit the suspension of procedural disenrollments to the impacted population(s). After requiring a limited suspension of procedural disenrollments, CMS may later opt to require the State to suspend all procedural disenrollments if CMS subsequently determines that the impact of the noncompliance is greater than was initially determined, or if the State fails to comply with the initial requirement to suspend some procedural disenrollments in accordance with the notice issued under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In these circumstances, CMS will issue a subsequent notice under paragraph (c)(2).


(ii) *Civil money penalties.* CMS may require the State to pay a civil money penalty of not more than $100,000, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, for each day that the State has not submitted or implemented an approved corrective action plan in accordance with the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section or has failed to meet the requirements of the approved plan, until the penalty is lifted due to the State meeting the conditions described in paragraph (e) of this section.


(A) Civil money penalties will start accruing five (5) calendar days after the date of the initial notice described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and become payable 60 calendar days after the date of the notice, if not timely appealed, or 60 calendar days after issuance of a final determination at the conclusion of any appeal pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.


(B) The amount of any applicable civil money penalties for failure to submit or implement a corrective action plan, including if CMS disapproves the State's submitted corrective action plan or if the State fails to meet the requirements set forth in the approved corrective action plan, will be determined according to the following formula, after the date specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section: Days 1-30 of noncompliance: $25,000/day; Days 31-60 of noncompliance: $50,000/day; and Days 61 or more of noncompliance until lifted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section: $100,000/day. Each of these amounts is adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102.


(C) Consistent with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if CMS identifies additional violations of corrective action plan provisions, CMS may issue additional notices to increase civil money penalties more quickly than provided for by the formula in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(4) *Noncompliance with requirements to suspend procedural disenrollments or pay civil money penalties.* If the State fails to suspend procedural disenrollments as required pursuant to a notice described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or to pay civil money penalties as specified in that notice, or both, CMS may issue an additional notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section to increase the civil money penalties to the maximum allowable daily amount, if not already reached, or may pursue additional enforcement action under section 1904 of the Act and § 430.35 of this subpart, including withholding some or all Federal financial participation.


(d) *Mitigating circumstances.* CMS will consider the following mitigating circumstances when deciding whether to take the following enforcement actions:


(1) *Requirement to submit corrective action plan for violation of redetermination requirements.* In the case of noncompliance relating to a violation of Federal redetermination requirements, CMS may delay requiring, or determine not to require, a State to submit a corrective action plan under paragraph (b) of this section if—


(i) The noncompliance caused neither actual harm nor a substantial risk of harm to beneficiaries, including increased burden for beneficiaries in completing the renewal process, loss of coverage at renewal for individuals who continue to meet the substantive eligibility criteria and whose eligibility should otherwise be retained but for failure to meet a procedural requirement, and delays in access to coverage or care to beneficiaries; or


(ii) CMS determines that there is an emergency or other extraordinary circumstances preventing the State's compliance.


(2) *Requirement to submit corrective action plan for violation of reporting requirements.* In the case of noncompliance relating to a violation of the reporting requirements under § 435.927 of this subchapter, CMS may delay requiring, or determine not to require, a State to submit a corrective action plan under paragraph (b) of this section if—


(i) CMS has determined that the State implementing a corrective action plan is not necessary to ensure that the noncompliance is remedied; or


(ii) CMS determines that there is an emergency or other extraordinary circumstances preventing the State's compliance.


(3) *Suspensions of procedural disenrollments and imposition of civil money penalties.* (i) In the case of a State that has failed to submit or implement an approved corrective action plan relating to a violation of either the reporting requirements under § 435.927 of this subchapter or Federal redetermination requirements, CMS may delay or forgo imposing civil money penalties if CMS determines that the State faces an emergency or other extraordinary circumstances that—


(A) Occurred after the violation resulting in CMS' requirement of a CAP for noncompliance with Federal redetermination requirements or reporting requirements under § 435.927; and


(B) Has significantly impeded the State's ability to submit or implement a corrective action plan.


(ii) In the case of a State's failure to submit or implement a corrective action plan relating to a violation of the reporting requirements under § 435.927 of this subchapter in which the underlying reporting violation does not impede CMS' oversight of the State's procedural disenrollments, CMS will:


(A) Delay suspension of procedural disenrollments for 1 month; and


(B) Impose civil money penalties, except in cases where there are also extraordinary circumstances as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.


(e) *Lifting of enforcement actions.* (1) In cases where CMS had sent a State a notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for failure to submit or implement an approved corrective action plan—


(i) The State will be required to continue any suspension of procedural disenrollments required pursuant to such notice, and any civil money penalties imposed in accordance with the terms of such notice will continue to be charged, until—


(A) For a State that failed to submit a corrective action plan, the State submits a corrective action plan that CMS determines is approvable consistent with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.


(B) For a State that failed to implement an approved corrective action plan, the State has implemented or resumed implementation of such plan.


(ii) CMS will continue the accrual of civil money penalties from the date specified in the original notice provided to the State under paragraph (c)(2) of this section until CMS determines whether the plan is approvable. If CMS determines that the plan is approvable, CMS will retroactively end the accrual of the civil money penalties on the day the CAP was submitted and cease charging civil money penalties prospectively. If CMS determines that the plan is not approvable, CMS will continue charging civil money penalties imposed under the terms of the enforcement notice without interruption until the State submits an approvable plan.


(2) Where a State has met the conditions under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, CMS will notify the State that the enforcement actions are being lifted. For States that were required to suspend procedural disenrollments, such notice will include the date on which the State may resume such disenrollments. For States that were subject to civil money penalties, such notice will include the date on which such civil money penalties stopped accruing, the total number of days for which civil money penalties accrued and the amount(s) of such civil money penalties, and the total amount of civil money penalties owed.


(f) *Administrative review*—(1) *Appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board.* A State that is dissatisfied with CMS's determination under paragraph (c) of this section that the State must suspend procedural disenrollments or pay civil money penalties because the State has failed to submit or implement an approvable corrective action plan may appeal, pursuant to 45 CFR part 16, the imposition of such suspensions of procedural disenrollments or civil money penalties to the Departmental Appeals Board (the Board) within 30 days after receipt of a notice described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The appeal request must comply with 45 CFR 16.7, and the process for counting days to submit an appeal will follow the provisions under 45 CFR 16.19. The appeals process is governed by 45 CFR part 16. If the State does not submit an appeal request within the 30-day timeframe provided for an appeal to the Board, then the decision described in the notice received by the State under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is the final decision of the Secretary and is final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704.


(2) *Reconsiderations by* the *Administrator.* (i) If any party to the appeal is dissatisfied with the Board's decision under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, it may seek the Administrator's reconsideration of that decision within 15 calendar days of receiving notice of the decision pursuant to 45 CFR 16.21.


(A) The request for reconsideration must be filed with the Administrator and must include a copy of the Board's decision, a brief statement of why the party believes the decision was wrong, and a statement of the amount of any civil money penalties in dispute.


(B) The party requesting reconsideration must send a copy of the request described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section to all other parties to the appeal and other participants in the appeal (as described in 45 CFR 16.16) at the same time that the request is filed with the Administrator.


(C) Any other party to the appeal, or other participant in the appeal, may respond to the request for reconsideration in writing and file their response with the Administrator within 15 calendar days of the date the request for reconsideration is filed with the Administrator.


(D) The Administrator will review the Board's decision and any additional information submitted by the parties and other participants under paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) or (C) of this section and, within 60 calendar days after the Board issues notice of its decision under 45 CFR 16.21, will either affirm the Board's decision or issue a new decision.


(ii) Within the 60-day period that is described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(D) of this section, the Administrator may also modify or reverse the Board's decision even if no party to the appeal has requested reconsideration of that decision.


(iii) If no request for reconsideration is filed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section and the Administrator does not modify or reverse the Board's decision within the 60-day period described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, then the decision of the Board is the final determination of the Secretary and is final agency action, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, and the Administrator will provide notice to all parties and other participants of such decision as described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section.


(iv) The Administrator will provide a notice to all parties and other participants of the final decision together with a notice indicating that this is the final determination of the *Secretary* and is final agency action, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section.


(v) The determination of the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(D) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section is the final determination of the *Secretary* and is final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704.


(g) *Severability.* Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, or stayed pending further State action, shall be severable from this section and shall not affect the remainder thereof or the application of the provision to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances.
