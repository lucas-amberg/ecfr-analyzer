# § 431.1010   Disallowance of Federal financial participation for erroneous State payments (for PERM review years ending after July 1, 2020).

(a) *Purpose.* (1) This section establishes rules and procedures for disallowing Federal financial participation (FFP) in erroneous medical assistance payments due to eligibility improper payment errors, as detected through the PERM program required under this subpart, in effect on and after July 1, 2020.


(2) After the State's eligibility improper rate has been established for each PERM review period, CMS will compute the amount of the disallowance, removing any underpayments due to eligibility errors, and adjust the FFP payable to each State. The disallowance or withholding is only applicable to the State's PERM year.


(3) CMS will compute the amount to be withheld or disallowed as follows:


(i) Subtract the 3 percent allowable threshold from the lower limit of the State's eligibility improper payment rate percentage excluding underpayments.


(ii) If the difference is greater than zero, the Federal medical assistance funds for the period, are multiplied by that percentage. This product is the amount of the disallowance or withholding.


(b) *Notice to States and showing of good faith.* (1) If CMS is satisfied that the State did not meet the 3 percent allowable threshold despite a good faith effort, CMS will reduce the funds being disallowed in whole.


(2) CMS may find that a State did not meet the 3 percent allowable threshold despite a good faith effort if the State has taken the action it believed was needed to meet the threshold, but the threshold was not met. CMS will grant a good faith waiver only if the State both:


(i) Participates in the MEQC pilot program in accordance with §§ 431.800 through 431.820, and


(ii) Implements PERM CAPs in accordance with § 431.992.


(3) Each State that has an eligibility improper payment rate above the allowable threshold will be notified by CMS of the amount of the disallowance.


(c) *Disallowance subject to appeal.* If the State does not agree with a disallowance imposed under paragraph (e) of this section, it may appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board within 30 days from the date of the final disallowance notice from CMS. The regular procedures for an appeal of a disallowance will apply, including review by the Appeals Board under 45 CFR part 16.
