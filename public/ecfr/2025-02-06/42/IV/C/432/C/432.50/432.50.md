(2) Rates of FFP in excess of 50 percent apply only to those portions of the individual's working time that are spent carrying out duties in the specified areas for which the higher rate is authorized. 


(3) The allocation of personnel and staff costs must be based on either the actual percentages of time spent carrying out duties in the specified areas, or another methodology approved by CMS. 


(d) *Other limitations for FFP rate for skilled professional medical personnel and directly supporting staff*—(1) *Medicaid agency personnel and staff.* The rate of 75 percent FFP is available for skilled professional medical personnel and directly supporting staff of the Medicaid agency if the following criteria, as applicable, are met: 


(i) The expenditures are for activities that are directly related to the administration of the Medicaid program, and as such do not include expenditures for medical assistance; 


(ii) The skilled professional medical personnel have professional education and training in the field of medical care or appropriate medical practice. “Professional education and training” means the completion of a 2-year or longer program leading to an academic degree or certificate in a medically related profession. This is demonstrated by possession of a medical license, certificate, or other document issued by a recognized National or State medical licensure or certifying organization or a degree in a medical field issued by a college or university certified by a professional medical organization.

The skilled professional medical staff must directly supervise the supporting staff and the performance of the supporting staff's work. 


(2) *Staff of other public agencies.* The rate of 75 percent FFP is available for staff of other public agencies if the requirements specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met and the public agency has a written agreement with the Medicaid agency to verify that these requirements are met. 


(e) *Limitations on FFP rates for staff in mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems.* The special matching rates for persons working on mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems (paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section) are applicable only if the design, development and installation, or the operation, have been approved by the Administrator in accordance with part 433, subchapter C, of this chapter.
