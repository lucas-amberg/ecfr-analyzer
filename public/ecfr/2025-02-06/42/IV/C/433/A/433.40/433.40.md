# § 433.40   Treatment of uncashed or cancelled (voided) Medicaid checks.

(a) *Purpose.* This section provides the rules to ensure that States refund the Federal portion of uncashed or cancelled (voided) checks under title XIX.


(b) *Definitions.* As used in this section—


*Cancelled (voided) check* means a Medicaid check issued by a State or fiscal agent which prior to its being cashed is cancelled (voided) by the State or fiscal agent, thus preventing disbursement of funds.


*Check* means a check or warrant that a State or local agency uses to make a payment.


*Fiscal agent* means an entity that processes or pays vendor claims for the Medicaid State agency.


*Uncashed check* means a Medicaid check issued by a State or fiscal agent which has not been cashed by the payee.


*Warrant* means an order by which the State agency or local agency without the authority to issue checks recognizes a claim. Presentation of a warrant by the payee to a State officer with authority to issue checks will result in release of funds due.


(c) *Refund of Federal financial participation (FFP) for uncashed checks*—(1) *General provisions.* If a check remains uncashed beyond a period of 180 days from the date it was issued; *i.e.*, the date of the check, it will no longer be regarded as an allowable program expenditure. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of the uncashed check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.


(2) *Report of refund.* At the end of each calendar quarter, the State must identify those checks which remain uncashed beyond a period of 180 days after issuance. The State agency must refund all FFP that it received for uncashed checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter. If an uncashed check is cashed after the refund is made, the State may file a claim. The claim will be considered to be an adjustment to the costs for the quarter in which the check was originally claimed. This claim will be paid if otherwise allowed by the Act and the regulations issued pursuant to the Act.


(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.


(d) *Refund of FFP for cancelled (voided) checks*—(1) *General provision.* If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of a cancelled (voided) check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.


(2) *Report of refund.* At the end of each calendar quarter, the State agency must identify those checks which were cancelled (voided). The State must refund all FFP that it received for cancelled (voided) checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter.


(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.
