# § 433.67   Limitations on level of FFP for permissible provider-related donations.

(a)(1) *Limitations on bona fide donations.* There are no limitations on the amount of bona fide provider-related donations that a State may receive without a reduction in FFP, as long as the bona fide donations meet the requirements of § 433.66(b)(1).


(2) *Limitations on donations for outstationed eligibility workers.* Effective October 1, 1992, the maximum amount of provider-related donations for outstationed eligibility workers, as described in § 433.66(b)(2), that a State may receive without a reduction in FFP may not exceed 10 percent of a State's medical assistance administrative costs (both the Federal and State share), excluding the costs of family planning activities. The 10 percent limit for provider-related donations for outstationed eligibility workers is not included in the limit in effect through September 30, 1995, for health care-related taxes as described in § 433.70.


(b) *Calculation of FFP.* CMS will deduct from a State's quarterly medical assistance expenditures, before calculating FFP, any provider-related donations received in that quarter that do not meet the requirements of § 433.66(b)(1) and provider donations for outstationed eligibility workers in excess of the limits specified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
