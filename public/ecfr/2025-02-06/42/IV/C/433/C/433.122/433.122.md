# ยง 433.122   Reapproval of a disapproved system.

When FFP has been reduced under ยง 433.120(a), and CMS determines upon subsequent review that the system meets all current performance standards, system requirements and other conditions of reapproval, the following provisions apply:


(a) CMS will resume FFP in expenditures for system operations at the 75 percent level beginning with the quarter following the review determination that the system again meets conditions of reapproval. 


(b) CMS may retroactively waive a reduction of FFP in expenditures for system operations if CMS determines that the waiver could improve the administration of the State Medicaid plan. However, CMS cannot waive this reduction for any quarter before the fourth quarter immediately preceding the quarter in which CMS issues the determination (as part of the review process) stating that the system is reapproved.
