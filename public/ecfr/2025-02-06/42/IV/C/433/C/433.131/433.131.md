# ยง 433.131   Waiver for noncompliance with conditions of approval and reapproval.

If a State is unable to comply with the conditions of approval or of reapproval and the noncompliance will cause a percentum reduction in FFP, CMS will waive the FFP reduction in the following circumstances:


(a) *Good cause.* If CMS determines that good cause existed, CMS will waive the FFP reduction attributable to those items for which the good cause existed. A waiver of FFP consequences of the failure to meet the conditions of approval or reapproval based upon good cause will not extend beyond two consecutive quarters.


(b) *Circumstances beyond the control of a State.* The State must satisfactorily explain the circumstances that are beyond its control. When CMS grants the waiver, CMS will also defer all other system deadlines for the same length of time that the waiver applies.


(c) *Waiver of deadline.* In no case will CMS waive the December 31, 2015 deadlines referenced in ยง 433.112(c) and ยง 433.116(j).
