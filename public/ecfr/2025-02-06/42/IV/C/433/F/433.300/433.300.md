# § 433.300   Basis.

This subpart implements—


(a) Section 1903(d)(2)(A) of the Act, which directs that quarterly Federal payments to the States under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act are to be reduced or increased to make adjustment for prior overpayments or underpayments that the Secretary determines have been made.


(b) Section 1903(d)(2)(C) and (D) of the Act, which provides that a State has 1 year from discovery of an overpayment for Medicaid services to recover or attempt to recover the overpayment from the provider before adjustment in the Federal Medicaid payment to the State is made; and that adjustment will be made at the end of the 1-year period, whether or not recovery is made, unless the State is unable to recover from a provider because the overpayment is a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy or is otherwise uncollectable.


(c) Section 1903(d)(3) of the Act, which provides that the Secretary will consider the pro rata Federal share of the net amount recovered by a State during any quarter to be an overpayment.
