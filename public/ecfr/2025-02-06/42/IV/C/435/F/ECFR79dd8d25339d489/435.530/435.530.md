(1) In determining the eligibility of individuals whose Medicaid eligibility is protected under §§ 435.130 through 435.134, the agency must use the definition of blindness that was used under the Medicaid plan in December 1973; and 


(2) The agency may use a more restrictive definition to determine eligibility under § 435.121, if the definition is no more restrictive than that used under the Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972. 


(b) *State plan requirement.* The State plan must contain the definition of blindness, expressed in ophthalmic measurements.
