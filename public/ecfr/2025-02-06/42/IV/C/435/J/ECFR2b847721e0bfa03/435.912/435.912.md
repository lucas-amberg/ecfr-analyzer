*Timeliness standards* refer to the maximum periods of time, subject to the exceptions in paragraph (e) of this section and in accordance with § 435.911(c), in which every applicant is entitled to a determination of eligibility, a redetermination of eligibility at renewal, and a redetermination of eligibility based on a change in circumstances.


(b) *State plan requirements.* Consistent with guidance issued by the Secretary, the agency must establish in its State plan timeliness and performance standards, promptly and without undue delay, for:


(1) Determining eligibility for Medicaid for individuals who submit applications to the single State agency or its designee in accordance with § 435.907, including determining eligibility or potential eligibility for, and transferring individuals' electronic accounts to, other insurance affordability programs pursuant to § 435.1200(e);


(2) Determining eligibility for Medicaid for individuals whose accounts are transferred from other insurance affordability programs, including at initial application, as well as at a regularly scheduled renewal or due to a change in circumstances;

(5) Redetermining eligibility for current beneficiaries based on anticipated changes in circumstances in accordance with § 435.919(b)(6), including determining eligibility or potential eligibility for, and transferring individuals' electronic accounts to, other insurance affordability programs pursuant to § 435.1200(e).


(c) *Timeliness and performance standard requirements*—(1) *Period covered.* The timeliness and performance standards adopted by the agency under paragraph (b) of this section must—


(i) For determinations of eligibility at initial application or upon receipt of an account transfer from another insurance affordability program, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, cover the period from the date of application or transfer from another insurance affordability program to the date the agency notifies the applicant of its decision or the date the agency transfers the individual's electronic account to another insurance affordability program in accordance with § 435.1200(e);

(iii) For redeterminations of eligibility due to changes in circumstances under § 435.919(b)(1) through (5), cover the period from the date the agency receives information about the reported change, to the date the agency notifies the individual of its decision or, as applicable, to the date the agency terminates eligibility and transfers the individual's electronic account to another insurance affordability program in accordance with § 435.1200(e); and
