# § 436.116   Families terminated from AFDC because of increased earnings or hours of employment.

(a) If a family loses AFDC solely because of increased income from employment or increased hours of employment, the agency must continue to provide Medicaid for 4 months to all members of the family if—


(1) The family received AFDC in any 3 or more months during the 6-month period immediately before the month in which it became ineligible for AFDC; and 


(2) At least one member of the family is employed throughout the 4-month period, although this need not be the same member for the whole period. 


(b) The 4 calendar month period begins on the date AFDC is terminated. If AFDC benefits are terminated retroactively, the 4 calendar month period also begins retroactively with the first month in which AFDC was erroneously paid.
