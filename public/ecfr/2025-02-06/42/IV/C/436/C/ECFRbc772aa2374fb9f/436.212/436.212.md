# ยง 436.212   Individuals who would be eligible for cash assistance if the State plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD were as broad as allowed under the Act.

(a) The agency may provide Medicaid to any group or groups of individuals specified under ยง 436.201(a) who:


(1) Would be eligible for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD if the State's plan under those programs included individuals whose coverage under title I, IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act is optional (for example, the agency may provide Medicaid to individuals who are 18 years of age and who are attending secondary school full-time and are expected to complete their education before age 19, even though the State's AFDC plan does not include them); or


(2) Would qualify for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD if the State's plan under those programs did not contain eligibility requirements more restrictive than, or in addition to, those required under the appropriate title of the Act. (For example, the agency may provide Medicaid to individuals who would meet the Federal definition of disability, 45 CFR 233.80, but who do not meet the State's more restrictive definitions.)


(b) The agency may cover one or more optional groups under any of the titles of the Act without covering all such groups.
