# § 436.845   Medically needy resource eligibility.

To determine eligibility on the basis of resources for medically needy individuals, the agency must—


(a) Consider only the individual's resources and those that are considered available to him under the financial responsibility requirements for relatives under § 436.602;


(b) Consider only resources available during the period for which income is computed under § 436.831(a); 


(c) Deduct the value of resources that would be deducted in determining eligibility under the State's plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD or under the State's less restrictive financial methodology specified in the State Medicaid plan in accordance with § 436.601. In determining the amount of an individual's resources for Medicaid eligibility, States must count amounts of resources that otherwise would not be counted under the conditional eligibility provisions of the AFDC program.


(d) Apply the resource standards established under § 436.840.
