(7) The subset of measures within the measures in the Child Core Set, among the behavioral health measures in the Adult Core Set, and among the measures in the Health Home Core Sets that must be stratified by race, ethnicity, sex, age, rural/urban status, disability, language, or such other factors as may be specified by the Secretary and informed by annual consultation with States and interested parties in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (d) of this section.


(c) In issuing the guidance described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may provide that Child and Adult Core Sets reporting for certain populations of beneficiaries described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will be voluntary for a specific year, considering the level of difficulty in accessing the data required for such Child and Adult Core Sets State reporting.
