*Indian* means any individual defined at 25 U.S.C. 1603(13), 1603(28), or 1679(a), or who has been determined eligible as an Indian, under 42 CFR 136.12. This means the individual:


(i) Is a member of a Federally recognized Indian tribe;


(ii) Resides in an urban center and meets one or more of the four criteria:


(A) Is a member of a tribe, band, or other organized group of Indians, including those tribes, bands, or groups terminated since 1940 and those recognized now or in the future by the State in which they reside, or who is a descendant, in the first or second degree, of any such member;

(iv) Is considered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be an Indian for purposes of eligibility for Indian health care services, including as a California Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, or other Alaska Native.


*Indian health care provider (IHCP)* means a health care program operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS) or by an Indian Tribe, Tribal Organization, or Urban Indian Organization (otherwise known as an I/T/U) as those terms are defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603).


*Indian managed care entity (IMCE)* means a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity that is controlled (within the meaning of the last sentence of section 1903(m)(1)(C) of the Act) by the Indian Health Service, a Tribe, Tribal Organization, or Urban Indian Organization, or a consortium, which may be composed of one or more Tribes, Tribal Organizations, or Urban Indian Organizations, and which also may include the Service.


(b) *Network and coverage requirements.* All contracts between a State and a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, and PCCM entity, to the extent that the PCCM entity has a provider network, which enroll Indians must:


(1) Require the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to demonstrate that there are sufficient IHCPs participating in the provider network of the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to ensure timely access to services available under the contract from such providers for Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services.


(2) Require that IHCPs, whether participating or not, be paid for covered services provided to Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers as follows:


(i) At a rate negotiated between the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity, and the IHCP, or


(ii) In the absence of a negotiated rate, at a rate not less than the level and amount of payment that the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity would make for the services to a participating provider which is not an IHCP; and


(iii) Make payment to all IHCPs in its network in a timely manner as required for payments to practitioners in individual or group practices under 42 CFR 447.45 and 447.46.


(3) Permit any Indian who is enrolled in a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity that is not an IMCE and eligible to receive services from a IHCP primary care provider participating as a network provider, to choose that IHCP as his or her primary care provider, as long as that provider has capacity to provide the services.


(4) Permit Indian enrollees to obtain services covered under the contract between the State and the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity from out-of-network IHCPs from whom the enrollee is otherwise eligible to receive such services.


(5) In a State where timely access to covered services cannot be ensured due to few or no IHCPs, an MCO, PIHP, PAHP and PCCM entity will be considered to have met the requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if—


(i) Indian enrollees are permitted by the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to access out-of-State IHCPs; or


(ii) If this circumstance is deemed to be good cause for disenrollment from both the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity and the State's managed care program in accordance with § 438.56(c).


(6) MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, and PCCM entities, to the extent the PCCM entity has a provider network, must permit an out-of-network IHCP to refer an Indian enrollee to a network provider.


(c) *Payment requirements.* (1) When an IHCP is enrolled in Medicaid as a FQHC but not a participating provider of the MCO, PIHP, PAHP or PCCM entity, it must be paid an amount equal to the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity would pay a FQHC that is a network provider but is not an IHCP, including any supplemental payment from the State to make up the difference between the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP or PCCM entity pays and what the IHCP FQHC would have received under FFS.


(2) When an IHCP is not enrolled in Medicaid as a FQHC, regardless of whether it participates in the network of an MCO, PIHP, PAHP and PCCM entity or not, it has the right to receive its applicable encounter rate published annually in the _Federal Register_ by the Indian Health Service, or in the absence of a published encounter rate, the amount it would receive if the services were provided under the State plan's FFS payment methodology.


(3) When the amount a IHCP receives from a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity is less than the amount required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the State must make a supplemental payment to the IHCP to make up the difference between the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity pays and the amount the IHCP would have received under FFS or the applicable encounter rate.


(d) *Enrollment in IMCEs.* An IMCE may restrict its enrollment to Indians in the same manner as Indian Health Programs, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1603(12), may restrict the delivery of services to Indians, without being in violation of the requirements in § 438.3(d).
