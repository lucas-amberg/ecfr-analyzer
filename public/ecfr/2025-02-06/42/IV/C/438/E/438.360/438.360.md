# § 438.360   Nonduplication of mandatory activities with Medicare or accreditation review.

(a) *General rule.* Consistent with guidance issued by the Secretary under § 438.352, to avoid duplication the State may use information from a Medicare or private accreditation review of an MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to provide information for the annual EQR (described in § 438.350) instead of conducting one or more of the EQR activities described in § 438.358(b)(1)(i) through (iii) (relating to the validation of performance improvement projects, validation of performance measures, and compliance review) if the following conditions are met:


(1) The MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is in compliance with the applicable Medicare Advantage standards established by CMS, as determined by CMS or its contractor for Medicare, or has obtained accreditation from a private accrediting organization recognized by CMS;


(2) The Medicare or private accreditation review standards are comparable to standards established through the EQR protocols (§ 438.352) for the EQR activities described in § 438.358(b)(1)(i) through (iii); and


(3) The MCO, PIHP, or PAHP provides to the State all the reports, findings, and other results of the Medicare or private accreditation review activities applicable to the standards for the EQR activities.


(b) *External quality review report.* If the State uses information from a Medicare or private accreditation review in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the State must ensure that all such information is furnished to the EQRO for analysis and inclusion in the report described in § 438.364(a).


(c) *Quality strategy.* The State must identify in its quality strategy under § 438.340 the EQR activities for which it has exercised the option described in this section, and explain the rationale for the State's determination that the Medicare review or private accreditation activity is comparable to such EQR activities, consistent with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
