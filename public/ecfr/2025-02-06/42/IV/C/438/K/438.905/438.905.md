# § 438.905   Parity requirements for aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits.

(a) *General parity requirement.* Each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP providing services to MCO enrollees must comply with paragraphs (b), (c), or (e) of this section for all enrollees of a MCO in States that cover both medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits under the State plan. This section details the application of the parity requirements for aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits.


(b) *MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs with no limit or limits on less than one-third of all medical/surgical benefits.* If a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP does not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on any medical/surgical benefits or includes an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit that applies to less than one-third of all medical/surgical benefits provided to enrollees through a contract with the State, it may not impose an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, respectively, on mental health or substance use disorder benefits.


(c) *MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs with a limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.* If a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP includes an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits provided to enrollees through a contract with the State, it must either—


(1) Apply the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit both to the medical/surgical benefits to which the limit would otherwise apply and to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a manner that does not distinguish between the medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits; or


(2) Not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is more restrictive than the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, respectively, on medical/surgical benefits.


(d) *Determining one-third and two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.* For purposes of this section, the determination of whether the portion of medical/surgical benefits subject to an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit represents one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits is based on the total dollar amount of all combinations of MCO, PIHP, and PAHP payments for medical/surgical benefits expected to be paid under the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP for a contract year (or for the portion of a contract year after a change in benefits that affects the applicability of the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits). Any reasonable method may be used to determine whether the dollar amount expected to be paid under the MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs will constitute one-third or two-thirds of the dollar amount of all payments for medical/surgical benefits.


(e) *MCO, PIHP, or PAHP not described in this section*—(1) *In general.* A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP that is not described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section for aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits on medical/surgical benefits, must either—


(i) Impose no aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, on mental health or substance use disorder benefits; or


(ii) Impose an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is no more restrictive than an average limit calculated for medical/surgical benefits in the following manner. The average limit is calculated by taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits, as appropriate, that are applicable to the categories of medical/surgical benefits. Limits based on delivery mechanisms, such as inpatient/outpatient treatment or normal treatment of common, low-cost conditions (such as treatment of normal births), do not constitute categories for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii). In addition, for purposes of determining weighted averages, any benefits that are not within a category that is subject to a separately-designated dollar limit under the contract are taken into account as a single separate category by using an estimate of the upper limit on the dollar amount that a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may reasonably be expected to incur for such benefits, taking into account any other applicable restrictions.


(2) *Weighting.* For purposes of this paragraph (e), the weighting applicable to any category of medical/surgical benefits is determined in the manner set forth in paragraph (d) of this section for determining one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.
