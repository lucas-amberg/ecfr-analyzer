# § 438.910   Parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations.

(a) *Clarification of terms*—(1) *Classification of benefits.* When reference is made in this section to a classification of benefits, the term “classification” means a classification as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(2) *Type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.* When reference is made in this section to a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, the reference to type means its nature. Different types of financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums. Different types of quantitative treatment limitations include annual, episode, and lifetime day and visit limits. *See* paragraph (d)(2) of this section for an illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.


(3) *Level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.* When reference is made in this section to a level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, level refers to the magnitude of the type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.


(b) *General parity requirement*—(1) *General rule and scope.* Each MCO, PIHP and PAHP providing services to MCO enrollees in a State that covers both medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits under the State plan, must not apply any financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation of that type applied to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the same classification furnished to enrollees (whether or not the benefits are furnished by the same MCO, PIHP, or PAHP). Whether a financial requirement or treatment limitation is a predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification is determined separately for each type of financial requirement or treatment limitation. The application of the rules of this paragraph (b) to financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (c) of this section; the application of the rules of this paragraph (b) to nonquantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) *Classifications of benefits used for applying rules.* If an MCO enrollee is provided mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification of benefits described in this paragraph (b)(2), mental health or substance use disorder benefits must be provided to the enrollee in every classification in which medical/surgical benefits are provided. In determining the classification in which a particular benefit belongs, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP must apply the same reasonable standards to medical/surgical benefits and to mental health or substance use disorder benefits. To the extent that a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP provides benefits in a classification and imposes any separate financial requirement or treatment limitation (or separate level of a financial requirement or treatment limitation) for benefits in the classification, the rules of this section apply separately for that classification for all financial requirements or treatment limitations. The following classifications of benefits are the only classifications used in applying the rules of this section:


(i) *Inpatient.* Benefits furnished on an inpatient basis.


(ii) *Outpatient.* Benefits furnished on an outpatient basis. *See* special rules for office visits in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(iii) *Emergency care.* Benefits for emergency care.


(iv) *Prescription drugs.* Benefits for prescription drugs. *See* special rules for multi-tiered prescription drug benefits in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(c) *Financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations*—(1) *Determining “substantially all” and “predominant”*—(i) *Substantially all.* For purposes of this section, a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation is considered to apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits if it applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in that classification. If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation does not apply to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, then that type cannot be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in that classification.


(ii) *Predominant.* (A) If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification as determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the level of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that is considered the predominant level of that type in a classification of benefits is the level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in that classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.


(B) If, for a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, there is no single level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in the classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation, the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may combine levels until the combination of levels applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation in the classification. The least restrictive level within the combination is considered the predominant level of that type in the classification. (For this purpose, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may combine the most restrictive levels first, with each less restrictive level added to the combination until the combination applies to more than one-half of the benefits subject to the financial requirement or treatment limitation.)


(iii) *Portion based on MCO, PIHP or PAHP payments.* For purposes of this section, the determination of the portion of medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation) is based on the total dollar amount of all combinations of MCO, PIHP, and PAHP payments for medical/surgical benefits in the classification expected to be paid under the MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs for a contract year (or for the portion of a contract year after a change in benefits that affects the applicability of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).


(iv) *Clarifications for certain threshold requirements.* For any deductible, the dollar amount of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payments includes all payments for claims that would be subject to the deductible if it had not been satisfied. For any out-of-pocket maximum, the dollar amount of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payments includes all payments associated with out-of-pocket payments that are taken into account towards the out-of-pocket maximum as well as all payments associated with out-of-pocket payments that would have been made towards the out-of-pocket maximum if it had not been satisfied. Similar rules apply for any other thresholds at which the rate of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payment changes.


(v) *Determining the dollar amount of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payments.* Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, any reasonable method may be used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid under a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP for medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).


(2) *Special rules*—(i)* Multi-tiered prescription drug benefits.* If a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP applies different levels of financial requirements to different tiers of prescription drug benefits based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the rules in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (relating to requirements for nonquantitative treatment limitations) and without regard to whether a drug is generally prescribed for medical/surgical benefits or for mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP satisfies the parity requirements of this section for prescription drug benefits. Reasonable factors include cost, efficacy, generic versus brand name, and mail order versus pharmacy pick-up/delivery.


(ii) *Sub-classifications permitted for office visits, separate from other outpatient services.* For purposes of applying the financial requirement and treatment limitation rules of this section, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may divide its benefits furnished on an outpatient basis into the two sub-classifications described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). After the sub-classifications are established, the MCO, PIHP or PAHP may not impose any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any sub-classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the sub-classification using the methodology set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Sub-classifications other than these special rules, such as separate sub-classifications for generalists and specialists, are not permitted. The two sub-classifications permitted under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) are:


(A) Office visits (such as physician visits); and


(B) All other outpatient items and services (such as outpatient surgery, facility charges for day treatment centers, laboratory charges, or other medical items).


(3) *No separate cumulative financial requirements.* A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may not apply any cumulative financial requirement for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a classification that accumulates separately from any established for medical/surgical benefits in the same classification.


(4) *Compliance with other cost-sharing rules.* Each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP must meet the cost-sharing requirements in § 438.108 when applying Medicaid cost-sharing.


(d) *Nonquantitative treatment limitations*—(1) *General rule.* A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may not impose a nonquantitative treatment limitation for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification unless, under the policies and procedures of the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP as written and in operation, any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the classification are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the limitation for medical/surgical benefits in the classification.


(2) *Illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.* Nonquantitative treatment limitations include -


(i) Medical management standards limiting or excluding benefits based on medical necessity or medical appropriateness, or based on whether the treatment is experimental or investigative;


(ii) Formulary design for prescription drugs;


(iii) For MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs with multiple network tiers (such as preferred providers and participating providers), network tier design;


(iv) Standards for provider admission to participate in a network, including reimbursement rates;


(v) MCO, PIHP, or PAHP methods for determining usual, customary, and reasonable charges;


(vi) Refusal to pay for higher-cost therapies until it can be shown that a lower-cost therapy is not effective (also known as fail-first policies or step therapy protocols);


(vii) Exclusions based on failure to complete a course of treatment;


(viii) Restrictions based on geographic location, facility type, provider specialty, and other criteria that limit the scope or duration of benefits for services provided under the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP; and


(ix) Standards for providing access to out-of-network providers.


(3) *Application to out-of-network providers.* Any MCO, PIHP or PAHP providing access to out-of-network providers for medical/surgical benefits within a classification, must use processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors in determining access to out-of-network providers for mental health or substance use disorder benefits that are comparable to, and applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors in determining access to out-of-network providers for medical/surgical benefits.
