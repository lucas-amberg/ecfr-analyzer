# ยง 441.305   Replacement of beneficiaries in approved waiver programs.

(a) *Regular waivers.* A State's estimate of the number of individuals who may receive home and community-based services must include those who will replace beneficiaries who leave the program for any reason. A State may replace beneficiaries who leave the program due to death or loss of eligibility under the State plan without regard to any federally-imposed limit on utilization, but must maintain a record of beneficiaries replaced on this basis. 


(b) *Model waivers.* (1) The number of individuals who may receive home and community-based services under a model waiver may not exceed 200 beneficiaries at any one time. 


(2) The agency may replace any individuals who die or become ineligible for State plan services to maintain a count up to the number specified by the State and approved by CMS within the 200-maximum limit.
