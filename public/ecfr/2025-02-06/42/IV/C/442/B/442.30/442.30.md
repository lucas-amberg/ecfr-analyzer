# § 442.30   Agreement as evidence of certification.

(a) Under §§ 440.40(a) and 440.150 of this chapter, FFP is available in expenditures for NF and ICF/IID services only if the facility has been certified as meeting the requirements for Medicaid participation, as evidenced by a provider agreement executed under this part. An agreement is not valid evidence that a facility has met those requirements if CMS determines that—


(1) The survey agency failed to apply the applicable requirements under subpart B of part 483 of this chapter for NFs or subpart I of part 483 of this chapter, which set forth the conditions of participation for ICFs/IID. 


(2) The survey agency failed to follow the rules and procedures for certification set forth in subpart C of this part, subpart E of part 488, and § 431.610 of this subchapter; 


(3) The survey agency failed to perform any of the functions specified in § 431.610(g) of this subchapter relating to evaluating and acting on information about the facility and inspecting the facility; 


(4) The agency failed to use the Federal standards, and the forms, methods and procedures prescribed by CMS as required under § 431.610(f)(1) or § 488.318(b) of this chapter, for determining the qualifications of providers; or 


(5) The survey agency failed to adhere to the following principles in determining compliance:


(i) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with Federal health, safety and quality standards;


(ii) The survey process uses resident outcomes as the primary means to establish the compliance status of facilities. Specifically, surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to residents, and the effects of that care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of individual residents;


(iii) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert with Federal forms and procedures, to determine compliance;


(iv) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform and consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;


(v) Federal forms are used by all surveyors to ensure proper recording of findings and to document the basis for the findings.


(6) The survey agency failed to assess in a systematic manner a facility's actual provision of care and services to residents and effects of that care on residents.


(7) Required elements of the NF survey process fails to include all of the following: 


(i) An entrance conference;


(ii) A resident-centered tour of facility;


(iii) An in-depth review of a sample of residents including observation, interview and record review;


(iv) Observation of the preparation and administration of drugs for a sample of residents;


(v) Evaluation of a facility's meals, dining areas and eating assistance procedures;


(vi) Formulation of a deficiency statement based on the incorporation of all appropriate findings onto the survey report form;


(vii) An exit conference; and


(viii) Follow-up surveys as appropriate.


(8) The agreement's terms and conditions do not meet the requirements of this subpart.


(b) The Administrator will make the determination under paragraph (a) of this section through onsite surveys, other Federal reviews, State certification records, or reports he may require from the Medicaid or survey agency. 


(c) If the Administrator disallows a State's claim for FFP because of a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the State is entitled upon request to reconsideration of the disallowance under 45 CFR part 16.
