# § 447.25   Direct payments to certain beneficiaries for physicians' or dentists' services.

(a) *Basis and purpose.* This section implements section 1905(a) of the Act by prescribing requirements applicable to States making direct payments to certain beneficiaries for physicians' or dentists' services. 


(b) *State plan requirements.* Except for groups specified in paragraph (c) of this section, a State may make direct payments to beneficiaries for physicians' or dentists' services. If it does so, the State plan must—


(1) Provide for direct payments; and 


(2) Specify the conditions under which payments are made. 


(c) *Federal financial participation.* No FFP is available in expenditures for direct payment for physicians' or dentists' services to any beneficiary—


(1) Who is receiving assistance under the State's approved plan under title I, IV-A, X, XIV or XVI (AABD) of the Act; or 


(2) To whom supplemental security benefits are being paid under title XVI of the Act; or 


(3) Who is receiving or eligible for a State supplementary payment or would be eligible if he were not in a medical institution, and who is eligible for Medicaid as a categorically needy beneficiary. 


(d) *Federal requirements.* (1) Direct payments to beneficiaries under this section are an alternative to payments directly to providers and are subject to the same conditions; for example, the State's reasonable charge schedules are applicable. 


(2) Direct payments must be supported by providers' bills for services.
