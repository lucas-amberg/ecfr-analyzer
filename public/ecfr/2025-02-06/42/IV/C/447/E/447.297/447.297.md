# ยง 447.297   Limitations on aggregate payments for disproportionate share hospitals beginning October 1, 1992.

(a) *Applicability.* The provisions of this section apply to the 50 States and the District of Columbia, but not to any State whose entire Medicaid program is operated under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act. 


(b) *National payment target.* The national payment target for disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments for any Federal fiscal year is equal to 12 percent of the total medical assistance expenditures that will be made during the Federal fiscal year under State plans, excluding administrative costs. A preliminary national expenditure target will be published by CMS prior to October 1 of each year. This preliminary national expenditure target will be superseded by a final national expenditure target posted as soon as practicable, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *State disproportionate share hospital allotments.* Prior to October 1 of each Federal fiscal year, CMS will post in the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System/State Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System and at Medicaid.gov (or similar successor system or website) preliminary State DSH allotments for each State. These preliminary State DSH allotments will be determined using the most current applicable actual and estimated State expenditure information as reported to CMS and adjusted by CMS as may be necessary using the methodology described in ยง 447.298. CMS will post final State DSH allotments as soon as practicable for each Federal fiscal year, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.


(d) *Final national disproportionate share hospitals expenditure target and State disproportionate share hospitals allotments.* (1) CMS will revise the preliminary national expenditure target and the preliminary State DSH allotments as soon as practicable for each Federal fiscal year. The final national DSH expenditure target and State DSH allotments will be based on the most current applicable actual and estimated expenditure information reported to CMS and adjusted by CMS as may be necessary immediately prior to the posting date. The final national expenditure target and State DSH allotments will not be recalculated for that Federal fiscal year based upon any subsequent actual or estimated expenditure information reported to CMS.


(2) If CMS determines that at any time a State has exceeded its final DSH allotment for a Federal fiscal year, FFP attributable to the excess DSH expenditures will be disallowed.


(3) If a State's actual DSH expenditures applicable to a Federal fiscal year are less than its final State DSH allotment for that Federal fiscal year, the State is permitted, to the extent allowed by its approved State plan, to make additional DSH expenditures applicable to that Federal fiscal year up to the amount of its final DSH allotment for that Federal fiscal year.
