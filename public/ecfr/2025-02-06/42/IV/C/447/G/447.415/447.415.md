# ยง 447.415   Availability of Federal financial participation (FFP).

(a) For primary care services furnished by physicians specified in ยง 447.400, FFP will be available at the rate of 100 percent for the amount by which the payment required to comply with ยง 447.405 exceeds the Medicaid payment that would have been made under the approved state plan in effect on July 1, 2009.


(b) For purposes of calculating the payment that would have been made under the approved State plan in effect on July 1, 2009, the state must exclude incentive, bonus, and performance-based payments but must include supplemental payments for which the approved methodology is linked to volume and payment for specific codes.


(c) For vaccine administration, the state must impute the payment that would have been made for code 90460 under the approved Medicaid state plan. The imputed rate for July 1, 2009, for code 90460 equals the payment rates for codes 90465 and 90471 weighted by service volume.


(d) For any payment made under a bundled rate methodology, including bundled rates for vaccines and vaccine administration, the amount directly attributable to the applicable primary care service must be isolated for purposes of determining the availability of the 100 percent FFP rate. Bundled rates, for purposes of this provision, do not include encounter and per diem rates.
