# § 455.417   Termination periods and termination database periods.

(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, a provider remains in the termination notification database referenced in section 1902(ll) of the Act for a period that is the lesser of:


(i) The length of the termination period imposed by the State that initially terminated the provider or the reenrollment bar (as described in § 424.535(c) of this chapter) imposed by the Medicare program in the case of a Medicare revocation; or


(ii) 10 years (for those Medicaid or CHIP terminations that are greater than 10 years).


(2) All other State Medicaid agencies or CHIPs must terminate or deny the provider from their respective programs (pursuant to § 455.416(c)) for at least the same length of time as the termination database period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b)(1) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section prohibits:


(i) The initially terminating State from imposing a termination period of greater than 10 years consistent with that State's laws, or


(ii) Another State from terminating the provider, based on the original State's termination, for a period:


(A) Of greater than 10 years; or


(B) That is otherwise longer than that imposed by the initially terminating State.


(2) The period established under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section must be no shorter than the period in which the provider is to be included in the termination database under paragraph (a) of this section.


(c)(1) If the initially terminating State agency or the Medicare program reinstates the provider prior to the end of the termination period originally imposed by the initially terminating State agency or Medicare, CMS removes the provider from the termination database after the reinstatement has been reported to CMS.


(2) If the provider is removed from the database pursuant to paragraph (c)(1), CMS may immediately reinclude the provider in the database (with no interval between the 2 periods) if a basis for doing so exists under part 455 or 424 of this chapter.


(d) For purposes of this section only, terminations under § 455.416(c) are not considered “for cause” terminations and therefore need not be reported to CMS for inclusion in the termination database.
