# § 456.236   Continued stay review process.

The UR plan must provide that—


(a) Review of continued stay cases is conducted by—


(1) The UR committee; 


(2) A subgroup of the UR committee; or 


(3) A designee of the UR committee; 


(b) The committee, subgroup or designee reviews a beneficiary's continued stay on or before the expiration of each assigned continued stay review date; 


(c) For each continued stay of a beneficiary in the mental hospital, the committee, subgroup or designee reviews and evaluates the documentation described under § 456.211 against the criteria developed under § 456.232 and applies close professional scrutiny to cases described under § 456.232(b). 


(d) If the committee, subgroup or designee finds that a beneficiary's continued stay in the mental hospital is needed, the committee assigns a new continued stay review date in accordance with § 456.234; 


(e) If the committee, subgroup or designee finds that a continued stay case does not meet the criteria, the committee or a subgroup that includes at least one physician reviews the case to decide the need for continued stay; 


(f) If the committee or subgroup making the review under paragraph (e) of this section finds that a continued stay is not needed, it notifies the beneficiary's attending or staff physician and gives him an opportunity to present his views before it makes a final decision on the need for the continued stay; 


(g) If the attending or staff physician does not present additional information or clarification of the need for the continued stay, the decision of the committee or subgroup is final; and 


(h) If the attending or staff physician presents additional information or clarification, at least two physician members of the committee, one of whom is knowledgeable in the treatment of mental diseases, review the need for the continued stay. If they find that the beneficiary no longer needs inpatient mental hospital services, their decision is final.
