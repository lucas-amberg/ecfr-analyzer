# § 456.653   Acceptable reasons for not meeting requirements for annual on-site review.

The Administrator will find an agency's showing satisfactory, even if it failed to meet the annual review requirements of § 456.652(a)(4), if—


(a) The agency demonstrates that—


(1) It completed reviews by the end of the quarter in at least 98 percent of all facilities requiring review by the end of the quarter;


(2) It completed reviews by the end of the quarter in all facilities with 200 or more certified Medicaid beds requiring review by the end of the quarter; and


(3) With respect to all unreviewed facilities, the agency exercised good faith and due diligence by attempting to review those facilities and would have succeeded but for events beyond its control which it could not have reasonably anticipated; or


(b) The agency demonstrates that it failed to meet the standard in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section by the close of the quarter for technical reasons, but met the standard within 30 days after the close of the quarter. Technical reasons are circumstances within the agency's control.


(c) Facilities that are reviewed under paragraph (b) of this section, after the quarter in which they were due for review, retain their original anniversary quarter due date for purposes of subsequent reviews.
