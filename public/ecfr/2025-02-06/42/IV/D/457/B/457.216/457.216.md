# § 457.216   Treatment of uncashed or canceled (voided) CHIP checks.

(a) *Purpose.* This section provides rules to ensure that States refund the Federal portion of uncashed or canceled (voided) checks under title XXI.


(b) *Definitions.* As used in this section—


*Canceled (voided) check* means an CHIP check issued by a State or fiscal agent that prior to its being cashed is canceled (voided) by the State or fiscal agent, thus preventing disbursement of funds.


*Fiscal agent* means an entity that processes or pays vendor claims for the CHIP agency.


*Uncashed check* means an CHIP check issued by a State or fiscal agent that has not been cashed by the payee.


*Warrant* means an order by which the CHIP agency or local agency without the authority to issue checks recognizes a claim. Presentation of a warrant by the payee to a State officer with authority to issue checks will result in release of funds due.


(c) *Refund of Federal financial participation (FFP) for uncashed checks*—(1) *General provisions.* If a check remains uncashed beyond a period of 180 days from the date it was issued; that is, the date of the check, it is no longer regarded as an allowable program expenditure. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of the uncashed check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.


(2) *Report of refund.* At the end of each calendar quarter, the State agency must identify those checks that remain uncashed beyond a period of 180 days after issuance. The CHIP agency must refund all FFP that it received for uncashed checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter. If an uncashed check is cashed after the refund is made, the State may file a claim. The claim will be considered to be an adjustment to the costs for the quarter in which the check was originally claimed. This claim will be paid if otherwise allowed by the Act and the regulations issued in accordance with the Act.


(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.


(d) *Refund of FFP for canceled (voided) checks*—(1) *General provisions.* If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of a canceled (voided) check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.


(2) *Report of refund.* At the end of each calendar quarter, the CHIP agency must identify those checks that were canceled (voided). The State must refund all FFP that it received for canceled (voided) checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter.


(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.
