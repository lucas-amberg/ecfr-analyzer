# § 457.350   Eligibility screening and enrollment in other insurance affordability programs.

(a) *State plan requirement.* The State plan shall include a description of the coordinated eligibility and enrollment procedures used, at an initial and any follow-up eligibility determination, including any periodic redetermination, to ensure that:


(1) Only targeted low-income children are furnished CHIP coverage under the plan; and


(2) Enrollment is facilitated for applicants and enrollees found to be eligible or potentially eligible for other insurance affordability programs in accordance with this section.


(b) *Evaluation of eligibility for other insurance affordability programs.* (1) For individuals described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, promptly and without undue delay, consistent with the timeliness standards established under § 457.340(d), the State must:


(i) Determine eligibility for Medicaid on the basis of having household income at or below the applicable modified adjusted gross income standard, as defined in § 435.911(b) of this chapter (“MAGI-based Medicaid”); and


(ii) If unable to make a determination of eligibility for MAGI-based Medicaid, identify potential eligibility for other insurance affordability programs, including Medicaid on a basis other than MAGI, the Basic Health Program (BHP) in accordance with § 600.305(a) of this chapter, or insurance affordability programs available through the Exchange, as indicated by information provided on the application or renewal form provided by or on behalf of the beneficiary, including information obtained by the agency from other trusted electronic data sources.


(2) Individuals to whom paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies include:


(i) Any applicant who submits an application to the State which includes sufficient information to determine CHIP eligibility;


(ii) Any enrollee whose eligibility is being redetermined at renewal or due to a change in circumstance per § 457.343; and


(iii) Any enrollee whom the State determines is not eligible for CHIP, or who is determined not eligible for CHIP as a result of a review conducted in accordance with subpart K of this part.


(3) In determining eligibility for Medicaid as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State must utilize the option the Medicaid agency has elected at § 435.1200(b)(4) of this chapter to accept determinations of MAGI-based Medicaid eligibility made by a separate CHIP, and which must be detailed in the agreement described at § 457.348(a).


(c) *Income eligibility test.* To determine eligibility as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and to identify the individuals described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section who are potentially eligible for BHP or insurance affordability programs available through an Exchange, a State must apply the MAGI-based methodologies used to determine household income described in § 457.315 or such methodologies as are applied by such other programs.


(d) *Individuals found eligible for Medicaid based on MAGI.* For individuals identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State must—


(1) Promptly and without undue delay, consistent with the timeliness standards established under § 457.340(d), transfer the individual's electronic account to the Medicaid agency via a secure electronic interface; and


(2) Except as provided in § 457.355, find the applicant ineligible for CHIP.


(e) *Individuals potentially eligible for Medicaid on a basis other than MAGI.* For individuals identified as potentially eligible for Medicaid on a non-MAGI basis, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the State must—


(1) Promptly and without undue delay, consistent with the timeliness standards established under § 457.340(d), transfer the electronic account to the Medicaid agency via a secure electronic interface.


(2) Complete the determination of eligibility for CHIP in accordance with § 457.340 or evaluation for potential eligibility for other insurance affordability programs in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(3) Include in the notice of CHIP eligibility or ineligibility provided under § 457.340(e), as appropriate, coordinated content relating to—


(i) The transfer of the individual's electronic account to the Medicaid agency per paragraph (e)(1) of this section;


(ii) The transfer of the individual's account to another insurance affordability program in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, if applicable; and


(iii) The impact that an approval of Medicaid eligibility will have on the individual's eligibility for CHIP or another insurance affordability program, as appropriate.


(4) Disenroll the enrollee from CHIP if the State is notified in accordance with § 435.1200(d)(5) of this chapter that the applicant has been determined eligible for Medicaid.


(f) *Children found ineligible for Medicaid based on MAGI, and potentially ineligible for Medicaid on a basis other than MAGI.* If a State uses a screening procedure other than a full determination of Medicaid eligibility under all possible eligibility groups, and the screening process reveals that the child does not appear to be eligible for Medicaid, the State must provide the child's family with the following in writing:


(1) A statement that based on a limited review, the child does not appear eligible for Medicaid, but Medicaid eligibility can only be determined based on a full review of a Medicaid application under all Medicaid eligibility groups;


(2) Information about Medicaid eligibility rules, covered benefits, and restrictions on cost sharing; and


(3) Information about how and where to apply for Medicaid under all eligibility groups.


(4) The State will determine the written format and timing of the information regarding Medicaid eligibility, benefits, and the application process required under this paragraph (f).


(g) *Individuals found potentially eligible for other insurance affordability programs.* For individuals identified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section who have been identified as potentially eligible for BHP or insurance affordability programs available through the Exchange, the State must promptly and without undue delay, consistent with the timeliness standards established under § 457.340(d), transfer the electronic account to the other insurance affordability program via a secure electronic interface.


(h) *Evaluation of eligibility for Exchange coverage.* A State may enter into an arrangement with the Exchange for the entity that determines eligibility for CHIP to make determinations of eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost sharing reductions, consistent with 45 CFR 155.110(a)(2).


(i) *Waiting lists, enrollment caps and closed enrollment.* The State must establish procedures to ensure that—


(1) The procedures developed in accordance with this section have been followed for each child applying for a separate child health program before placing the child on a waiting list or otherwise deferring action on the child's application for the separate child health program;


(2) Children placed on a waiting list or for whom action on their application is otherwise deferred are transferred to other insurance affordability programs in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section; and


(3) Families are informed that a child may be eligible for other insurance affordability programs, while the child is on a waiting list for a separate child health program or if circumstances change, for Medicaid.
