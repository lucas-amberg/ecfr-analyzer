# § 457.360   Deemed newborn children.

(a) *Basis.* This section implements section 2112(e) of the Act.


(b) *Eligibility.* (1) The State must provide CHIP to children from birth until the child's first birthday without application if—


(i) The child's mother was eligible for and received covered services for the date of the child's birth under the State plan as a targeted low-income pregnant woman in accordance with section 2112 of the Act; and


(ii) The child is not eligible for Medicaid under § 435.117 of this chapter.


(2)(i) The State may provide coverage under this section to children who are not eligible for Medicaid under § 435.117 from birth until the child's first birthday without application if the requirement in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is met and if, for the date of the child's birth, the child's mother was eligible for and received covered services under—


(A) The State plan as a targeted low-income child;


(B) CHIP coverage in another State; or


(C) Coverage under the State's demonstration under section 1115 of the Act as a Medicaid or CHIP population.


(ii) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the State may only elect the optional populations described if it elects to cover the corresponding optional populations in Medicaid under § 435.117(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter.


(3) The child is deemed to have applied and been determined eligible under the State's separate CHIP State plan effective as of the date of birth, and remains eligible regardless of changes in circumstances (except if the child dies or ceases to be a resident of the State or the child's representative requests a voluntary termination of the child's eligibility) until the child's first birthday.


(c) *CHIP identification number.* (1) The CHIP identification number of the mother serves as the child's identification number, and all claims for covered services provided to the child may be submitted and paid under such number, unless and until the State issues a separate identification number for the child.


(2) The State must issue a separate CHIP identification number for the child prior to the effective date of any termination of the mother's eligibility or prior to the date of the child's first birthday, whichever is sooner, except that the State must issue a separate CHIP identification number for the child if the mother was covered in another State at the time of birth.
