# § 457.626   Prevention of duplicate payments.

(a) *General rule.* No payment shall be made to a State for expenditures for child health assistance under its State child health plan to the extent that: 


(1) A non-governmental health insurer would have been obligated to pay for those services but for a provision of its insurance contract that has the effect of limiting or excluding those obligations based on the actual or potential eligibility of the individual for child health assistance under the State child health insurance plan. 


(2) Payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly under any other Federally operated or financed health insurance or benefits program, other than a program operated or financed by the Indian Health Service. 


(3) Services are for an unborn child and are payable under Medicaid as a service to an eligible pregnant woman under that program. 


(b) *Definitions.* As used in paragraph (a) of this section— 


*Non-governmental health insurer* includes any health insurance issuer, group health plan, or health maintenance organization, as those terms are defined in 45 CFR 144.103, which is not part of, or wholly owned by, a governmental entity. 


*Prompt payment* can reasonably be expected when payment is required by applicable statute, or under an approved State plan. 


*Programs operated or financed by the Indian Health Service* means health programs operated by the Indian Health Service, or Indian tribe or tribal organization pursuant to a contract, grant, cooperative agreement or compact with the Indian Health Service under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450, *et seq.*), or by an urban Indian organization in accordance with a grant or contract with the Indian Health Service under the authority of title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1601, *et seq.*).
