# § 457.1015   Cost-effectiveness.

(a) *Definition.* For purposes of this subpart, “cost-effective” means that the State's cost of purchasing family coverage that includes coverage for targeted low-income children is equal to or less than the State's cost of obtaining coverage under the State plan only for the eligible targeted low-income children involved. 


(b) *Cost comparisons.* A State may demonstrate cost-effectiveness by comparing the cost of coverage for the family to the cost of coverage only for the targeted low-income children under the health benefits package offered by the State under the State plan for which the child is eligible. 


(c) *Individual or aggregate basis.* (1) The State may base its demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of family coverage on an assessment of the cost of family coverage for individual families, done on a case-by-case basis, or on the cost of family coverage in the aggregate. 


(2) The State must assess cost-effectiveness in its initial request for a waiver and then annually. 


(3) For any State that chooses the aggregate cost method, if an annual assessment of the cost-effectiveness of family coverage in the aggregate reveals that it is not cost-effective, the State must assess cost-effectiveness on a case-by-case basis. 


(d) *Reports on family coverage.* A State with a waiver under this section must include in its annual report pursuant to § 457.750, the cost of family coverage purchased under the waiver, and the number of children and adults, respectively, covered under family coverage pursuant to the waiver.
