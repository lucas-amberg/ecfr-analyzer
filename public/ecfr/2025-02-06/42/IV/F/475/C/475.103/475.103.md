(1) The organization's proposed processes, capabilities, quantitative, and/or qualitative performance objectives, and methodology to perform quality improvement initiatives;


(2) The organization's proposed involvement of and access to physicians and practitioners in the QIO area with the appropriate expertise and specialization in the areas of health care concerning the quality improvement initiatives;
