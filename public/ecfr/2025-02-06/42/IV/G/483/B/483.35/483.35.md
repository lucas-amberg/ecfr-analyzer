The facility must have sufficient nursing staff with the appropriate competencies and skills sets to provide nursing and related services to assure resident safety and attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident, as determined by resident assessments and individual plans of care and considering the number, acuity, and diagnoses of the facility's resident population in accordance with the facility assessment required at § 483.71.

(3) Compliance with minimum total nurse staffing hours per resident day as set forth in one or more of the hours per resident day requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section should not be construed as approval for a facility to staff only to these numerical standards. Facilities must ensure there are a sufficient number of staff with the appropriate competencies and skills sets necessary to assure resident safety and to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident, as determined by resident assessments, acuity and diagnoses of the facility's resident population in accordance with the facility assessment at § 483.71.

(6) *Required retraining.* If, since an individual's most recent completion of a training and competency evaluation program, there has been a continuous period of 24 consecutive months during none of which the individual provided nursing or nursing-related services for monetary compensation, the individual must complete a new training and competency evaluation program or a new competency evaluation program.


(7) *Regular in-service education.* The facility must complete a performance review of every nurse aide at least once every 12 months, and must provide regular in-service education based on the outcome of these reviews. In-service training must comply with the requirements of § 483.95(g).
