(1) Arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility in accordance with § 483.15(b); and


(2) Prepare and orient the resident for discharge.


(c) *Residents who do not require NF services but require specialized services for MI or IID*—(1) *Long term residents.* Except as otherwise may be provided in an alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the Act, for any resident who has continuously resided in a NF for at least 30 months before the date of the determination, and who requires only specialized services as defined in § 483.120, the State must, in consultation with the resident's family or legal representative and caregivers—


(i) Offer the resident the choice of remaining in the facility or of receiving services in an alternative appropriate setting;


(ii) Inform the resident of the institutional and noninstitutional alternatives covered under the State Medicaid plan for the resident;


(iii) Clarify the effect on eligibility for Medicaid services under the State plan if the resident chooses to leave the facility, including its effect on readmission to the facility; and


(iv) Regardless of the resident's choice, provide for, or arrange for the provision of specialized services for the mental illness or intellectual disability.


(2) *Short term residents.* Except as otherwise may be provided in an alternative disposition plan adopted under section 1919(e)(7)(E) of the Act, for any resident who requires only specialized services, as defined in § 483.120, and who has not continuously resided in a NF for at least 30 months before the date of the determination, the State must, in consultation with the resident's family or legal representative and caregivers—


(i) Arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility in accordance with § 483.15(b);


(ii) Prepare and orient the resident for discharge; and 


(iii) Provide for, or arrange for the provision of, specialized services for the mental illness or intellectual disability.


(3) For the purpose of establishing length of stay in a NF, the 30 months of continuous residence in a NF or longer—


(i) Is calculated back from the date of the first annual resident review determination which finds that the individual is not in need of NF level of services;
