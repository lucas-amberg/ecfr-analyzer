# § 483.134   Evaluating whether an individual with mental illness requires specialized services (PASARR/MI).

(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of this section is to identify the minimum data needs and process requirements for the State mental health authority, which is responsible for determining whether or not the applicant or resident with MI, as defined in § 483.102(b)(1) of this part, needs a specialized services program for mental illness as defined in § 483.120.


(b) *Data.* Minimum data collected must include—(1) A comprehensive history and physical examination of the person. The following areas must be included (if not previously addressed):


(i) Complete medical history;


(ii) Review of all body systems;


(iii) Specific evaluation of the person's neurological system in the areas of motor functioning, sensory functioning, gait, deep tendon reflexes, cranial nerves, and abnormal reflexes; and 


(iv) In case of abnormal findings which are the basis for an NF placement, additional evaluations conducted by appropriate specialists.


(2) A comprehensive drug history including current or immediate past use of medications that could mask symptoms or mimic mental illness.


(3) A psychosocial evaluation of the person, including current living arrangements and medical and support systems.


(4) A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation including a complete psychiatric history, evaluation of intellectual functioning, memory functioning, and orientation, description of current attitudes and overt behaviors, affect, suicidal or homicidal ideation, paranoia, and degree of reality testing (presence and content of delusions) and hallucinations.


(5) A functional assessment of the individual's ability to engage in activities of daily living and the level of support that would be needed to assist the individual to perform these activities while living in the community. The assessment must determine whether this level of support can be provided to the individual in an alternative community setting or whether the level of support needed is such that NF placement is required.


(6) The functional assessment must address the following areas: Self-monitoring of health status, self-administering and scheduling of medical treatment, including medication compliance, or both, self-monitoring of nutritional status, handling money, dressing appropriately, and grooming.


(c) *Personnel requirements.* (1) If the history and physical examination are not performed by a physician, then a physician must review and concur with the conclusions.


(2) The State may designate the mental health professionals who are qualified—


(i) To perform the evaluations required under paragraph (b) (2)-(6) of this section including the—


(A) Comprehensive drug history;


(B) Psychosocial evaluation;


(C) Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation;


(D) Functional assessment; and


(ii) To make the determination required in paragraph (d) of this section.
