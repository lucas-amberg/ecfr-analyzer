(2) An order for restraint or seclusion must not be written as a standing order or on an as-needed basis. 


(3) Restraint or seclusion must not result in harm or injury to the resident and must be used only— 


(i) To ensure the safety of the resident or others during an emergency safety situation; and 


(ii) Until the emergency safety situation has ceased and the resident's safety and the safety of others can be ensured, even if the restraint or seclusion order has not expired. 


(4) Restraint and seclusion must not be used simultaneously. 


(b) *Emergency safety intervention.* An emergency safety intervention must be performed in a manner that is safe, proportionate, and appropriate to the severity of the behavior, and the resident's chronological and developmental age; size; gender; physical, medical, and psychiatric condition; and personal history (including any history of physical or sexual abuse). 


(c) *Notification of facility policy.* At admission, the facility must— 


(1) Inform both the incoming resident and, in the case of a minor, the resident's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the facility's policy regarding the use of restraint or seclusion during an emergency safety situation that may occur while the resident is in the program; 


(2) Communicate its restraint and seclusion policy in a language that the resident, or his or her parent(s) or legal guardian(s) understands (including American Sign Language, if appropriate) and when necessary, the facility must provide interpreters or translators; 


(3) Obtain an acknowledgment, in writing, from the resident, or in the case of a minor, from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) that he or she has been informed of the facility's policy on the use of restraint or seclusion during an emergency safety situation.
