(2) Be free of potentially hazardous conditions such as unprotected light fixtures and electrical outlets. 


(c) If the emergency safety situation continues beyond the time limit of the order for the use of seclusion, a registered nurse or other licensed staff, such as a licensed practical nurse, must immediately contact the ordering physician or other licensed practitioner permitted by the state and the facility to order restraint or seclusion to receive further instructions. 


(d) A physician, or other licensed practitioner permitted by the state and the facility to evaluate the resident's well-being and trained in the use of emergency safety interventions, must evaluate the resident's well-being immediately after the resident is removed from seclusion.
