# § 483.370   Postintervention debriefings.

(a) Within 24 hours after the use of restraint or seclusion, staff involved in an emergency safety intervention and the resident must have a face-to-face discussion. This discussion must include all staff involved in the intervention except when the presence of a particular staff person may jeopardize the well-being of the resident. Other staff and the resident's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) may participate in the disussion when it is deemed appropriate by the facility. The facility must conduct such discussion in a language that is understood by the resident's parent(s) or legal guardian(s). The discussion must provide both the resident and staff the opportunity to discuss the circumstances resulting in the use of restraint or seclusion and strategies to be used by the staff, the resident, or others that could prevent the future use of restraint or seclusion. 


(b) Within 24 hours after the use of restraint or seclusion, all staff involved in the emergency safety intervention, and appropriate supervisory and administrative staff, must conduct a debriefing session that includes, at a minimum, a review and discussion of— 


(1) The emergency safety situation that required the intervention, including a discussion of the precipitating factors that led up to the intervention; 


(2) Alternative techniques that might have prevented the use of the restraint or seclusion; 


(3) The procedures, if any, that staff are to implement to prevent any recurrence of the use of restraint or seclusion; and 


(4) The outcome of the intervention, including any injuries that may have resulted from the use of restraint or seclusion. 


(c) Staff must document in the resident's record that both debriefing sessions took place and must include in that documentation the names of staff who were present for the debriefing, names of staff that were excused from the debriefing, and any changes to the resident's treatment plan that result from the debriefings.
