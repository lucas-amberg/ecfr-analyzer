# ยง 484.358   HHVBP Measure removal factors.

CMS may remove a quality measure from the expanded HHVBP Model based on one or more of the following factors:


(a) Measure performance among HHAs is so high and unvarying that meaningful distinctions in improvements in performance can no longer be made (that is, topped out).


(b) Performance or improvement on a measure does not result in better patient outcomes.


(c) A measure does not align with current clinical guidelines or practice.


(d) A more broadly applicable measure (across settings, populations, or conditions) for the particular topic is available.


(e) A measure that is more proximal in time to desired patient outcomes for the particular topic is available.


(f) A measure that is more strongly associated with desired patient outcomes for the particular topic is available.


(g) Collection or public reporting of a measure leads to negative unintended consequences other than patient harm.


(h) The costs associated with a measure outweigh the benefit of its continued use in the program.
