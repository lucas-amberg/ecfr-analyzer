# ยง 485.532   Condition of participation: Discharge planning.

An REH must have an effective discharge planning process that focuses on the patient's goals and treatment preferences and includes the patient and their caregivers/support person(s) as active partners in the discharge planning for post-discharge care. The discharge planning process and the discharge plan must be consistent with the patient's goals for care and their treatment preferences, ensure an effective transition of the patient from the REH to post-discharge care, and reduce the factors leading to preventable hospital admissions or readmissions.


(a)* Standard: Discharge planning process.* The REH's discharge planning process must identify, at an early stage of the provision of services, those patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge in the absence of adequate discharge planning and must provide a discharge planning evaluation for those patients so identified as well as for other patients upon the request of the patient, patient's representative, or patient's physician.


(1) Any discharge planning evaluation must be made on a timely basis to ensure that appropriate arrangements for post-REH care will be made before discharge and to avoid unnecessary delays in discharge.


(2) A discharge planning evaluation must include an evaluation of a patient's likely need for appropriate services following those furnished by the REH, including, but not limited to, hospice care services, post-REH extended care services, home health services, and non-health care services and community-based care providers, and must also include a determination of the availability of the appropriate services as well as of the patient's access to those services.


(3) The discharge planning evaluation must be included in the patient's medical record for use in establishing an appropriate discharge plan and the results of the evaluation must be discussed with the patient (or the patient's representative).


(4) Upon the request of a patient's physician, the REH must arrange for the development and initial implementation of a discharge plan for the patient.


(5) Any discharge planning evaluation or discharge plan required under this paragraph (a) must be developed by, or under the supervision of, a registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified personnel.


(6) The REH's discharge planning process must require regular re-evaluation of the patient's condition to identify changes that require modification of the discharge plan. The discharge plan must be updated, as needed, to reflect these changes.


(7) The REH must assess its discharge planning process on a regular basis. The assessment must include ongoing periodic review of a representative sample of discharge plans.


(8) The REH must assist patients, their families, or the patient's representative in selecting a post-acute care provider by using and sharing data that includes, but is not limited to, home health agency (HHA), skilled nursing facility (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), or long term care hospital (LTCH) data on quality measures and data on resource use measures. The REH must ensure that the post-acute care data on quality measures and data on resource use measures is relevant and applicable to the patient's goals of care and treatment preferences.


(b) *Standard: Discharge of the patient and provision and transmission of the patient's necessary medical information.* The REH must discharge the patient, and also transfer or refer the patient where applicable, along with all necessary medical information pertaining to the patient's current course of illness and treatment, post-discharge goals of care, and treatment preferences, at the time of discharge, to the appropriate post-acute care service providers and suppliers, facilities, agencies, and other outpatient service providers and practitioners responsible for the patient's follow-up or ancillary care.
