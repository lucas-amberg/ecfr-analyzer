The REH must be constructed, arranged, and maintained to ensure the safety of the patient, and to provide facilities for diagnosis and treatment and for special services appropriate to the needs of the community.


(a) *Standard: Buildings.* The condition of the physical plant and the overall REH environment must be developed and maintained in such a manner that the safety and well-being of patients are ensured.

(2) There must be facilities for emergency gas and water supply.


(3) The REH must have a safe and sanitary environment, properly constructed, equipped, and maintained to protect the health and safety of patients.

(2) In consideration of a recommendation by the state survey agency or accrediting organization or at the discretion of the Secretary, CMS may waive, for periods deemed appropriate, specific provisions of the Life Safety Code, which would result in unreasonable hardship upon an REH, but only if the waiver will not adversely affect the health and safety of the patients.


(3) The provisions of the Life Safety Code do not apply in a state if CMS finds that a fire and safety code imposed by state law adequately protects patients in an REH.


(4) An REH may place alcohol-based hand rub dispensers in its facility if the dispensers are installed in a manner that adequately protects against inappropriate access.


(5) When a sprinkler system is shut down for more than 10 hours, the REH must:

(1) Chapters 7, 8, 12, and 13 of the adopted Health Care Facilities Code do not apply to an REH.


(2) If application of the Health Care Facilities Code required under paragraph (d) of this section would result in unreasonable hardship for the REH, CMS may waive specific provisions of the Health Care Facilities Code, but only if the waiver does not adversely affect the health and safety of patients.
