(4) The infection prevention and control program reflects the scope and complexity of the CAH services provided.


(b) *Standard: Antibiotic stewardship program organization and policies.* The CAH must demonstrate that:


(1) An individual (or individuals), who is qualified through education, training, or experience in infectious diseases and/or antibiotic stewardship, is appointed by the governing body, or responsible individual, as the leader(s) of the antibiotic stewardship program and that the appointment is based on the recommendations of medical staff leadership and pharmacy leadership;


(2) The facility-wide antibiotic stewardship program:


(i) Demonstrates coordination among all components of the CAH responsible for antibiotic use and resistance, including, but not limited to, the infection prevention and control program, the QAPI program, the medical staff, nursing services, and pharmacy services;


(ii) Documents the evidence-based use of antibiotics in all departments and services of the CAH; and


(iii) Documents any improvements, including sustained improvements, in proper antibiotic use;


(3) The antibiotic stewardship program adheres to nationally recognized guidelines, as well as best practices, for improving antibiotic use; and


(4) The antibiotic stewardship program reflects the scope and complexity of the CAH services provided.


(c) *Standard: Leadership responsibilities.* (1) The governing body, or responsible individual, must ensure all of the following:


(i) Systems are in place and operational for the tracking of all infection surveillance, prevention and control, and antibiotic use activities, in order to demonstrate the implementation, success, and sustainability of such activities.


(ii) All HAIs and other infectious diseases identified by the infection prevention and control program as well as antibiotic use issues identified by the antibiotic stewardship program are addressed in collaboration with the CAH's QAPI leadership.


(2) The infection prevention and control professional(s) is responsible for:


(i) The development and implementation of facility-wide infection surveillance, prevention, and control policies and procedures that adhere to nationally recognized guidelines.


(ii) All documentation, written or electronic, of the infection prevention and control program and its surveillance, prevention, and control activities.


(iii) Communication and collaboration with the CAH's QAPI program on infection prevention and control issues.


(iv) Competency-based training and education of CAH personnel and staff, including medical staff, and, as applicable, personnel providing contracted services in the CAH, on the practical applications of infection prevention and control guidelines, policies and procedures.


(v) The prevention and control of HAIs, including auditing of adherence to infection prevention and control policies and procedures by CAH personnel.


(vi) Communication and collaboration with the antibiotic stewardship program.


(3) The leader(s) of the antibiotic stewardship program is responsible for:


(i) The development and implementation of a facility-wide antibiotic stewardship program, based on nationally recognized guidelines, to monitor and improve the use of antibiotics.


(ii) All documentation, written or electronic, of antibiotic stewardship program activities.


(iii) Communication and collaboration with medical staff, nursing, and pharmacy leadership, as well as the CAH's infection prevention and control and QAPI programs, on antibiotic use issues.


(iv) Competency-based training and education of CAH personnel and staff, including medical staff, and, as applicable, personnel providing contracted services in the CAHs, on the practical applications of antibiotic stewardship guidelines, policies, and procedures.


(d) *Respiratory illness reporting*—(1) *Ongoing reporting.* The CAH must electronically report information on acute respiratory illnesses, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and RSV.


(i) The report must be in a standardized format and frequency specified by the Secretary.


(ii) To the extent as required by the Secretary, the report must include the following data elements:


(A) Confirmed infections for a limited set of respiratory illnesses, including but not limited to influenza, SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and RSV, among newly admitted and hospitalized patients.


(B) Total bed census and capacity, including for critical hospital units and age groups.


(C) Limited patient demographic information, including but not limited to age.


(2) *Public health emergency (PHE) reporting.* In the event that the Secretary has declared a national, State, or local PHE for an acute infectious illness, the CAH must also electronically report the following data elements in a standardized format and frequency specified by the Secretary:


(i) Supply inventory shortages.


(ii) Staffing shortages.


(iii) Relevant medical countermeasures and therapeutic inventories, usage, or both.


(iv) Facility structure and operating status, including CAH/ED diversion status.


(e)-(f) [Reserved]


(g) *Standard: Unified and integrated infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs for a CAH in a multi-facility system.* If a CAH is part of a system consisting of multiple separately certified hospitals, CAHs, and/or REHs using a system governing body that is legally responsible for the conduct of two or more hospitals, CAHs, and/or REHs, the system governing body can elect to have unified and integrated infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs for all of its member facilities after determining that such a decision is in accordance with all applicable state and local laws. The system governing body is responsible and accountable for ensuring that each of its separately certified CAHs meets all of the requirements of this section. Each separately certified CAH subject to the system governing body must demonstrate that:


(1) The unified and integrated infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs are established in a manner that takes into account each member CAH's unique circumstances and any significant differences in patient populations and services offered in each CAH;


(2) The unified and integrated infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure that the needs and concerns of each of its separately certified CAHs, regardless of practice or location, are given due consideration;


(3) The unified and integrated infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs have mechanisms in place to ensure that issues localized to particular CAHs are duly considered and addressed; and


(4) A qualified individual (or individuals) with expertise in infection prevention and control and in antibiotic stewardship has been designated at the CAH as responsible for communicating with the unified infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs, for implementing and maintaining the policies and procedures governing infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship as directed by the unified infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs, and for providing education and training on the practical applications of infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship to CAH staff.
