The record must include, at a minimum, information identifying the donor (for example, name, address, date of birth, social security number or other unique identifier, such as Medicare health insurance claim number), organs and (when applicable) tissues recovered, date of the organ recovery, donor management data, all test results, current hospital history, past medical and social history, the pronouncement of death, and consent and next-of-kin information.


(b) *Disposition of organs.* The OPO must maintain records showing the disposition of each organ recovered for the purpose of transplantation, including information identifying transplant beneficiaries.


(c) *Data retention.* Donor and transplant beneficiary records must be maintained in a human readable and reproducible paper or electronic format for 7 years.


(d) *Format of records.* The OPO must maintain data in a format that can readily be transferred to a successor OPO and in the event of a transfer must provide to CMS copies of all records, data, and software necessary to ensure uninterrupted service by a successor OPO. Records and data subject to this requirement include donor and transplant beneficiary records and procedural manuals and other materials used in conducting OPO operations.
