# ยง 488.7   Release and use of accreditation surveys.

A Medicare participating provider or supplier deemed to meet program requirements in accordance with ยง 488.4 must authorize its accrediting organization to release to CMS a copy of its most current accreditation survey and any information related to the survey that CMS may require (including, but not limited to, corrective action plans).


(a) CMS may determine that a provider or supplier does not meet the applicable Medicare conditions or requirements on the basis of its own investigation of the accreditation survey or any other information related to the survey.


(b) With the exception of home health agency and hospice program surveys, general disclosure of an accrediting organization's survey information is prohibited under section 1865(b) of the Act. CMS may publicly disclose an accreditation survey and information related to the survey, upon written request, to the extent that the accreditation survey and survey information are related to an enforcement action taken by CMS.


(c) CMS posts inspection reports from a State or local survey agency or accrediting organization conducted on or after October 1, 2022, for hospice programs, including copies of a hospice program's survey deficiencies, and enforcement actions (for example, involuntary terminations) taken as a result of such surveys, on its public website in a manner that is prominent, easily accessible, readily understandable, and searchable for the general public and allows for timely updates.
