An abbreviated standard survey may be premised on complaints received; a change of ownership, management, or director of nursing; or other indicators of specific concern.

Other premises for abbreviated standard surveys would follow the requirements of § 488.314.

Instances of abuse of all residents, irrespective of any mental or physical condition, cause physical harm, pain or mental anguish. It includes verbal abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and mental abuse including abuse facilitated or enabled through the use of technology. *Willful,* as used in this definition of abuse, means the individual must have acted deliberately, not that the individual must have intended to inflict injury or harm.
