(2) If the facility fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, CMS does and the State must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last day of the survey, if the immediate jeopardy is not removed. In these cases, State monitoring may be imposed pending termination.

(2) CMS will or the State must do one or both of the following:


(i) Take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the noncompliance through temporary management.

(e) If the immediate jeopardy is also substandard quality of care, the State survey agency must notify attending physicians and the State board responsible for licensing the facility administrator of the finding of substandard quality of care, as specified in ยง 488.325(h).
