# § 488.418   Secretarial authority to deny all payments.

(a) *CMS option to deny all payment.* If a facility has not met a requirement, in addition to the authority to deny payment for all new admissions as specified in § 488.417, CMS may deny any further payment for all Medicare residents in the facility and to the State for all Medicaid residents in the facility. 


(b) *Prospective resumption of payment.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, if the facility achieves substantial compliance, CMS resumes payment prospectively from the date that it verifies as the date that the facility achieved substantial compliance. 


(c) *Restriction on payment after denial of payment is imposed.* If payment to the facility or to the State resumes after denial of payment for all residents, no payment is made for the period between the date that—


(1) Denial of payment was imposed; and 


(2) CMS verifies as the date that the facility achieved substantial compliance. 


(d) *Retroactive resumption of payment.* Except when a facility has repeated instances of substandard quality of care, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, when CMS or the State finds that the facility was in substantial compliance before the date of the revisit, or before CMS or the survey agency received credible evidence of such compliance, payment is resumed on the date that substantial compliance was achieved, as determined by CMS. 


(e) *Resumption of payment—repeated instances of substandard care.* When CMS denies payment for all Medicare residents for repeated instances of substandard quality of care, payment is resumed when—


(1) The facility achieved substantial compliance, as indicated by a revisit or written credible evidence acceptable to CMS; and 


(2) CMS believes that the facility will remain in substantial compliance.
