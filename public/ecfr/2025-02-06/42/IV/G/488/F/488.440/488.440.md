(b) The per day civil money penalty is computed and collectible, as specified in §§ 488.431, 488.432, and 488.442 for the number of days of noncompliance until the date the facility achieves substantial compliance, or, if applicable, the date of termination when —

(f) *Accrual of penalties when there is no immediate jeopardy.* (1) In the case of noncompliance that does not pose immediate jeopardy, the daily accrual of per day civil money penalties is imposed for the days of noncompliance prior to the notice specified in § 488.434 and an additional period of no longer than 6 months following the last day of the survey.


(2) After the period specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, if the facility has not achieved substantial compliance, CMS terminates the provider agreement and the State may terminate the provider agreement.
