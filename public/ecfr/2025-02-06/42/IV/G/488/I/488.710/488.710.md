# ยง 488.710   Standard surveys.

(a) For each HHA, the survey agency must conduct a standard survey not later than 36 months after the date of the previous standard survey that includes, but is not limited to, all of the following (to the extent practicable):


(1) A case-mix stratified sample of individuals furnished items or services by the HHA.


(2) Visits to the homes of patients, (the purpose of the home visit is to evaluate the extent to which the quality and scope of services furnished by the HHA attained and maintained the highest practicable functional capacity of each patient as reflected in the patient's written plan of care and clinical records), but only with their consent, and, if determined necessary by CMS or the survey team, other forms of communication with patients including telephone calls.


(3) Review of indicators that include the outcomes of quality care and services furnished by the agency as indicated by medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care.


(4) Review of compliance with a select number of regulations most related to high-quality patient care.


(b) The survey agency's failure to follow the procedures set forth in this section will not invalidate otherwise legitimate determinations that deficiencies exist at an HHA.
