(a) *Basic rule.* All HHA surveys must be unannounced and conducted with procedures and scheduling that renders the onsite surveys as unpredictable in their timing as possible.


(b) *State survey agency's scheduling and surveying procedures.* CMS reviews each survey agency's scheduling and surveying procedures and practices to assure that the survey agency has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of a survey through the scheduling procedures and conduct of the surveys.


(c) *Civil money penalties.* Any individual who notifies an HHA, or causes an HHA to be notified, of the time or date on which a standard survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a Federal civil money penalty not to exceed $2,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102.
