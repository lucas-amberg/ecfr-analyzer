# ยง 488.745   Informal Dispute Resolution (IDR).

(a) *Opportunity to refute survey findings.* Upon the provider's receipt of an official statement of deficiencies, HHAs are afforded the option to request an informal opportunity to dispute condition-level survey findings.


(b) *Failure to conduct IDR timely.* Failure of CMS or the State, as appropriate, to complete IDR shall not delay the effective date of any enforcement action.


(c) *Revised statement of deficiencies as a result of IDR.* If any findings are revised or removed by CMS or the State based on IDR, the official statement of deficiencies is revised accordingly and any enforcement actions imposed solely as a result of those cited deficiencies are adjusted accordingly.


(d) *Notification.* When the survey findings indicate a condition-level deficiency, CMS or the State, as appropriate, must provide the agency with written notification of the opportunity for participating in an IDR process at the time the official statement of deficiencies is issued. The request for IDR must be submitted in writing to the State or CMS, must include the specific deficiencies that are disputed, and must be made within the same 10 calendar day period that the HHA has for submitting an acceptable plan of correction.
