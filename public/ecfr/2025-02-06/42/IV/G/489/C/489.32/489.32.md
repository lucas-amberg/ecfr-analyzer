# § 489.32   Allowable charges: Noncovered and partially covered services.

(a) *Services requested by beneficiary.* If services furnished at the request of a beneficiary (or his or her representative) are more expensive than, or in excess of, services covered under Medicare—


(1) A provider may charge the beneficiary an amount that does not exceed the difference between—


(i) The provider's customary charges for the services furnished; and 


(ii) The provider's customary charges for the kinds and amounts of services that are covered under Medicare. 


(2) A provider may not charge for the services unless they have been requested by the beneficiary (or his or her representative) nor require a beneficiary to request services as a condition of admission. 


(3) To avoid misunderstanding and disputes, a provider must inform any beneficiary who requests a service for which a charge will be made that there will be a specified charge for that service. 


(b) *Services not requested by the beneficiary.* For special provisions that apply when a provider customarily furnishes more expensive services, see § 413.35 of this chapter.
