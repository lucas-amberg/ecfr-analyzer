# § 489.62   Requirement waived for Government-operated HHAs.

An HHA operated by a Federal, State, local, or tribal government agency is deemed to have provided CMS with a comparable surety bond under State law, and CMS therefore waives the requirements of this subpart with respect to such an HHA if, during the preceding 5 years the HHA has—


(a) Not had any unpaid claims or unpaid civil money penalties or assessments; and


(b) Not had any of its claims referred by CMS to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office in accordance with part 401 of this chapter.
