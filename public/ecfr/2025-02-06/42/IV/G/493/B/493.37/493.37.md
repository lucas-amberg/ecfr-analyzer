# § 493.37   Requirements for a certificate of waiver.

(a) HHS will issue a certificate of waiver to a laboratory only if the laboratory meets the requirements of § 493.35.

(3) For laboratories receiving payment from the Medicare or Medicaid program, such payments will be suspended on the effective date specified in the notice to the laboratory of a non-compliance determination even if there has been no appeals decision issued.
