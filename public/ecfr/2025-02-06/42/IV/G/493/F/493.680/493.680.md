# § 493.680   Methodology for determining the biennial fee increase.

(a) *General rule.* Except for fees assessed to State laboratory programs approved by HHS, the fee amounts described in this subpart are subject to a biennial increase based on a two-part calculation of the Consumer Price Index—Urban (CPI-U) inflation adjustment and, if applicable, an additional increase as follows:


(1) CMS calculates the inflation rate using the compounded CPI-U over 2 years and, provided that the calculated rate is greater than zero, applies an increase to all fee amounts equal to the calculated rate.


(2) If the total fee amounts, including any increase applied under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, do not match or exceed actual program obligations based on a review of the previous 2 years' obligations, CMS applies an additional across the board increase to each laboratory's fees by calculating the difference between the total fee amounts and actual program obligations.


(b) *Baseline.* Any increase applied under paragraph (a) of this section is incorporated into the baseline fee amounts for any subsequent biennial increase.


(c) *Publication.* Any increase applied under paragraph (a) of this section, including the calculation thereof, will be published as a notice in the _Federal Register_.
