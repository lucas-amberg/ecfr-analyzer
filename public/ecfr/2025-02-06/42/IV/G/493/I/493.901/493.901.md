# § 493.901   Approval of proficiency testing programs.

In order for a proficiency testing program to receive HHS approval, the program must be offered by a private nonprofit organization or a Federal or State agency, or entity acting as a designated agent for the State. An organization, Federal, or State program seeking approval or reapproval for its program for the next calendar year must submit an application providing the required information by July 1 of the current year. The organization, Federal, or State program must provide technical assistance to laboratories seeking to qualify under the program, and must, for each specialty, subspecialty, and analyte or test for which it provides testing—


(a) Require a minimum of 10 laboratory participants for each specialty, subspecialty, and analyte or test for which the proficiency testing program is seeking reapproval;


(b) Assure the quality of test samples, appropriately evaluate and score the testing results, and identify performance problems in a timely manner;


(c) Demonstrate to HHS that it has—


(1) The technical ability required to—


(i) Prepare or purchase samples from manufacturers who prepare the samples in conformance with the appropriate good manufacturing practices required in 21 CFR parts 606, 640, and 820; and


(ii) Distribute the samples, using rigorous quality control to assure that samples mimic actual patient specimens when possible and that samples are homogeneous, except for specific subspecialties such as cytology, and will be stable within the time frame for analysis by proficiency testing participants;


(2) A scientifically defensible process for determining the correct result for each challenge offered by the program;


(3) A program of sufficient annual challenge and with the frequency specified in §§ 493.909 through 493.959 to establish that a laboratory has met minimum performance requirements;


(4) The resources needed to provide Statewide or nationwide reports to regulatory agencies on individual's performance for gynecologic cytology and on individual laboratory performance on testing events, cumulative reports and scores for each laboratory or individual, and reports of specific laboratory failures using grading criteria acceptable to HHS. These reports must be provided to HHS on a timely basis when requested;


(5) Provisions to include on each proficiency testing program report form used by the laboratory to record testing event results, an attestation statement that proficiency testing samples were tested in the same manner as patient specimens with a signature block to be completed by the individual performing the test as well as by the laboratory director; 


(6) A mechanism for notifying participants of the PT shipping schedule and for participants to notify the proficiency testing program within three days of the expected date of receipt of the shipment that samples have not arrived or are unacceptable for testing. The program must have provisions for replacement of samples that are lost in transit or are received in a condition that is unacceptable for testing; and


(7) A process to resolve technical, administrative, and scientific problems about program operations; and


(8) A contractor performing technical and scientific responsibilities as described in this section and § 493.903 (including, but not limited to, processes for selecting appropriate target values to be included in challenges as part of the annual PT program or grading PT results, determining target values, reporting scores to CMS, and determining organisms included in microbiology PT samples) must be a private nonprofit organization or a Federal or State agency, or an entity acting as a designated agent for the Federal or State agency.


(d) Meet the specific criteria for proficiency testing programs listed by specialty, subspecialty, and analyte or test contained in §§ 493.901 through 493.959 for initial approval and thereafter provide HHS, on an annual basis, with the information necessary to assure that the proficiency testing program meets the criteria required for approval; and


(e) HHS may require on-site visits for all initial proficiency testing program applications for CMS approval and periodically or when problems are encountered for previously HHS-approved proficiency testing programs either during the reapproval process or as necessary to review and verify the policies and procedures represented in its application and other information, including, but not limited to, review and examination of documents and interviews of staff.


(f) HHS may require a proficiency testing program to reapply for approval using the process for initial applications if significant problems are encountered during the reapproval process.
