# § 493.1814   Action when deficiencies are at the condition level but do not pose immediate jeopardy.

If a laboratory has condition level deficiencies that do not pose immediate jeopardy, the following rules apply:


(a) *Initial action.* (1) CMS may cancel the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its services.


(2) CMS may suspend, limit, or revoke the laboratory's CLIA certificate.


(3) If CMS does not impose a principal sanction under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, it imposes one or more alternative sanctions. In the case of unsuccessful participation in proficiency testing, CMS may impose the training and technical assistance requirement set forth at § 493.1838 in lieu of, or in addition to, one or more alternative sanctions.


(b) *Failure to correct condition level deficiencies.* If CMS imposes alternative sanctions for condition level deficiencies that do not pose immediate jeopardy, and the laboratory does not correct the condition level deficiencies within 12 months after the last day of inspection, CMS—


(1) Cancels the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare payment for its services, and discontinues the Medicare payment sanctions as of the day cancellation is effective.


(2) Following a revisit which indicates that the laboratory has not corrected its condition level deficiencies, notifies the laboratory that it proposes to suspend, limit, or revoke the certificate, as specified in § 493.1816(b), and the laboratory's right to hearing; and


(3) May impose (or continue, if already imposed) any alternative sanctions that do not pertain to Medicare payments. (Sanctions imposed under the authority of section 353 of the PHS Act may continue for more than 12 months from the last date of inspection, while a hearing on the proposed suspension, limitation, or revocation of the certificate of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures is pending.) 


(c) *Action after hearing.* If a hearing decision upholds a proposed suspension, limitation, or revocation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate, CMS discontinues any alternative sanctions as of the day it makes the suspension, limitation, or revocation effective.
