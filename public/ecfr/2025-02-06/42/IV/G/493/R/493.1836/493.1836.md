# ยง 493.1836   State onsite monitoring.

(a) *Application.* (1) CMS may require continuous or intermittent monitoring of a plan of correction by the State survey agency to ensure that the laboratory makes the improvements necessary to bring it into compliance with the condition level requirements. (The State monitor does not have management authority, that is, cannot hire or fire staff, obligate funds, or otherwise dictate how the laboratory operates. The monitor's responsibility is to oversee whether corrections are made.)


(2) The laboratory must pay the costs of onsite monitoring by the State survey agency.


(i) The costs are computed by multiplying the number of hours of onsite monitoring in the laboratory by the hourly rate negotiated by CMS and the State.


(ii) The hourly rate includes salary, fringe benefits, travel, and other direct and indirect costs approved by CMS.


(b) *Procedures.* Before imposing this sanction, CMS provides notice of sanction and opportunity to respond in accordance with ยง 493.1810.


(c) *Duration of sanction.* (1) If CMS imposes onsite monitoring, the sanction continues until CMS determines that the laboratory has the capability to ensure compliance with all condition level requirements.


(2) If the laboratory does not correct all deficiencies within 12 months, and a revisit indicates that deficiencies remain, CMS cancels the laboratory's approval for Medicare payment for its services and notifies the laboratory of its intent to suspend, limit, or revoke the laboratory's certificate of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures. 


(3) If the laboratory still does not correct its deficiencies, the Medicare sanction continues until the suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's certificate of compliance, registration certificate, certificate of accreditation, or certificate for PPM procedures is effective.
