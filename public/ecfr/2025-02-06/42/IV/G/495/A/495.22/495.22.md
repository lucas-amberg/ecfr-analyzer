(b) *Criteria for EPs for 2015 through 2018*—(1) *General rule regarding criteria for meaningful use for 2015 through 2018 for EPs.* Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, EPs must meet all objectives and associated measures of the meaningful use criteria specified under paragraph (e) of this section to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user.


(2) *Exclusion for non-applicable objectives.* (i) An EP may exclude a particular objective contained in paragraph (e) of this section, if the EP meets all of the following requirements:

(B) Meets the criteria in the applicable objective that would permit the attestation to the exclusion.


(C) Attests.


(ii) An exclusion will reduce (by the number of exclusions applicable) the number of objectives that would otherwise apply in paragraph (e) of this section.


(c) *Criteria for eligible hospitals and CAHs for 2015 through 2018*—(1) *General rule regarding criteria for meaningful use for 2015 through 2018 for eligible hospitals and CAHs.* Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, eligible hospitals and CAHs attesting to CMS must meet all objectives and associated measures of the meaningful use criteria specified under paragraph (e) of this section to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user in 2015 and 2016 and must meet all objectives and associated measures of the meaningful use criteria specified under paragraph (f) of this section to meet the definition of a meaningful EHR user in 2017 and 2018.

A patient's record is maintained using CEHRT if sufficient data were entered in the CEHRT to allow the record to be saved, and not rejected due to incomplete data.


(2) If the objective and associated measure does not reference this paragraph (d) of this section, then the measure must be calculated by reviewing all patient records, not just those maintained using CEHRT.


(e) *Meaningful use objectives and measures for EPs for 2015 through 2018, for eligible hospitals and CAHs attesting to CMS for 2015 and 2016, and for eligible hospitals and CAHs attesting to a State for the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program for 2015 through 2018.*—(1) *Protect patient health information*—(i) *Objective.* Protect electronic protected health information created or maintained by the CEHRT through the implementation of appropriate technical capabilities.
