# § 498.56   Hearing on new issues.

(a) *Basic rules.* (1) Within the time limits specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the ALJ may, at the request of either party, or on his or her own motion, provide a hearing on new issues that impinge on the rights of the affected party.


(2) Except for provider or supplier enrollment appeals which are addressed in § 498.56(e), the ALJ may consider new issues even if CMS or the OIG has not made initial or reconsidered determinations on them, and even if they arose after the request for hearing was filed or after the prehearing conference.


(3) The ALJ may give notice of hearing on new issues at any time after the hearing request is filed and before the hearing record is closed.


(b) *Time limits.* The ALJ will not consider any issue that arose on or after any of the following dates:


(1) The effective date of the termination of a provider agreement.


(2) The date on which it is determined that a supplier no longer meets the conditions for coverage of its services.


(3) The effective date of the notice to a hospital of its failure to remain in compliance with the qualifications for claiming reimbursement for all emergency services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during the calendar year.


(4) The effective date of the suspension, or of the exclusion from coverage of services furnished by a suspended or excluded practitioner, provider, or supplier.


(5) With respect to Medicaid SNFs or ICFs surveyed under section 1910(c) of the Act— 


(i) The completion date of the survey or resurvey that is the basis for a proposed cancellation of approval; or 


(ii) If approval was cancelled before the hearings, because of immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, the effective date of cancellation.


(c) *Notice and conduct of hearing on new issues.* (1) Unless the affected party waives its right to appear and present evidence, notice of the time and place of hearing on any new issue will be given to the parties in accordance with § 498.52.


(2) After giving notice, the ALJ will, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, proceed to hearing on new issues in the same manner as on an issue raised in the request for hearing.


(d) *Remand to CMS or the OIG.* At the request of either party, or on his or her own motion, in lieu of a hearing under paragraph (c) of this section, the ALJ may remand the case to CMS or the OIG for consideration of the new issue and, if appropriate, a determination. If necessary, the ALJ may direct CMS or the OIG to return the case to the ALJ for further proceedings.


(e) *Provider and supplier enrollment appeals: Good cause requirement*—(1) *Examination of any new documentary evidence.* After a hearing is requested but before it is held, the ALJ will examine any new documentary evidence submitted to the ALJ by a provider or supplier to determine whether the provider or supplier has good cause for submitting the evidence for the first time at the ALJ level.


(2) *Determining if good cause exists*—(i) *If good cause exists.* If the ALJ finds that there is good cause for submitting new documentary evidence for the first time at the ALJ level, the ALJ must include evidence and may consider it in reaching a decision.


(ii) *If good cause does not exist.* If the ALJ determines that there was not good cause for submitting the evidence for the first time at the ALJ level, the ALJ must exclude the evidence from the proceeding and may not consider it in reaching a decision.


(2) *Notification to all parties.* As soon as possible, but no later than the start of the hearing, the ALJ must notify all parties of any evidence that is excluded from the hearing.
