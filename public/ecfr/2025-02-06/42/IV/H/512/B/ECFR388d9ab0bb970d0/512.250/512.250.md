(i) In Maryland, Vermont, or any of the U.S. Territories;


(ii) In the inpatient setting;


(iii) By an entity classified as an ASC, CAH, or PPS-exempt cancer hospital; or


(iv) By an HOPD participating in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model at the time the RT service was furnished.


(2) CMS excludes the following episodes from the determination of the national base rates:


(i) Episodes that are not linked to a CBSA selected for participation in the RO Model;


(ii) Episodes that are not attributed to an RT provider or RT supplier;


(iii) Episodes that are not assigned an included cancer type; or

(3) CMS calculates the episode amount CMS paid on average to RT providers and RT suppliers for the PC and TC for each of the included cancer types in the HOPD setting, creating the RO Model's national base rates.
