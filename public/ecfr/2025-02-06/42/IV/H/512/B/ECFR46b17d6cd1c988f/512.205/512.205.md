For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:

*Baseline period* means the three calendar year period that begins on January 1 no fewer than five years but no more than six years prior to the start of the model performance period during which episodes must initiate in order to be used in the calculation of the national base rates, each RO participant's historical experience adjustment for the PC or TC or both for the model performance period, and the RO participant's case mix adjustment for the PC or TC or both for PY1. The baseline period is January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, unless the RO Model is prohibited by law from starting in calendar year (CY) 2022, in which case the baseline period will be delayed based on the new model performance period (for example, if the model performance period starts any time in CY 2023, then the baseline period would be CY 2018 through CY 2020).


*Blend* means the weight given to an RO participant's historical experience adjustment relative to the geographically-adjusted trended national base rate in the calculation of its participant-specific episode payment amounts.


*CAH* means Critical Access Hospital.
