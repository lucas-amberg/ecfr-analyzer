(a) *Selected participants.* All Medicare-certified ESRD facilities and Medicare-enrolled Managing Clinicians located in a selected geographic area are required to participate in the ETC Model.


(b) *Selected Geographic Areas.* CMS establishes the Selected Geographic Areas by selecting all HRRs for which at least 20 percent of the component zip codes are located in Maryland, and a random sample of 30 percent of HRRs, stratified by Census-defined regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West). CMS excludes all U.S. Territories from the Selected Geographic Areas.
