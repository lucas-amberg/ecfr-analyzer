# § 512.422   Overview of performance assessment and scoring.

(a) *General.* (1) CMS establishes the performances measures described in §§ 512.424, 512.426, and 512.428 to assess IOTA participants in the achievement domain, efficiency domain and quality domain.


(2) CMS assigns each set of metrics within a domain a point value with the total possible points awarded to an IOTA participant across the three domains equaling 100, as described in §§ 512.424, 512.426, and 512.428.


(b) *Data sources.* (1) CMS uses Medicare claims data and Medicare administrative data about beneficiaries, providers, suppliers, and data from the OPTN, to calculate performance for the IOTA participant based on the methodologies under §§ 512.424, 512.426, and 512.428.


(2) CMS may also use model-specific data reported by an IOTA participant to CMS under the IOTA Model to calculate IOTA participant performance in the domains.
