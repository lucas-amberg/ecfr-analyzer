# § 512.550   Reconciliation process and determination of the reconciliation payment or repayment amount.

(a) *General.* Providers and suppliers furnishing items and services included in the episode bill for such items and services in accordance with existing Medicare rules.


(b) *Reconciliation process.* Six months after the end of each performance year, CMS does the following:


(1) Performs a reconciliation calculation to establish a reconciliation payment or repayment amount for each TEAM participant.


(2) For TEAM participants that experience a reorganization event in which one or more hospitals reorganize under the CCN of a TEAM participant, performs—


(i) Separate reconciliation calculations for each predecessor TEAM participant for episodes where the anchor hospitalization admission or the anchor procedure occurred before the effective date of the reorganization event; and


(ii) Reconciliation calculations for each new or surviving TEAM participant for episodes where the anchor hospitalization admission or anchor procedure occurred on or after the effective date of the reorganization event.


(c) *Calculation of the reconciliation amount.* CMS compares the reconciliation target prices described in § 512.545 and the TEAM participant's performance year spending to establish a reconciliation amount for the TEAM participant for each performance year as follows:


(1) CMS determines the performance year spending for each episode included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 512.537(b)) using claims data that is available 6 months after the end of the performance year.


(2) CMS calculates and applies the high-cost outlier cap for performance year episode spending by applying the calculation described in § 512.540(b)(4) to performance year episode spending.


(3) CMS applies the adjustments specified in § 512.545 to the preliminary target prices computed in accordance with § 512.540 to calculate the reconciliation target prices.


(4) CMS aggregates the reconciliation target prices computed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for all episodes included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 512.537(b)).


(5) CMS subtracts the performance year spending amount determined under paragraph (c)(1-2) of this section from the aggregated reconciliation target price amount determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to determine the reconciliation amount.


(d) *Calculation of the quality-adjusted reconciliation amount.* CMS adjusts the reconciliation amount based on the Composite Quality Score as follows:


(1) CMS calculates a CQS adjustment percentage based on a TEAM participant's CQS, computed in accordance with § 512.547(b).


(i) CMS applies a CQS adjustment percentage up to 10 percent for positive reconciliation amounts for TEAM participants in Track 1.


(ii) CMS applies a CQS adjustment percentage up to 10 percent for positive reconciliation amounts and up to 15 percent for negative reconciliation amounts for TEAM participants in Track 2.


(iii) CMS applies a CQS adjustment percentage up to 10 percent for positive reconciliation amounts and up to 10 percent for negative reconciliation amounts for TEAM participants in Track 3.


(2) CMS multiplies the CQS adjustment percentage, computed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, by the TEAM participant's positive or negative reconciliation amount calculated in paragraph (c) of this section to construct the CQS adjustment amount.


(3) CMS subtracts the CQS adjustment amount, computed from paragraph (d)(2) of this section, from the positive or negative reconciliation amount calculated in paragraph (c) of this section to construct the quality-adjusted reconciliation amount.


(e) *Calculation of the net payment reconciliation amount (NPRA).* CMS applies stop-loss and stop gain limits to the quality-adjusted reconciliation amount computed in paragraph (d) of this section to calculate the NPRA as follows:


(1) *Limitation on loss.* For TEAM participants in Track 3, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the repayment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 20 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year. The post-episode spending calculation amount in paragraph (f) of this section is not subject to the limitation on loss.


(2) *Limitation on gain.* (i) For TEAM participants in Track 1, the reconciliation payment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 10 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year.


(ii) For TEAM participants in Tracks 2, the reconciliation payment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 5 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year.


(iii) For TEAM participants in Track 3, the reconciliation payment amount for a performance year cannot exceed 20 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the performance year.


(iv) The post-episode spending amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section is not subject to the limitation on gain.


(3) *Limitation on loss for certain providers.* For performance years 2-5, the repayment amount for a TEAM participant in Track 2 defined at § 512.505, must not exceed 5 percent of the aggregated reconciliation target price amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(f) *Post-episode spending calculation.* CMS calculates the post-episode spending amount as follows: If the average post-episode spending amount for a TEAM participant in the performance year being reconciled is greater than 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode spending amount for the performance year, then the post-episode spending amount that exceeds 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode spending amount for the performance year is subtracted from the NPRA for that performance year.


(g) *Calculation of the reconciliation payment or repayment amount.* (1) CMS applies the results of the post-episode spending calculation set forth in paragraph (f) of this section to the NPRA as follows:


(i) For TEAM participants whose post-episode spending amount does not exceed the limit calculated in paragraph (f) of this section, the reconciliation payment or repayment amount is equal to the NPRA.


(ii) If the TEAM participant's post-episode spending exceeds the limit calculated in paragraph (f) of this section, CMS subtracts the amount of post-episode spending exceeding the limit from the NPRA to calculate the reconciliation payment or repayment amount.


(2) If the amount calculated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is positive, the TEAM participant is owed a reconciliation payment in that amount, to be paid by CMS in one lump sum payment.


(3) If the amount calculated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is negative, CMS determines the repayment amount as follows:


(i) For TEAM participants in Track 1, the TEAM participant does not owe a repayment amount.


(ii) For TEAM participants in Track 2 or Track 3 for Performance Years 1-5, as applicable, the Team participant owes that amount as a repayment to CMS.


(h) *TEAM reconciliation report.* CMS issues each TEAM participant a TEAM reconciliation report for the performance year. Each TEAM reconciliation report contains the following:


(1) The total performance year spending for the TEAM participant.


(2) The TEAM participant's reconciliation target prices.


(3) The TEAM participant's reconciliation amount.


(4) The TEAM participant's composite quality score calculated in accordance with § 512.547(b).


(5) The TEAM participant's quality-adjusted reconciliation amount.


(6) The stop-loss and stop-gain limits that apply to the TEAM participant.


(7) The TEAM participant's NPRA.


(8) The TEAM participant's post-episode spending amount, if applicable.


(9) The amount of any reconciliation payment owed to the TEAM participant or repayment owed by the TEAM participant to CMS for the performance year, if applicable.
