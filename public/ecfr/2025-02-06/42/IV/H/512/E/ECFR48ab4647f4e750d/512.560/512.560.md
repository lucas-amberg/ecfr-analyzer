# ยง 512.560   Appeals process.

(a) *Notice of calculation error (first level of appeal).* Subject to the limitations on review in ยง 512.594, if a TEAM participant wishes to dispute calculations involving a matter related to payment, reconciliation amounts, repayment amounts, the use of quality measure results in determining the composite quality score, or the application of the composite quality score during reconciliation, the TEAM participant is required to provide written notice of the calculation error, in a form and manner and by a date specified by CMS.


(1) Unless the TEAM participant provides such written notice, CMS deems the TEAM reconciliation report to be final 30 calendar days after it is issued and proceeds with the payment or repayment processes as applicable.


(2) If CMS receives a notice of a calculation error within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the TEAM reconciliation report, CMS responds in writing within 30 calendar days to either confirm that there was an error in the calculation or verify that the calculation is correct. CMS reserves the right to extend the time for its response upon written notice to the TEAM participant.


(3) Only TEAM participants may use the calculation error process described in this part.


(b) *Exception to the appeals process.* If the TEAM participant contests a matter that does not involve an issue contained in, or a calculation that contributes to, a TEAM reconciliation report, a notice of calculation error is not required. In these instances, if CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the TEAM participant within 10 calendar days of the notice of the initial reconciliation, the initial determination is deemed final and CMS proceeds with the action indicated in the initial determination. This does not apply to the limitations on review in ยง 512.594.
