*Reasonable request* means a written request made by a properly identified agent of the Secretary, of a State survey agency or of another authorized entity, during hours that the facility, agency or institution is open for business. 


The request will include a statement of the authority for the request, the rights of the entity in responding to the request, the definition of *reasonable request* and *immediate access,* and the penalties for failure to comply, including when the exclusion will take effect. 


(3) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv) of this section, the term—


*Failure to grant immediate access* means—


(i) The failure to produce or make available for inspection and copying the requested material upon reasonable request, or to provide a compelling reason why they cannot be produced, within 24 hours of such request, except when the OIG or State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) reasonably believes that the requested material is about to be altered or destroyed, or

*Reasonable request* means a written request, signed by a designated representative of the OIG or MFCU and made by a properly identified agent of the OIG or an MFCU during reasonable business hours, where there is information to suggest that the person has violated statutory or regulatory requirements under Titles V, XI, XVIII, XIX, or XX of the Act. The request will include a statement of the authority for the request, the person's rights in responding to the request, the definition of “reasonable request” and “failure to grant immediate access” under part 1001, and the effective date, length, and scope and effect of the exclusion that would be imposed for failure to comply with the request, and the earliest date that a request for reinstatement would be considered.


(4) Nothing in this section shall in any way limit access otherwise authorized under State or Federal law. 


(b) *Length of exclusion.* (1) An exclusion of an individual under this section may be for a period equal to the sum of: 


(i) The length of the period during which the immediate access was not granted, and 


(ii) An additional period of up to 90 days. 


(2) The exclusion of an entity may be for a longer period than the period in which immediate access was not granted based on consideration of the following factors—


(i) The impact of the failure to grant the requested immediate access on Medicare or any of the State health care programs, beneficiaries or the public; 


(ii) The circumstances under which such access was refused; 


(iii) The impact of the exclusion on Medicare, Medicaid or any of the other Federal health care programs, beneficiaries or the public; and 


(iv) Whether the entity has a documented history of criminal, civil or administrative wrongdoing (The lack of any prior record is to be considered neutral).


(3) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the length of the period in which immediate access was not granted will be measured from the time the request is made, or from the time by which access was required to be granted, whichever is later. 


(c) The exclusion will be effective as of the date immediate access was not granted.
