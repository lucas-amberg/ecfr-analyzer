# § 1002.215   Action on request for reinstatement.

(a) The State agency may grant reinstatement only if it is reasonably certain that the types of actions that formed the basis for the original exclusion have not recurred and will not recur. In making this determination, the agency will consider, in addition to any factors set forth in State law—


(1) The conduct of the individual or entity occurring prior to the date of the notice of exclusion, if not known to the agency at the time of the exclusion; 


(2) The conduct of the individual or entity after the date of the notice of exclusion; and 


(3) Whether all fines, and all debts due and owing (including overpayments) to any Federal, State or local government that relate to Medicare or any of the State health care programs, have been paid, or satisfactory arrangements have been made, that fulfill these obligations. 


(b) Notice of action on request for reinstatement. (1) If the State agency approves the request for reinstatement, it must give written notice to the excluded party, and to all others who were informed of the exclusion in accordance with § 1002.212, specifying the date on which Medicaid program participation may resume. 


(2) If the State agency does not approve the request for reinstatement, it will notify the excluded party of its decision. Any appeal of a denial of reinstatement will be in accordance with State procedures and need not be subject to administrative or judicial review, unless required by State law.
