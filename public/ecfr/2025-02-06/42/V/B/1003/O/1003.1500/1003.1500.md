The notice will include—

(2) A description of the violation for which the penalty, assessment, and exclusion are proposed (except in cases in which the OIG is relying upon statistical sampling in accordance with § 1003.1580, in which case the notice shall describe those claims and requests for payment constituting the sample upon which the OIG is relying and will briefly describe the statistical sampling technique used by the OIG);

(6) Instructions for responding to the notice, including—


(i) A specific statement of the respondent's right to a hearing and


(ii) A statement that failure to request a hearing within 60 days permits the imposition of the proposed penalty, assessment, and exclusion without right of appeal; and


(7) In the case of a notice sent to a respondent who has an agreement under section 1866 of the Act, the notice also indicates that the imposition of an exclusion may result in the termination of the respondent's provider agreement in accordance with section 1866(b)(2)(C) of the Act.


(b) Any person upon whom the OIG has proposed the imposition of a penalty, an assessment, or an exclusion may appeal such proposed penalty, assessment, or exclusion to the Departmental Appeals Board in accordance with 42 CFR 1005.2. The provisions of 42 CFR part 1005 govern such appeals.
