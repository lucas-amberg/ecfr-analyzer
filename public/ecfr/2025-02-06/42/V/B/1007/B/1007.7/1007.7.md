# ยง 1007.7   Prosecutorial authority requirements of Unit.

A Unit must be organized according to one of the following three options related to a Unit's prosecutorial authority:


(a) The Unit is in the office of the State Attorney General or another department of State government that has statewide authority to prosecute individuals for violations of criminal laws with respect to fraud and patient or resident abuse or neglect in the provision or administration of medical assistance under a State plan implementing Title XIX of the Act.


(b) If there is no State agency with statewide authority and capability for criminal fraud or patient or resident abuse or neglect prosecutions, the Unit has established formal written procedures ensuring that the Unit refers suspected cases of criminal fraud in the State Medicaid program or of patient or resident abuse and neglect to the appropriate prosecuting authority or authorities, and coordinates with and assists such authority or authorities in the prosecution of such cases.


(c) The Unit has a formal working relationship with the office of the State Attorney General, or another office with statewide prosecutorial authority, and has formal written procedures for referring to the State Attorney General or other office suspected criminal violations and for effective coordination of the activities of both entities relating to the detection, investigation, and prosecution of those violations relating to the State Medicaid program. Under this working relationship, the office of the State Attorney General, or other office, must agree to assume responsibility for prosecuting alleged criminal violations referred to it by the Unit. However, if the State Attorney General finds that another prosecuting authority has the demonstrated capacity, experience, and willingness to prosecute an alleged violation, he or she may refer a case to that prosecuting authority, as long as the office of the State Attorney General maintains oversight responsibility for the prosecution and for coordination between the Unit and the prosecuting authority.
