The OIG will not provide any legal opinion on questions or issues regarding an authority which is vested in other Federal, State or local government agencies.


(b) An advisory opinion issued under this part will not bind or obligate any agency other than the Department. It will not affect the requestor's, or anyone else's, obligations to any other agency, or under any statutory or regulatory provision other than that which is the specific subject matter of the advisory opinion.
