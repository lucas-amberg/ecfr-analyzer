# § 10.7   Disposition.

When human remains or cultural items are removed from Federal or Tribal lands, as soon as possible (but no later than one year) after the discovery or excavation of the human remains or cultural items, the appropriate official must identify the lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization that has priority for disposition of human remains or cultural items using this section.


(a) *Priority for disposition.* The disposition of human remains or cultural items removed from Federal or Tribal lands must be in the following priority order:


(1) The known lineal descendant, if any, for human remains or associated funerary objects;


(2) The Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization from whose Tribal lands the human remains or cultural items were removed;


(3) The Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization with the closest cultural affiliation according to the priority order at § 10.3(e) of this part;


(4) On Federal land that is recognized by a final judgment of the Indian Claims Commission or the United States Court of Claims as the aboriginal land of some Indian Tribe, the Indian Tribe with the strongest relationship to the human remains or cultural items, which is:


(i) The Indian Tribe recognized as aboriginally occupying the geographical location where the human remains or cultural items were removed; or


(ii) A different Indian Tribe who shows by a preponderance of the evidence a stronger relationship to the human remains or cultural items; or


(5) Any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that requests transfer of the human remains or cultural items as unclaimed under paragraph (d) of this section.


(b) *On Tribal lands.* The Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization from whose Tribal lands the human remains or cultural items were removed must identify the lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization with priority for disposition under paragraph (a) of this section.


(1) The Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization must complete and retain a written disposition statement to recognize:


(i) A lineal descendant (whose name may be withheld) has ownership or control of the human remains or associated funerary objects removed from Tribal lands; or


(ii) A lineal descendant could not be ascertained, and the Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has ownership or control of the human remains or cultural items removed from Tribal lands.


(2) On Tribal lands in Alaska and the continental United States, the Indian Tribe may delegate its responsibility for disposition of human remains or cultural items to the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Federal agency with primary management authority. If both the Federal agency and the Indian Tribe consent in writing, the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Federal agency with primary management authority is responsible for completing the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section.


(3) On Tribal lands of an NHO, the Native Hawaiian organization may agree in writing to be responsible for disposition of human remains or cultural items from its Tribal lands and then must provide written disposition statements under this paragraph. If the Native Hawaiian organization has not agreed in writing to be responsible for dispositions, DHHL is responsible for completing the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for any dispositions from those Tribal lands of an NHO.


(4) After completing a disposition statement, nothing in the Act or this part:


(i) Limits the authority of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization to enter into any agreement with the lineal descendant or another Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization concerning the human remains or cultural items;


(ii) Limits any procedural or substantive right which may otherwise be secured to the lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization; or


(iii) Prevents the governing body of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization from expressly relinquishing its ownership or control of human remains, funerary objects, or sacred objects.


(c) *On Federal or Tribal lands.* When a Federal agency or DHHL has responsibility for disposition of human remains or cultural items from Federal or Tribal lands, the Federal agency or DHHL must inform and notify the lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization with priority for disposition under paragraph (a) of this section.


(1) *Step 1—Inform consulting parties.* As soon as possible but no later than six months after removal of human remains or cultural items from Federal or Tribal lands, the Federal agency or DHHL must send a written document informing all consulting parties listed in the plan of action under § 10.4(b)(3) of this part. Consultation on disposition of human remains or cultural items may continue until the Federal agency or DHHL sends a disposition statement to a claimant under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.


(i) The written document must include:


(A) A description of the human remains or cultural items, including the date and geographical location by county and State of removal; and


(B) The lineal descendant (whose name may be withheld), Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization identified as having priority for disposition of the human remains or cultural items.


(ii) For human remains or cultural items removed from Federal or Tribal lands whose disposition is not complete prior to January 12, 2024, the Federal agency or DHHL must:


(A) Identify the lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization with priority for disposition under paragraph (a) of this section; and


(B) No later than July 12, 2024, send a written document under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

(2) *Step 2—Submit a notice of intended disposition.* No earlier than 30 days and no later than six months after informing consulting parties, the Federal agency or DHHL must submit a notice of intended disposition. If the human remains or cultural items are evidence in an ongoing civil or criminal action under ARPA or a criminal action under NAGPRA, the deadline for the notice is extended until the conclusion of the ARPA or NAGPRA case.

(C) The date (to be calculated by the _Federal Register_ 30 days from the date of publication) after which the Federal agency or DHHL may send a disposition statement to a claimant; and


(D) The date (to be calculated by the _Federal Register_ one year from the date of publication) on which the human remains or cultural items become unclaimed human remains or cultural items if no claim for disposition is received from a lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization.


(iii) No later than 21 days after receiving a notice of intended disposition, the Manager, National NAGPRA Program, must:


(A) Approve for publication in the _Federal Register_ any submission that conforms to the requirements under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; or

(i) A claim for disposition of human remains or cultural items must be received by the Federal agency or DHHL before a disposition statement for the human remains or cultural items is sent to a claimant under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the transfer or reinterment of the human remains or cultural items under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. A claim for disposition received by the Federal agency or DHHL before the publication of the notice of intended disposition is dated the same date the notice was published.


(ii) Claims from two or more lineal descendants, Indian Tribes, or Native Hawaiian organizations who agree to joint disposition of the human remains or cultural items are considered a single claim and not competing claims.


(iii) A claim for disposition must satisfy one of the following criteria:
