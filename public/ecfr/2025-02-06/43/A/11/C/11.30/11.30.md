# § 11.30   What does the authorized official do if an assessment is warranted?

(a) If the authorized official determines during the Preassessment Phase that an assessment is warranted, the authorized official must develop a plan for the assessment of natural resource damages.


(b) *Purpose.* The purpose of the Assessment Plan is to ensure that the assessment is performed in a planned and systematic manner and that methodologies selected from subpart D for a type A assessment or from subpart E for a type B assessment, including the Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination phases, can be conducted at a reasonable cost, as that phrase is used in this part.


(c) *Assessment Plan phase costs.* (1) The following categories of reasonable and necessary costs may be incurred in the Assessment Plan phase of the damage assessment:


(i) Methodology identification and screening costs;


(ii) Potentially responsible party notification costs;


(iii) Public participation costs;


(iv) Exposure confirmation analysis costs;


(v) Preliminary estimate of damages costs; and


(vi) Any other Assessment Plan costs for activities authorized by §§ 11.30 through 11.38.


(2) The reasonable and necessary costs for these categories shall be limited to those costs incurred or anticipated by the authorized official for, and specifically allocable to, site specific efforts taken in the development of an Assessment Plan for a resource for which the agency or Indian tribe is acting as trustee. Such costs shall be supported by appropriate records and documentation, and shall not reflect regular activities performed by the agency or tribe in management of the natural resource. Activities undertaken as part of the Assessment Plan phase shall be taken in a manner that is cost-effective, as that phrase is used in this part.
