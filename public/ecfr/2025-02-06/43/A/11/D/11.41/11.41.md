(2) The mass or volume of the identified substance that was released;


(3) The duration of the release;


(4) The time of the release;


(5) The location of the release;


(6) The wind conditions;


(7) The extent of response actions;


(8) The extent of any closures;


(9) The implicit price deflator; and


(10) For the NRDAM/CME, the condition of the currents and tides.


(b) The authorized official must change the data in the NRDAM/CME and the NRDAM/GLE for the following parameters if he or she is aware of more accurate data:


(1) Air temperature;


(2) Water temperature at the surface;


(3) Total suspended sediment concentration;


(4) Mean settling velocity of suspended solids; and


(5) Habitat type.
