# § 11.70   Quantification phase—general.

(a) *Requirement.* (1) Upon completing the Injury Determination phase, the authorized official shall quantify for each resource determined to be injured and for which damages will be sought, the effect of the discharge or release in terms of the reduction from the baseline condition in the quantity and quality of services, as the phrase is used in this part, provided by the injured resource using the guidance provided in the Quantification phase of this part.


(2) The Quantification phase consists of § 11.70—general; § 11.71—service reduction quantification; § 11.72—baseline services determination; and § 11.73—resource recoverability analysis, of this part.


(b) *Purpose.* The purpose of the Quantification phase is to quantify the effects of the discharge or release on the injured natural resources for use in determining the appropriate amount of compensation.


(c) *Steps in the Quantification phase.* In the Quantification phase, the extent of the injury shall be measured, the baseline condition of the injured resource shall be estimated, the baseline services shall be identified, the recoverability of the injured resource shall be determined, and the reduction in services that resulted from the discharge or release shall be estimated.


(d) *Completion of Quantification phase.* Upon completing the Quantification phase, the authorized official shall make a determination as to the reduction in services that resulted from the discharge or release. This Quantification Determination shall be used in the Damage Determination phase and shall be maintained as part of the Report of Assessment described in § 11.90 of this part.
