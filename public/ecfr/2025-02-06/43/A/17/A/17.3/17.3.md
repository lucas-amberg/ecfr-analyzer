# ยง 17.3   Discrimination prohibited.

(a) *General.* No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies.


(b) *Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.* (1) A recipient to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin:


(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;


(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;


(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;


(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;


(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;


(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).


(vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.


(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.


(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect if defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part.


(4)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.


(ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color or national origin.


(5) References in this section to services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.


(6) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph (b) and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Employment practices.* (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this part shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees). Such recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246, as amended, or any Executive Order which supersedes it.


(2) The requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to programs under laws funded or administered by the Department where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (i) to reduce the unemployment of such individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence needs, (ii) to assist such individuals in meeting expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (iii) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of such individuals. Assistance given under the following laws has one of the above purposes as a primary objective: Water Resources Research Act of 1964, title I, 78 Stat. 329, and those statutes listed in appendix A to this subpart where the facilities or employment opportunities provided are limited, or a preference is given, to students, fellows, or other persons in training or related employment.


(3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefit of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this part, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.


(d) *Benefits for Indians, natives of certain territories, and Alaska natives.* An individual shall not be deemed subjected to discrimination by reason of his exclusion from benefits which, in accordance with Federal law, are limited to Indians, natives of certain territories, or Alaska natives, if the individual is not a member of the class to which the benefits are addressed. Such benefits include those authorized by statutes listed in appendix B to this subpart.
