# ยง 17.213   Pre-employment inquiries.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a recipient may not conduct a pre-employment medical examination or make a pre-employment inquiry as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make a pre-employment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.


(b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to ยง 17.205(a), when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to ยง 17.205(b), or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided that:


(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose, or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts.


(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this subpart.


(3) The recipient must communicate with the applicant in a manner that will ensure that the applicant understands clearly the reasons for the recipient's questions.


(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided that: (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap, and (2) the results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.


(d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:


(1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary accommodations;


(2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment;


(3) Government officials investigating compliance with the Act shall be provided relevant information upon request.
