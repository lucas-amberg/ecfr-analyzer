# § 17.311   Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination.

(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms “normal operation” and “statutory objective” shall have the following meaning:


(1) *Normal operation* means the operation of a program or activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its objectives.


(2) *Statutory objective* means any purpose of a program or activity expressly stated in any Federal, State, or local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body.


(b) Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination: Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.


(1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and


(2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and


(3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and


(4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.


(c) Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination: Reasonable factors other than age. A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 17.310 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.
