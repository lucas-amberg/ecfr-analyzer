# ยง 2.3   Where should you send a FOIA request?

(a) The Department does not have a central location for submitting FOIA requests and it does not maintain a central index or database of records in its possession. Instead, the Department's records are decentralized and maintained by various bureaus and offices throughout the country.


(b) To make a request for Department records, you must write directly to the bureau that you believe maintains those records by utilizing the written forms of submission listed on the Department's FOIA website, *https://www.doi.gov/foia*, or utilizing physical or facsimile addresses of an appropriate FOIA contact, located at *http://www.doi.gov/foia/contacts.*

(c) Questions about where to send a FOIA request should be directed to the bureau that manages the underlying program or to the appropriate FOIA Requester Center, as discussed in ยง 2.66 of this part.
