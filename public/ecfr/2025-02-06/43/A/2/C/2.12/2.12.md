# § 2.12   What should you know about how bureaus process requests?

(a) Except as described in §§ 2.4 and 2.13 of this part, the bureau to which the request is addressed is responsible for responding to the request and for making a reasonable effort to search for responsive records.


(b) In determining which records are responsive to a request, the bureau will include only records in its possession and control on the date that it begins its search.


(c) The bureau will make reasonable efforts to search for the requested records. As part of its reasonable efforts, the bureau will search paper and/or electronic records (for example, emails), as appropriate. The bureau will not search for records in an electronic form or format if these efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the bureau's automated information system.


(d) If a bureau receives a request for records in its possession that primarily concern another bureau or Federal Government agency that is subject to FOIA, it may undertake consultations and/or referrals as described in § 2.13.
