# ยง 2.26   May submitters of possibly confidential information designate information as confidential when making Departmental submissions?

(a) The Department encourages, but does not require, submitters to designate confidential information in good faith (in other words, to identify specific information as information the submitter considers protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, found at 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)), at the time of submission or reasonably soon thereafter.


(b) The designations discussed in paragraph (a) of this section assist the bureau in identifying what information obtained from the submitter is possibly confidential and triggers the requirement for bureau-provided notifications under ยง 2.27(a)(1) of this subpart.
