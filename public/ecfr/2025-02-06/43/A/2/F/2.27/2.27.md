# ยง 2.27   When will the bureau notify a submitter of a request for their possibly confidential information?

(a) Except as outlined in ยง 2.29 of this subpart, a bureau must exercise due diligence to promptly notify a submitter in writing when it receives a FOIA request if:


(1) The requested information has been designated by the submitter as confidential information under ยง 2.26(a) of this subpart; or


(2) The requested information has not been designated as confidential information by the submitter under ยง 2.26(a) of this subpart, but the bureau identifies it as possibly confidential information.


(b) If a voluminous number of submitters are involved, the bureau may publish a notice in a manner reasonably calculated to reach the attention of the submitters (for example, in newspapers or newsletters, the bureau's Web site, or the _Federal Register_) instead of providing a written notice to each submitter.
