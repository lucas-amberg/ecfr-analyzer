# § 2.43   What review fees will you have to pay?

(a) The bureau will charge review fees if you make a commercial-use request, subject to the restrictions of §§ 2.37(f), 2.39, and 2.40(a) of this subpart.


(b) The bureau will assess review fees in connection with the initial review of the record (the review conducted by the bureau to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record).


(c) The Department will not charge for reviews at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if the appellate authority determines that an exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with the bureau's re-review of the records to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.


(d) The bureau will charge review fees at the same rates as those charged for a search under § 2.41(b) of this subpart.


(e) The bureau can charge review fees even if the record(s) reviewed ultimately is not disclosed.
