# § 2.223   Standards for maintenance of records subject to the Act.

(a) *Content of records.* Records subject to the Act shall contain only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or Executive Order of the President.


(b) *Standards of accuracy.* Records subject to the Act which are used in making any determination about any individual shall be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making the determination.


(c) *Collection of information.* (1) Information which may be used in making determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from that individual.


(2) In deciding whether collection of information from an individual, as opposed to a third party source, is practicable, the following factors, among others, may be considered:


(i) Whether the nature of the information sought is such that it can only be obtained from a third party;


(ii) Whether the cost of collecting the information from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from a third party;


(iii) Whether there is a risk that information collected from third parties, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination to the individual concerned;


(iv) Whether the information, if supplied by the individual, would have to be verified by a third party; or


(v) Whether provisions can be made for verification, by the individual, of information collected from third parties.


(d) *Advice to individuals concerning uses of information.* (1) Each individual who is asked to supply information about him or herself which will be added to a system of records shall be informed of the basis for requesting the information, how it may be used, and what the consequences, if any, are of not supplying the information.


(2) At a minimum, the notice to the individual must state:


(i) The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;


(ii) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;


(iii) The routine uses which may be made of the information; and


(iv) The effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.


(3)(i) When information is collected on a standard form, the notice to the individual shall be provided on the form, on a tear-off sheet attached to the form, or on a separate sheet, whichever is most practical.


(ii) When information is collected by an interviewer, the interviewer shall provide the individual with a written notice which the individual may retain. If the interview is conducted by telephone, however, the interviewer may summarize the notice for the individual and need not provide a copy to the individual unless the individual requests a copy.


(iii) An individual may be asked to acknowledge, in writing, that the notice required by this section has been provided.


(e) *Records concerning activity protected by the First Amendment.* No record may be maintained describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution unless the maintenance of the record is (1) expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or (2) pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.
