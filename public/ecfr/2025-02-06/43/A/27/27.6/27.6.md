# ยง 27.6   Equal opportunity implementation.

Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of these regulations, or within sixty (60) days from the commencement of a Federal authorization to which this part applies, whichever occurs later, recipients of Federal authorizations to which this part applies, shall prepare and submit an affirmative action plan for each of their establishments to which this part applies, to assure that the requirements of this part will be met. In addition, recipients and each of their prime contractors and subcontractors shall require each contractor and subcontractor with a contract of $50,000 or more and 50 or more employees to develop within sixty (60) days from the commencement of the contract and to keep on file a written affirmative action plan for each of its establishments, to which this part applies, with the exception of those establishments which the Department Compliance Officer determines are in all respects separate and distinct from performance of the activities of the prime contractor or subcontractor conducted under the Federal authorizations. Such plans shall include a set of specific and result-oriented procedures which the recipient, contractor or subcontractor commits itself to apply every good faith effort to achieve equal opportunity in all aspects of its operations. An acceptable program must include an analysis of all areas of operation of the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor in which it could be deficient in offering services, opportunities, or benefits to minority groups and women, and all areas of employment in which it could be deficient in the utilization of minority groups and women and all areas of contracting in which it could be deficient in the utilization of minority business enterprises, and, further, specific goals and specific timetables to which its efforts will be directed, to correct all deficiencies and thus to increase materially the participation of minorities and women in all aspects of its operation. The implementing affirmative action plans shall include the following:


(a) *Services, financial aids, and other benefits.* The implementing program is required to specifically address all areas of operation of the recipient, contractor or subcontractor which offer and provide services, financial aids, and other benefits; it shall identify those services, financial aids, and benefits; analyze the opportunities available to minorities and women in each area; and set forth affirmative action, including goals and time- tables, which will be taken to materially increase participation of minorities and women.


(b) *Employment practices.* The implementing plan shall address all aspects of employment operations and is required to contain all analyses and commitments, including goals and timetables, which are required in rules, regulations, and orders implementing Executive Order 11246, as amended, and to include additional commitments to employment goals for minorities and women in construction operations, to the extent that those goals are not established under Executive Order 11246.


(c) *Contracting practices.* Recipients to which this part applies and each of their contractors and subcontractors with a contract of $150,000 or more shall also include in their affirmative action plan a program in which the recipient, contractor or subcontractor agrees to take specific affirmative action as set forth below to utilize minority business enterprises as subcontractors and suppliers. For this purpose, the term *minority business enterprise* means a business enterprise that is owned or controlled by minority group members or women. The plan shall identify specific actions which the recipient, contractor or subcontractor will take to:


(1) Designate a liaison officer who will administer the minority business enterprises program;


(2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of minority business enterprises in all contracting decisions;


(3) Afford minority business enterprises an equitable opportunity to compete for contracts and subcontracts by arranging solicitations, time for preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitiate the participation of minority business enterprises;


(4) Submit periodic reports of contracting opportunities, procedures, and awards to minority business enterprises, at such times, and in such form, and containing such information as the Department Compliance Officer may prescribe, including reports showing:


(i) Procedures which have been adopted to comply with the policies set forth in this clause, including the establishment of a source list of minority business enterprises;


(ii) Awards to minority business enterprises on the source lists, and


(iii) Specific efforts to identify and award contracts to minority business enterprises.


(5) Establish specific goals and timetables to utilize minority business enterprises in the performance of contracts awarded.


(6) Inform minority business enterprises and organizations of minority business enterprises of contracting opportunities and procedures.


(7) Cooperate with the Department Compliance Officer in any studies and surveys of the recipient's minority business enterprise procedures and practices that the Department Compliance Officer may from time to time conduct.


(8) Assist potential minority business enterprises in obtaining and maintaining suitable bonding capabilities, in those instances where bonds are required.


(d) *Exemption.* Contracts and subcontracts are exempt from the requirements of the equal opportunity clause with regard to work performed outside the United States by employees who were not recruited within the United States.
