# ยง 30.145   When can a judge reduce or disallow a claim?

The judge has discretion to decide whether part or all of an otherwise valid claim is unreasonable, and if so, to reduce the claim to a reasonable amount or disallow the claim in its entirety. If a claim is reduced, the judge will order payment only of the reduced amount.
