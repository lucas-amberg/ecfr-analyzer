# ยง 30.147   What happens if there is not enough trust personalty to pay all the claims?

If, as of the date of death, there was not enough trust personalty to pay all allowed claims, the judge may order them paid on a pro rata basis. The unpaid balance of any claims will not be enforceable against the estate after the estate is closed.
