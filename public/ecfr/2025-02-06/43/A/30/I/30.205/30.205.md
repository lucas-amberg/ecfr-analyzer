# § 30.205   What must a summary probate decision contain?

The written decision in a summary probate proceeding must be in the form of findings of fact and conclusions of law, with an order for distribution. Each decision must include the following:


(a) The name, birth date, and relationship to the decedent of each heir or devisee;


(b) A statement as to whether the heir or devisee is eligible to hold property in trust status and, if relevant, a statement of whether the heir or devisee is “Indian” for purposes of the Act;


(c) If the case involves a will, a statement approving or disapproving the will, interpreting provisions of an approved will as necessary, and describing the share each devisee is to receive under an approved will;


(d) In intestate cases, citation to the law of descent and distribution under which the summary probate decision is made, and description of the share each heir is to receive;


(e) A statement advising all interested parties, other than potential claimants, that they have a right to seek review under § 30.207 and that, if they fail to do so, the summary probate decision will become final 30 days after it is mailed;


(f) Notice to the heirs or devisees that each may renounce his or her right to inherit the funds in favor of one or more individuals or entities. The heir or devisee will be ordered to submit the renunciation within 30 days of the mailing date of the decision or within 30 days of an order on review if a request for review is filed by any party;


(g) A statement that the findings in a summary probate decision may not be used to determine the decedent's heirs or devisees for distribution of any trust or restricted land that may be added to the decedent's estate at a later time. If BIA identifies trust or restricted land in the decedent's estate after the completion of the summary probate process, BIA should file a petition for reopening and include all documents required for a formal probate proceeding pursuant to 25 CFR 15.202(a); and


(h) The signature of the judge or ADM and date of the probate decision.
