(a) If you are adversely affected by the written decision in a summary probate proceeding, you may seek review of the summary probate decision. To do this, you must file a request with the OHA office that issued the summary probate decision within 30 days after the date the summary probate decision was mailed. BIA may also seek review within the same deadline.

(1) The name of the decedent;


(2) A description of your relationship to the decedent;


(3) An explanation of what errors you allege were made in the summary probate decision; and
