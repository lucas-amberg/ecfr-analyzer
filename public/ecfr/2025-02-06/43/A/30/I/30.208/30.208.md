(a) Within 30 days of receiving a request for review, OHA will notify the agency that prepared the probate file, all other affected agencies, and all interested parties of the request.


(b) A judge will review the merits of the case, consider any allegations of errors in the summary probate decision, conduct a hearing if necessary or appropriate to address the issues raised in the request, and issue an order affirming, modifying, or vacating the summary probate decision.


(c) The judge must distribute the final order on the request to review to each affected agency and to each interested party. The order must include a notice stating that interested parties who are adversely affected, or BIA, have a right to appeal the final order to the Board within 30 days of the date on which the final order was mailed, and giving the Board's address.
