# ยง 30.250   May a correction order be issued to correct typographical and other non-substantive errors?

If, after issuance of a decision or other probate order, it appears that the decision or other probate order contains non-substantive errors, the judge may issue a correction order to correct them. Errors are non-substantive if they are merely typographical, clerical, or their correction would not change the distribution of a decedent's property.


(a) A judge may issue a correction order for the purpose of correcting non-substantive errors on the judge's own motion. A request for correction order may also be filed by BIA or an interested party at any time.


(b) Copies of the correction order will be sent to BIA and all interested parties.


(c) The correction order is not subject to appeal to the Board.
