Yes. The judge may limit the time, place, and scope of discovery either:


(a) On timely motion by any interested party, if that party also gives notice to all interested parties and shows good cause; or


(b) When the judge determines that limits are necessary to prevent delay of the proceeding or prevent undue hardship to a party or witness.
