# ยง 30.408   What will OHA include in the probate decision or reconsideration order when a purchase at probate request is pending?

(a) If a purchase at probate request is pending at the time the probate decision (or reconsideration order under ยง 30.251) is issued, and is not denied in the decision (or reconsideration order), the decision (or reconsideration order) will include the following to address the request:


(1) A list of all requests to purchase at probate that have been submitted;


(2) Notification to the parties as to whether consent of the applicable heirs or devisees is required to approve the requested purchase; and


(3) Direction to BIA to obtain an appraisal or valuation for each interest for which a purchase at probate request has been submitted.


(b) If the purchase of the interest requires consent of the applicable heirs or devisees, the probate decision or reconsideration order will also:


(1) Direct the heirs or devisees to submit written notification within 30 days of the mailing date of the decision or reconsideration order that the heirs or devisees would consider selling the interest to an eligible purchaser during the probate process if a bid is made for fair market value or greater;


(2) Inform the heirs or devisees that OHA may consider failure to provide such written notification as a refusal to consent to sell the property during probate, and may rely on such refusal to deny the request to purchase at probate; and


(3) Direct BIA to postpone seeking an appraisal/valuation of that property until BIA receives future notice from OHA that at least one heir or devisee has filed the written notification that the heir or devisee would consider selling the interest.
