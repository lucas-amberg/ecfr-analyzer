# ยง 30.410   How will the purchase at probate process continue after the decision or reconsideration order is issued?

After a decision or reconsideration order is issued:


(a) If consent is required for the purchase of an interest, and an heir or devisee does not submit written notification that he or she would consider selling the interest by the deadline OHA established, the request to purchase the applicable property interest(s) is denied by operation of law. In such cases, OHA will notify the BIA that it may remove the encumbrance remaining on the applicable property interest(s).


(b) If the heirs or devisees submit the written notification that they would consider selling the interest by the deadline OHA established, then OHA will notify BIA that it may obtain an appraisal/valuation of the property.


(c) In any other instances in which a purchase request is denied, BIA may remove any encumbrance remaining on the applicable property interest(s).
