# ยง 30.411   How will the interests to be purchased at probate be valued?

(a) For each parcel for which a request to purchase has been submitted, BIA will obtain appraisal(s) or other fair market valuation(s) in compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) or other approved valuation methods under 25 U.S.C. 2214.


(b) Any appraisal/valuation must be made on the basis of the fair market value of the parcel as of the date of the decedent's death.


(c) No valuation document filed by the BIA, aside from an appraisal, will be used to determine the fair market value of trust land during a purchase at probate unless the document clearly states that it assesses the fair market value of the real property interest or is accompanied by a certification that it does so.
