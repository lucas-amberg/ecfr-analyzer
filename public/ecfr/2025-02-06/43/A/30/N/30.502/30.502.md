# ยง 30.502   How does a judge resolve conflicts between the anti-lapse provision and the presumption of joint tenancy?

If the presumption of joint tenancy and anti-lapse provisions conflict, then the judge will give priority to the presumption of joint tenancy and the share of the deceased devisee will descend to the surviving devisees.
