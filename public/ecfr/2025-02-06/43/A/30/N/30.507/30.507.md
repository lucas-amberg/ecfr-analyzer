(a) To the decedent's surviving children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, parents, or siblings who are not eligible heirs under the Act, in the order set forth in 25 U.S.C. 2206(a)(2)(B).


(b) If trust personalty does not descend under paragraph (a) of this section, then to the decedent's surviving nieces and nephews, in equal shares.

(1) To the Indian Tribe in which the decedent's biological parents were enrolled, if both were enrolled in the same Tribe;
