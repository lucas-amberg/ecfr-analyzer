(a) The Young Adult Conservation Corps (YACC) is authorized by title I of the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-93), which amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 by adding a new title VIII.


(b) The Young Adult Conservation Corps (YACC) is a year-round employment program for young men and women aged 16 through 23 inclusive. Financial assistance is available through grants-in-aid for employment and work to be performed on projects affecting both Federal and non-Federal public lands and waters or projects limited to non-Federal public lands and waters. YACC grants do not require matching.


(c) The YACC grant program is jointly managed by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture under an interagency agreement with the Secretary of Labor.


(d) Thirty percent of the sums appropriated to carry out the YACC program for any fiscal year will be available for grants during such year. Grant funds will be allocated on the basis of the total youth population within each State. State YACC programs must consist of both residential and nonresidential projects. At least 25 percent of the State YACC program must be residential by September 30, 1978.
