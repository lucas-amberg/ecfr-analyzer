# ยง 34.10   Compliance reviews.

(a) *Periodic compliance procedures.* (1) The Federal Inspector will review the practices of recipients, contractors, or subcontractors, which offer significant opportunities for employment or procurement, to determine whether such recipient, contractor, or subcontractor are complying with its affirmative action plans and the rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 17 and Condition 11 of the President's *Decision.* The review will consist of a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of the recipient's, contractor's, or subcontractor's operations and practices and the conditions resulting therefrom. The review will include an on-site visit if the Federal Inspector determines that such a review is necessary.


(2) The Federal Inspector will continually monitor and verify the status of MBE's and FBE's through procedures as the Inspector may determine appropriate.


(b) *Complaints.* (1) Complaints alleging discrimination or non-compliance with affirmative action plans shall be filed with the Federal Inspector.


(2) A complaint must be filed within 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Federal Inspector for good cause shown.


(3) The complaint should include the name, address, and telephone number of the complainant; the name and address of the person alleged to have discriminated; a description of the alleged discriminatory acts; and any other pertinent information which will assist the investigation and resolution of the complaint. The complaint should be signed by the complainant or his or her authorized representative.


(4) The filing of a complaint with the Federal Inspector shall not constitute the filing of a complaint pursuant to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the Equal Opportunity Commission unless, by agreement between the two agencies, the Federal Inspector and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission so provide.


(c) *Investigations.* The Federal Inspector will make a prompt investigation whenever information indicates that a person may have failed to comply with section 17 or Condition 11 of the President's *Decision* or the implementing rules, regulations, or orders thereunder. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the person under investigation, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance occurred, and other factors relevant to determine whether the person has failed to comply with section 17, Condition 11 of the President's *Decision,* or the implementing rules, regulations, and orders thereunder.


(d) *Resolution of complaints and investigations.* (1) In exercising the broad authority to enforce these regulations, the Federal Inspector shall, within 90 days of the effective date of these regulations, establish the procedures to be followed in enforcing these regulations. These regulations shall thereafter be amended to incorporate these procedures. The procedures shall, to the extent consistent with ANGTA, be similar to those proposed to be adopted by the Department of Energy to resolve complaints of violations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See regulations proposed to be codified at 10 CFR 1040.104, (Nov. 16, 1978). At a minimum the procedures must incorporate the following paragraphs (d) (2) through (5) of this section.


(2) The Federal Inspector will initiate action upon all complaints within 35 days of the date the complaint is filed with the Federal Inspector.


(3) If an investigation pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section indicates probable non-compliance with section 17, Condition 11 of the President's *Decision,* or the implementing rules, regulations, or orders thereunder, the Federal Inspector will attempt to resolve the matter by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.


(4) Resolution shall be effected through a written agreement between the Federal Inspector, the complainant, if any, and the person who has failed to comply. The agreement shall contain commitments to promptly eliminate all discriminatory conditions, shall identify the precise remedial actions to be taken and dates for completion of remedial actions, and shall include a provision that breath of the agreement may result in further enforcement actions by the Federal Inspector. The Federal Inspector will then certify compliance, on condition that the commitments are kept. Such certification will not preclude a subsequent determination by the Federal Inspector that the full facts were not known at the time agreement was executed, or the commitments undertaken are not sufficient to correct deficiencies.


(5) If the Federal Inspector's investigation does not warrant enforcement action, the Federal Inspector shall so inform the complainant, if any, and the person who was investigated. The complainant shall also be notified of any action taken including the achievement of voluntary compliance.


(6) Between the period of these effective dates of these regulations and the effective date of the enforcement procedures established by the Federal Inspector, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Federal Inspector shall at a minimum adhere to paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section.


(e) *Acts of intimidation or retaliation prohibited.* No person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, harass, or retaliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 17, Condition 11 the President's *Decision,* and implementing rules, regulations, orders, because such individual has opposed a practice prohibited by section 17 or by this part, made a complaint, testified, assisted in, benefited from, or participated in any manner in an investigation, compliance review, proceeding or hearing, conducted pursuant to these regulations. The identity of complainants may be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purpose of this part, including investigatory actions, hearings, or judicial proceedings.
