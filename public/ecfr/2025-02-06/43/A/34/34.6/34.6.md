Each certificate, permit, right-of-way, lease, or other Federal authorization to which this part applies, shall include the following Equal Opportunity Clause:


(a) The recipient, contractor, or subcontractor hereby agrees that it will not discriminate directly or indirectly against any individual or establishment in offering or providing procurements, employment, services, financial aid, other benefits, or other activities to which these regulations apply. The recipient, contractor, or subcontractor will take affirmative action to utilize business enterprises owned and controlled by minorities and/or women in its procurement practices; to assure that applicants for employment are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, or sex; and to assure that individuals and establishments are offered and provided services, financial aid, and other benefits without discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, or sex. The recipient, contractor, or subcontractor agrees to post in conspicuous places available to contractors, subcontractors, employees, and other interested individuals, notices which set forth these equal opportunity terms; and to notify interested individuals, such as bidders, contractors, purchasers, and labor unions or representatives of workers with whom it has collective bargaining agreements, of its obligations under section 17, Condition 11 of the President's *Decision,* and the implementing rules, regulations, and orders thereunder;


(b) The recipient, contractor, or subcontractor will comply with all rules, regulations, and orders which implement section 17 and Condition 11 of the President's *Decision*;


(c) The recipient, contractor, or subcontractor will furnish all information and reports required by or pursuant to rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 17 and Condition 11 of the President's *Decision,* and will permit access to its facilities, books, records, and accounts by the Federal Inspector for purposes of ascertaining compliance with such rules, regulations, and orders;


(d) In the event of a recipient's, contractor's, or subcontractor's noncompliance with these equal opportunity terms, compliance may be effected through procedures authorized by ANGTA and set forth in implementing rules, regulations, and orders, or by any other means authorized by law;


(e) The recipient, contractor, or subcontractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (a) to (e) of this section in all agreements to assign authorizations, all contracts over $10,000, and all contracts of indefinite quantity, unless there is reason to believe that the amount to be ordered in any year under the contract will not exceed $10,000. The recipient, contractor, or subcontractor will take such action with respect to any contract or purchase order that the Federal Inspector may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance: *Provided, however,* That in the event the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor becomes involved in or is threatened with litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.


(f) Any project labor agreement which may be entered into between the applicants and any union must be consistent with the provisions of these regulations and must contain an Equal Opportunity Clause.
