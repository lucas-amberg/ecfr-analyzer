(d) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the party must support its motion requesting an extension of time by showing there is good cause to grant it.


(e) A Board order granting or denying a motion requesting an extension will state when the document must be filed. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if the Board does not act on a motion before the document is due, the document must be filed no later than 15 days after the original due date, unless the Board orders otherwise.


(f) A party seeking additional time to file an answer may have one automatic extension, not to exceed 30 days, of the deadline in ยง 4.414(a) by filing a motion for such extension under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
