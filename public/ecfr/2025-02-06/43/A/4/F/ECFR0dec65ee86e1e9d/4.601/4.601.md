# § 4.601   What is the purpose of this subpart?

(a) The Equal Access to Justice Act provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Department of the Interior. Under the Act, an eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Department or other agency, unless the position of the Department or other agency was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The regulations in this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Office of Hearings and Appeals will use in ruling on those applications.


(b) The regulations in this subpart apply to any application for an award of attorney fees and other expenses that is:


(1) Pending on February 8, 2006; or


(2) Filed on or after February 8, 2006.
