# § 4.604   When am I eligible for an award?

(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, you must:


(1) Be a party to the adversary adjudication for which you seek an award; and


(2) Show that you meet all conditions of eligibility in this section.


(b) You are an eligible applicant if you are any of the following:


(1) An individual with a net worth of $2 million or less;


(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of $7 million or less, including both personal and business interests, and 500 or fewer employees;


(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with 500 or fewer employees;


(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with 500 or fewer employees;


(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of $7 million or less and 500 or fewer employees; or


(6) For purposes of § 4.605(c), a small entity as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6).


(c) For the purpose of eligibility, your net worth and the number of your employees must be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.


(1) Your employees include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration under your direction and control.


(2) Part-time employees must be included on a proportional basis.


(d) You are considered an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if:


(1) You own an unincorporated business; and


(2) The issues on which you prevail are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.


(e) To determine your eligibility, your net worth and the number of your employees must be aggregated with the net worth and the number of employees of all of your affiliates. However, this paragraph does not apply if the adjudicative officer determines that aggregation would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities.


(f) The adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships other than those described in the definition of “affiliate” in § 4.602 constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.


(g) If you participate in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible, you are not eligible for an award.
