(1) You prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of a proceeding; and


(2) The position of the Department or other agency over which you prevailed was not substantially justified. The Department or other agency has the burden of proving that its position was substantially justified.

(i) You have committed a willful violation of law;


(ii) You have acted in bad faith; or


(iii) Special circumstances make an award unjust.


(2) Fees and expenses awarded under this paragraph will be paid only if appropriations to cover the payment have been provided in advance.
