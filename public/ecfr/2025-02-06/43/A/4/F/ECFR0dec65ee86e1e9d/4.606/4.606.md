# § 4.606   What fees and expenses may be allowed?

(a) If the criteria in §§ 4.603 through 4.605 are met, you may receive an award under this subpart only for the fees and expenses of your attorney(s) and expert witness(es).


(b) The adjudicative officer must base an award on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available to you without charge or at a reduced rate.


(1) The maximum that can be awarded for the fee of an attorney is $125 per hour.


(2) The maximum that can be awarded for the fee of an expert witness is the highest rate at which the Department or other agency pays expert witnesses with similar expertise.


(3) An award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney or expert witness as a separate item, if the attorney or expert witness ordinarily charges clients separately for those expenses.


(c) The adjudicative officer may award only reasonable fees and expenses under this subpart. In determining the reasonableness of the fee for an attorney or expert witness, the adjudicative officer must consider the following:


(1) If the attorney or expert witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services;


(2) If the attorney or expert witness is your employee, the fully allocated cost of the services;

(4) The time actually spent in representing you in the proceeding;


(5) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and


(6) Any other factors that bear on the value of the services provided.


(d) The adjudicative officer may award the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on your behalf to the extent that:


(1) The charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services; and


(2) The study or other matter was necessary for preparation of your case.
