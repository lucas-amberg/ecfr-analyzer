# ยง 4.621   When may the Department or other agency file an answer?

(a) Within 30 days after service of an application, the Department or other agency against which an award is sought may file an answer to the application. However, if consideration of an application has been stayed under ยง 4.613(b), the answer is due within 30 days after the final disposition of the review or reconsideration of the decision.


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested. In such case, the adjudicative officer will issue a decision in accordance with ยง 4.625 based on the record before him or her.


(2) Failure to file an answer within the 30-day period will not be treated as a consent to the award requested if the Department or other agency either:


(i) Requests an extension of time for filing; or


(ii) Files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) If the Department or other agency and you believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, you may jointly file a statement of intent to negotiate a settlement. Filing this statement will extend for an additional 30 days the time for filing an answer, and the adjudicative officer may grant further extensions if you and the agency counsel so request.


(c) The answer must explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on to support the Department's or other agency's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the Department or other agency must include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under ยง 4.624.
