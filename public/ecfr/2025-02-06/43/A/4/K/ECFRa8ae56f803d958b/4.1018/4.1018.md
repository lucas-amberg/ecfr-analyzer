# ยง 4.1018   What are the requirements for motions?

(a) *General.* Any party may apply for an order or ruling on any matter related to the hearing process by presenting a motion to the ALJ. A motion may be presented any time after DCHD issues the docketing notice.


(1) A motion made at a hearing may be stated orally on the record, unless the ALJ directs that it be written.


(2) Any other motion must:


(i) Be in writing;


(ii) Comply with the requirements of this subpart with respect to form, content, filing, and service; and


(iii) Not exceed 10 pages, unless the ALJ orders otherwise.


(b) *Content.* (1) Each motion must state clearly and concisely:


(i) Its purpose and the relief sought;


(ii) The facts constituting the grounds for the relief sought; and


(iii) Any applicable statutory or regulatory authority.


(2) A proposed order must accompany the motion.


(c) *Response.* Except as otherwise required by this subpart or by order of the ALJ, any other party may file a response to a written motion within 14 days after service of the motion. When a party presents a motion at a hearing, any other party may present a response orally on the record.


(d) *Reply.* Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, no reply to a response may be filed.


(e) *Effect of filing.* Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, the filing of a motion does not stay the hearing process.


(f) *Ruling.* The ALJ will rule on the motion as soon as feasible, either orally on the record or in writing. The ALJ may summarily deny any dilatory, repetitive, or frivolous motion.
