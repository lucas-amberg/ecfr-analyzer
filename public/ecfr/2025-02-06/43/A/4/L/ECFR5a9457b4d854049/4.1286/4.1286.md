(d) If the Board orders a hearing, it may do one or more of the following:


(1) Suspend the effectiveness of the decision under review pending a final Departmental decision on the appeal if it finds good cause to do so;


(2) Authorize the administrative law judge to specify additional issues; or


(3) Authorize the parties to agree to additional issues that are material, with the approval of the administrative law judge.


(e) The hearing will be conducted under §§ 4.1100, 4.1102 through 4.1115, 4.1121 through 4.1127, and 4.1130 through 4.1141. Unless the Board orders otherwise, the administrative law judge may consider other relevant issues and evidence identified after referral of the case for a hearing.
