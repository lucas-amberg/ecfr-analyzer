# § 4.1157   Determination by administrative law judge.

(a) The administrative law judge shall incorporate in his decision concerning the civil penalty, findings of fact on each of the four criteria set forth in 30 CFR 723.13 or 845.13, and conclusions of law.


(b) If the administrative law judge finds that—


(1) A violation occurred or that the fact of violation is uncontested, he shall establish the amount of the penalty, but in so doing, he shall adhere to the point system and conversion table contained in 30 CFR 723.13 and 723.14 or 845.13 and 845.14, except that the administrative law judge may waive the use of such point system where he determines that a waiver would further abatement of violations of the Act. However, the administrative law judge shall not waive the use of the point system and reduce the proposed assessment on the basis of an argument that a reduction in the proposed assessment could be used to abate other violations of the Act; or


(2) No violation occurred, he shall issue an order that the proposed assessment be returned to the petitioner.


(c) If the administrative law judge makes a finding that no violation occurred or if the administrative law judge reduces the amount of the civil penalty below that of the proposed assessment and a timely petition for review of his decision is not filed with the Board or the Board refuses to grant such a petition, the Department of the Interior shall have 30 days from the expiration of the date for filing a petition with the Board if no petition is filed, or 30 days from the date the Board refuses to grant such a petition, within which to remit the appropriate amount to the person who made the payment, with interest at the rate of 6 percent, or at the prevailing Department of the Treasury rate, whichever is greater.


(d) If the administrative law judge increases the amount of the civil penalty above that of the proposed assessment, the administrative law judge shall order payment of the appropriate amount within 30 days of receipt of the decision.
