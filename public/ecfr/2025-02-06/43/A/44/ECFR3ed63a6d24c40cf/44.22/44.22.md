# ยง 44.22   Are there any special circumstances that affect the way the Department calculates PILT payments?

If a local government eligible for payments under this subpart reorganizes, the Department will:


(a) Calculate payments for the fiscal year in which the reorganization occurred as if the reorganization had not occurred; and


(b) Disburse any payment due to each new unit based on the amount of eligible acreage in that unit.
