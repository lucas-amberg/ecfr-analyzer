# ยง 44.41   How does the Department calculate payments for lands in the Redwood National Park or Lake Tahoe Basin?

(a) The Department calculates section 6905 payments by determining 1 percent of the fair market value of the purchased land and comparing the result to the amount of real estate taxes paid on the land in the year prior to Federal acquisition. The payment to qualified units of general local government will be the lesser of the two.


(b) The Department disburses payments annually for a period of 5 years beginning in the year immediately following the year of Federal acquisition of the land or interest.


(1) The difference, if any, between the amounts actually paid during each of the 5 years and 1 percent of the fair market value will be deferred to future years. However, a payment or any portion of a payment not paid because Congress appropriated insufficient monies will not be deferred.


(2) The Department will begin annual payment of the deferred amount (calculated the same as in paragraph (a) of this section) starting with the sixth fiscal year following Federal acquisition.


(3) The Department disburses payment of the deferred amount until the total amount deferred during the first 5 years is paid in full.
