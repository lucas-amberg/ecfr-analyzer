# ยง 45.1   What is the purpose of this part, and to what license proceedings does it apply?

(a) *Hearing process.* (1) The regulations in subparts A and B of this part contain rules of practice and procedure applicable to hearings on disputed issues of material fact with respect to mandatory conditions and prescriptions that the Department of the Interior (DOI) may develop for inclusion in a hydropower license issued under subchapter I of the Federal Power Act (FPA), 16 U.S.C. 791 *et seq.* The authority to develop these conditions and prescriptions is granted by FPA sections 4(e) and 18, 16 U.S.C. 797(e) and 811, which authorize the Secretary of the Interior to condition hydropower licenses issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and to prescribe fishways.


(2) The hearing process under this part does not apply to provisions that DOI may submit to FERC under any authority other than FPA section 4(e) and 18, including recommendations under FPA section 10(a) or (j), 16 U.S.C. 803(a), (j), or terms and conditions under FPA section 30(c), 16 U.S.C. 823a(c).


(3) The FPA also grants the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce the authority to develop mandatory conditions, and the Department of Commerce the authority to develop mandatory prescriptions, for inclusion in a hydropower license. Where DOI and either or both of these other Departments develop conditions or prescriptions to be included in the same hydropower license and where the Departments agree to consolidate the hearings under ยง 45.23:


(i) A hearing conducted under this part will also address disputed issues of material fact with respect to any condition or prescription developed by one of the other Departments; or


(ii) A hearing requested under this part will be conducted by one of the other Departments, pursuant to 7 CFR 1.601 *et seq.* or 50 CFR 221.1 *et seq.,* as applicable.


(4) The regulations in subparts A and B of this part will be construed and applied to each hearing process to achieve a just and speedy determination, consistent with adequate consideration of the issues involved and the provisions of ยง 45.60(a).


(b) *Alternatives process.* The regulations in subparts A and C of this part contain rules of procedure applicable to the submission and consideration of alternative conditions and prescriptions under FPA section 33, 16 U.S.C. 823d. That section allows any party to the license proceeding to propose an alternative to a condition deemed necessary by DOI under section 4(e) or a fishway prescribed by DOI under section 18.


(c) *Reserved authority.* Where DOI has notified or notifies FERC that it is reserving its authority to develop one or more conditions or prescriptions at a later time, the hearing and alternatives processes under this part for such conditions or prescriptions will be available if and when DOI exercises its reserved authority.


(d) *Applicability.* (1) This part applies to any hydropower license proceeding for which the license had not been issued as of November 17, 2005, and for which one or more preliminary conditions or prescriptions have been or are filed with FERC before FERC issues the license.


(2) This part also applies to any exercise of DOI's reserved authority under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to a hydropower license issued before or after November 17, 2005.
