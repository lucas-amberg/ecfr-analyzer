# ยง 46.240   Establishing time limits for the NEPA process.

(a) For each proposed action, on a case-by-case basis, bureaus shall:


(1) Set time limits from the start to the finish of the NEPA analysis and documentation, consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.8 and other legal obligations, including statutory and regulatory timeframes;


(2) Consult with cooperating agencies in setting time limits; and


(3) Encourage cooperating agencies to meet established time frames.


(b) Time limits should reflect the availability of Department and bureau personnel and funds. Efficiency of the NEPA process is dependent on the management capabilities of the lead bureau, which must assemble an interdisciplinary team and/or qualified staff appropriate to the type of project to be analyzed to ensure timely completion of NEPA documents.
