# ยง 48.25   How does the Secretary determine if the proposed amendment decreases the benefits to beneficiaries of Hawaiian home lands?

(a) In determining benefits to the beneficiaries, the Secretary will consider the goals and purposes of the Trust, including, but not limited to, the following:


(1) The provision of homesteads to beneficiaries;


(2) The rehabilitation of beneficiaries and their families and Hawaiian homestead communities;


(3) The educational, economic, political, social, and cultural processes by which the general welfare and conditions of beneficiaries are improved and perpetuated;


(4) The construction of replacement homes, repairs or additions;


(5) The development of farm, ranch or aquaculture, including soil and water conservation;


(6) The enhanced construction, reconstruction, operation and maintenance of revenue-producing improvements intended to benefit occupants of Hawaiian home lands;


(7) The making of investments in water and other utilities, supplies, equipment, and goods, as well as professional services needed to plan, implement, develop or operate such projects that will improve the value of Hawaiian home lands for their current and future occupants; and,


(8) The establishment and maintenance of an account to serve as a reserve for loans issued or backed by the Federal Government.


(b) The Secretary will determine if the proposed amendment or any other legislative action decreases the above-described or similar benefits to the beneficiaries, now or in the future, by weighing the answers to the following questions:


(1) How would the proposed amendment impact the benefits to current lessees of Hawaiian home lands?


(2) How would the proposed amendment impact the benefits to beneficiaries currently on a waiting list for a Hawaiian home lands lease?


(3) How would the proposed amendment impact the benefits to beneficiaries who have not yet applied for a Hawaiian home lands lease?


(4) If the interests of the beneficiaries who have not been awarded a Hawaiian home lands lease and the lessees differ, how does the proposed amendment weigh the interests of beneficiaries who have not been awarded a Hawaiian home lands lease with the interests of Hawaiian home lands lessees?


(5) If the interests of the beneficiaries who have not been awarded a Hawaiian home lands lease and the lessees differ, do the benefits to the lessees outweigh any detriment to the beneficiaries who have not been awarded a Hawaiian home lands lease?


(6) If the interests of the beneficiaries differ from the interests of the lessees, do the benefits to the beneficiaries outweigh any detriment to the lessees?
