(3) Conduct inventories consistent with Departmental and bureau museum management standards, and report the results to the bureau.


(b) The Federal land manager, in coordination with the repository official and appropriate subject matter experts, may determine that specimens that are found to be redundant, lack adequate associated data, or otherwise are determined not to further paleontological knowledge, public education, or management of paleontological resources may be removed from museum collections and placed into working collections.
