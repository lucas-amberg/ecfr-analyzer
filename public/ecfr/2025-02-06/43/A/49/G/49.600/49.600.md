# § 49.600   How is “scientific value” determined for criminal and civil penalties?

In determining a criminal or civil penalty, the scientific value of a paleontological resource will be based on the value of the scientific and educational information associated with the resource. This value is the estimated costs of obtaining the scientific and educational information from the disturbed paleontological resource or site if the prohibited act had not occurred. These costs may include, but are not limited to:


(a) Research design development;


(b) Fieldwork;


(c) Preparation of the paleontological specimen;


(d) Stabilization of the paleontological site;


(e) Scientific analysis;


(f) Curation;


(g) Preparation and production of reports or educational materials; and


(h) Lost visitor services or experience.
