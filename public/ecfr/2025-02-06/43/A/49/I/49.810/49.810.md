# ยง 49.810   What is casual collecting?

(a) Casual collecting means the collecting without a permit of a reasonable amount of common invertebrate or plant paleontological resources for non-commercial personal use, either by surface collection or the use of non-powered hand tools, resulting in only negligible disturbance to the Earth's surface or paleontological or other resources.


(1) *Common non-vertebrate paleontological resources* means common invertebrate or plant paleontological resources.


(2) *Reasonable amount* means a maximum of 25 pounds of common non-vertebrate paleontological resources per day per person. Where the common non-vertebrate paleontological resources are embedded in rock, the collector, using non-motorized hand tools, may remove a slab or cobble of rock that exceeds 25 pounds in order to preserve the integrity of the embedded specimen.


(3) *Negligible disturbance* means little or no change to the surface of the land and minimal or no effect to natural and other resources.


(4) *Non-commercial personal use* means a use other than for purchase, sale, financial gain, or research.


(5) *Non-powered hand tools* means tools that do not use or are not operated by a motor, engine, or other mechanized power source, and that can be hand-carried by one person.


(b) In order to preserve paleontological or other resources, or for other management reasons, the Federal land manager may establish area-specific limits on casual collecting, including, but not limited to, restricting the weight of common non-vertebrate paleontological resources; limiting the depth of disturbance; establishing dates or locations for collecting; or establishing what paleontological resources in a specific area are not common.


(c) In consultation with knowledgeable paleontologists, the Federal land manager will determine which non-vertebrate paleontological resources are scientifically rare or unique and are therefore not common.


(d) Collecting common non-vertebrate paleontological resources inconsistent with this subpart is a prohibited act and may result in civil or criminal penalties.
