# ยง 5.8   What expenses will I incur?

You must pay us a location fee and reimburse us for expenses that we incur, as required in this section.


(a) *Location fee.* (1) For commercial filming and still photography permits, we will require a reasonable location fee that provides a fair return to the United States.


(2) The location fee charged is in lieu of any entrance or other special use fees. However, the location fee is in addition to any cost recovery amount assessed in paragraph (b) of this section and represents a fee for the use of Federal lands and facilities and does not include any cost recovery.


(3) We will assess location fees in accordance with a fee schedule, which we will publish in the _Federal Register_ and also make available on the internet and at agency field offices. The location fee does not include any cost recovery.


(b) *Cost recovery.* You must reimburse us for actual costs incurred in processing your request and administering your permit. We will base cost recovery charges upon our direct and indirect expenses including, but not limited to, administrative costs for application processing, preproduction meetings and other activities, on-site monitoring of permitted activities, and any site restoration.
