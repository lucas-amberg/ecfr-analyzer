# ยง 6.5   Rights in inventions.

(a) The rules prescribed in this section shall be applied in determining the respective rights of the Government and of an employee of the Department in and to any invention made by the employee.


(b)(1) Except as indicated in the succeeding paragraphs, (b) (1) through (4), of this section, the Government shall obtain the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to any invention made by an employee of the Department


(i) During working hours, or


(ii) With a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information, or of time or services of other government employees on official duty, or


(iii) Which bears a direct relation to or is made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.


(2) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the invention is insufficient equitably to justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to such invention, or in any case where the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain the entire domestic right, title, and interest therein (although the Government could obtain same under paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the Solicitor, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, shall leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the reservation to the Government of a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant sublicenses for all governmental purposes, such reservation, in the terms thereof, to appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.


(3) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any particular invention, it shall be presumed that any invention made by an employee who is employed or assigned (i) to invent or improve or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or (ii) to conduct or perform research, development work, or both, or (iii) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or (iv) to act in a liaison capacity among governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged in such work, falls within the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and it shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls within the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Either presumption may be rebutted by a showing of the facts and circumstances in the case and shall not preclude a determination that these facts and circumstances justify leaving the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the government employee, subject to law.


(4) In any case wherein the Government neither (i) obtains the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to an invention pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, nor (ii) reserves a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention, with power to grant sublicenses for all governmental purposes, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Solicitor, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, shall leave the entire right, title, and interest in and to the invention in the employee, subject to law.


(c) In the event that the Solicitor determines, pursuant to paragraph (b) (2) or (4) of this section, that title to an invention will be left with an employee, the Solicitor shall notify the employee of this determination and promptly prepare, and preserve in appropriate files, accessible to the Commissioner, a written signed, and dated statement concerning the invention including the following:


(1) A description of the invention in sufficient detail to identify the invention and show the relationship to the employee's duties and work assignment;


(2) The name of the employee and his employment status, including a detailed statement of his official duties and responsibilities at the time the invention was made; and


(3) A statement of the Solicitor's determination and reasons therefor. The Solicitor shall, subject to considerations of national security, or public health, safety, or welfare, submit to the Commissioner a copy of this written statement. This submittal in a case falling within the provisions of paragraph (b) (2) of this section shall be made after the expiration of the period prescribed in ยง 6.6 for the taking of an appeal, or it may be made prior to the expiration of such period if the employees acquiesces in the Solicitor's determination. The Commissioner thereupon shall review the determination of the Solicitor and the Commissioner's decision respecting the matter shall be final, subject to the right of the employee or the Solicitor to submit to the Commissioner within 30 days (or such longer period as the Commissioner may, for good cause, shown in writing, fix in any case) after receiving notice of such decision, a petition for the reconsideration of the decision. A copy of such petition must also be filed by the inventor with the Solicitor within the prescribed period.
