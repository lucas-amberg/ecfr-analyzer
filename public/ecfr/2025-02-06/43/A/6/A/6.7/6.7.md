# § 6.7   Domestic patent protection.

(a) The Solicitor, upon determining that an invention coming within the scope of § 6.5(b) (1) or (2) has been made, shall thereupon determine whether patent protection will be sought in the United States by the Department for such invention. A controversy over the respective rights of the Government and of the inventor in any case shall not delay the taking of the actions provided for in this section. In cases coming within the scope of § 6.5(b)(2), action by the Department looking toward such patent protection shall be contingent upon the consent of the inventor.


(b) Where there is a dispute as to whether paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of § 6.5 applies in determining the respective rights of the Government and of an employee in and to any invention, the Solicitor will determine whether patent protection will be sought in the United States pending the Commissioner's decision on the dispute, and, if he determines that an application for patent should be filed, he will take such rights as are specified in § 6.5(b)(2), but this shall be without prejudice to acquiring the rights specified in § 6.5(b)(1) should the Commissioner so decide.


(c) Where the Solicitor has determined to leave title to an invention with an employee under § 6.5(b)(2), the Solicitor will, upon the filing of an application for patent and pending review of the determination by the Commissioner, take the rights specified in that paragraph, without prejudice to the subsequent acquisition by the Government of the rights specified in § 6.5(b)(1) should the Commissioner so decide.


(d) In the event that the Solicitor determines that an application for patent will not be filed on an invention made under the circumstances specified in § 6.5(b)(1) giving the United States the right to title thereto, the Solicitor shall subject to considerations of national security, or public health, safety, or welfare, report to the Commissioner promptly upon making such determination, the following information concerning the invention:


(1) Description of the invention in sufficient detail to permit a satisfactory review;


(2) Name of the inventor and his employment status;


(3) Statement of the Solicitor's determination and reasons therefor.
