# § 404.13   What criteria will Reclamation use to prioritize requests for assistance under the program?

All requests for assistance that meet the eligibility requirements in §§ 404.6 and 404.7 will be evaluated by applying the following prioritization criteria:

(1) Address present or future water supply needs; or


(2) Promote public health and safety by addressing present and preventing future violations of drinking water standards;


(b) The extent to which a rural water supply project promotes and applies a regional or watershed perspective to water resources management as defined in § 404.2;


(c) The financial need of the project sponsors for assistance with the planning, design, and construction of a rural water supply project, as demonstrated by readily available local and regional economic indicators;


(d) The extent to which Reclamation is uniquely qualified to plan, design, and build the project;


(e) Whether a rural water supply project helps meet applicable requirements established by law;


(f) The extent to which a rural water supply project serves Indian tribes that have nonexistent or inadequate water systems;


(g) The extent to which a rural water supply project is ineligible for comprehensive funding (sufficient to fully fund planning and construction of the entire project) through other assistance programs;


(h) The extent to which a rural water supply project is identified as a priority by state, tribal or local governments;


(i) Whether a rural water supply project incorporates an innovative approach that effectively addresses water supply problems and needs, either by applying new technology or by employing a creative administrative or cooperative solution; and


(j) Other criteria that Reclamation deems appropriate.
