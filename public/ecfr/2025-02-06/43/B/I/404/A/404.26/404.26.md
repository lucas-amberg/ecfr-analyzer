# ยง 404.26   Must an appraisal investigation be completed before I can request Reclamation to review a feasibility study that was not completed under this program?

In general, Reclamation must review an appraisal investigation and prepare an appraisal report recommending that a feasibility study be conducted before Reclamation can review a feasibility study completed without Reclamation assistance under ยง 404.11(c). However, Reclamation may review a feasibility study without first reviewing and approving an appraisal investigation, if Reclamation determines that:


(a) No appraisal investigation was prepared for the project;


(b) The feasibility study satisfies the appraisal criteria set forth in ยง 404.44; and


(c) Reclamation documents these findings in the feasibility report.
