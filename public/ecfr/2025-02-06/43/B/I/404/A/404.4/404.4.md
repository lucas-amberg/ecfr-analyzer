The goals of the program are to:


(a) Assess and address urgent and compelling rural water supply needs that are not currently met by other programs;


(b) Promote and apply a regional or watershed perspective to water resources management in planning rural water supply projects;


(c) Develop solutions to address rural water supply needs that are cost-effective, and that generate national net economic benefits as required under the “Economic Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources” (Principles and Guidelines). The Principles and Guidelines, published in 1983 by the Water Resources Council pursuant to the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 (Pub.
