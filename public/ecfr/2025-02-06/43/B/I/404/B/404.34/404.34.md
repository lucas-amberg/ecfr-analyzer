# ยง 404.34   Can Reclamation reduce the amount of non-Federal cost-share required for a feasibility study?

Yes. Reclamation may reduce the non-Federal cost-share required for a feasibility study to an amount less than 50 percent of the study costs if:


(a) Reclamation determines that there is an overwhelming Federal interest in conducting the feasibility study, and you demonstrate financial hardship. Financial hardship will be determined in accordance with Reclamation's standards, which are available at your local Reclamation office; and


(b) Reclamation consults with other Federal agencies that are partners in the project and determines that a reduction in the non-Federal cost-share is appropriate.
