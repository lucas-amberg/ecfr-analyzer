# ยง 404.35   Is there a different non-Federal cost-share requirement for feasibility studies that involve a community greater than 50,000 inhabitants?

Yes. If the feasibility study involves a rural water supply system that will serve a community with a population in excess of 50,000 inhabitants, pursuant to the exception provided in ยง 404.8, you may be required to pay more than 50 percent of the costs of the study. Determination of the appropriate amount of the non-Federal cost-share will be based on the same criteria used to evaluate your capability to pay the non-Federal share of construction costs, set forth in ยง 404.39.
