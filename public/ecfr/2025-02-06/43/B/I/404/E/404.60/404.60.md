# ยง 404.60   Does this rule contain an information collection that requires approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)?

Yes. This rule does contain an information collection that is approved by OMB, under Control Number 1006-0029. The Paperwork Reduction Act provides that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number.
