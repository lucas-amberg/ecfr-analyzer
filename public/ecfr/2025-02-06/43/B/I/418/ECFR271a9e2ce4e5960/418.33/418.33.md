# ยง 418.33   Purpose of the implementation strategy.

The intent of the implementation strategy for this part is to ensure that the District delivers water within entitlements at a reasonable level of efficiency as a long term average. 


(a) The incentives and disincentives provided in this part are designed to encourage local officials with responsibilities for Project operations to select and implement through their discretionary actions, operating strategies which achieve the principles of this part.


(b) The specified efficiencies in the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency table (ยง 418.13 (a)(4)) were developed considering implementation of reasonable conservation measures, historic project operations, economics, and environmental effects. 


(c) The efficiency target will be used as a performance standard to establish at the end of each year on the basis of actual operations, whether the District is entitled to a performance bonus in the form of incentive water or a reduction in storage for the amount borrowed ahead.
