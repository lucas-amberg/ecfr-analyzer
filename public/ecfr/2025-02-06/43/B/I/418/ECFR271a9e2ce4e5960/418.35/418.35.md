# ยง 418.35   Efficiencies.

The established target efficiencies under this part are shown in the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency table (ยง 418.13 (a)(4)). The efficiency of the Project will vary with the amount of entitlement water actually delivered at the headgates. Since most of the distribution system losses such as evaporation and seepage do not change significantly with the amount of water delivered (i.e., these losses are principally a function of water surface area and the wetted perimeter of the canals), the Project efficiency requirement is higher as the percent of entitlement water actually delivered at the headgates increases. The actual efficiency is calculated each year after the close of the irrigation season based on actual measured amounts. The application of any adjustments to Lahontan Reservoir storage or Truckee River diversions resulting from the efficiency is always prospective.
