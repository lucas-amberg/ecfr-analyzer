# ยง 426.10   Public entities.

(a) *Application of the acreage limitation provisions to public entities.* Reclamation does not subject public entities to the acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation law with respect to land that Reclamation determines public entities farm primarily for nonrevenue producing functions. However, public entities are required to meet certification and reporting requirements as specified in ยง 426.18.


(b) *Sale of public land.* Reclamation does not require public entities to seek price approval before they sell nonexempt lands. Once sold, Reclamation can make irrigation water available to such land if the purchaser meets RRA eligibility requirements.


(c) *Leasing of public land.* Public entities can lease irrigation land that they own or control to eligible landholders. Land leased from a public entity counts towards the lessee's ownership and nonfull-cost entitlement.
