# ยง 426.19   District responsibilities.

A district that delivers irrigation water to nonexempt land under a contract with the United States must:


(a) Provide information to landholders concerning the requirements of Federal reclamation law and these regulations;


(b) Provide Reclamation, as required by these regulations or upon request, and in a form suitable to Reclamation, records and information as Reclamation may deem reasonably necessary to implement the RRA and other provisions of Federal reclamation law;


(c) Be responsible for payments to Reclamation of all appropriate charges specified in these regulations. Districts must collect the appropriate charges from each landholder based on the landholder's acreage limitation status, landholdings, and entitlements, and must not average the costs over the entire district, unless the charges prove uncollectible from the responsible landholders;


(d) Distribute, collect, and review landholder certification and reporting forms;


(e) File and retain landholder certification and reporting forms. Districts must retain superseded landholder certification and reporting forms for 6 years; thereafter, districts may destroy such superseded forms, except:


(1) Districts must keep on file the last fully completed standard certification or reporting form, in addition to the current verification form; or


(2) If Reclamation specifically requests a district to retain superseded forms beyond 6 years.


(f) Comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, with respect to landholder certification and reporting forms;


(g) Annually summarize information provided on landholder certification and reporting forms on separate summary forms provided by Reclamation and submit these forms to Reclamation on or before the date established by the appropriate regional director;


(h) Withhold deliveries of irrigation water to any landholder not eligible to receive irrigation water under the certification or reporting requirements or any other provision of Federal reclamation law and these regulations; and


(i) Return to Reclamation, for deposit as a general credit to the Reclamation fund, all revenues received from the delivery of water to ineligible land. For purposes of these regulations only, this does not include revenues from any charges that may be assessed by the district to cover district operation, maintenance, and administrative expenses.
