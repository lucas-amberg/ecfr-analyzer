# § 428.7   What happens if a farm operator does not submit required forms.

(a) If you do not submit required RRA form(s) in any water year, then: 


(1) The district must not deliver irrigation water before you submit the required RRA form(s); and 


(2) You, the trustee, or the landholder(s) who holds the land (including to whom the land held in trust is attributed) must not accept delivery of irrigation water before you submit the required RRA form(s). 


(b) After you submit all required RRA forms to the district, we will restore eligibility. 


(c) If a district delivers irrigation water to land that is ineligible because you did not submit RRA forms as required by this part, we will assess administrative costs against the district as specified in § 426.20(e) of this chapter. We will determine these costs in the same manner used to determine costs for landholders under §§ 426.20(a)(1) through (3) of this chapter.
