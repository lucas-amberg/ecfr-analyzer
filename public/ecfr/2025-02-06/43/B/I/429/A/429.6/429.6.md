# ยง 429.6   When must water user organizations also approve use authorizations?

(a) Use authorizations for easements and rights-of-way for periods in excess of 25 years are also subject to approval from water user organizations under contract obligation for repayment of the project or division. This requirement does not apply to any other type of use authorizations.


(b) At a minimum, the appropriate water user organizations will be notified of all use authorizations prior to their issuance to avoid potential conflicts between the requested use authorization and the water user organizations' need to operate and maintain the facilities for which they have contractual responsibility.


(c) At the discretion of the responsible Regional Director, concurrence of the appropriate water user organizations not addressed in paragraph (a) of this section may be requested.
