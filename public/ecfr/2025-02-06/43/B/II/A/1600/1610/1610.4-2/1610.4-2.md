(a) The Field Manager will prepare criteria to guide development of the resource management plan or revision, to ensure:


(1) It is tailored to the issues previously identified; and


(2) That BLM avoids unnecessary data collection and analyses.


(b) Planning criteria will generally be based upon applicable law, Director and State Director guidance, the results of public participation, and coordination with any cooperating agencies and other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and federally recognized Indian tribes.


(c) BLM will make proposed planning criteria, including any significant changes, available for public comment prior to being approved by the Field Manager for use in the planning process.


(d) BLM may change planning criteria as planning proceeds if we determine that public suggestions or study and assessment findings make such changes desirable.
