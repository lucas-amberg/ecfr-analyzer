# ยง 1822.15   If I miss filing a required document or payment within the specified period, can BLM consider it timely filed anyway?

BLM may consider it timely filed if:


(a) The law does not prohibit BLM from doing so;


(b) No other BLM regulation prohibits doing so; and


(c) No intervening third party interests or rights have been created or established during the intervening period.
