# ยง 1823.12   When and how may I obtain a refund?

(a) In making a payment to BLM, if the funds or fees you submitted to BLM exceed the amount required or if the regulations provide that fees submitted to BLM must be returned in certain situations, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund.


(b) If you believe you are due a refund, you may request it from the BLM office where you previously submitted your payment. You should state the reasons you believe you are entitled to a refund and include a copy of the appropriate receipt, canceled check, or other relevant documents.
