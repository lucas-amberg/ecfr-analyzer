# ยง 1863.5-1   Evidence of title.

Evidence of title, when required by the regulations, must be submitted in such form and by such abstracter or company as may be satisfactory to the Bureau of Land Management. A policy of title insurance, or a certificate of title, may be accepted in lieu of an abstract, in proper cases, when issued by a title company. A policy of title insurance when furnished must be free from conditions and stipulations not acceptable to the Department of the Interior. A certificate of title will be accepted only where the certificate is made to the Government, or expressly for its benefit and where the interests of the Government will be sufficiently protected thereby.
