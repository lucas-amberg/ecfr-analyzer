# ยง 2091.6   Opening of withdrawn lands: General.

The term of a withdrawal ends upon expiration under its own terms, or upon revocation or termination by the Secretary by publication in the _Federal Register_ of a Public Land Order. Lands included in a withdrawal that is revoked, terminates or expires do not automatically become open, but are opened through publication in the _Federal Register_ of an opening order. An opening order may be incorporated in a Public Land Order that revokes or terminates a withdrawal or may be published in the _Federal Register_ as a separate document. In each case, the opening order specifies the time, date and specific conditions under which the lands are opened. (See subpart 2310.)
