# ยง 2310.3-5   Compensation for improvements.

(a) When an application is allowed, the applicant shall compensate the holder of record of each permit, license or lease lawfully terminated or revoked after the allowance of an application, for all authorized improvements placed on the lands under the terms and conditions of the permit, license or lease, before the lands were segregated or withdrawn. The amount of such compensation shall be determined by an appraisal as of the date of revocation or termination of the permit, license or lease, but shall not exceed fair market value. To the extent such improvements were constructed with Federal funds, they shall not be compensable unless the United States has been reimbursed for such funds prior to the allowance of the application and then only to the extent of the sum that the United States has received.


(b) When an application is allowed that affects public lands which are subject to permits or leases for the grazing of domestic livestock and that is required to be terminated, the applicant shall comply with the cancellation notice and compensation requirements of section 402(g) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1752(g)), to the extent applicable.
