# § 2361.10   Protection of surface resources.

(a) In administering the Reserve, the Bureau must protect surface resources by adopting whatever conditions, restrictions, and prohibitions it deems necessary or appropriate to mitigate reasonably foreseeable and significantly adverse effects of proposed oil and gas activities. Such conditions, restrictions, or prohibitions may involve conditioning, delaying action on, or denying some or all aspects of proposed oil and gas activities, and will fully consider community access and other infrastructure needs, after consultation with the North Slope Borough and consistent with § 2361.6.


(b) The Bureau will use the following procedures to protect surface resources from the reasonably foreseeable and significantly adverse effects of proposed oil and gas activities:


(1) The Bureau will maintain an Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) addressing management of all BLM-administered lands and minerals throughout the Reserve. When issuing a use authorization, the authorization must conform to the IAP and this subpart, including any subsequent designation or modifications of Special Areas. To the extent there is any inconsistency between the IAP and this subpart, this subpart governs;


(2) In each decision concerning proposed activity in the Reserve, the authorized officer will document consideration of, and adopt measures to mitigate, reasonably foreseeable and significantly adverse effects on fish and wildlife, water, cultural, paleontological, scenic, and any other surface resource. The authorized officer will take particular care to account for, and mitigate adverse effects on, surface resources that support subsistence uses and needs; and


(3) In assessing effects of a decision concerning proposed activity in the Reserve, the authorized officer will document consideration of any uncertainty concerning the nature, scope, and duration of potential effects on surface resources of the Reserve and shall ensure that any conditions, restrictions, or prohibitions on proposed oil and gas activities account for and reflect any such uncertainty.


(c) When affected surface resources are located in a Special Area, the authorized officer must comply with the procedures and requirements of §§ 2361.20 through 2361.60.


(d) The authorized officer must include in each decision and authorization related to proposed oil and gas activity in the Reserve such terms and conditions that provide the Bureau with sufficient ability to fully implement the requirements of this subpart.


(e)(1) To the extent consistent with the requirements of the Act, other applicable law, and the terms of any applicable existing authorization, and after consultation with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, federally recognized Tribes, and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act corporations, the authorized officer may limit, restrict, or prohibit the use of or access to lands within the Reserve, including Special Areas. Upon proper notice, as determined by the authorized officer, such actions may be taken to protect fish and wildlife breeding, nesting, spawning, lambing or calving, or migrations; subsistence uses and resources; and other environmental, scenic, or historic values.


(2) The consultation requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not required when the authorized officer determines that emergency measures are required.


(f) No site, structure, object, or other values of historical, cultural, or paleontological character, including, but not limited to, historic and prehistoric remains, fossils, and artifacts, shall be injured, altered, destroyed, or collected without authorization under an appropriate Federal permit and without compliance with applicable law governing cultural items, archaeological resources, and historic properties.
