# ยง 2361.40   Management of oil and gas activities in Special Areas.

The management priority within Special Areas is to assure maximum protection of significant resource values, consistent with the requirements of the Act for exploration and production of the Reserve. The Bureau must fulfill this duty at each stage in the decision-making process for oil and gas activities in the Reserve, and in accordance with the following procedures:


(a) The authorized officer must, to the extent consistent with the Act, take such steps as are necessary to avoid the adverse effects of proposed oil and gas activities on the significant resource values of Special Areas. This includes, but is not limited to, conditioning, delaying action on, or denying proposals for activities, either in whole or in part, and ensuring that leasing and production is approved only subject to the provisions of this section.


(b) The authorized officer will identify and adopt maximum protection measures for each significant resource value that is present in a Special Area when Special Areas are designated. The authorized officer will update maximum protection measures as appropriate thereafter, including in the IAP, lease terms, and permits to conduct oil and gas activities.


(c) Maximum protection may include, but is not limited to, requirements for:


(1) Rescheduling activities, including specifying rates of development, and requiring use of alternative routes;


(2) Limiting new infrastructure and roads;


(3) Limiting extraction of sand and gravel or withdrawal of water;


(4) Limiting types of vehicles and loadings;


(5) Limiting types of aircraft in combination with minimum flight altitudes and distances from identified places; and


(6) Applying special fuel handling procedures.


(d) Subject to any revisions made pursuant to ยง 2361.30, oil and gas leasing and authorization of new infrastructure in Special Areas will conform to the land use allocations and restrictions identified on the maps published as of June 6, 2024, and available for public inspection at the Arctic District Office.


(e) On lands within Special Areas that are allocated as closed to leasing or unavailable to new infrastructure, certain uses may be authorized under limited circumstances:


(1) The authorized officer may issue oil and gas leases in Special Areas if drainage is occurring. Any lease issued for drainage purposes will include provisions that prohibit surface-disturbing oil and gas activities on the entire lease tract.


(2) The authorized officer may approve new roads, pipelines, transmission lines, and other types of infrastructure in Special Areas provided that:


(i) The infrastructure will primarily be used by and provide a benefit to communities located within or in close proximity to the Reserve or will support subsistence activities; and


(ii) Appropriate measures are adopted to assure maximum protection of significant resource values.


(3) The authorized officer may approve new permanent infrastructure related to existing oil and gas leases only if such infrastructure is necessary to comport with the terms of a valid existing lease.


(f) On lands within Special Areas that are allocated as available for future oil and gas leasing or new infrastructure, the authorized officer will presume that proposed oil and gas activities should not be permitted unless specific information available to the authorized officer clearly demonstrates that those activities can be conducted with no or minimal adverse effects on significant resource values or unless they are necessary to comport with the terms of a valid existing lease.


(g) When preparing an environmental analysis of proposed leasing, exploration, development, or new infrastructure in Special Areas, and reaching a final decision, the authorized officer will:


(1) Provide the public with a meaningful opportunity to review and comment, and consider and respond to any relevant comment they receive;


(2) Consult with federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act corporations that use the affected Special Area for subsistence purposes or have historic, cultural, or economic ties to the Special Area;


(3) Evaluate potential adverse effects and measures to avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate such effects to achieve maximum protection of significant resource values;


(4) Document how the proposal falls within one of the exceptions in paragraph (e) of this section or the justification for overcoming the presumption in paragraph (f) of this section, such as if the proposed infrastructure is necessary to comport with the terms of a valid existing lease, or if it will primarily be used by and provide a benefit to communities located within or in close proximity to the Reserve, and the proposal has been conditioned to avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate adverse effects;


(5) Document and consider any uncertainty concerning the nature, scope, and duration of potential adverse effects on significant resource values of Special Areas and ensure that any actions taken to avoid, minimize, or mitigate such effects account for and reflect any such uncertainty; and


(6) Prepare a Statement of Adverse Effect, if the authorized officer determines that the proposal cannot avoid adverse effects on significant resource values in a Special Area. The Statement of Adverse Effect will describe the:


(i) Significant resource values that may be adversely affected;


(ii) Nature, scope, and duration of those adverse effects;


(iii) Measures the Bureau evaluated to avoid the adverse effects, including whether any practicable alternatives exist that would have less adverse impact on significant resource values of the Special Area;


(iv) Justification for not requiring those measures;


(v) Measures the authorized officer will require to minimize, to the maximum extent possible, adverse effects on significant resource values of the Special Area; and


(vi) Measures the authorized officer will require to mitigate any residual adverse effects that cannot be avoided or minimized, including compensatory mitigation, along with an explanation of how those measures will assure maximum protection of significant resource values.


(h) The authorized officer must include in each decision and authorization related to oil and gas activity in the Reserve terms and conditions that provide the authorized officer with sufficient authority to fully implement the requirements of this section.
