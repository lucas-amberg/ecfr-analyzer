# ยง 2430.2   General criteria for disposal classification.

The general approach to determine the act under which lands are to be classified and disposed of is as follows: 


(a) Consideration under criteria listed in this part will first be given to whether the lands can be classified for retention for multiple use management, for disposal, or for both. If, under these criteria, they could be classified for both, the principles of ยง 2410.2 will be applied. 


(b) If the lands are found to be suitable for disposal, consideration under the criteria of this part will be given to whether the lands are needed for urban or suburban purposes or whether they are chiefly valuable for other purposes. Lands found to be valuable for public purposes will be considered chiefly valuable for public purposes, except in situations where alternate sites are available to meet the public needs involved.
