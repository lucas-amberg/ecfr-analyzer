(a) To be valuable for public purposes, lands must be suitable for use by a State or local governmental entity or agency for some noncommercial and nonindustrial governmental program or suitable for transfer to a non-Federal interest in a transaction which will benefit a Federal, State, or local governmental program. 


(b) Lands found to be valuable for public purposes may be classified for sale pursuant to the Public Land Sale Act as chiefly valuable for public uses or development or for transfer in satisfaction of a State land grant, or for transfer to a State or local governmental agency in exchange for other property, or for transfer to a governmental agency under any applicable act of Congress other than the Recreation and Public Purposes Act (44 Stat. 741), as amended (43 U.S.C. 869-869-4), if (1) the proposed use includes profit activities or if the interested, qualified governmental agency and the authorized officer agree that there is no need for the perpetual dedication of the lands to public uses required by the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, and (2) in the case of sales under the Public Land Sale Act, adequate zoning regulations exist in the area in which the lands are located. 


(c) Lands found to be valuable for public purposes will ordinarily be classified for sale or lease under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act (see part 2740 and subpart 2912 of this chapter) if the proposed use involves nonprofit activities and if it is determined by the authorized officer that the provisions of that Act are required to insure the continued dedication of the lands to such uses, or otherwise to carry out the purposes of the Act. 


(d) Lands may be classified for exchange under appropriate authority where they are found to be chiefly valuable for public purposes because they have special values, arising from the interest of exchange proponents, for exchange for other lands which are needed for the support of a Federal program.
