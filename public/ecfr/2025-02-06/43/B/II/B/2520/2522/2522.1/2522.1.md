# ยง 2522.1   General acts authorizing extensions of time.

(a) There are five general Acts of Congress which authorize the allowance, under certain conditions, of an extension of time for the submission of final proof by a desert-land claimant. Said Acts are the following: June 27, 1906 (Sec. 5, 34 Stat. 520; 43 U.S.C. 448); March 28, 1908 (Sec. 3, 35 Stat. 52; 43 U.S.C. 333); April 30, 1912 (37 Stat. 106; 43 U.S.C. 334); March 4, 1915 (Sec. 5, 38 Stat. 1161; 43 U.S.C. 335); and February 25, 1925 (43 Stat. 982; 43 U.S.C. 336). The Act of June 27, 1906, is applicable only to entries embraced within the exterior limits of some withdrawal or irrigation project under the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388). 


(b) In addition to the Acts cited in this section, extensions of time for making desert-land proofs were authorized by the Acts of June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 274; 43 U.S.C. 256a), July 26, 1935 (49 Stat. 504; 43 U.S.C. 256a), and June 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 303; 43 U.S.C. 256a). Such Acts affect only proofs becoming due on or before December 31, 1936. For that reason, the regulations which were issued thereunder have not been included in this chapter.
