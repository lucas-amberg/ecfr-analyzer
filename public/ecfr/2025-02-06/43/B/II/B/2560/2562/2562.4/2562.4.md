# ยง 2562.4   Survey.

(a) If the land applied for be unsurveyed and no objection to its survey is known to the authorizing officer, he will furnish the applicant with a certificate stating the facts, and, after receiving such certificate, the applicant may make application to the State Director for the survey of the land. Upon receipt of an application, the State Director will, if conditions make such procedure practicable and no objection is shown by his records, furnish the applicant with an estimate of the cost of field and office work, and upon receipt of the deposit required will issue appropriate instructions for the survey of the claim, such survey to be made not later than the next surveying season. The sum so deposited by the applicant for survey will be deemed an appropriation thereof and will be held to be expended in the payment of the cost of the survey, including field and office work, and upon the acceptance of the survey any excess over the cost shall be repaid to the depositor or his legal representative. 


(b) In case it is decided that by reason of the inaccessibility of the locality embraced in an application for the survey, or by reason of other conditions, it will result to the advantage of the Government or claimant to have the survey executed by a deputy surveyor, the State Director will deliver an order to the applicant for such survey, which will be sufficient authority for any deputy surveyor to make a survey of the claim. 


(c) In the latter contingency the survey must be made at the expense of the applicant, and no right will be recognized as initiated by such application unless actual work on the survey is begun and carried to completion without unnecessary delay.
