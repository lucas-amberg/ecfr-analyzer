# ยง 2565.7   Final report of trustee; disposition of unexpended moneys and unsold lots.

After the disposal of a sufficient number of lots to pay all expenses incident to the execution of the trust, including the cost of the subdivisional survey, the trustee will make and transmit to the Bureau of Land Management his final report of his trusteeship, showing all amounts received and paid out and the balance remaining on hand derived from assessments upon the lots and from the public sale. The proceeds derived from such sources, after deducting all expenses, may be used by the trustee on direction of the Secretary of the Interior, where the town is unincorporated, in making public improvements, or, if the town is incorporated such remaining proceeds may be turned over to the municipality for the use and benefit thereof. After the public sale and upon proof of the incorporation of the town, all lots then remaining unsold will be deeded to the municipality, and all municipal public reserves will, by a separate deed, be conveyed to the municipality in trust for the public purposes for which they were reserved.
