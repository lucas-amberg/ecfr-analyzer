(a) *Orders revoked.* All Executive orders heretofore issued for the disposition of townsites along the Government railroads in Alaska are hereby revoked so far as they conflict with §§ 2566.1 and 2566.2. This order is intended to take the place of all other orders making provisions for the sale and disposal of lots in said townsites along Government railroads in Alaska under the provisions of said Act.

(2) As to the lots within said townsite which have been forfeited for failure to pay such assessments, upon which valuable improvements have been placed, the provisions of said order regarding the collection of the unpaid assessments remain effective. 


(3) This order shall continue in full force and effect unless and until revoked by the President or by Act of Congress.
