# § 2568.110   If I qualify for Federal land in one of the categories BLM cannot convey, is there any other way for me to receive an allotment?

Yes. If you qualify for land in one of the categories listed in section 2568.91 which BLM cannot convey, you may choose an alternative allotment from the following types of land within the same ANCSA Region as the land for which you originally qualified: 


(a) Land within an original withdrawal under section 11(a)(1) of ANCSA for selection by a Village Corporation which was: 


(1) Not selected, 


(2) Selected and later relinquished, or 


(3) Selected and later rejected by BLM; 


(b) Land outside of, but touching a boundary of a Village withdrawal, not including land described in section 2568.91 or land within a National Park; or


(c) Vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved land. (For purposes of this section, the term “unreserved” includes land withdrawn solely under the authority of section 17(d)(1) of ANCSA.)
