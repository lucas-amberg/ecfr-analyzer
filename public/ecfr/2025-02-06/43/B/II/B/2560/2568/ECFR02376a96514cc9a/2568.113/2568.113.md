# ยง 2568.113   Do I have to prove that I used and occupied the land I've chosen as an alternative allotment?

No. If BLM cannot convey the allotment for which you originally apply, and you are eligible to choose an alternative allotment, you do not have to prove that you used and occupied the land in the alternative location.
