# § 2568.90   If I qualify for an allotment, what land may BLM convey to me?

You may receive title only to: 


(a) Land that: 


(1) Is currently owned by the Federal government, 


(2) Was vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved when you first began to use and occupy it, 


(3) Has not been continuously withdrawn since before your sixth birthday, 


(4) You started using before December 14, 1968, the date when Public Land Order 4582 withdrew all unreserved public lands in Alaska from all forms of appropriation and disposition under the public land laws, and 


(5) You prove by a preponderance of the evidence that you used and occupied in a substantially continuous and independent manner, at least potentially exclusive of others, for five or more years. This possession of the land must not be merely intermittent. “Preponderance of evidence” means evidence which is more convincing than the evidence offered in opposition to it; that is, evidence which as a whole shows that the fact you are trying to prove is more likely a fact than not. 


(b) Substitute land explained in 43 CFR 2568.110.
