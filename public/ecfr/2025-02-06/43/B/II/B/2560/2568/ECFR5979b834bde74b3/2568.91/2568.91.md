You cannot receive an allotment containing any of the following: 


(a) A regularly used and recognized campsite that is primarily used by someone other than yourself. The campsite area that you cannot receive is that which is actually used as a campsite. 


(b) Land presently selected by, but not conveyed to, the State of Alaska. The State may relinquish up to 160 acres of its selection to allow an eligible Native veteran to receive an allotment; 


(c) Land presently selected by, but not conveyed to, a Native corporation as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1602(m). A Native corporation may relinquish up to 160 acres of its selection to allow an eligible Native veteran to receive an allotment, as long as the remaining ANCSA selection comports with the appropriate selection rules in 43 CFR 2650. Any such relinquishment must not cause the corporation to become underselected. See 43 U.S.C. 1621(j)(2) for a definition of underselection; 


(d) Land designated as wilderness by statute; 


(e) Land acquired by the Federal government through gift, purchase, or exchange; 


(f) Land containing any development owned or controlled by a unit of government, or a person other than yourself; 


(g) Land withdrawn or reserved for national defense, other than the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska; 


(h) National Forest land; or 


(i) Land selected or claimed, but not yet conveyed, under a public land law, including but not limited to the following:


(1) Land within a recorded mining claim; 


(2) Home sites; 


(3) Trade and manufacturing sites; 


(4) Reindeer sites and headquarters sites; 


(5) Cemetery sites.
