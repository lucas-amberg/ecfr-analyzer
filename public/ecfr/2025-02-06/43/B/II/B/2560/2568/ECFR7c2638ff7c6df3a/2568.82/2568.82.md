# ยง 2568.82   If BLM decides that I have not submitted enough information to show qualifying use and occupancy, will it reject my application or give me a chance to submit more information?

(a) BLM will not reject your application without giving you an opportunity for a hearing to establish the facts of your use. 


(b) If BLM cannot determine from the information you submit that you met the use and occupancy requirements of the 1906 Act, it will send you a notice saying that you have not submitted enough evidence and will give you at least 60 days to file additional information. 


(c) If you do not submit additional evidence by the end of the time BLM gives you or if you submit additional evidence but BLM still cannot determine that you meet the use and occupancy requirements, the following process will occur: 


(1) BLM will issue a formal contest complaint telling you why it believes it should reject your application. 


(2) If you answer the complaint and tell BLM you want a hearing, BLM will ask an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Interior Department, Office of Hearings and Appeals, to preside over a hearing to establish the facts of your use and occupancy. 


(3) The ALJ will evaluate all the written evidence and oral testimony and issue a decision. 


(4) You can appeal this decision to the Interior Board of Land Appeals according to 43 CFR part 4.
