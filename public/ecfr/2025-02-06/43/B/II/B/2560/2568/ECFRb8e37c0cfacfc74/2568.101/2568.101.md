# ยง 2568.101   If the land I used and occupied is within a CSU other than a National Wilderness or any part of a National Forest, can I receive a title to it?

You may receive title if you qualify for that allotment and the managing agency of the CSU agrees that conveyance of that allotment is not inconsistent with the purposes of the CSU.
