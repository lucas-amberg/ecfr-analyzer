# ยง 2568.50   What qualifications do I need to be eligible for an allotment?

To qualify for an allotment you must: 


(a) Have been eligible for an allotment under the Native Allotment Act as it was in effect before December 18, 1971; and 


(b) Establish that you used land in accordance with the regulation in effect before December 18, 1971, and that the land is still owned by the Federal government; and 


(c) Be a veteran who served at least six months between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 1971, or enlisted or was drafted after June 2, 1971, but before December 3, 1971; and


(d) Not have already received conveyance or approval of an allotment. (However, if you are otherwise qualified to receive an allotment under the Alaska Native Veterans Allotment Act, you will still qualify even if you received another allotment interest by inheritance, devise, gift, or purchase); and 


(e) Not have a Native allotment application pending on October 21, 1998; and 


(f) Reside in the State of Alaska or, in the case of a deceased veteran, have been a resident of Alaska at the time of death.
