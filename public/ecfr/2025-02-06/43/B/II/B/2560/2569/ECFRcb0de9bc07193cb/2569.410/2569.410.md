(a) If an error is found, the BLM will send you a notice identifying any correctable errors or omissions and whether the error is substantive or technical.


(1) You will have 60 days from the date you received the notice to correct the errors or provide the omitted materials.


(2) If you do not submit the corrections to the BLM within the 60-day period, the BLM will issue a decision rejecting your application and require you to submit a new application.
