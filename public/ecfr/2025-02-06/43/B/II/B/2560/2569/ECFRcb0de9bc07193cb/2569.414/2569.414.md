# ยง 2569.414   May I request an extension of time to respond to Notices?

The BLM will allow reasonable extensions of deadlines in Notices for good cause. The request for the extension must be received from the Eligible Individual prior to the end of the 60-day period and provide the reason an extension is needed.
