(a) *Lands included in grant.* (1) Section 2 of the Act of January 25, 1927 (44 Stat. 1027; 43 U.S.C. 871) reads as follows: 


(2) The only grants affected in any way by the provisions of the Act of January 25, 1927, are those of numbered sections of land in place made to the States for the support of common or public schools. The adjudication of claims to land asserted under other grants, for indemnity or lieu lands and exchanges of lands, will proceed as theretofore, being governed by the provisions of existing laws applicable thereto. The States will be afforded full opportunity, however, if the facts and conditions are such as to authorize such action, either to assign new base in support of or to withdraw pending unapproved indemnity school land selections in support of which mineral school-section lands have been tendered as base. 


(b) *Lands excluded from grant.* (1) Subsection (c) of section 1 of the Act of January 25, 1927, provides: 


(2) School-section lands included within the limits of existing reservations of or by the United States, specifically reserved for waterpower purposes, or included in any suit or proceedings in the courts of the United States, prior to January 25, 1927, and all lands in Alaska are excluded from the provisions of the Act. (ยง 2623.4)
