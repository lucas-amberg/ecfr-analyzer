The notice shall provide public comment period of 45 days from the date of publication in the _Federal Register._ Comments shall be sent to the Bureau of Land Management office issuing the notice.


(b) The notice of realty action may segregate the lands or interests in lands to be conveyed to the extent that they will not be subject to appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. The segregative effect of the notice of realty action shall terminate either upon the issuance of a document of conveyance or 1 year after the date of publication, whichever occurs first.
