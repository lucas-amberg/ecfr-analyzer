# ยง 2650.4-3   Administration.

Leases, contracts, permits, rights-of-way, or easements granted prior to the issuance of any conveyance under this authority shall continue to be administered by the State of Alaska or by the United States after the conveyance has been issued, unless the responsible agency waives administration. Where the responsible agency is an agency of the Department of the Interior, administration shall be waived when the conveyance covers all the land embraced within a lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement, unless there is a finding by the Secretary that the interest of the United States requires continuation of the administration by the United States. In the latter event, the Secretary shall not renegotiate or modify any lease, contract, right-of-way or easement, or waive any right or benefit belonging to the grantee until he has notified the grantee and allowed him an opportunity to present his views.
