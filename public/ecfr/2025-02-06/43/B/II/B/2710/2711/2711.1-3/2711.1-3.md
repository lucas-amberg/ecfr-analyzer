# ยง 2711.1-3   Sales requiring grazing permit or lease cancellations.

When lands are identified for disposal and such disposal will preclude livestock grazing, the sale shall not be made until the permittees and lessees are given 2 years prior notification, except in cases of emergency, that their grazing permit or grazing lease and grazing preference may be cancelled in accordance with ยง 4110.4-2(b) of this title. A sale may be made of such identified lands if the sale is conditioned upon continued grazing by the current permittee/lessee until such time as the current grazing permit or lease would have expired or terminated. A permittee or lessee may unconditionally waive the 2-year prior notification. The publication of a notice of realty action as provided in ยง 2711.1-2(c) of this title shall constitute notice to the grazing permittee or lessee if such notice has not been previously given.
