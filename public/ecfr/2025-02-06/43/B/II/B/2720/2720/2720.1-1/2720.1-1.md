# § 2720.1-1   Filing of application.

(a) Any existing or prospective record owner of the surface of land in which mineral interests are reserved or otherwise owned by the United States may file an application to purchase such mineral interests if— 


(1) He has reason to believe that there are no known mineral values in the land, or 


(2) The reservation of ownership of the mineral interests in the United States interferes with or precludes appropriate non-mineral development of the land and such development would be a more beneficial use of the land than its mineral development.


(b) Publication in the _Federal Register_ of a notice of the filing of an application under this part shall segregate the mineral interests owned by the United States in the public lands covered by the application to the extent that they will not be subject to appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. The segregative effect of the application shall terminate either upon issuance of a patent or other document of conveyance to such mineral interests, upon final rejection of the application or 2 years from the date of filing of the application which ever occurs first.
