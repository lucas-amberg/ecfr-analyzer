# ยง 2802.10   What lands are available for grants?

(a) In its discretion, BLM may grant rights-of-way on any lands under its jurisdiction except when:


(1) A statute, regulation, or public land order specifically excludes rights-of-way;


(2) The lands are specifically segregated or withdrawn from right-of-way uses; or


(3) BLM identifies areas in its land use plans or in the analysis of an application as inappropriate for right-of-way uses.


(b) BLM may require common use of a right-of-way and may require, to the extent practical, location of new rights-of-way within existing or designated right-of-way corridors (*see* ยง 2802.11 of this subpart). Safety and other considerations may limit the extent to which you may share a right-of-way. BLM will designate right-of-way corridors through land use plan decisions.


(c) You should contact the BLM to:


(1) Determine the appropriate BLM office with which to coordinate;


(2) Determine whether or not the land you want to use is available for that use; and


(3) Begin discussions about any application(s) you may need to file.
