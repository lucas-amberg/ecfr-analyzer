# ยง 2803.11   Can another person act on my behalf?

Another person may act on your behalf if you have authorized that person to do so under the laws of the State where the right-of-way is or will be located.


(a) If you intend to designate another person or entity to act on your behalf or operate as your third-party agent, you must first:


(1) Notify the BLM office having jurisdiction over your grant in writing of your intention and provide a copy of the Power of Attorney, if one exists; and


(2) Provide and then maintain the current contact information for the intended agent.


(b) If you designate an agent or third-party to act on your behalf after you have been issued a grant, you are still responsible for ensuring the terms and conditions of the grant are followed.
