# ยง 2804.23   What costs am I responsible for when the BLM decides to use a competitive process for lands included in my application?

If the BLM decides to use a competitive process for lands included in your application and your application is in:


(a) *Processing Categories 1 through 4.* You must reimburse the Federal Government for processing costs as if the other application or applications had not been filed.


(b) *Processing Category 6.* You are responsible for processing costs identified in your application. If the BLM cannot readily separate costs, such as costs associated with preparing environmental analyses, you and any competing applicants must pay an equal share, or a proportion agreed to in writing among all applicants and the BLM. If you agree to share the costs that are common to your application and that of a competing applicant, and the competitor does not pay the agreed upon amount, you are liable for the entire amount due. You must pay the entire processing fee in advance. The BLM will not process your application until we receive the advance payments.
