# ยง 2804.28   What processing fees must I pay for a BLM grant application associated with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses or re-license applications under part I of the Federal Power Act (FPA)?

(a) You must reimburse BLM for the costs which the United States incurs in processing your grant application associated with a FERC project, other than those described at ยง 2801.6(b)(7) of this part. BLM also requires reimbursement for processing a grant application associated with a FERC project licensed before October 24, 1992, that involves the use of additional public lands outside the original area reserved under section 24 of the FPA.


(b) BLM will determine the amount you must pay by using the processing fee categories described at ยง 2804.14 of this subpart and bill you for the costs. FERC will address other costs associated with processing a FERC license or relicense (*see* 18 CFR chapter I).
