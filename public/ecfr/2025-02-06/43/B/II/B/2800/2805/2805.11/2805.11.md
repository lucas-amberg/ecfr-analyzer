# ยง 2805.11   What does a grant or lease contain?

The grant states what your rights are on the lands subject to the grant and contains information about:


(a) *What lands you can use or occupy.* The lands may or may not correspond to those for which you applied. BLM will limit the grant to those lands which BLM determines:


(1) You will occupy with authorized facilities;


(2) Are necessary for constructing, operating, maintaining, and terminating the authorized facilities;


(3) Are necessary to protect the public health and safety;


(4) Will not unnecessarily damage the environment; and


(5) Will not result in unnecessary or undue degradation.


(b) *Right of ingress and egress to a right-of-way.* To facilitate the use of a right-of-way, the authorized officer must include in the grant rights of ingress and egress, as may be necessary for access to and from the right-of-way. Access routes must be identified in the grant and may include existing roads or other infrastructure.




(c) *How long you can use the right-of-way.* Each grant will state the length of time that you are authorized to use the right-of-way.


(1) BLM will consider the following factors in establishing a reasonable term:


(i) The public purpose served;


(ii) Cost and useful life of the facility;


(iii) Time limitations imposed by licenses or permits required by other Federal agencies and state, tribal, or local governments; and


(iv) The time necessary to accomplish the purpose of the grant.


(2) Specific terms for energy grants and leases, such as solar or wind energy development projects, are as follows:




(i) For an energy site-specific testing grant, the term is 3 years or less, without the option of renewal;


(ii) For an energy project-area testing grant, the initial term is 3 years or less, with the option to renew for one additional 3-year period when the renewal application is also accompanied by a solar or wind energy development application and a POD as required by ยง 2804.25(e)(3);


(iii) For a short-term grant for all other associated actions not specifically included in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, such as geotechnical testing and other temporary land disturbing activities, the term is 3 years or less;


(iv) Energy generation facilities, including solar or wind energy development facilities, are authorized with a grant or lease for up to 50 years (plus initial partial year of issuance), subject to the terms and conditions including but not limited to ยง 2805.12(c); and




(v) Energy storage facilities which are separate from energy generation facilities are authorized with a right-of-way grant for up to 50 years, subject to the terms and conditions including but not limited to ยง 2805.12(c);




(3) All grants and leases, except those issued for a term of 3 years or less and those issued in perpetuity, will expire on December 31 of the final year of the grant or lease. For grants and leases with terms greater than 3 years, the actual term includes the number of full years specified, plus the initial partial year, if any.


(4) Electric transmission lines with a capacity of 100 kV or more are authorized with a right-of-way grant for up to 50 years.
