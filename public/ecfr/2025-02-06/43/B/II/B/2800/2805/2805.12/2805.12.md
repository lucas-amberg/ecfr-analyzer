(b) You must comply with the bonding requirements under § 2805.20. The BLM will not issue a Notice to Proceed or give written approval to proceed with ground disturbing activities until you comply with this requirement.


(c) By accepting a grant or lease for solar or wind energy development, you also agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. You must:


(1) Not begin any ground disturbing activities until the BLM issues a Notice to Proceed (see § 2807.10) or written approval to proceed with ground disturbing activities;


(2) Complete construction within the timeframes in the approved POD, but no later than 24 months after the start of construction, unless the project has been approved for staged development, or as otherwise authorized by the BLM;


(3) If an approved POD provides for staged development, unless otherwise approved by the BLM:


(i) Begin construction of the initial phase of development within 12 months after issuance of the Notice to Proceed, but no later than 24 months after the effective date of the right-of-way authorization;


(ii) Begin construction of each stage of development (following the first) within 3 years of the start of construction of the previous stage of development, and complete construction of that stage no later than 24 months after the start of construction of that stage, unless otherwise authorized by the BLM; and


(iii) Have no more than 3 development stages, unless otherwise authorized by the BLM;


(4) Maintain all onsite electrical generation equipment and facilities in accordance with the design standards in the approved POD;


(5) Repair and place into service, or remove from the site, damaged or abandoned facilities that:


(i) Have been inoperative for any continuous period of 3 months and present a hazard to the public lands; or


(ii) Present a hazard to human health or safety. You must take appropriate remedial action within 30 days after receipt of a written noncompliance notice unless you have been provided an extension of time by the BLM. Alternatively, you must show good cause for any delays in repairs, use, or removal; estimate when corrective action will be completed; provide evidence of diligent operation of the facilities; and submit a written request for an extension of the 30-day deadline. If you do not comply with this provision, the BLM may suspend or terminate the authorization under §§ 2807.17 through 2807.19; and






(6) Comply with the diligent development provisions of the authorization or the BLM may suspend or terminate your grant or lease under §§ 2807.17 through 2807.19. Before suspending or terminating the authorization, the BLM will send you a notice that gives you a reasonable opportunity to correct any noncompliance or to start or resume use of the right-of-way (see § 2807.18). In response to this notice, you must:


(i) Provide reasonable justification for any delays in construction (for example, delays in equipment delivery, legal challenges, and acts of God);


(ii) Provide the anticipated date of completion of construction and evidence of progress toward the start or resumption of construction; and


(iii) Submit a written request under paragraph (e) of this section for extension of the timelines in the approved POD. If you do not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the BLM may deny your request for an extension of the timelines in the approved POD.


(7) In addition to the RCE requirements of § 2805.20(a)(5) for a grant, the bond secured for a grant or lease must cover the estimated costs of cultural resource and Indian cultural resource identification, protection, and mitigation for project impacts.


(8) Comply with the operational standards in this section for solar or wind energy development projects on public lands. The holder of a grant or lease for solar or wind energy development is authorized to operate for the purpose of generating energy. Diligent operation requires the holder to annually maintain at least 75 percent of energy generation capacity for the authorized development. Failure to meet this required generation in continuous two calendar year period during the term of the grant or lease may support suspension or termination of the grant or lease under §§ 2807.17 through 2807.19. Before suspending or terminating the authorization, the BLM will send you a notice that gives you a reasonable opportunity to correct any noncompliance or to start or resume use of the right-of-way (see § 2807.18). In response to this notice, you must:


(i) Provide reasonable justification for any reductions in energy generation (for example, delays in equipment delivery, legal challenges, and Acts of God);


(ii) Provide the anticipated date in which production of energy generation will resume; and


(iii) Submit a written request under paragraph (e) of this section for extension of the period in which the holder must satisfy the minimum energy threshold. If you do not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(8) of this section, the BLM may deny your request for an extension of the period for complying with the minimum energy generation threshold.


(d) For energy site or project testing grants:


(1) You must install all monitoring facilities within 12 months after the effective date of the grant or other authorization. If monitoring facilities under a site testing and monitoring right-of-way authorization have not been installed within 12 months after the effective date of the authorization or consistent with the timeframe of the approved POD, you must request an extension pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;


(2) You must maintain all onsite equipment and facilities in accordance with the approved design standards;


(3) You must repair and place into service, or remove from the site, damaged or abandoned facilities that:


(i) Have been inoperative for any continuous period of 3 months and present a hazard to the public lands; or


(ii) Present a hazard to human health or safety; and


(4) If you do not comply with the diligent development provisions of either the site testing and monitoring authorization or the project testing and monitoring authorization, the BLM may terminate your authorization under § 2807.17.


(e) *Notification of noncompliance and request for alternative requirements.* (1) As soon as you anticipate that you will not meet any stipulation, term, or condition of the approved right-of-way grant or lease, or in the event of your noncompliance with any such stipulation, term, or condition, you must notify the BLM in writing and show good cause for the noncompliance, including an explanation of the reasons for the failure.


(2) You may also request that the BLM consider alternative stipulations, terms, or conditions, other than rents or fees, and except as provided in § 2806.52(b)(1)(i). Any proposed alternative stipulation, term, or condition must comply with applicable law in order to be considered. Any proposed alternative to applicable bonding requirements must provide the United States with adequate financial assurance for potential liabilities associated with your right-of-way grant or lease. Any such request is not approved until you receive BLM approval in writing.
