# § 2806.26   How may I make rental payments when land encumbered by my perpetual easement issued under § 2807.15(b) is being transferred out of Federal ownership?

(a) The BLM will use the appraisal report for the land transfer action (i.e., direct or indirect land sales, land exchanges, and other land disposal actions) and other acceptable market information to determine the one-time rental payment for a perpetual easement issued under § 2807.15(b).


(b) When no acceptable market information is available and no appraisal report has been completed for the land transfer action or when the BLM requests it, you must prepare an appraisal report as required under § 2806.25(d). You may also submit an appraisal report on your own initiative in accordance with § 2806.25(d).
