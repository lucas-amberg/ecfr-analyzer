(a) You must pay rent for the initial rental period before the BLM issues you a grant or lease.


(1) If your grant or lease is effective on:




(i) January 1 through September 30 and qualifies for annual payments, your initial rent bill is pro-rated to include only the remaining full months in the initial year; or


(ii) October 1 through December 31 and qualifies for annual payments, your initial rent bill is pro-rated to include the remaining full months in the initial year plus the next full year.


(2) If your grant or lease allows for multiyear payments, such as a short-term grant issued for energy site-specific testing, you may request that your initial rent bill be for the full term instead of the initial rent bill periods provided under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.




(b) You must make all rent payments for rights-of-way according to the payment plan described in ยง 2806.24.
