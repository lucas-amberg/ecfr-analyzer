# ยง 2806.70   How will the BLM determine the payment for a grant or lease when the linear, communication use, solar energy, or wind energy payment schedules do not apply?

When we determine that the linear, communication use, solar, or wind energy payment schedules do not apply, we may determine your payment through a process based on comparable commercial practices, appraisals, competitive bids, or other reasonable methods. We will notify you in writing of the payment determination. If you disagree with the payment determination, you may appeal our final determination under ยง 2801.10.
