# ยง 2807.22   How do I renew my grant or lease?

(a) If your grant or lease specifies the terms and conditions for its renewal, and you choose to renew it, you must request a renewal from the BLM at least 120 calendar days before your grant or lease expires consistent with the renewal terms and conditions specified in your grant or lease. We will renew the grant or lease if you are in compliance with the renewal terms and conditions; the other terms, conditions, and stipulations of the grant or lease; and other applicable laws and regulations.


(b) If your grant or lease does not specify the terms and conditions for its renewal, you may apply to us to renew the grant or lease. You must send us your application at least 120 calendar days before your grant or lease expires. In your application you must show that you are in compliance with the terms, conditions, and stipulations of the grant or lease and other applicable laws and regulations, and explain why a renewal of your grant or lease is necessary. We may approve or deny your application to renew your grant or lease.


(c) Submit your application under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and include the same information necessary for a new application (*see* subpart 2804 of this part). You must reimburse BLM in advance for the administrative costs of processing the renewal in accordance with ยง 2804.14 of this part.


(d) We will review your application and determine the applicable terms and conditions of any renewed grant or lease.


(e) BLM will not renew grants issued before October 21, 1976. If you hold such a grant and would like to continue to use the right-of-way beyond your grant's expiration date, you must apply to BLM for a new FLPMA grant (*see* subpart 2804 of this part). You must send BLM your application at least 120 calendar days before your grant expires.


(f) If you make a timely and sufficient application for a renewal of your existing grant, in accordance with this section, and you are in conformance with applicable laws, regulations, and terms and conditions in your grant, the existing grant does not expire until the BLM has issued a decision to approve or deny the renewal application. Within 60 days of receiving an application for a renewal, the BLM will notify you in writing of its determination regarding the timeliness and sufficiency of your application. If the BLM determines that your application is timely and sufficient, the BLM's written notice will confirm that until the BLM issues a decision on your renewal application, your existing grant will remain valid, provided that you remain in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and terms and conditions.




(g) If BLM denies your application, you may appeal the decision under ยง 2801.10 of this part.


(h) If you do not submit your application under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section at least 120 days prior to grant expiration, it is considered delinquent; the BLM will not be subject to the customer service standards in this section; and it will be processed only as the BLM has time and resources available.
