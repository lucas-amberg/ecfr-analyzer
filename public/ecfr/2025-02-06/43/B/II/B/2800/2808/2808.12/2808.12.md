# ยง 2808.12   May I receive a grant if I am or have been in trespass?

Until you satisfy your liability for a trespass, BLM will not process any applications you have pending for any activity on BLM-administered lands. A history of trespass will not necessarily disqualify you from receiving a grant. In order to correct a trespass, you must apply under the procedures described at subpart 2804 of this part. BLM will process your application as if it were a new use. Prior unauthorized use does not create a preference for receiving a grant.
