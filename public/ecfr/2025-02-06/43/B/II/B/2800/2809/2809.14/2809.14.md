# § 2809.14   What types of bids are acceptable?

(a) *Bid submissions.* The BLM will accept your bid only if:


(1) It includes the minimum bid and at least 20 percent of the bonus bid; and


(2) The BLM determines that you are qualified to hold a grant or lease under § 2803.10. You must include documentation of your qualifications with your bid, unless we have previously approved your qualifications under § 2809.10(d) or § 2809.11(d).


(b) *Minimum bid.* The minimum bid is not prorated among all bidders, but must be paid entirely by the successful bidder. The minimum bid consists of:


(1) The administrative costs incurred by the BLM and other Federal agencies in preparing for and conducting the competitive offer, including required environmental reviews; and


(2) An amount determined by the authorized officer and disclosed in the notice of competitive offer. This amount will be based on known or potential values of the parcel. In setting this amount, the BLM will consider factors that include, but are not limited to, the acreage rent and megawatt capacity fee.


(c) *Bonus bid.* The bonus bid consists of any dollar amount that a bidder wishes to bid in addition to the minimum bid.


(d) If you are not the successful bidder, as defined in § 2809.15(a), the BLM will refund your bid.
