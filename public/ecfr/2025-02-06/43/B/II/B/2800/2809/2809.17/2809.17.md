# ยง 2809.17   Will the BLM ever reject bids or re-conduct a competitive process?

(a) The BLM may reject bids regardless of the amount offered. If the BLM rejects your bid under this provision, you will be notified in writing and such notice will include the reason(s) for the rejection and what refunds to which you are entitled. If the BLM rejects a bid, the bidder may appeal that decision under ยง 2801.10.


(b) We may make the next highest bidder the successful bidder if the first successful bidder does not satisfy the requirements of ยง 2809.15, does not execute the lease, or is for any reason disqualified from holding the lease.




(c) If we are unable to determine the successful bidder, such as in the case of a tie, we may re-offer the lands competitively (under ยง 2809.13) to the tied bidders or to all prospective bidders.
