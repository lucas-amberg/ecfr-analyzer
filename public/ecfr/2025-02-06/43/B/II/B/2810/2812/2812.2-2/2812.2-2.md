# § 2812.2-2   Right of permittee to authorize use by third parties.

A permittee may not authorize other persons to use the right-of-way for the transportation of forest products which are not owned by the permittee. Any person, other than the permittee or a licensee of the United States who desires to use the right-of-way for such purposes, is required to make application therefor and to comply with all the provisions of these regulations relating to applications and applicants: *Provided, however,* That upon the request of a permittee the authorized officer may, with respect to an independent contractor who desires to use such right-of-way for the transportation of forest products owned by such independent contractor and derived from timber or logs acquired by him from such permittee, waive the requirements of this sentence. Where the right-of-way involved has been substantially improved by the holder of an outstanding permit, any subsequent permit issued for the same right-of-way will be conditioned upon the subsequent permittee's agreement while the prior permit is outstanding, to be bound by the road rules of and to pay fair compensation to, the prior permittee, such rules and compensation to be agreed upon by the prior and subsequent permittee in accordance with the procedures and standards established by the regulations in §§ 2812.4-1, 2812.4-3, and 2812.4-4 of this subpart.
