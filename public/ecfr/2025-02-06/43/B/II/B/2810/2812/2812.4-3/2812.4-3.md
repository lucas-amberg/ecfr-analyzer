# ยง 2812.4-3   Agreements and arbitration between permittee and licensee respecting adjustment of road use.

(a) When the United States exercises the right received under this paragraph to use or to license any person to use a road of a permittee, the permittee or his successor in interest shall not unreasonably obstruct the United States or such licensee in such use. If there has been no agreement under ยง 2812.3-7 covering such matters, the permittee shall have the right to prescribe reasonable operating regulations, to apply uniformly as between the permittee and such licensee, covering the use of such road for such matters as speed and load limits, scheduling of hauls during period of use by more than one timber operator, coordination of peak periods of use, and such other matters as are reasonably related to safe operations and protection of the road; if the capacity of such road should be inadequate to accommodate the use thereof which such licensee and permittee desire to make concurrently, they shall endeavor to adjust their respective uses by agreement. 


(b) If the permittee and such licensee are unable to agree as to the reasonableness of such operating regulations or on the adjustment of their respective uses where the capacity of the road is inadequate to accommodate their concurrent use, then upon the written request of either party delivered to the other party, the matter shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the procedures established by ยง 2812.4-4. 


(c) The arbitrators may make such disposition of a dispute involving the reasonableness of such operating regulations as appears equitable to them, taking into account the capacity and the construction of the road and the volume of use to which it will be subjected. In the determination of a dispute arising out of the inadequacy of the capacity of a road to accommodate the concurrent use by a permittee and a licensee, the arbitrators may make such disposition thereof as appears equitable to them, taking into account, among other pertinent facts, the commitments of the permittee and the licensee with respect to the cutting and removal of the timber involved and the disposition of the products derived therefrom; the extent to which each of the parties may practicably satisfy any of the aforesaid commitments from other timber currently controlled by him; the past normal use of such road by the permittee; the extent to which federal timber has contributed to the amortization of the capital costs of such road; and the extent to which the United States or its licensees have enlarged the road capacity.
