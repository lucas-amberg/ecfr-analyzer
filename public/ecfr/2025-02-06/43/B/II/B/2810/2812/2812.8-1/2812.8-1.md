# § 2812.8-1   Notice of termination.

(a) The authorized officer in his discretion may elect upon 30 days' notice to terminate any permit or right-of-way issued under this paragraph if: 


(1) In connection with the application made therefor, the applicant represented any material fact knowing the same to be false or made such representation in reckless disregard of the truth; or 


(2) A permittee, subsequent to the issuance of a permit or right-of-way to him, represents any material fact to the Bureau, in accordance with any requirement of such permit or this paragraph, knowing such representation to be false, or makes such representation in reckless disregard of the truth. 


(b) The authorized officer in his discretion may elect to terminate any permit or right-of-way issued under this paragraph, if the permittee shall fail to comply with any of the provisions of such regulations or make defaults in the performance or obligation of any of the conditions of the permit, and such failure or default shall continue for 60 days after service of written notice thereof by the authorized officer. 


(c) Notice of such termination shall be served personally or by registered mail upon the permittee, shall specify the misrepresentation, failure or default involved, and shall be final, subject, however, to the permittee's right of appeal. 


(d) Termination of the permit and of the right-of-way under this section shall not operate to terminate any right granted to the United States pursuant to this paragraph, nor shall it affect the right of the permittee, after the termination of his permit and right-of-way to receive compensation and to establish road operating rules with respect to roads controlled by him which the United States has the right to use and to permit its licensees to use; nor shall it relieve the permittee of his duty under this paragraph, to submit to and be bound by arbitration pursuant to §§ 2812.4-1, 2812.4-3, and 2812.4-4.
