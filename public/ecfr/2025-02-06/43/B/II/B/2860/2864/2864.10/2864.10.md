# ยง 2864.10   What should I do before I file my application?

In addition to the suggested actions listed in ยง 2804.10, before you file your application you should:


(a) Schedule a preliminary application review meeting with the appropriate personnel in the BLM field office having jurisdiction over the lands you seek to use. Preliminary application review meetings help you to plan your project, coordinate with the BLM, and ensure a smooth permitting process. During the preliminary application review meeting, the BLM can:


(1) Identify potential constraints;


(2) Determine whether the lands are located inside a communications site management plan area;


(3) Tentatively schedule the processing of your proposed application; and


(4) Inform you of your financial obligations, such as processing and monitoring costs and rents.


(b) Request a copy of the most recent communications site management plan for that site if one is available.


(c) Ensure you have all other necessary licenses, authorizations, or permits required for the operation of your facility.
