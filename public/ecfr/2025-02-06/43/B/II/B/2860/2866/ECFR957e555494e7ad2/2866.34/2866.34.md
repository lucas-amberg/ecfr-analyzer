# § 2866.34   How will the BLM calculate the rent for a multiple-use communication facility grant?

(a) *Basic rule.* The BLM first determines the population strata the communication facility serves according to § 2866.32 of this subpart and then calculates the rent assessed to facility owners and facility managers for a grant for a communication facility that authorizes subleasing with tenants, customers, or both, as follows:


(1) The BLM will determine the rent of the highest value use in the facility or facilities as the base rent, and add to it 25 percent of the rent from the rent schedule (see § 2866.30) for each tenant use in the facility or facilities;


(2) If the highest value use is not the use of the facility owner or facility manager, the BLM will consider the owner's or manager's use like any tenant or customer use in calculating the rent (see § 2866.35(b) for facility owners and § 2866.39(a) for facility managers);


(3) If a tenant use is the highest value use, the BLM will exclude the rent for that tenant's use when calculating the additional 25 percent amount under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for tenant uses;


(4) If a holder has multiple uses authorized under the same grant, such as a TV and a FM radio station, the BLM will calculate the rent as in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In this case, the TV rent would be the highest value use and the BLM would charge the FM portion according to the rent schedule as if it were a tenant use.


(b) *Special applications.* The following provisions apply when calculating rents for communications uses exempted from rent under § 2866.14 of this subpart or communications uses whose rent has been waived or reduced to zero under § 2866.15 of this subpart:


(1) The BLM will exclude exempted uses or uses whose rent has been waived or reduced to zero (see §§ 2866.14 and 2866.15) of either a facility owner or a facility manager in calculating rents. The BLM will exclude similar uses (see §§ 2866.14 and 2866.15) of a customer or tenant if they choose to hold their own grant (see § 2866.36) or are occupants in a Federal facility (see § 2866.42(a));


(2) The BLM will charge rent to a facility owner whose own use is either exempted from rent or whose rent has been waived or reduced to zero (see §§ 2866.14 and 2866.15), but who has tenants in the facility, in an amount equal to the rent of the highest value tenant use plus 25 percent of the rent from the rent schedule for each of the remaining tenant uses subject to rent;


(3) The BLM will not charge rent to a facility owner, facility manager, or tenant (when holding a grant) when all of the following occur:


(i) The BLM exempts from rent, waives, or reduces to zero the rent for the holder's use (see §§ 2866.14 and 2866.15);


(ii) Rent from all other uses in the facility is exempted, waived, or reduced to zero, or the BLM considers such uses as customer uses; and


(iii) The holder is not operating the facility for commercial purposes (see § 2866.15(c)(2)) with respect to such other uses in the facility; and


(4) If a holder, whose own use is exempted from rent or whose rent has been waived or reduced to zero, is conducting a commercial activity with customers or tenants whose uses are also exempted from rent or whose rent has been waived or reduced to zero (see §§ 2866.14 and 2866.15), the BLM will charge rent, notwithstanding § 2866.31(b), based on the highest value use within the facility. This paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to facilities exempt from rent under § 2866.14(a)(3) except when the facility also includes ineligible facilities.
