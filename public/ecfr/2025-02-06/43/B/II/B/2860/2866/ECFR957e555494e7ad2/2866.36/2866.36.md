# ยง 2866.36   If I am a tenant or customer in a facility, must I have my own grant and if so, how will this affect my rent?

(a) You may have your own authorization, but the BLM does not require a separate grant for tenants and customers using a facility authorized by a BLM grant that contains a subleasing provision. The BLM charges the facility owner or facility manager rent based on the highest value use within the facility (including any tenant or customer use authorized by a separate grant) and 25 percent of the rent from the rent schedule for each of the other uses subject to rent (including any tenant or customer use a separate grant authorizes and the facility owner's use if it is not the highest value use).


(b) If you own a building, equipment shelter, or tower on public lands for communication purposes, you must have an authorization under this part, even if you are also a tenant or customer in someone else's facility.


(c) The BLM will charge tenants and customers who hold their own grant in a facility, as grant holders, the full annual rent for their use based on the BLM communications use rent schedule. The BLM will also include such tenant or customer use in calculating the rent the facility owner or facility manager must pay.
