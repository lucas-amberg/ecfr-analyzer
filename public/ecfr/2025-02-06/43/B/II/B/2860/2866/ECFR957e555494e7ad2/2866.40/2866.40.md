# ยง 2866.40   How will the BLM calculate rent for an authorization for ancillary Communications Uses associated with Communications Uses on the rent schedule?

If the ancillary communication equipment is used solely in direct support of the primary use (see the definition of communications uses rent schedule in ยง 2861.5 and the definition of ancillary in ยง 2801.5 of this chapter), the BLM will calculate and charge rent only for the primary use.
