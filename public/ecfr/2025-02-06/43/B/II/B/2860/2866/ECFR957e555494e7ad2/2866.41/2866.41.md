# ยง 2866.41   How will the BLM calculate rent for communications facilities ancillary to a linear grant or other use authorization?

When a communications facility is authorized as ancillary to (*i.e.,* used for the sole purpose of internal communications) a grant or some other type of use authorization (*e.g.,* a mineral lease or sundry notice), the BLM will determine the rent using the linear rent schedule (see ยง 2866.20) or rent scheme associated with the other authorization, and not the communications uses rent schedule.
