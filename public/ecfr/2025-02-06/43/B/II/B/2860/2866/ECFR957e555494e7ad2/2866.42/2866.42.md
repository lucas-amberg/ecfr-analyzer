# § 2866.42   How will the BLM calculate rent for Communications Uses within a federally owned communications facility?

(a) If you are an occupant of a federally owned communication facility, you must have your own grant and pay rent in accordance with these regulations; and


(b) If a Federal agency holds a grant and agrees to operate the facility as a facility owner under § 2866.31, occupants do not need a separate BLM grant, and the BLM will calculate and charge rent to the Federal facility owner under §§ 2866.30 through 2866.44.
