# § 2866.44   How will the BLM calculate rent for a facility owner's or facility manager's grant which authorizes Communications Uses?

This section applies to a grant that authorizes a mixture of communications uses, some of which are subject to the communications uses rent schedule and some of which are not. The BLM will determine rent for these grants under the provisions of this section.


(a) The BLM establishes the rent for each of the uses in the facility that are not covered by the communications uses rent schedule using § 2806.70 of this chapter.


(b) The BLM establishes the rent for each of the uses in the facility that are covered by the rent schedule using §§ 2866.30 and 2866.31.


(c) The BLM determines the facility owner or facility manager's rent by identifying the highest rent in the facility of those established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and adding to it 25 percent of the rent of all other uses subject to rent.
