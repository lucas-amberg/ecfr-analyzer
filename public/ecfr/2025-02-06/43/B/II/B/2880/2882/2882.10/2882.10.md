# ยง 2882.10   What lands are available for grants or TUPs?

(a) For lands BLM exclusively manages, we use the same criteria to determine whether lands are available for grants or TUPs as we do to determine whether lands are available for FLPMA grants (*see* subpart 2802 of this chapter).


(b) BLM may require common use of a right-of-way and may restrict new grants to existing right-of-way corridors where safety and other considerations allow. Generally, BLM land use plans designate right-of-way corridors.


(c) Where a proposed oil or gas right-of-way involves lands managed by two or more Federal agencies, *see* ยง 2884.26 of this part.
