# ยง 2884.25   What activities may I conduct on BLM lands covered by my application for a grant or TUP while BLM is processing my application?

(a) You may conduct casual use activities on BLM lands covered by the application, as may any other member of the public. BLM does not require a grant or TUP for casual use on BLM lands.


(b) For any activities on BLM lands that are not casual use, you must obtain prior BLM approval. To conduct activities on lands administered by other Federal agencies, you must obtain any prior approval those agencies require.
