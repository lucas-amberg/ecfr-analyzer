# ยง 2885.23   How will BLM calculate rent for communication uses ancillary to a linear grant, TUP, or other use authorization?

When a communication use is ancillary to, and authorized by BLM under, a grant or TUP for a linear use, or some other type of authorization (*e.g.*, a mineral lease or sundry notice), BLM will determine the rent using the linear rent schedule (*see* ยง 2885.19 of this subpart) or rent scheme associated with the other authorization, and not the communication use rent schedule (*see* ยง 2806.30 of this chapter).
