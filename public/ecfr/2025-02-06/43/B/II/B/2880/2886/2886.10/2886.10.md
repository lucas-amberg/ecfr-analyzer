# ยง 2886.10   When can I start activities under my grant or TUP?

(a) When you can start depends on the terms of your grant or TUP. You can start activities when you receive the grant or TUP you and BLM signed, unless the grant or TUP includes a requirement for BLM to provide a written Notice to Proceed. If your grant or TUP contains a Notice to Proceed requirement, you may not initiate construction, operation, maintenance, or termination until BLM issues you a Notice to Proceed.


(b) Before you begin operating your pipeline or related facility authorized by a grant or TUP, you must certify in writing to BLM that the pipeline system:


(1) Has been constructed and tested according to the terms of the grant or TUP; and


(2) Is in compliance with all required plans, specifications, and Federal and state laws and regulations.
