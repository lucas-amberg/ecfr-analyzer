(b) Subject to ยง 2886.11, BLM may suspend or terminate your TUP if you do not comply with applicable laws and regulations or any terms, conditions, or stipulations of the TUP, or if you abandon the TUP area.


(c) A grant or TUP also terminates when:


(1) The grant or TUP contains a term or condition that has been met that requires the grant or TUP to terminate;


(2) The BLM consents in writing to your request to relinquish the grant or TUP;


(3) A court terminates it or requires the BLM to terminate it; or
