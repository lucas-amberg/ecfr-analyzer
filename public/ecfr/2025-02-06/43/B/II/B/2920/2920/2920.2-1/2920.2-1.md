# ยง 2920.2-1   Discussion of proposals.

(a) *Suggestions by land use proponent.* Any person who seeks to use public lands may contact the Bureau of Land Management office having jurisdiction over the public lands in question and discuss the land use proposal. This contact should be made as early as possible so that administrative requirements and potential conflicts with other land uses can be identified.


(b) *Response by the authorized officer.* The authorized officer will discuss with the land use proponent whether the requested land use, suitability or non-suitability of the requested land use based on a preliminary examination of existing land use plans, where available, is or is not in conformance with Bureau of Land Management policies and programs for the lands, local zoning ordinances and any other pertinent information. The authorized officer will discuss administrative requirements for the type of land use authorization which may be granted (lease, permit or easement), including, but not limited to: additional information which may be required; qualifications; cost reimbursement requirements; associated clearances, other permits or licenses which may be required; environmental and management considerations; and special requirements such as competitive bidding and identification of on-the-ground investigations which may be required in order to issue a land use authorization.
