# ยง 2932.13   How will I know if individual use of a special area requires a Special Recreation Permit?

BLM will publish notification of the requirement to obtain a Special Recreation Permit to enter a special area in the _Federal Register_ and local and regional news media. We will post permit requirements at major access points for the special area and provide information at the local BLM office.
