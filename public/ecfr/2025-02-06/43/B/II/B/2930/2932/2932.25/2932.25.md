# ยง 2932.25   What will BLM do when I apply for a Special Recreation Permit?

BLM will inform you within 30 days after the filing date of your application if we must delay a decision on issuing the permit. An example of when this could happen is if we determine that we cannot complete required environmental assessments or consultations with other agencies within 180 days.
