# ยง 2932.32   When must I pay the fees?

You must pay the required fees before BLM will authorize your use and by the deadline or deadlines that BLM will establish in each case. We may allow you to make periodic payments for commercial use. We will not process or continue processing your application until you have paid the required fees or installments.
