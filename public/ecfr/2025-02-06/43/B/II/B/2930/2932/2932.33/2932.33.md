# ยง 2932.33   When are fees refundable?

(a) *Overpayments.* For multi-year commercial permits, if your actual fees due are less than the estimated fees you paid in advance, BLM will credit overpayments to the following year or season. For other permits, BLM will give you the option whether to receive refunds or credit overpayments to future permits, less processing costs.


(b) *Underuse.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for areas where BLM's planning process allocates use to commercial outfitters, or non-commercial users, or a combination, we will not make refunds for use of the areas we allocate to you in your permit if your actual use is less than your intended use. 


(2) We may consider a refund if we have sufficient time to authorize use by others. 


(c) *Non-refundable fees.* Application fees and minimum annual commercial use fees (those on BLM's published fee schedule) are not refundable.
