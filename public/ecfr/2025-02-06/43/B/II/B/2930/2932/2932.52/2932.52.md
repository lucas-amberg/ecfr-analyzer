# ยง 2932.52   How do I apply for a renewal?

(a) You must apply for renewal on the same form as for a new permit. You must include information that has changed since your application or your most recent renewal. If information about your operation or activities has not changed, you may merely state that and refer to your most recent application or renewal. 


(b) BLM will establish deadlines in your permit for submitting renewal applications.
