# ยง 2932.54   When may I transfer my Special Recreation Permit to other individuals, companies, or entities?

(a) BLM may transfer a commercial Special Recreation Permit only in the case of an actual sale of a business or a substantial part of the business. Only BLM can approve the transfer or assignment of permit privileges to another person or entity, also basing our decision on the criteria in ยง 2932.26. 


(b) The approved transferee must complete the standard permit application process as provided in ยง 2932.20 through 2932.24. Once BLM approves your transfer of permit privileges and your transferee meets all BLM requirements, including payment of fees, BLM will issue a Special Recreation Permit to the transferee.
