# ยง 2933.14   For what time may BLM issue a Recreation Use Permit?

You may obtain a permit for a day, season of use, year, or any other time period that we deem appropriate for the particular use. We will post this information on site, or make it available at the local BLM office with jurisdiction over the area or site, or both.
