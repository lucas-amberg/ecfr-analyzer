# § 3102.51   Compliance.

Only responsible and qualified bidders and lessees may own, hold, or control an interest in a lease or prospective lease. Responsible and qualified bidders and lessees, including corporations, and all members of associations, including partnerships of all types, will, without exception, be qualified and in compliance with the Act. Compliance means that the persons are:


(a) Citizens of the United States (see § 3102.10) or non-U.S. citizens who own stock in a corporation organized under State or Federal law (see § 3102.20);


(b) In compliance with the Federal acreage limitations (see § 3101.20);


(c) Not minors (see § 3102.30);


(d) Except for an assignment or transfer under 43 CFR subpart 3106, in compliance with section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 201(2)(A)), in which case the signature on a bid or lease constitutes evidence of compliance. A lease issued to any person in violation of this paragraph (d) will be subject to the cancellation provisions of 43 CFR 3108.30.


(e) Not in violation of the provisions of section 41 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 195); and


(f) In compliance with section 17(g) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 226(g)), in which case the signature on an offer, lease, assignment, or transfer constitutes evidence of compliance that the signatory and any subsidiary, affiliate, or person, association, or corporation controlled by or under common control with the signatory, as defined in 43 CFR 3400.0-5(rr), has not failed or refused to comply with reclamation requirements with respect to all leases and operations thereon in which such person has an interest. A person is noncompliant with section 17(g) of the Act when they fail to comply with their reclamation obligations or other standards established under 30 U.S.C. 226 in the time specified in a notice from the BLM. A lease issued, or an assignment or transfer approved, to any such person in violation of this paragraph (f) may be subject to the cancellation provisions of 43 CFR 3108.30, notwithstanding any administrative or judicial appeals that may be pending with respect to violations or penalties assessed for failure to comply with the prescribed reclamation standards on any lease holdings. Noncompliance will end upon a determination by the authorized officer that all required reclamation has been completed and that the United States has been fully reimbursed for any costs incurred due to the required reclamation.


(g) In compliance with 43 CFR 3106.10(d) and section 30A of the Act (30 U.S.C. 187(a)). The authorized officer may accept the signature on a request for approval of an assignment of less than 640 acres outside of Alaska (2,560 acres within Alaska) as acceptable certification that the assignment would further the development of oil and gas, or the authorized officer may apply the provisions of 43 CFR 3102.53.


(h) Not excluded or disqualified from participating in a transaction covered by Federal non-procurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR parts 180 and 1400), unless the Department explicitly approves an exception for a transaction pursuant to the regulations in those parts.
