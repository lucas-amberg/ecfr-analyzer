# ยง 3103.22   Annual rental payments.

Rentals must be paid on or before the lease anniversary date. A full year's rental must be submitted even when less than a full year remains in the lease term, except as provided in 43 CFR 3103.42(d). Failure to make the required payment on or before the lease anniversary date will cause a lease to terminate automatically by operation of law. If the designated ONRR office is not open on the anniversary date, payment received on the next day the designated ONRR office is open to the public will be deemed to be timely made. Payments made to an improper BLM or ONRR office will be returned and will not be forwarded to the designated ONRR office. Rental must be paid at the following rates:


(a) The annual rental for all leases is as stated in the lease, and the annual rental for all new leases will be as specified in 43 CFR 3103.1;


(b) Rental will not be due on acreage for which royalty or minimum royalty is being paid, except on nonproducing leases when compensatory royalty has been assessed in which case annual rental as established in the lease will be due in addition to compensatory royalty;


(c) For leases that are reinstated under ยง 3108.23, the annual rental will be as specified in 43 CFR 3103.1 beginning with the termination date upon the filing of a petition to reinstate a lease; and


(d) Each succeeding time a specific lease is reinstated under ยง 3108.23, the annual rental on that lease will increase by an additional $10 per acre or fraction thereof.
