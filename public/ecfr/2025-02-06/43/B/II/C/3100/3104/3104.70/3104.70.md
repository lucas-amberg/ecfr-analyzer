# ยง 3104.70   Default.

(a) Where, upon a default, the surety makes a payment to the United States of an obligation incurred under a lease, the face amount of the surety bond or personal bonds and the surety's liability thereunder will be reduced by the amount of such payment.


(b) After default, where the obligation in default equals or is less than the face amount of the bond(s), the principal must either post a new bond or restore the existing bond(s) to the amount previously held or a larger amount as determined by the authorized officer. In lieu thereof, the principal may file separate bonds for each lease covered by the deficient bond(s). Where the obligation incurred exceeds the face amount of the bond(s), the principal must make full payment to the United States for all obligations incurred that are in excess of the face amount of the bond(s) and must post a new bond in the amount previously held or such larger amount as determined by the authorized officer. The restoration of a bond or posting of a new bond must be made within 6 months or less after receipt of notice from the authorized officer. Failure to comply with these requirements may:


(1) Subject all leases covered by such bond(s) to cancellation under the provisions of 43 CFR 3108.30; and


(2) Result in the bond obligor or principal being referred to the Department's Suspension and Debarment Program under 2 CFR part 1400 to determine if the person will be suspended or debarred from doing business with the Federal Government.
