(a) The communitization agreement must describe the separate tracts comprising the drilling or spacing unit, must show the apportionment of the production or royalties to the several parties, the name of the operator, and contain adequate provisions for the protection of the interests of the United States. The agreement must be signed by or on behalf of all necessary parties and must be filed prior to the expiration of the Federal lease(s) involved in order to confer the benefits of the agreement upon such lease(s).


(b) The agreement will be effective as to the Federal lease(s) involved only if approved by the authorized officer. Approved communitization agreement are considered effective from the date of the agreement or from the date of the onset of production from the communitized formation, whichever is earlier, except when the spacing unit is subject to a State pooling order after the date of first sale, then the effective date of the agreement will be the effective date of the order.


(c) The public interest requirement for an approved communitization agreement will be satisfied only if the well dedicated thereto has been completed for production in the communitized formation at the time the agreement is approved or, if not, that the operator thereafter commences and/or diligently continues drilling operations to a depth sufficient to test the communitized formation or establishes to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that further drilling of the well would be unwarranted or impracticable. If an application is received for voluntary termination of a communitization agreement during its fixed term or such an agreement automatically expires at the end of its fixed term without the public interest requirement having been satisfied, the approval of that agreement by the authorized officer will be invalid and no Federal lease included in the communitization agreement will be eligible for an extension under 43 CFR 3107.40.
