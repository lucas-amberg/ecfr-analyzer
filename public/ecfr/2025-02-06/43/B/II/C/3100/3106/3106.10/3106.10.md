# ยง 3106.10   Transfers, general.

(a) Leases may be transferred by assignment or sublease as to all or part of the acreage in the lease or as to either a divided or undivided interest therein.


(b) An assignment of the record title conveys both record title and operating rights, unless operating rights have been severed from the record title through an approved transfer of operating rights. Thereafter, the operating rights and record title may each be subject to further transfers.


(c) An assignment of a separate zone, deposit, depth, formation, specific well, or of part of a legal subdivision, will be denied.


(d) Within the boundaries of a Federal lease, operating rights may only be divided with respect to legal subdivisions, depth ranges, and formations.


(e) An assignment of less than 640 acres outside Alaska or of less than 2,560 acres within Alaska will be denied unless the assignment constitutes the entire lease or is demonstrated to further the development of oil and gas to the satisfaction of the authorized officer. Reference 43 CFR 3102.51(g) for certification of compliance.


(f) The rights of the transferee to a lease or an interest therein will not be recognized by the Department until the transfer has been approved by the authorized officer.


(g) A transfer may be withdrawn in writing, signed by the transferor and the transferee, if the transfer has not been approved by the authorized officer.


(h) A request for approval of a transfer of a lease or interest in a lease must be filed within 90 days from the date of its execution. The 90-day filing period will begin on the date the transferor signs and dates the transfer. If the transfer is filed after the 90th day, the authorized officer may require verification that the transfer is still in force and effect.


(i) A transfer of production payments or overriding royalty or other similar payments, arrangements, or interests must be filed in the proper BLM office but will not require approval.


(j) No transfer of an offer to lease or interest in a lease will be approved prior to the issuance of the lease.
