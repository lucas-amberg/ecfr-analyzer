# ยง 3107.10   Extension by drilling.

(a) Any lease on which actual drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of its primary term and are being diligently prosecuted at the end of the primary term or any lease which is part of an approved oil and gas agreement upon which such drilling takes place, will be extended for 2 years subject to the rental being timely paid as required by 43 CFR 3103.20, and subject to the provisions of 43 CFR 3105.23 and appendix A to part 3180, if applicable. The BLM will not grant a drilling extension for a lease in its extended term.


(b) Actual drilling operations must be conducted in a manner that a reasonable person seriously looking for oil or gas could be expected to make in that particular area, given the existing knowledge of geologic and other pertinent facts. In drilling a new well on a lease or for the benefit of a lease under the terms of an approved agreement, it must be taken to a depth sufficient to penetrate at least one formation recognized in the area as potentially productive of oil or gas, or where an existing well is reentered, it must be taken to a depth sufficient to penetrate at least one new and deeper formation recognized in the area as potentially productive of oil or gas. The authorized officer may determine that further drilling is unwarranted or impracticable.


(c) When a BLM-approved directional or horizontal well is drilled within the leased area from an off-lease location with the intent to produce from the leased area, the BLM will consider drilling to have commenced on the leased area when drilling is commenced at the off-lease location.
