# ยง 3107.60   Extension of reinstated leases.

Where a reinstatement of a terminated lease is granted under 43 CFR 3108.20 and the authorized officer finds that the reinstatement will not afford the lessee a reasonable opportunity to continue operations under the lease, the authorized officer may extend the term of such lease for a period sufficient to give the lessee such an opportunity. Any extension will be subject to the following conditions:


(a) No extension will exceed a period equal to the unexpired portion of the lease or any extension thereof remaining at the date of termination.


(b) When the reinstatement occurs after the expiration of the term or extension thereof, the lease may be extended from the date the authorized officer grants the petition, but in no event for more than 2 years from the date the reinstatement is authorized and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
