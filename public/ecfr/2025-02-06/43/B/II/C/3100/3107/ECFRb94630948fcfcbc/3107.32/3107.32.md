# ยง 3107.32   Segregation of leases committed in part.

(a) Any lease committed after July 29, 1954, to any unit agreement, which covers lands within and lands outside the area covered by the agreement, will be segregated, as of the effective date of commitment to the unit, into separate leases; one covering the lands committed to the agreement, the other lands not committed to the agreement. For unproven areas, such segregation will occur only when the public interest requirement is satisfied pursuant to 43 CFR 3183.4(b). Upon satisfaction of the public interest requirement, the BLM will deem the segregation to have been effective as of the date of commitment of the lands to the unit.


(b)(1) The segregated lease covering the non-unitized portion of the lands will continue in force and effect for the term of the lease or for 2 years from the date of segregation, whichever is longer.


(2) If a partially committed lease is in an extended term because of production, the segregated, non-producing lease will continue in effect so long as the producing lease exists and rentals are paid, and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from the committed lease.
