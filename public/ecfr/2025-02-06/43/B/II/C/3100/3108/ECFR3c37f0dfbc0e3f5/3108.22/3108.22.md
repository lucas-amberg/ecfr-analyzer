# ยง 3108.22   Reinstatement at existing rental and royalty rates: Class I reinstatements.

(a) Except as hereinafter provided, the authorized officer may reinstate a lease which has terminated for failure to pay on or before the anniversary date the full amount of rental due, provided that:


(1) Such rental was paid or tendered within 20 days after the anniversary date; and


(2) It is shown to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that the failure to timely submit the full amount of the rental due was either justified or not due to a lack of reasonable diligence on the part of the lessee (reasonable diligence includes a rental payment that is paid to the ONRR on or before the lease anniversary date. If the designated ONRR office or payment system is not operational on the anniversary date, payment received on the next business day in which the designated ONRR office or payment system is operational to the public will be deemed timely); and


(3) A petition for reinstatement and the processing fee for lease reinstatement, Class I, found in the fee schedule in ยง 3000.120 of this chapter, are filed with the proper BLM office within 60 days after receipt of Notice of Termination of Lease due to late payment of rental. If a terminated lease becomes productive prior to the time the lease is reinstated, all required royalty that has accrued must be paid to the ONRR.


(b) The burden of showing that the failure to pay on or before the anniversary date was justified or not due to lack of reasonable diligence is on the lessee.


(c) Under no circumstances will a terminated lease be reinstated if:


(1) A valid oil and gas lease has been issued prior to the filing of a petition for reinstatement affecting any of the lands covered by that terminated lease; or


(2) The oil and gas interests of the United States in the lands have been disposed of or otherwise have become unavailable for leasing.
