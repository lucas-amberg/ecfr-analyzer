(a) A bid will not be withdrawn and will constitute a legally binding commitment to execute the lease bid form and accept a lease, including the obligation to pay the bonus bid, first year's rental, and processing fee. Execution by the high bidder of a competitive lease bid form approved by the Director constitutes certification of compliance with 43 CFR subpart 3102, will constitute a binding lease offer, including all terms and conditions applicable thereto, and must be submitted when payment is made in accordance with ยง 3120.62(b). Failure to comply with ยง 3120.62(c) will result in rejection of the bid and forfeiture of the monies submitted under ยง 3120.62(b).


(b) A lease will be awarded to the highest responsible and qualified bidder. A copy of the lease will be provided to the lessee after signature by the authorized officer.


(c) If a bid is rejected, the land may be reoffered competitively under this subpart.

(e) Leases will be issued within 60 calendar days, following payment by the successful bidder of the remainder of the bonus bid, if any, and the annual rental for the first lease year. If the BLM cannot issue the lease within 60 days, the BLM, with the consent of the bidder, may reject the offer.
