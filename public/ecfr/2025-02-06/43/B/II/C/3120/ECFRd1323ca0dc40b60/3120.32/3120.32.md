# ยง 3120.32   Expression of interest leasing preference.

When determining whether the BLM should offer lands specified in an expression of interest at lease sales, the BLM will evaluate the Secretary's obligations to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to take any action required to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands and their resources, along with other applicable legal requirements. In evaluating the lands to be offered, as part of the scoping process, the BLM will consider, at minimum:


(a) Proximity to oil and gas development existing at the time of the BLM's evaluation, giving preference to lands upon which a prudent operator would seek to expand existing operations;


(b) The presence of important fish and wildlife habitats or connectivity areas, giving preference to lands that would not impair the proper functioning of such habitats or corridors;


(c) The presence of historic properties, sacred sites, and other high value cultural resources, giving preference to lands that would not impair the cultural significance of such resources;


(d) The presence of recreation and other important uses or resources, giving preference to lands that would not impair the value of such uses or resources; and


(e) The potential for oil and gas development, giving preference to lands with high potential for development.
