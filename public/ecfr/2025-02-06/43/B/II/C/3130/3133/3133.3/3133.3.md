# § 3133.3   Under what circumstances will BLM waive, suspend, or reduce the rental, royalty, or minimum royalty on my NPR-A lease?

(a) BLM will waive, suspend, or reduce the rental or minimum royalty or reduce the royalty rate on your lease if BLM finds that—


(1) It encourages the greatest ultimate recovery of oil or gas or it is in the interest of conservation; and 


(2) It is necessary to promote development or the BLM determines the lease cannot be successfully operated under the terms of the lease.


(b) The BLM will consult with the State of Alaska and the North Slope Borough within 10 days of receiving an application for waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental or minimum royalty, or reduction of the royalty rate and will not approve an application under § 3133.4 of this subpart until at least 30 days after the consultation.


(c) If your lease includes land that was made available for acquisition by a regional corporation (as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1602) under the provision of Section 1431(o) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3101 *et seq.*), the BLM will only approve a waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental or minimum royalty, or reduction of the royalty rate if the regional corporation concurs.
