# ยง 3135.5   When should I stop paying rental or royalty after BLM requires or approves a suspension of operations and production ?

You should stop paying rental or royalty on the first day of the month that the suspension is effective. However, if there is any production sold or removed during that month, you must pay royalty on that production.
