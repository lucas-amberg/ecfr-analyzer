# ยง 3135.7   What effect does a suspension of operations and production have on the term of my lease?

(a) *Primary term.* If BLM grants a suspension of operations and production for your lease, the suspension stops the running of the primary term of your lease for the period of the suspension.


(b) *Extended term.* If your lease is in its extended term, a suspension holds your lease in its extended term for the period of the suspension as if it were in production.
