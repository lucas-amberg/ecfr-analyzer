# ยง 3135.8   If BLM requires a suspension or grants my request for a suspension of operations and production for my lease, when must I next pay advance annual rental, royalty, or minimum royalty?

(a) You are not required to submit your next rental or minimum royalty payment until the date the suspension terminates. Therefore, if your suspension begins in month 3 of lease year A and ends in month 2 of lease year B, you must submit your rental payment for lease year B when your suspension ends. BLM will send a written notice to the lessee and operator stating that the suspension is terminated and the date your rental payment for lease year B is due to MMS. BLM's notice also will state when you must pay any minimum royalty due for lease year A. Your minimum royalty for lease year B will be due at the end of that year.


(b) If you remove or sell any production from the lease during the term of the suspension, you must pay royalty on that production.
