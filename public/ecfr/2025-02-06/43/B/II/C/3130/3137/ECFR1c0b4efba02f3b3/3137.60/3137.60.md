# § 3137.60   As the unit operator, what are my obligations?

As the unit operator— 


(a) You must comply with the terms and conditions of the unit agreement, Federal laws and regulations, lease terms and stipulations, and BLM notices and orders; 


(b) You must provide to BLM evidence of acceptable bonding. Acceptable bonding means a bond in an amount which is no less than the sum of the individual Federal bonding requirements for each of the NPR-A leases committed to the unit. You may also meet this requirement if you add the unit operator as a principal to lease bonds to reach the required amount; and 


(c) The bond must be payable to the Secretary of the Interior.
