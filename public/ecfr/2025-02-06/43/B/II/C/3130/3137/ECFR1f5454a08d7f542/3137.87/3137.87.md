# § 3137.87   What must I do if there are unleased Federal tracts in a participating area?

If there are unleased Federal tracts in a participating area, you must— 


(a) Include the unleased Federal tracts in the participating area, even though BLM will not share in unit costs; 


(b) Allocate production for royalty purposes as if the unleased Federal tracts were leased and committed to the unit agreement under § 3137.100 of this subpart; 


(c) Admit Federal tracts leased after the effective date of the unit agreement into the unit agreement on the date the lease is effective; and 


(d) Submit to BLM revised maps, a list of committed leases, and allocation schedules that reflect the commitment of the newly leased Federal tracts to the unit.
