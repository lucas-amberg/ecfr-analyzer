# § 3137.51   Under what conditions does BLM permit multiple unit operators?

BLM permits multiple unit operators only if the unit agreement defines— 


(a) The conditions under which additional unit operators are acceptable; 


(b) The responsibilities of the different operators, including obtaining BLM approvals, reporting, paying Federal royalties and conducting operations; 


(c) Which unit operators are obligated to ensure bond coverage for each NPR-A lease in the unit; 


(d) The consequences if one or more unit operators defaults. For example, if an operator defaults, the unit agreement would list which unit operators would conduct that operator's operations and ensure bonding of those operations; and 


(e) Which unit operator is responsible for unit obligations not specifically assigned in the unit agreement.
