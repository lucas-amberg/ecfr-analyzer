# § 3137.100   How must I allocate production to the United States when a participating area includes unleased Federal lands?

(a) When a participating area includes unleased Federal lands, you must allocate production as if the unleased Federal lands were leased and committed to the unit agreement (*see* §§ 3137.80 and 3137.81 of this subpart). The obligation to pay royalty for production attributable to unleased Federal lands accrues from the later of the date the— 


(1) Committed leases in the participating area that includes unleased Federal lands receive a production allocation; or 


(2) Previously leased tracts within the participating area become unleased. 


(b) The royalty rate applicable to production allocated to unleased Federal lands is the greater of 12
1/2 percent or the highest royalty rate for any lease committed to the unit. 


(c) The value of the production must be determined under the Minerals Management Service's oil and gas product value regulations at 30 CFR part 206.
