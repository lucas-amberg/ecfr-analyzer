# ยง 3140.12   Notice of intent to convert.

(a) Owners of oil and gas leases in Special Tar Sand Areas which were scheduled to expire prior to November 15, 1983, could have preserved the right to convert their leases to combined hydrocarbon leases by filing a Notice of Intent to Convert with the BLM Utah State Office.


(b) A letter, submitted by the lessee, notifying the BLM of the lessee's intention to submit a plan of operations constituted a notice of intent to convert a lease. The Notice of Intent must have contained the lease number.


(c) The Notice of Intent must have been filed prior to the expiration date of the lease. The notice would have preserved the lessee's conversion rights only until November 15, 1983.
