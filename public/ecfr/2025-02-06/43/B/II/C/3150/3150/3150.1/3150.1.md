The right to conduct exploration under notices of intent and oil and gas geophysical exploration permits may be revoked or suspended, after notice, by the authorized officer and upon a final administrative finding of a violation of any term or condition of the instrument, including, but not limited to, terms and conditions requiring compliance with regulations issued under Acts applicable to the public lands and applicable State air and water quality standards or implementation plans.
