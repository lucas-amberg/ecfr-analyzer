# ยง 3162.2-5   Must I take protective action when a protective well would be uneconomic?

You are not required to take any of the actions listed in ยง 3162.2-4 if you can prove to BLM that when you first knew or had constructive notice of drainage you could not produce a sufficient quantity of oil or gas from a protective well on your lease for a reasonable profit above the cost of drilling, completing, and operating the protective well.
