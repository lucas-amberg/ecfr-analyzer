# ยง 3171.16   Waiver from electronic submission requirements.

The operator may request a waiver from the electronic submission requirement for an APD or Notice of Staking if compliance would cause hardship or the operator is unable to file these documents electronically. In the request, the operator must explain the reason(s) that prevent its use of the electronic system, plans for complying with the electronic submission requirement, and a timeframe for compliance. If the request applies to a particular set of APDs or Notices of Staking, then the request must identify the APDs or Notices of Staking to which the waiver applies. The waiver request is subject to BLM approval. If the request does not specify a particular set of APDs or Notices of Staking, then the waiver will apply to all submissions made by the operator during the compliance timeframe included as part of the BLM's waiver approval. The BLM will not consider an APD or Notice of Staking that the operator did not submit through the electronic system, unless the BLM approves a waiver.
