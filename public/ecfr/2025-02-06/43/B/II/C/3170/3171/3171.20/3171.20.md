# ยง 3171.20   Leases for Indian oil and gas.

(a) *Approval of operations.* The BLM will process APDs, Master Development Plans, and Sundry Notices on Indian tribal and allotted oil and gas leases, and Indian Mineral Development Act mineral agreements in a manner similar to Federal leases. For processing such applications, the BLM considers the BIA to be the surface managing agency. Operators are responsible for obtaining any special use or access permits from appropriate BIA and, where applicable, tribal offices. The BLM is not required to post for public inspection APDs for minerals subject to Indian oil and gas leases or agreements.


(b) *Surface use.* Where the wellsite and/or access road is proposed on Indian lands with a different beneficial owner than the minerals, the operator is responsible for entering into a surface use agreement with the Indian tribe or the individual Indian surface owner, subject to BIA approval. This agreement must specify the requirements for protection of surface resources, mitigation, and reclamation of disturbed areas. The BIA, the Indian surface owner, and the BLM, pursuant to 25 CFR 211.4, 212.4 and 225.4, will develop the Conditions of Approval. If the operator is unable to obtain a Surface Access Agreement, it may provide a bond for the benefit of the surface owner(s) (see ยง 3171.19).
