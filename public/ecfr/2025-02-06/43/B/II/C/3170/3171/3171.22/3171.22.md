# ยง 3171.22   Well conversions.

(a) *Conversion to an injection well.* When subsequent operations will result in a well being converted to a Class II injection well (*i.e.,* for disposal of produced water, oil and gas production enhancement, or underground storage of hydrocarbons), the operator must file with the appropriate BLM office a Sundry Notice, Notice of Intent to Convert to Injection on Form 3160-5. The BLM and the surface managing agency, if applicable, will review the information to ensure its technical and administrative adequacy. Following the review, the BLM, in consultation with the surface managing agency, where applicable, will decide upon the approval or disapproval of the application based upon relevant laws and regulations and the circumstances (*e.g.,* the well used for lease or non-lease operations, surface ownership, and protection of subsurface mineral ownership). The BLM will determine if a Right-of-Way or Special Use Authorization and additional bonding are necessary and notify the operator.


(b) *Conversion to a water supply well.* In cases where the surface managing agency or private surface owner desires to acquire an oil and gas well and convert it to a water supply well or acquire a water supply well that was drilled by the operator to support lease operations, the surface managing agency or private surface owner must inform the appropriate BLM office of its intent before the approval of the APD in the case of a dry hole and no later than the time a Notice of Intent to Abandon is submitted for a depleted production well. The operator must abandon the well according to BLM instructions, and must complete the surface cleanup and reclamation, in conjunction with the approved APD, Surface Use Plan of Operations, or Notice of Intent to Abandon, if the BLM or the FS require it. The surface managing agency or private surface owner must reach agreement with the operator as to the satisfactory completion of reclamation operations before the BLM will approve any abandonment or reclamation. The BLM approval of the partial abandonment under this section, completion of any required reclamation operations, and the signed release agreement will relieve the operator of further obligation for the well. If the surface managing agency or private surface owner acquires the well for water use purposes, the party acquiring the well assumes liability for the well.
