# ยง 3171.25   Abandonment.

In accordance with the requirements of 43 CFR 3162.3-4, before starting abandonment operations the operator must submit a Notice of Intent to Abandon on Sundry Notices and Reports on Wells, Form 3160-5. If the operator proposes to modify the plans for surface reclamation approved at the APD stage, the operator must attach these modifications to the Notice of Intent to Abandon.


(a) *Plugging.* The operator must obtain BLM approval for the plugging of the well by submitting a Notice of Intent to Abandon. In the case of dry holes, drilling failures, and in emergency situations, verbal approval for plugging may be obtained from the BLM, with the Notice of Intent to Abandon promptly submitted as written documentation. Within 30 days following completion of well plugging, the operator must file with the BLM a Subsequent Report of Plug and Abandon, using Sundry Notices and Reports on Wells, Form 3160-5. For depleted production wells, the operator must submit a Notice of Intent to Abandon and obtain the BLM's approval before plugging.


(b) *Reclamation.* Plans for surface reclamation are a part of the Surface Use Plan of Operations, as specified in ยง 3171.8(e)(10), and must be designed to return the disturbed area to productive use and to meet the objectives of the land and resource management plan. If the operator proposes to modify the plans for surface reclamation approved at the APD stage, the operator must attach these modifications to the Subsequent Report of Plug and Abandon using Sundry Notices and Reports on Wells, Form 3160-5.


(1) For wells not having an approved plan for surface reclamation, operators must submit to the BLM a proposal describing the procedures to be followed for complete abandonment, including a map showing the disturbed area and roads to be reclaimed. The BLM will forward the request to the FS or other surface managing agency. If applicable, the private surface owner will be notified and their views will be carefully considered.


(2) Earthwork for interim and final reclamation must be completed within 6 months of well completion or well plugging (weather permitting). All pads, pits, and roads must be reclaimed to a satisfactorily revegetated, safe, and stable condition, unless an agreement is made with the landowner or surface managing agency to keep the road or pad in place. Pits containing fluid must not be breached (cut) and pit fluids must be removed or solidified before backfilling. Pits may be allowed to air dry subject to BLM or FS approval, but the use of chemicals to aid in fluid evaporation, stabilization, or solidification must have prior BLM or FS approval. Seeding or other activities to reestablish vegetation must be completed within the time period approved by the BLM or the FS.


(3) Upon completion of reclamation operations, the lessee or operator must notify the BLM or the FS using Form 3160-5, Final Abandonment Notice, when the location is ready for inspection. Final abandonment will not be approved until the surface reclamation work required in the Surface Use Plan of Operations or Subsequent Report of Plug and Abandon has been completed to the satisfaction of the BLM or the FS and surface managing agency, if appropriate.
