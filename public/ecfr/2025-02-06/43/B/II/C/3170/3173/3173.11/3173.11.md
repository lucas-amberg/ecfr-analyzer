# § 3173.11   Site facility diagram.

(a) A site facility diagram is required for all facilities.


(b) Except for the requirement to submit a Form 3160-5, Sundry Notice, with the site facility diagram, no format is prescribed for site facility diagrams. The diagram should be formatted to fit on an 8
1/2 x 11 sheet of paper, if possible, and must be legible and comprehensible to an individual with an ordinary working knowledge of oil field operations (see Appendix A to subpart 3173). If more than one page is required, each page must be numbered (in the format “N of X pages”).


(c) The diagram must:


(1) Reflect the position of the production and water recovery equipment, piping for oil, gas, and water, and metering or other measuring systems in relation to each other, but need not be to scale;


(2) Commencing with the header, identify all of the equipment, including, but not limited to, the header, wellhead, piping, tanks, and metering systems located on the site, and include the appropriate valves and any other equipment used in the handling, conditioning, or disposal of production and water, and indicate the direction of flow;


(3) Identify by API number the wells flowing into headers;


(4) If another operator operates a co-located facility, depict the co-located facility(ies) on the diagram or list them as an attachment and identify them by company name, facility name(s), lease, unit PA, or CA number(s), and FMP number(s);


(5) Indicate which valve(s) must be sealed and in what position during the production and sales phases and during the conduct of other production activities (*e.g.,* circulating tanks or drawing off water), which may be shown by an attachment, if necessary;


(6) When describing co-located facilities operated by one operator, include a skeleton diagram of the co-located facility(ies), showing equipment only. For storage facilities common to co-located facilities operated by one operator, one diagram is sufficient;


(7) Clearly identify the lease, unit PA, or CA to which the diagram applies, the land description of the facility, and the name of the company submitting the diagram, with co-located facilities being identified for each lease, unit PA, or CA;


(8) Clearly identify, on the diagram or as an attachment, all meters and measurement equipment. Specifically identify all approved and assigned FMPs; and


(9) If the operator claims royalty-free use, clearly identify the equipment for which the operator claims royalty-free use. The operator must either:


(i) For each engine, motor, or major component (*e.g.,* compressor, separator, dehydrator, heater-treater, or tank heater) powered by production from the lease, unit PA, or CA, state the volume (oil or gas) consumed (per day or per month) and how the volume is determined; or


(ii) Measure the volume used, by meter or tank gauge.


(d) At facilities for which the BLM will assign an FMP number under § 3173.12, the operator must submit a new site facility diagram as follows:


(1) For facilities that become operational after January 17, 2017, within 30 days after the BLM assigns an FMP; or


(2) For a facility that is in service on or before January 17, 2017, and that has a site facility diagram on file with the BLM that meets the minimum requirements of Onshore Oil and Gas Order 3, Site Security, an amended site facility diagram meeting the requirements of this section is not due until 30 days after the existing facility is modified, a non-Federal facility located on a Federal lease or federally approved unit or communitized area is constructed or modified, or there is a change in operator.


(e) At facilities for which an FMP number is not required under § 3173.12 (*e.g.,* facilities that dispose of produced water), the operator must submit a new site facility diagram as follows:


(1) For new facilities in service after January 17, 2017, the new site facility diagram must be submitted within 30 days after the facility becomes operational; or


(2) For a facility that is in service on or before January 17, 2017, and that has a site facility diagram on file with the BLM that meets the minimum requirements of Onshore Oil and Gas Order 3, Site Security, an amended site facility diagram meeting the requirements of this section is not due until 30 days after the existing facility is modified, a non-Federal facility located on a Federal lease or federally approved unit or communitized area is constructed or modified, or there is a change in operator.


(f) After a site facility diagram has been submitted that complies with the requirements of this part, the operator has an ongoing obligation to update and amend the diagram within 30 days after such facility is modified, a non-Federal facility located on a Federal lease or federally approved unit or communitized area is constructed or modified, or there is a change in operator.
