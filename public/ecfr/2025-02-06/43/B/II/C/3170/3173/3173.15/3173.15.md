# § 3173.15   Applying for a commingling and allocation approval.

To apply for a CAA, the operator(s) must submit the following, if applicable, to the BLM office having jurisdiction over the leases, unit PAs, or CAs from which production is proposed to be commingled:


(a) A completed Sundry Notice for approval of commingling and allocation (if off-lease measurement is a feature of the commingling and allocation proposal, then a separate Sundry Notice under § 3173.23 is not necessary as long as the information required under § 3173.23(b) through (e) and, where applicable, § 3173.23(f) through (i) is included as part of the request for approval of commingling and allocation);


(b) A completed Sundry Notice for approval of off-lease measurement under § 3173.23, if any of the proposed FMPs are outside the boundaries of any of the leases, units, or CAs from which production would be commingled (which may be included in the same Sundry Notice as the request for approval of commingling and allocation), except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section;


(c) A proposed allocation agreement, including an allocation methodology (including allocation of produced water), with an example of how the methodology is applied, signed by each operator of each of the leases, unit PAs, or CAs from which production would be included in the CAA;


(d) A list of all Federal or Indian lease, unit PA, or CA numbers in the proposed CAA, specifying the type of production (*i.e.,* oil, gas, or both) for which commingling is requested;


(e) A topographic map or maps of appropriate scale showing the following:


(1) The boundaries of all the leases, units, unit PAs, or communitized areas whose production is proposed to be commingled; and


(2) The location of existing or planned facilities and the relative location of all wellheads (including the API number) and piping included in the CAA, and existing FMPs or FMPs proposed to be installed to the extent known or anticipated;


(f) A surface use plan of operations (which may be included in the same Sundry Notice as the request for approval of commingling and allocation) if new surface disturbance is proposed for the FMP and its associated facilities are located on BLM-managed land within the boundaries of the lease, units, and communitized areas from which production would be commingled;


(g) A right-of-way grant application (Standard Form 299), filed under 43 CFR part 2880, if the proposed FMP is on a pipeline, or under 43 CFR part 2800, if the proposed FMP is a meter or storage tank. This requirement applies only when new surface disturbance is proposed for the FMP, and its associated facilities are located on BLM-managed land outside any of the leases, units, or communitized areas whose production would be commingled;


(h) Written approval from the appropriate surface-management agency, if new surface disturbance is proposed for the FMP and its associated facilities are located on Federal land managed by an agency other than the BLM;


(i) A right-of-way grant application for the proposed FMP, filed under 25 CFR part 169, with the appropriate BIA office, if any of the proposed surface facilities are on Indian land outside the lease, unit, or communitized area from which the production would be commingled;


(j) Documentation demonstrating that each of the leases, unit PAs, or CAs proposed for inclusion in the CAA is producing in paying quantities (or, in the case of Federal leases, is capable of production in paying quantities) pending approval of the CAA; and


(k) All gas analyses, including Btu content (if the CAA request includes gas) and all oil gravities (if the CAA request includes oil) for previous periods of production from the leases, units, unit PAs, or communitized areas proposed for inclusion in the CAA, up to 6 years before the date of the application for approval of the CAA. Gas analysis and oil gravity data is not needed if the CAA falls under § 3173.14(a)(1).
