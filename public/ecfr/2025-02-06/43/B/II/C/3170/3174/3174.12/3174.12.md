# § 3174.12   Measurement tickets.

(a) *Tank gauging.* After oil is measured by tank gauging under §§ 3174.5 and 3174.6 of this subpart, the operator, purchaser, or transporter, as appropriate, must complete a uniquely numbered measurement ticket, in either paper or electronic format, with the following information:


(1) Lease, unit PA, or CA number;


(2) Unique tank number and nominal tank capacity;


(3) Opening and closing dates and times;


(4) Opening and closing gauges and observed temperatures in °F;


(5) Observed volume for opening and closing gauge, using tank specific calibration charts (see § 3174.5(c));


(6) Total gross standard volume removed from the tank following API 11.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3);


(7) Observed API oil gravity and temperature in °F;


(8) API oil gravity at 60 °F, following API 11.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3);


(9) S&W content percent;


(10) Unique number of each seal removed and installed;


(11) Name of the individual performing the tank gauging; and


(12) Name of the operator.


(b) *LACT system and CMS.* (1) At the beginning of every month, and, unless the operator is using a flow computer under § 3174.10, before conducting proving operations on a LACT system, the operator, purchaser, or transporter, as appropriate, must complete a uniquely numbered measurement ticket, in either paper or electronic format, with the following information:


(i) Lease, unit PA, or CA number;


(ii) Unique meter ID number;


(iii) Opening and closing dates;


(iv) Opening and closing totalizer readings of the indicated volume;


(v) Meter factor, indicating if it is a composite meter factor;


(vi) Total gross standard volume removed through the LACT system or CMS;


(vii) API oil gravity. For API oil gravity determined from a composite sample, the observed API oil gravity and temperature must be indicated in °F and the API oil gravity must be indicated at 60 °F. For API oil gravity determined from average density (CMS only), the average uncorrected density must be determined by the CMS;


(viii) The average temperature in °F;


(ix) The average flowing pressure in psig;


(x) S&W content percent;


(xi) Unique number of each seal removed and installed;


(xii) Name of the purchaser's representative; and


(xiii) Name of the operator.


(2) Any accumulators used in the determination of average pressure, average temperature, and average density must be reset to zero whenever a new measurement ticket is opened.
