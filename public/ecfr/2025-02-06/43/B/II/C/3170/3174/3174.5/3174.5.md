# § 3174.5   Oil measurement by tank gauging—general requirements.

(a) *Measurement objective.* Oil measurement by tank gauging must accurately compute the total net standard volume of oil withdrawn from a properly calibrated sales tank by following the activities prescribed in § 3174.6 and the requirements of § 3174.4 of this subpart to determine the quantity and quality of oil being removed.


(b) *Oil tank equipment.* (1) Each tank used for oil storage must comply with the recommended practices listed in API RP 12R1 (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3).


(2) Each oil storage tank must be connected, maintained, and operated in compliance with §§ 3173.2, 3173.6, and 3173.7 of this part.


(3) All oil storage tanks, hatches, connections, and other access points must be vapor tight. Unless connected to a vapor recovery or flare system, all tanks must have a pressure-vacuum relief valve installed at the highest point in the vent line or connection with another tank. All hatches, connections, and other access points must be installed and maintained in accordance with manufacturers' specifications.


(4) All oil storage tanks must be clearly identified and have an operator-generated number unique to the lease, unit PA, or CA, stenciled on the tank and maintained in a legible condition.


(5) Each oil storage tank associated with an approved FMP that has a tank-gauging system must be set and maintained level.


(6) Each oil storage tank associated with an approved FMP that has a tank-gauging system must be equipped with a distinct gauging reference point, consistent with API 3.1A (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3). The height of the reference point must be stamped on a fixed bench-mark plate or stenciled on the tank near the gauging hatch, and be maintained in a legible condition.


(c) *Sales tank calibrations.* The operator must accurately calibrate each oil storage tank associated with an approved FMP that has a tank-gauging system using either API 2.2A, API 2.2B, or API 2.2C; and API RP 2556 (all incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3). The operator must:


(1) Determine sales tank capacities by tank calibration using actual tank measurements;


(i) The unit volume must be in barrels (bbl); and


(ii) The incremental height measurement must match gauging increments specified in § 3174.6(b)(5)(i)(C);


(2) Recalibrate a sales tank if it is relocated or repaired, or the capacity is changed as a result of denting, damage, installation, removal of interior components, or other alterations; and


(3) Submit sales tank calibration charts (tank tables) to the AO within 45 days after calibration. Tank tables may be in paper or electronic format.
