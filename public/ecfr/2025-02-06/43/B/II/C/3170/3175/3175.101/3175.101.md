# § 3175.101   Installation and operation of electronic gas measurement systems.

(a) Manifolds and gauge lines connecting the pressure taps to the secondary device must:


(1) Have a nominal diameter of not less than 
3/8-inch, including ports and valves;


(2) Be sloped upwards from the pressure taps at a minimum pitch of 1 inch per foot of length with no visible sag;


(3) Have the same internal diameter along their entire length;


(4) Not include tees except for the static-pressure line;


(5) Not be connected to any other devices or more than one differential pressure and static-pressure transducer. If the operator is employing redundancy verification, two differential pressure and two static-pressure transducers may be connected; and


(6) Be no longer than 6 feet.


(b) Each FMP must include a display, which must:


(1) Be readable without the need for data-collection units, laptop computers, a password, or any special equipment;


(2) Be on site and in a location that is accessible to the AO;


(3) Include the units of measure for each required variable;


(4) Display the software version and previous-day's volume, as well as the following variables consecutively:


(i) Current flowing static pressure with units (psia or psig);


(ii) Current differential pressure (inches of water);


(iii) Current flowing temperature ( °F); and


(iv) Current flow rate (Mcf/day or scf/day); and


(5) Either display or post on site and accessible to the AO an hourly or daily QTR (see § 3175.104(a)) no more than 31 days old showing the following information:


(i) Previous-period (for this section, previous period means at least 1 day prior, but no longer than 1 month prior) average differential pressure (inches of water);


(ii) Previous-period average static pressure with units (psia or psig); and


(iii) Previous-period average flowing temperature ( °F).


(c) The following information must be maintained at the FMP in a legible condition, in compliance with § 3170.7(g) of this part, and accessible to the AO at all times:


(1) The unique meter ID number;


(2) Relative density (specific gravity);


(3) Elevation of the FMP;


(4) Primary device information, such as orifice bore diameter (inches) or Beta or area ratio and discharge coefficient, as applicable;


(5) Meter-tube mean inside diameter;


(6) Make, model, and location of approved isolating flow conditioners, if used;


(7) Location of the downstream end of 19-tube-bundle flow straighteners, if used;


(8) For self-contained EGM systems, make and model number of the system;


(9) For component-type EGM systems, make and model number of each transducer and the flow computer;


(10) URL and upper calibrated limit for each transducer;


(11) Location of the static-pressure tap (upstream or downstream);


(12) Last primary-device inspection date; and


(13) Last secondary device verification date.


(d) The differential pressure, static pressure, and flowing temperature transducers must be operated between the lower and upper calibrated limits of the transducer. The BLM may approve the differential pressure to exceed the upper calibrated limit of the differential-pressure transducer for brief periods in plunger lift operations; however, the differential pressure may not exceed the URL.


(e) The flowing temperature of the gas must be continuously measured and used in the flow-rate calculations under API 21.1, Section 4 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).
