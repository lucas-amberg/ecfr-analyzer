# § 3175.102   Verification and calibration of electronic gas measurement systems.

(a) *Transducer verification and calibration after installation or repair.* (1) Before performing any verification required in this section, the operator must perform a leak test in the manner prescribed in § 3175.92(a)(1).


(2) The operator must verify the points listed in API 21.1, Subsection 7.3.3 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), by comparing the values from the certified test device with the values used by the flow computer to calculate flow rate. If any of these as-left readings vary from the test equipment reading by more than the tolerance determined by API 21.1, Subsection 8.2.2.2, Equation 24 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), then that transducer must be replaced and the new transducer must be tested under this paragraph.


(3) For absolute static-pressure transducers, the value of atmospheric pressure used when the transducer is vented to atmosphere must be calculated under appendix A to this subpart, measured by a NIST-certified barometer with a stated accuracy of ±0.05 psi or better, or obtained from an absolute-pressure calibration device.


(4) Before putting a meter into service, the differential-pressure transducer must be tested at zero with full working pressure applied to both sides of the transducer. If the absolute value of the transducer reading is greater than the reference accuracy of the transducer, expressed in inches of water column, the transducer must be re-zeroed.


(b) *Routine verification frequency.* (1) If redundancy verification under paragraph (d) of this section is not used, the differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature transducers must be verified under the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section at the frequency specified in Table 1 to § 3175.100, in months; or


(2) If redundancy verification under paragraph (d) of this section is used, the differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature transducers must be verified under the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, the transducers must be verified under the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section at least annually.


(c) *Routine verification procedures.* Verifications must be performed according to API 21.1, Subsection 8.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), with the following exceptions, additions, and clarifications:


(1) Before performing any verification required under this section, the operator must perform a leak test consistent with § 3175.92(a)(1).


(2) An as-found verification for differential pressure, static pressure and temperature must be conducted at the normal operating point of each transducer.


(i) The normal operating point is the mean value taken over a previous time period not less than 1 day or greater than 1 month. Acceptable mean values include means weighted based on flow time and flow rate.


(ii) For differential and static-pressure transducers, the pressure applied to the transducer for this verification must be within five percentage points of the normal operating point. For example, if the normal operating point for differential pressure is 17 percent of the upper calibrated limit, the normal point verification pressure must be between 12 percent and 22 percent of the upper calibrated limit.


(iii) For the temperature transducer, the water bath or test thermometer well must be within 20 °F of the normal operating point for temperature.


(3) If any of the as-found values are in error by more than the manufacturer's specification for stability or drift—as adjusted for static pressure and ambient temperature—on two consecutive verifications, that transducer must be replaced prior to returning the meter to service.


(4) If a transducer is calibrated, the as-left verification must include the normal operating point of that transducer, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(5) The as-found values for differential pressure obtained with the low side vented to atmospheric pressure must be corrected to working-pressure values using API 21.1, Annex H, Equation H.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).


(6) The verification tolerance for differential and static pressure is defined by API 21.1, Subsection 8.2.2.2, Equation 24 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30). The verification tolerance for temperature is equivalent to the uncertainty of the temperature transmitter or 0.5 °F, whichever is greater.


(7) All required verification points must be within the verification tolerance before returning the meter to service.


(8) Before putting a meter into service, the differential-pressure transducer must be tested at zero with full working pressure applied to both sides of the transducer. If the absolute value of the transducer reading is greater than the reference accuracy of the transducer, expressed in inches of water column, the transducer must be re-zeroed.


(d) *Redundancy verification procedures.* Redundancy verifications must be performed as required under API 21.1, Subsection 8.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), with the following exceptions, additions, and clarifications:


(1) The operator must identify which set of transducers is used for reporting on the OGOR (the primary transducers) and which set of transducers is used as a check (the check set of transducers);


(2) For every calendar month, the operator must compare the flow-time linear averages of differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature readings from the primary transducers with those from the check transducers;


(3)(i) If for any transducer the difference between the averages exceeds the tolerance defined by the following equation:


(ii) The operator must verify both the primary and check transducer under paragraph (c) of this section within the first 5 days of the month following the month in which the redundancy verification was performed. For example, if the redundancy verification for March reveals that the difference in the flow-time linear averages of differential pressure exceeded the verification tolerance, both the primary and check differential-pressure transducers must be verified under paragraph (c) of this section by April 5th.


(e) The operator must retain documentation of each verification for the period required under § 3170.7 of this part, including calibration data for transducers that were replaced, and submit it to the BLM upon request.


(1) For routine verifications, this documentation must include:


(i) The information required in § 3170.7(g) of this part;


(ii) The time and date of the verification and the last verification date;


(iii) Primary device data (meter-tube inside diameter and differential-device size, Beta or area ratio);


(iv) The type and location of taps (flange or pipe, upstream or downstream static tap);


(v) The flow computer make and model;


(vi) The make and model number for each transducer, for component-type EGM systems;


(vii) Transducer data (make, model, differential, static, temperature URL, and upper calibrated limit);


(viii) The normal operating points for differential pressure, static pressure, and flowing temperature;


(ix) Atmospheric pressure;


(x) Verification points (as-found and applied) for each transducer;


(xi) Verification points (as-left and applied) for each transducer, if calibration was performed;


(xii) The differential device inspection date and condition (e.g., clean, sharp edge, or surface condition);


(xiii) Verification equipment make, model, range, accuracy, and last certification date;


(xiv) The name, contact information, and affiliation of the person performing the verification and any witness, if applicable; and


(xv) Remarks, if any.


(2) For redundancy verification checks, this documentation must include;


(i) The information required in § 3170.7(g) of this part;


(ii) The month and year for which the redundancy check applies;


(iii) The makes, models, upper range limits, and upper calibrated limits of the primary set of transducers;


(iv) The makes, models, upper range limits, and upper calibrated limits of the check set of transducers;


(v) The information required in API 21.1, Annex I (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30);


(vii) The tolerance for differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature as calculated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and


(viii) Whether or not each transducer required verification under paragraph (c) of this section.


(f) *Notification of verification.* (1) For verifications performed after installation or following repair, the operator must notify the AO at least 72 hours before conducting the verifications.


(2) For routine verifications, the operator must notify the AO at least 72 hours before conducting the verification or submit a monthly or quarterly verification schedule to the AO in advance.


(g) If, during the verification, the combined errors in as-found differential pressure, static pressure, and flowing temperature taken at the normal operating points tested result in a flow-rate error greater than 2 percent or 2 Mcf/day, whichever is greater, the volumes reported on the OGOR and on royalty reports submitted to ONRR must be corrected beginning with the date that the inaccuracy occurred. If that date is unknown, the volumes must be corrected beginning with the production month that includes the date that is half way between the date of the last verification and the date of the present verification. See the example in § 3175.92(f).


(h) *Test equipment requirements.* (1) Test equipment used to verify or calibrate transducers at an FMP must be certified at least every 2 years. Documentation of the certification must be on site and made available to the AO during all verifications and must show:


(i) The test equipment serial number, make, and model;


(ii) The date on which the recertification took place;


(iii) The range of the test equipment; and


(iv) The uncertainty determined or verified as part of the recertification.


(2) Test equipment used to verify or calibrate transducers at an FMP must meet the following accuracy standards:


(i) The accuracy of the test equipment, stated in actual units of measure, must be no greater than 0.5 times the reference accuracy of the transducer being verified, also stated in actual units of measure; or


(ii) The equipment must have a stated accuracy of at least 0.10 percent of the upper calibrated limit of the transducer being verified.
