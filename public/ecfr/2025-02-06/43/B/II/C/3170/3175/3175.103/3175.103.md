# § 3175.103   Flow rate, volume, and average value calculation.

(a) The flow rate must be calculated as follows:


(1) For flange-tapped orifice plates, the flow rate must be calculated under:


(i) API 14.3.3, Section 4 and API 14.3.3, Section 5 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30); and


(ii) AGA Report No. 8 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), for supercompressibility.


(2) For primary devices other than flange-tapped orifice plates, for which there are no industry standards, the flow rate must be calculated under the equations and procedures recommended by the PMT and approved by the BLM, specific to the make, model, size, and area ratio of the primary device used.


(b) Atmospheric pressure used to convert static pressure in psig to static pressure in psia must be determined under API 21.1, Subsection 8.3.3 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).


(c) Hourly and daily gas volumes, average values of the live input variables, flow time, and integral value or average extension as required under § 3175.104 must be determined under API 21.1, Section 4 and API 21.1, Annex B (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).
