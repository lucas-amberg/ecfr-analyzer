# § 3175.114   Spot samples—allowable methods.

(a) Spot samples must be obtained using one of the following methods:


(1) *Purging—fill and empty method.* Samples taken using this method must comply with GPA 2166-05, Section 9.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30);


(2) *Helium “pop” method.* Samples taken using this method must comply with GPA 2166-05, Section 9.5 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30). The operator must maintain documentation demonstrating that the cylinder was evacuated and pre-charged before sampling and make the documentation available to the AO upon request;


(3) *Floating piston cylinder method.* Samples taken using this method must comply with GPA 2166-05, Sections 9.7.1 to 9.7.3 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30). The operator must maintain documentation of the seal material and type of lubricant used and make the documentation available to the AO upon request;


(4) *Portable gas chromatograph.* Samples taken using this method must comply with § 3175.118; or


(5) Other methods approved by the BLM (through the PMT) and posted at *www.blm.gov*.


(b) If the operator uses either a purging—fill and empty method or a helium “pop” method, and if the flowing pressure at the sample port is less than or equal to 15 psig, the operator may also employ a vacuum-gathering system. Samples taken using a vacuum-gathering system must comply with API 14.1, Subsection 11.10 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), and the samples must be obtained from the discharge of the vacuum pump.
