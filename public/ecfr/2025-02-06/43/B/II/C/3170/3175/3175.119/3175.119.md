# ยง 3175.119   Components to analyze.

(a) The gas must be analyzed for the following components:


(1) Methane;


(2) Ethane;


(3) Propane;


(4) Iso Butane;


(5) Normal Butane;


(6) Pentanes;


(7) Hexanes + (C_6_+);


(8) Carbon dioxide; and


(9) Nitrogen.


(b) When the concentration of C_6_+ exceeds 0.5 mole percent, the following gas components must also be analyzed:


(1) Hexanes;


(2) Heptanes;


(3) Octanes; and


(4) Nonanes +.


(c) In lieu of testing each sample for the components required under paragraph (b) of this section, the operator may periodically test for these components and adjust the assumed C_6_+ composition to remove bias in the heating value (see ยง 3175.126(a)(3)). The C_6_+ composition must be applied to the mole percent of C_6_+ analyses until the next analysis is done under paragraph (b) of this section. The minimum analysis frequency for the components listed in paragraph (b) of this section is as follows:


(1) For high-volume FMPs, once per year; and


(2) For very-high-volume FMPs, once every 6 months.
