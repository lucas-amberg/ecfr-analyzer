# § 3175.126   Reporting of heating value and volume.

(a) The gross heating value and real heating value, or average gross heating value and average real heating value, as applicable, derived from all samples and analyses must be reported on the OGOR in units of Btu/scf under the following conditions:


(1) Containing no water vapor (“dry”), unless the water vapor content has been determined through actual on-site measurement and reported on the gas analysis report. The heating value may not be reported on the basis of an assumed water-vapor content. Acceptable methods of measuring water vapor are:


(i) Chilled mirror;


(ii) Laser detectors; and


(iii) Other methods approved by the BLM;


(2) Adjusted to a pressure of 14.73 psia and a temperature of 60 °F; and


(3) For samples analyzed under § 3175.119(a), and notwithstanding any provision of a contract between the operator and a purchaser or transporter, the composition of hexane+ is deemed to be:


(i) 60 percent n-hexane, 30 percent n-heptane, and 10 percent n-octane; or


(ii) The composition determined under § 3175.119(c).


(b) The volume for royalty purposes must be reported on the OGOR in units of Mcf as follows:


(1) The volume must not be adjusted for water-vapor content or any other factors that are not included in the calculations required in § 3175.94 or § 3175.103; and


(2) The volume must match the monthly volume(s) shown in the unedited QTR(s) or integration statement(s) unless edits to the data are documented under paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Edits and adjustments to reported volume or heating value.* (1) If for any reason there are measurement errors stemming from an equipment malfunction that results in discrepancies to the calculated volume or heating value of the gas, the volume or heating value reported during the period in which the volume or heating value error persisted must be estimated.


(2) All edits made to the data before the submission of the OGOR must be documented and include verifiable justifications for the edits made. This documentation must be maintained under § 3170.7 of this part and must be submitted to the BLM upon request.


(3) All values on daily and hourly QTRs that have been changed or edited must be clearly identified and must be cross referenced to the justification required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(4) The volumes reported on the OGOR must be corrected beginning with the date that the inaccuracy occurred. If that date is unknown, the volumes must be corrected beginning with the production month that includes the date that is half way between the date of the previous verification and the most recent verification date.
