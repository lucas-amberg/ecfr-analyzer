# § 3175.134   Transducer test reporting.

(a) Each test required by §§ 3175.131 through 3175.133 must be fully documented by the test facility performing the tests. The report must indicate the results for each required test and include all data points recorded.


(b) The report must be submitted to the PMT. If the PMT determines that all testing was completed as required by §§ 3175.131 through 3175.133, it will make a recommendation that the BLM approve the transducer make, model, and range, along with the reference uncertainty, influence effects, and any operating restrictions, and posts them to the BLM's website at *www.blm.gov* as an approved device.
