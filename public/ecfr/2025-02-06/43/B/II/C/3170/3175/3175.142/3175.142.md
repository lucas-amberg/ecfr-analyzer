# ยง 3175.142   Required static tests.

(a) *Instantaneous flow rate.* The instantaneous flow rates must meet the criteria in ยง 3175.141(d) for each test identified in Table 1 to this section, using the gas compositions identified in Table 2 to this section, as prescribed in Table 1 to this section.


(b) *Sums and averages.* (1) Fixed input values from test 2 in Table 1 to this section must be applied for a period of at least 24 hours.


(2) At the conclusion of the 24-hour period, the following hourly and daily values must meet the criteria in ยง 3175.141(d):


(i) Volume;


(ii) Integral value;


(iii) Flow time;


(iv) Average differential pressure;


(v) Average static pressure; and


(vi) Average flowing temperature.


(c) *Other tests.* The following additional tests must be performed on the flow-computer software:


(1) Each parameter of the configuration log must be changed to ensure the event log properly records the changes according to the variables listed in ยง 3175.104(c); and


(2) Inputs simulating a 15 percent and 150 percent over-range of the differential and static-pressure transducer's calibrated span must be entered to verify that the over-range condition triggers an alarm or an entry in the event log.
