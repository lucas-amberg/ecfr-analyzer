# § 3175.143   Required dynamic tests.

(a) *Square wave test.* The pressures and temperatures must be applied to the software revision under test for at least 60 minutes as follows:


(1) *Differential pressure.* The differential pressure must be cycled from a low value, below the no-flow cutoff, to a high value of approximately 80 percent of the upper calibrated limit of the differential-pressure transducer. The cycle must approximate a square wave pattern with a period of 60 seconds, and the maximum and minimum values must be the same for each cycle;


(2) *Static pressure.* The static pressure must be cycled between approximately 20 percent and approximately 80 percent of the upper calibrated limit of the static-pressure transducer in a square wave pattern identical to the cycling pattern used for the differential pressure. The maximum and minimum values must be the same for each cycle;


(3) *Temperature.* The temperature must be cycled between approximately 20 °F and approximately 100 °F in a square wave pattern identical to the cycling pattern used for the differential pressure. The maximum and minimum values must be the same for each cycle; and


(4) At the conclusion of the 1-hour period, the following hourly values must meet the criteria in § 3175.141(d):


(i) Volume;


(ii) Integral value;


(iii) Flow time;


(iv) Average differential pressure;


(v) Average static pressure; and


(vi) Average flowing temperature.


(b) *Sawtooth test.* The pressures and temperatures must be applied to the software revision under test for 24 hours as follows:


(1) *Differential pressure.* The differential pressure must be cycled from a low value, below the no-flow cutoff, to a high value of approximately 80 percent of the maximum value of differential pressure for which the flow computer is designed. The cycle must approximate a linear sawtooth pattern between the low value and the high value and there must be 3 to 10 cycles per hour. The no-flow period between cycles must last approximately 10 percent of the cycle period;


(2) *Static pressure.* The static pressure must be cycled between approximately 20 percent and approximately 80 percent of the maximum value of static pressure for which the flow computer is designed. The cycle must approximate a linear sawtooth pattern between the low value and the high value and there must be 3 to 10 cycles per hour;


(3) *Temperature.* The temperature must be cycled between approximately 20 °F and approximately 100 °F. The cycle should approximate a linear sawtooth pattern between the low value and the high value and there must be 3 to 10 cycles per hour; and


(4) At the conclusion of the 24-hour period, the following hourly and daily values must meet the criteria in § 3175.141(d):


(i) Volume;


(ii) Integral value;


(iii) Flow time;


(iv) Average differential pressure;


(v) Average static pressure; and


(vi) Average flowing temperature.


(c) *Random test.* The pressures and temperatures must be applied to the software revision under test for 24 hours as follows:


(1) *Differential pressure.* Differential-pressure random values must range from a low value, below the no-flow cutoff, to a high value of approximately 80 percent of the upper calibrated limit of the differential-pressure transducer. The no-flow period between cycles must last for approximately 10 percent of the test period;


(2) *Static pressure.* Static-pressure random values must range from a low value of approximately 20 percent of the upper calibrated limit of the static-pressure transducer, to a high value of approximately 80 percent of the upper calibrated limit of the static-pressure transducer;


(3) *Temperature.* Temperature random values must range from approximately 20 °F to approximately 100 °F; and


(4) At the conclusion of the 24-hour period, the following hourly values must meet the criteria in § 3175.141(d):


(i) Volume;


(ii) Integral value;


(iii) Flow time;


(iv) Average differential pressure;


(v) Average static pressure; and


(vi) Average flowing temperature.


(d) *Long-term volume accumulation test.* (1) Fixed inputs of differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature must be applied to the software version under test to simulate a flow rate greater than 500,000 Mcf/day for a period of at least 7 days.


(2) At the end of the 7-day test period, the accumulated volume must meet the criteria in § 3175.141(d).
