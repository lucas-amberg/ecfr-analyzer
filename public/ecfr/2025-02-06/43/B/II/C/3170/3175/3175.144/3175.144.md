# § 3175.144   Flow-computer software test reporting.

(a) The test facility performing the tests must fully document each test required by §§ 3175.141 through 3175.143. The report must indicate the results for each required test and include all data points recorded.


(b) The report must be submitted to the AO by the operator or the manufacturer. If the PMT determines all testing was completed as required by this section, it will make a recommendation that the BLM approve the software version and post it on the BLM's website at *www.blm.gov* as approved software.
