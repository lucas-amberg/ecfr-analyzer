# ยง 3175.44   Flow-computer software.

(a) A flow computer of a particular make and model, and equipped with a particular software version, is approved for use at high- and very-high-volume FMPs if the flow computer and software version meet the following requirements:


(1) The documentation required in ยง 3175.144 has been submitted to the PMT;


(2) The PMT has determined that the flow computer and software version passed the type-testing required in ยง 3175.140, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section; and


(3) The BLM has approved the flow computer and software version and has placed them on the list of approved equipment maintained at *www.blm.gov*.


(b) *Software versions (high- and very-high-volume FMPs).* (1) Software revisions that affect or have the potential to affect determination of flow rate, determination of volume, determination of heating value, or data or calculations used to verify flow rate, volume, or heating value must be type-tested under ยง 3175.140.


(2) Software revisions that do not affect or have the potential to affect the determination of flow rate, determination of volume, determination of heating value, or data and calculations used to verify flow rate, volume, or heating value are not required to be type-tested, however, the operator must provide the BLM with a list of these software versions and a brief description of what changes were made from the previous version. (The software manufacturer may provide such information instead of the operator.)


(c) *Software versions (low- and very-low-volume FMPs).* All software versions are approved for use at low- and very-low-volume FMPs, unless otherwise required by the BLM.
