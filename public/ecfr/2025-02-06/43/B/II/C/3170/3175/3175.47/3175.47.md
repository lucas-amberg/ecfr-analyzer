A make, model, and size of differential primary device listed at *www.blm.gov* is approved for use if it is installed, operated, and maintained in compliance with any applicable conditions of use identified on *www.blm.gov* for that device.

(d) The PMT will review the test data to ensure that the primary device meets the requirements of API 22.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30) and § 3175.31(c) and (d) and make a recommendation to the BLM to either approve use of the device, disapprove use of the device, or approve its use with conditions.


(e) If the primary device is approved by the BLM, the BLM will add the approved make and model, and any applicable conditions of use, to the list maintained at *www.blm.gov.*
