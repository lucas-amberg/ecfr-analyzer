# § 3175.49   Accounting systems.

An accounting system with a name and version listed at *www.blm.gov* is approved for use in reporting logs and records to the BLM. The approval is specific to those makes and models of flow computers for which testing demonstrates compatibility. Approval for a particular name and version of accounting system used with a particular make and model of flow computer is obtained as follows:


(a) For daily QTRs (see § 3175.104(a)), an operator or vendor must submit daily QTRs to the BLM both from the accounting system and directly from the flow computer for at least 6 consecutive monthly reporting periods;


(b) For hourly QTRs (see § 3175.104(a)), an operator must submit hourly QTRs to the BLM both from the accounting system and directly from the flow computer for at least 15 consecutive daily reporting periods. (A vendor may submit such information on behalf of an operator);


(c) For configuration logs (see § 3175.104(b)), an operator must submit at least 10 configuration logs to the BLM taken at random times covering a span of at least 6 months both from the accounting system and directly from the flow computer. (A vendor may submit such information on behalf of an operator);


(d) For event logs (see § 3175.104(c)), an operator must submit an event log to the BLM containing at least 50 events both from the accounting system and directly from the flow computer. (A vendor may submit such information on behalf of an operator);


(e) For alarm logs (see § 3175.104(d)), an operator must submit an alarm log to the BLM containing at least 50 alarm conditions both from the accounting system and directly from the flow computer (a vendor may submit such information on behalf of an operator);


(f) The BLM may require additional tests and records that may be necessary to determine that the software meets the requirements of § 3175.104(a);


(g) The records retrieved directly from the flow computer in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section must be unedited;


(h) The records retrieved from the accounting system in paragraphs (a) through (d) must include both edited and unedited versions; and


(i) The BLM will approve the accounting system name and version for use with the make and model of flow computer used for comparison, and add the system name and version to the list of approved systems maintained at *www.blm.gov* if:


(1) The BLM compares the records retrieved directly from the flow computer with the unedited records from the accounting system and there are no significant discrepancies; and


(2) The BLM compares the records retrieved directly from the flow computer with the edited records from the accounting system and all changes are clearly indicated, the reason for each change is indicated or is available upon request, and the edited version is clearly distinguishable from the unedited version.
