# § 3175.61   Grandfathering.

(a) *Meter tubes.* Meter tubes installed at high- and low-volume FMPs before January 17, 2017 are exempt from the meter tube requirements of API 14.3.2, Subsection 6.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), and § 3175.80(f) and (k). For high-volume FMPs, the BLM will add an uncertainty of ±0.25 percent to the discharge coefficient uncertainty when determining overall meter uncertainty under § 3175.31(a), unless the PMT reviews, and the BLM approves, data showing otherwise. Meter tubes grandfathered under this section must still meet the following requirements:


(1) Orifice plate eccentricity must comply with AGA Report No. 3 (1985), Section 4.2.4 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).


(2) Meter tube construction and condition must comply with AGA Report No. 3 (1985), Section 4.3.4 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).


(3) *Meter tube lengths.* (i) Meter tube lengths must comply with AGA Report No. 3 (1985), Section 4.4 (dimensions “A” and “A'” from Figures 4-8) (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).


(ii) If the upstream meter tube contains a 19-tube bundle flow straightener or isolating flow conditioner, the installation must comply with § 3175.80(g);


(b) *EGM software.* (1) EGM software installed at very-low-volume FMPs before January 17, 2017 is exempt from the requirements in § 3175.103(a)(1). However, flow-rate calculations must still be calculated in accordance with AGA Report No. 3 (1985), Section 6, or API 14.3.3 (1992), and supercompressibility calculations must still be calculated in accordance with PRCI NX 19 (all incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).


(2) EGM software installed at low-volume FMPs before January 17, 2017 is exempt from the requirements at § 3175.103(a)(1)(i) if the differential-pressure to static-pressure ratio, based on the monthly average differential pressure and static pressure, is less than the value of “*x*_i_” shown in API 14.3.3 (1992), Annex G, Table G.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30). However, flow-rate calculations must still be calculated in accordance with API 14.3.3 (1992) (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).
