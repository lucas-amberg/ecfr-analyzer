(g) CO_2_ content (mole percent);


(h) N_2_ content (mole percent);


(i) Heating value calculated under § 3175.125 (Btu/standard cubic feet);


(j) Atmospheric pressure or elevation at the FMP;


(k) Pressure base;


(l) Temperature base;

(n) Chart rotation (hours or days);


(o) Differential-pressure bellows range (inches of water);


(p) Static-pressure element range (psi); and


(q) For each chart or day integrated:


(i) The time and date on and time and date off;


(ii) Average differential pressure (inches of water);


(iii) Average static pressure;


(iv) Static-pressure units of measure (psia or psig);
