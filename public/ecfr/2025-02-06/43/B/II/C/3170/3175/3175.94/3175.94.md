# ยง 3175.94   Volume determination.

(a) The volume for each chart integrated must be determined as follows:


(1) If the primary device is a flange-tapped orifice plate, a single IMV must be calculated for each chart or chart interval using the following equation:


(2) For other types of primary devices, the IMV must be calculated using the equations and procedures recommended by the PMT and approved by the BLM, specific to the make, model, size, and area ratio of the primary device being used.


(3) Variables that are functions of differential pressure, static pressure, or flowing temperature (e.g., C_d_, Y, Z_f_) must use the average values of differential pressure, static pressure, and flowing temperature as determined from the integration statement and reported on the integration statement for the chart or chart interval integrated. The flowing temperature must be the average flowing temperature reported on the integration statement for the chart or chart interval being integrated.


(b) Atmospheric pressure used to convert static pressure in psig to static pressure in psia must be determined under appendix A to this subpart.
