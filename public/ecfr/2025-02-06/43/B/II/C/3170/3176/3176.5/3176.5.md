# ยง 3176.5   Requirements.

The requirements of this subpart are the minimum acceptable standards with regard to H_2_S operations. This subpart also classifies violations as typically major or minor for purposes of the assessment and penalty provisions of 43 CFR part 3160, subpart 3163, specifies the corrective action which will probably be required, and establishes the normal abatement period following detection of a major or minor violation in which the violator may take such corrective action without incurring an assessment. However, the authorized officer may, after consideration of all appropriate factors, require reasonable and necessary standards, corrective actions, and abatement periods that may, in some cases, vary from those specified in this subpart that he/she determines to be necessary to protect public health and safety, the environment, or to maintain control of a well to prevent waste of Federal mineral resources. To the extent such standards, actions, or abatement periods differ from those set forth in this subpart, they may be subject to review pursuant to 43 CFR 3165.3.
