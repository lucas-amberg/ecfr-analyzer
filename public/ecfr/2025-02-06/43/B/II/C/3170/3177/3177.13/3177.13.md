# § 3177.13   Variances from requirements or minimum standards.

An operator may request that the authorized officer approve a variance from any of the requirements or minimum standards prescribed in §§ 3177.5 through 3177.12. All such requests shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate authorized officer and provide information as to the circumstances that warrant approval of the variance(s) requested and the proposed alternative means by which the requirements or related minimum standard(s) will be satisfied. The authorized officer, after considering all relevant factors, will approve the requested variance(s) if it is determined that the proposed alterative(s) meet or exceed the objectives of the applicable minimum standard(s); or if the authorized officer determines that the exemption of the requirement is justified. Variances granted by BLM under this section shall be limited to proposals and requirements under BLM statutory and/or regulatory authority only, and shall not be construed as granting variances to regulations under EPA, State, or Tribal authority.
