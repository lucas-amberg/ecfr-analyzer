# § 3177.6   Application and approval authority.

(a) *On-lease disposal.* For water produced from a Federal/Indian lease and disposed of on the same Federal/Indian lease, or on other committed Federal/Indian leases if in a unit or communitized area, the approval of the disposal method is usually granted in conjunction with the approval for the disposal facilities. An example would be the approval of a proposal to drill an injection well to be used for the disposal of produced water from a well or wells on the same lease.


(1) *Disposal of water in injection wells.* When approval is requested for on-lease disposal of produced water into an injection well, the operator shall submit a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5. Information submitted in support of obtaining the Underground Injection Control permit shall be accepted by the authorized officer in approving the disposal method, provided the information submitted in support of obtaining such a permit satisfies all applicable Bureau of Land Management statutory responsibilities (including but not limited to drilling safety, down hole integrity, and protection of mineral and surface resources) and requirements in this subpart. If the authorized officer has on file a copy of the approval for the receiving facilities, he/she may determine that a reference to that document is sufficient.


(2) *Disposal of water in pits.* When approval is requested for disposal of produced water in a lined or unlined pit, the operator shall submit a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5. The operator shall comply with all the applicable Bureau of Land Management requirements and standards for pits established in this subpart. On National Forest lands, where the proposed pit location creates new surface disturbance, the authorized officer shall not approve the proposal without the prior approval of the Forest Service.


(b) *Off-lease disposal*—(1) *On leased or unleased Federal/Indian lands.* The purpose of the off-lease disposal approval process is to ensure that the removal of the produced water from a Federal or Indian oil and gas lease is proper and that the water is disposed of in an authorized facility. Therefore, the operator shall submit a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5, for removal of the water together with a copy of the authorization for the disposal facility. If the authorized officer has a copy of the approval for the receiving facilities on file, he/she may determine that a reference to that document is sufficient. Where an associated right-of-way authorization is required, the information for the right-of-way authorization may be incorporated in the Sundry Notice, and the Bureau of Land Management will process both authorizations simultaneously for Bureau lands.


(i) *Disposal of water in injection wells.* When approval is requested for removing water that is produced from wells on leased Federal or Indian lands and that is to be injected into a well located on another lease or unleased Federal lands, the operator shall submit to the authorized officer a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5, along with a copy of the Underground Injection Control permit issued to the operator of the injection well, unless the well is authorized by rule under 40 CFR part 144.


(ii) *Disposal of water in pits.* When approval is requested for removing water that is produced from wells on leased Federal or Indian lands and is to be disposed of into a lined or unlined pit located on another lease or unleased Federal lands, the operator shall submit to the authorized officer a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5.


(iii) *Right-of-way procedures.* The operator of the injection well or pit is required to have an authorization from the Bureau of Land Management for disposing of the water into the pit or well, under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and 43 CFR part 2800, or a similar authorization from the responsible surface management agency. In transporting the produced water from the lease to the pit or injection well, *e.g.,* building a road or laying a pipeline, a right-of-way authorization under Title V of FLPMA and 43 CFR part 2800 from the Bureau of Land Management or a similar permit from the responsible surface management agency also shall be obtained by the operator of the pit or any injection well or other responsible party.


(2) *Disposal of water on State and privately owned lands*—(i) *Disposal of water in injection wells.* When approval is requested for removing water that is produced from wells on leased Federal or Indian lands and that is to be injected into a well located on State or privately owned lands, the operator shall submit to the authorized officer, in addition to a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5, a copy of the Underground Injection Control permit issued for the injection well by Environmental Protection Agency or the State where the State has achieved primacy. Submittal of the Underground Injection Control permit will be accepted by the authorized officer and approval will be granted for the removal of the produced water unless the authorized officer states in writing that such approval will have adverse effects on the Federal/Indian lands or public health and safety.


(ii) *Disposal of water in pits.* When approval is requested for removing water that is produced from wells on leased Federal and/or Indian lands and is to be disposed of into a pit located on State or privately owned lands, the operator shall submit to the authorized officer, in addition to a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5, a copy of the permit issued for the pit by the State or any other regulatory agency, if required, for disposal in such pit. Submittal of the permit will be accepted by the authorized officer and approval will be granted for removal of the produced water unless the authorized officer states in writing that such approval will have adverse effects on the Federal/Indian lands or public health and safety. If such a permit is not issued by the State or other regulatory agency, the requested removal of the produced water from leased Federal or Indian lands will be denied.


(iii) *Right-of-way procedures.* If the water produced from wells on leased Federal and/or Indian lands, and to be disposed of at a location on State or privately owned lands, will be transported over off-lease Federal or Indian lands, the operator of the disposal facility or other responsible party shall have an authorization from the Bureau of Land Management under Title V of FLPMA and 43 CFR part 2800, or a similar authorization from the responsible surface management agency.
