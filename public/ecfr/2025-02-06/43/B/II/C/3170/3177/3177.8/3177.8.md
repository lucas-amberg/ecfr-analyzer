# ยง 3177.8   Informational requirements for pits.

Operators who request approval for disposal of produced water into a lined or unlined pit shall file an application on a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5, and identify the operator's field representative by name, address, and telephone number and the source of the produced water. Sources of produced water shall be identified by facility, lease number, well number and name, and legal description of well location. All samples for water analysis shall be taken at the current discharge a point. A reclamation plan detailing the procedures expected to be followed for closure of the pit and the contouring and revegetating of the site shall be submitted prior to pit abandonment. If requested by the authorized officer, a contingency plan to deal with specific anticipated emergency situations shall be submitted as provided for in 43 CFR 3162.5-1(d).


(a) *Lined pits.* The authorized officer shall not consider for approval an application for disposal into lined pits on Federal/Indian leases unless the operator also provides the following information:


(1) A map and drawings of the site on a suitable scale that show the pit dimension, cross section, side slopes, leak detection system, and location relative to other site facilities;


(2) The daily quantity of water to be disposed of (maximum daily quantity shall be cited if major fluctuations are anticipated) and a water analysis (unless waived by the authorized officer as unnecessary) that includes the concentrations of chlorides, sulfates, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and toxic constituents that the authorized officer reasonably believes to be present;


(3) Criteria used to determine the pit size, which includes a minimum of 2 feet of free-board;


(4) The average monthly evaporation and average monthly precipitation for the area;


(5) The method and schedule for periodic disposal of precipitated solids and a copy of the appropriate disposal permit, if any; and


(6) The type, thickness, and life span of material to be used for lining the pit and the method of installation. The manufacturer's guidebook and information for the product shall be included, if available.


(b) *Unlined pits.* (1) Application for disposal into unlined pits may be considered for approval by the authorized officer where the application of the operator shows that such disposal meets one or more of the following criteria:


(i) The water to be disposed of has an annual average TDS concentration equal to or less than that of the existing water to be protected, provided that the level of any toxic constituents in the produced water does not exceed established State or Federal standards for protection of surface and/or ground water;


(ii) All, or a substantial part, of the produced water is being used for beneficial purposes and meets minimum water quality standards for such uses. For example, uses of produced water for purposes such as irrigation and livestock or wildlife watering shall be considered as beneficial;


(iii)(A) The water to be disposed of will not degrade the quality of surface or subsurface waters in the area;


(B) The surface and subsurface waters contain TDS above 10,000 ppm, or toxic constituents in high concentrations; or


(C) The surface and subsurface waters are of such poor quality or small quantity as to eliminate any practical use thereof; and


(iv) That the volume of water to be disposed of per disposal facility does not exceed an average of 5 barrels per day on a monthly basis.


(2) Operators applying for disposal into an unlined pit shall also submit the following information, as appropriate:


(i) Applications for disposal into unlined pits that meet the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section shall include:


(A) A map and drawings of the site on a suitable scale that show the pit dimension, cross section, side slopes, size, and location relative to other site facilities;


(B) The daily quantity of water to be disposed of and a water analysis that includes total dissolved solids (in ppm), pH, oil and grease content, the concentrations of chlorides and sulfates, and other parameters or constituents toxic to animal or plant life as reasonably prescribed by the authorized officer. The applicant should also indicate any effect or interaction of produced water with any water resources present at or near the surface and other known mineral deposits. For applications submitted under criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the water quality analysis is not needed unless requested by the authorized officer;


(C) The average monthly evaporation and the average monthly precipitation for the area. For applications submitted under criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, average annual data will be acceptable;


(D) The estimated percolation rate based on soil characteristics under and adjacent to the pit. In some cases the authorized officer may require percolation tests using accepted test procedures; and


(E) Estimated depth and areal extent of the shallowest known aquifer with TDS less than 10,000 ppm, and the depth and extent of any known mineral deposits in the area.


(ii) Where beneficial use (criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) is the basis for the application, the justification submitted shall also contain written confirmation from the user(s).


(iii) If the application is made on the basis that surface and subsurface waters will not be adversely affected by disposal in an unlined pit (paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section), the justification shall also include the following additional information:


(A) Map of the site showing the location of surface waters, water wells, and existing water disposal facilities within 1 mile of the proposed disposal facility;


(B) Average concentration of TDS (in ppm) of all surface and subsurface waters within the 1-mile radius that might be affected by the proposed disposal;


(C) Reasonable geologic and hydrologic evidence that shows the proposed disposal method will not adversely affect existing water quality or major uses of such waters, and identifies the presence of any impermeable barrier(s), as necessary; and


(D) A copy of any State order or other authorization granted as a result of a public hearing that is pertinent to the authorized officer's consideration of the application.


(c) *Emergency pits.* Application for a permanent pit (lined or unlined) to be used for anticipated emergency purposes shall be submitted by the operator on a Sundry Notice, Form 3160-5, for approval by the authorized officer, unless it has been approved in conjunction with a previously approved operational activity. Design criteria for an emergency pit will be established by the authorized officer on a case-by-case basis. Any emergency use of such pits shall be reported in accordance with NTL-3A, and the pit shall be emptied and the liquids disposed of in accordance with applicable State and/or Federal regulations within 48 hours following its use, unless such time is extended by the authorized officer.
