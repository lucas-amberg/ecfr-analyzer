# ยง 3179.10   Definitions and acronyms.

As used in this subpart, the term:


*Automatic ignition system* means an automatic ignitor and, where necessary to ensure continuous combustion, a continuous pilot flame.


*Capture* means the physical containment of natural gas for transportation to market or productive use of natural gas and includes reinjection and royalty-free on-site uses pursuant to subpart 3178.


*Compressor station* means any permanent combination of one or more compressors that move natural gas at increased pressure through gathering or transmission pipelines, or into or out of storage. This includes, but is not limited to, gathering and boosting stations and transmission compressor stations. The combination of one or more compressors located at a well site, or located at an onshore natural gas processing plant, is not a compressor station.


*Gas-to-oil ratio (GOR)* means the ratio of gas to oil in the production stream expressed in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil at standard conditions.


*Gas well* means a well for which the energy equivalent of the gas produced, including its entrained liquefiable hydrocarbons, exceeds the energy equivalent of the oil produced. Unless more specific British thermal unit (Btu) values are available, a well with a gas-to-oil ratio greater than 6,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of gas per barrel of oil is a gas well.


*High-pressure flare* means an open-air flare stack or flare pit designed for the combustion of natural gas that would normally go to sales.


*Leak* means a release of natural gas from a component that is not associated with normal operation of the component, when such release is:


(1) A hydrocarbon emission detected by use of an optical-gas-imaging instrument;


(2) At least 500 ppm of hydrocarbon detected using a portable analyzer or other instrument that can measure the quantity of the release; or


(3) A hydrocarbon emission detected via audio, visual, and olfactory means or visible bubbles detected using soap solution. Releases due to normal operation of equipment intended to vent as part of normal operations, such as gas-driven pneumatic controllers and safety-release devices, are not leaks unless the releases exceed the quantities and frequencies expected during normal operations. Releases due to operator errors or equipment malfunctions or from control equipment at levels that exceed applicable regulatory requirements, such as releases from an oil storage tank hatch left open, or an improperly sized combustor, are leaks.


*Liquids unloading* means the removal of an accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons or water from the wellbore of a completed gas well.


*Lost oil or lost gas* means produced oil or gas that escapes containment, either intentionally or unintentionally, or is flared before being removed from the lease, unit, or communitized area, and cannot be recovered.


*Low-pressure flare* means any flare that does not meet the definition of high-pressure flare.


*Pneumatic controller* means an automated instrument used for maintaining a process condition, such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure, or temperature.
