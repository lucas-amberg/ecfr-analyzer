# § 3179.101   Repairing leaks.

(a) The operator must repair any leak as soon as practicable, and in no event later than 30 calendar days after discovery, unless good cause exists to delay the repair for a longer period. Good cause for delay of repair exists if the repair (including replacement) is technically infeasible (including unavailability of parts that have been ordered), would require a pipeline blowdown, a compressor station shutdown, or a well shut-in, or would be unsafe to conduct during operation of the unit.


(b) If there is good cause for delaying the repair beyond 30 calendar days, the operator must notify the BLM of the cause by Sundry Notice and must complete the repair at the earliest opportunity, such as during the next compressor station shutdown, well shut-in, or pipeline blowdown. In no case will the BLM approve a delay of more than 2 years.


(c) Not later than 30 calendar days after completion of a repair, the operator must verify the effectiveness of the repair by conducting a follow-up inspection using an appropriate instrument or a soap bubble test under Section 8.3.3 of EPA Method 21—Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks (40 CFR Appendix A-7 to part 60).


(d) If the repair is not effective, the operator must complete additional repairs within 15 calendar days and conduct follow-up inspections and repairs until the leak is repaired.
