(1) Issue Notices of Incidents of Noncompliance that impose monetary assessments and penalties; 


(2) Collect assessments and penalties; 


(3) Calculate and distribute shared civil penalties; 


(4) Train and certify Tribal or State inspectors; 


(5) Issue and regulate inspector identification cards; and
