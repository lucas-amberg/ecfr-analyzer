(a) If your cooperative agreement was terminated by consent, you may request that BLM reinstate the agreement at any time. 


(b) If BLM terminated an agreement because you did not carry out the terms of the agreement, you must prove that you have corrected the problem(s) and are able to carry out the terms of the agreement. 


(c) For any reinstatement request BLM will decide whether or not your cooperative agreement may be reinstated and, if so, whether you must make any changes to the agreement before it can be reinstated.
