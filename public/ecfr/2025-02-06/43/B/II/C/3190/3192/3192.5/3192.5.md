# ยง 3192.5   How do I modify a cooperative agreement?

You may modify a cooperative agreement by having all parties to the agreement consent to the change in writing. If the agreement is with a State, and the modification would affect the duration or scope of the agreement, then the State must obtain the written consent of the affected Tribe and/or allottee or heir.
