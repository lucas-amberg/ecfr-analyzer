# ยง 3207.17   How is the term of my lease affected by commitment to a unit?

(a) If your lease is committed to a unit agreement and its term would expire before the unit term would, BLM may extend your lease to match the term of the unit. We will do this if unit development has been diligently pursued while your lease is committed to the unit.


(b) To extend the term of a lease committed to a unit, the unit operator must send BLM a request for lease extension at least 60 days before the lease expires showing that unit development has been diligently pursued. BLM may require additional information.


(c) Within 30 days after receiving your complete extension request, BLM will notify the unit operator whether we approve.
