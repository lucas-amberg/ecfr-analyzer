# ยง 3212.12   How long does a suspension of operations or a suspension of operations and production last?

(a) BLM will state in your suspension notice how long your suspension of operations or operations and production is effective.


(b) During a suspension, you may ask BLM in writing to terminate your suspension. You may not unilaterally terminate a suspension that BLM ordered. A suspension of operations and production that we approved upon your request will automatically terminate when you begin or resume authorized production or drilling operations.


(c) If we receive information showing that you must resume operations to protect the interests of the United States, we will terminate your suspension and order you to resume production.


(d) If a suspension terminates, you must resume paying rents and royalty (see ยง 3212.14).
