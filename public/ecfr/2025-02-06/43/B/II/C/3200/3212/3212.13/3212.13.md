# ยง 3212.13   How does a suspension affect my lease term and obligations?

(a) If BLM approves a suspension of operations and production:


(1) Your lease term is extended by the length of time the suspension is in effect; and


(2) You are not required to drill, produce geothermal resources, or pay rents or royalties during the suspension. We will suspend your obligation to pay lease rents or royalties beginning the first day of the month following the date the suspension is effective.


(b) If BLM orders you to suspend your operations;


(1) Your lease term is extended by the length of time the suspension is in effect; and


(2) Your lease rental or royalty obligations are not suspended, except that BLM may suspend your rental or royalty obligations if you will be denied all beneficial use of your lease during the period of the suspension.
