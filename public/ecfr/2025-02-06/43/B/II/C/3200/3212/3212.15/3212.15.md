# § 3212.15   Will my lease remain in effect if I cease production and I do not have an approved suspension?

In the absence of a suspension issued under § 3212.11, if you cease production for more than one calendar month on a lease that is subject to royalties and that has achieved commercial production (through actual or allocated production), your lease will remain in effect only if the circumstances described in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section apply:


(a)(1) For leases issued on or after August 8, 2005 (other than leases issued in response to applications pending on that date for which no election is made under § 3200.8(b)(1)), and for leases issued before August 8, 2005, for which an election is made under § 3200.7(a)(2), your lease will remain in effect if, during the period in which there is no production, you continue to pay a monthly advanced royalty under MMS regulations at 30 CFR 218.305. This option is available only for an aggregate of 10 years (120 months, whether consecutive or not).


(2) For leases issued before August 8, 2005, for which no election is made under § 3200.7(a)(2), and for leases issued in response to applications pending on August 8, 2005, for which no election is made under § 3200.8(b)(1), your lease will remain in effect if, during the period in which there is no production you:


(i) Continue to make minimum royalty payments as specified in § 3211.21(b) of this part;


(ii) Maintain a well capable of production in commercial quantities;


(iii) Continue to make diligent efforts to utilize the geothermal resource; and


(iv) Satisfy any other applicable requirements.


(b) The Secretary:


(1) Requires or causes the cessation of production; or


(2) Determines that the cessation in production is required or otherwise caused by:


(i) The Secretary of the Air Force, Army, or Navy;


(ii) A state or a political subdivision of a state; or


(iii) Force majeure.


(c) The discontinuance of production is caused by the performance of maintenance necessary to maintain operations. Such maintenance is considered a production activity, not a cessation of production, and maintenance may include activities such as overhauling your power plant, re-drilling or re-working wells that are critical to plant operation, or repairing and improving gathering systems or transmission lines, that necessitate the discontinuation of production. You must obtain BLM approval by submitting a Geothermal Sundry Notice if the activity will require more than one calendar month, for it to be classified as maintenance under this paragraph. The BLM must receive the Geothermal Sundry Notice before the end of the first calendar month in which there will be no production.
