# ยง 3212.16   Can I apply to BLM to reduce, suspend, or waive the royalty or rental of my lease?

(a) You may apply for a suspension, reduction, or waiver of your rent or royalty for any lease or portion thereof. BLM may grant your request in the interest of conservation and to encourage the greatest ultimate recovery of geothermal resources, if we determine that:


(1) Granting the request is necessary to promote development; or


(2) You cannot successfully operate the lease under its current terms.


(b) BLM will not approve a rental or royalty reduction, suspension, or waiver unless all rental or royalty interest owners other than the United States accept a similar reduction, suspension, or waiver.
