# ยง 3212.20   How will BLM review my request for a production incentive?

(a) BLM will review your request on a case-by-case basis to determine whether your project meets the criteria for a qualified expansion project under ยง 3212.21 or a new facility under ยง 3212.22. If it does not meet the criteria for the type of project you requested, we will determine whether it meets the criteria for the other type of production incentive project.


(b) If BLM determines that you have a qualified expansion project, we will, as part of our approval, provide you with a schedule of monthly target net generation amounts that you must exceed to qualify for the production incentive. These amounts will quantify the required 10 percent increase in net generation over the projected net generation without the project. The schedule will be specific to the facility or facilities that are affected by the project and will cover the 48-month time period during which your production incentive may apply.


(c) If BLM determines that you have met the criteria for a new facility, we will provide you with written notification of this determination.
