# ยง 3214.19   What are my bonding requirements when a lease interest is transferred to me?

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the lands to be transferred to you contain a well or any other surface disturbance which the original lessee did not reclaim, you must post a bond under this subpart before BLM will approve the transfer.


(b) If the original lessee does not transfer all interest in the lease to you, you may become a co-principal on the original bond, rather than posting a new bond.


(c) You do not need to post an additional bond if:


(1) You previously furnished a statewide or nationwide bond sufficient to cover the lands transferred; or


(2) The operator provided the original bond, and the operator does not change.
