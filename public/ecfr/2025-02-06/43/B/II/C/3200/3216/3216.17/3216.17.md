# ยง 3216.17   Where must I file estate transfers, corporate mergers, and name changes?

(a) If you have posted a bond for any Federal lease, you must file estate transfers, corporate mergers, and name changes in the BLM State Office that maintains your bond.


(b) If you have not posted a bond, you must file estate transfers, corporate mergers, and name changes in the State Office having jurisdiction over the lease.
