# ยง 3216.18   How do I describe the lands in my lease transfer?

(a) If you are transferring an interest in your entire lease, you do not need to give BLM a legal description of the land.


(b) If you are transferring an interest in a portion of your lease, describe the lands that are transferred in the same way they are described in the lease.
