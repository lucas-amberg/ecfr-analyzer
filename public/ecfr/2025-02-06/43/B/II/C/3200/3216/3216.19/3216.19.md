# ยง 3216.19   May I transfer record title interest for less than 640 acres?

Except for direct use leases, you may transfer record title interest for less than 640 acres only if your transfer includes an irregular subdivision or all of the lands in your lease are in a section. We may make an exception to the minimum acreage requirements if it is necessary to conserve the resource.
