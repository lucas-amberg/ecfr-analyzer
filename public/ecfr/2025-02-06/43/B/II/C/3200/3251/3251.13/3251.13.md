# ยง 3251.13   Once I have an approved Notice of Intent, how can I change my exploration operations?

Send BLM a complete and signed Form 3260-3, Geothermal Sundry Notice, which fully describes the requested changes. Do not proceed with the change in operations until you receive written approval from BLM.
