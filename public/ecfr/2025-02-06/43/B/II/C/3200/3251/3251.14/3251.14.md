# ยง 3251.14   Do I need a bond for conducting exploration operations?

(a) You must not start any exploration operations on BLM-managed lands until we approve your bond. You may meet the requirement for an exploration bond in two ways:


(1) If you have an existing nationwide or statewide oil and gas exploration bond, provide a rider in an amount we have specified to include geothermal resources exploration operations; or


(2) If you must file a new bond for geothermal exploration, the minimum amounts are:


(i) $5,000 for a single operation;


(ii) $25,000 for all of your operations within a state; and


(iii) $50,000 for all of your operations on public lands nationwide.


(b) See subparts 3214 and 3215 for additional details on bonding procedures.
