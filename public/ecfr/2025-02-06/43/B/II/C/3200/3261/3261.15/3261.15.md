# ยง 3261.15   Must I give BLM my drilling permit application, drilling program, and operations plan at the same time?

You may submit your completed and signed drilling permit application and complete drilling program and operations plan either together or separately.


(a) If you submit them together and we approve your drilling permit, the approved drilling permit will authorize both the pad construction and the drilling and testing of the well.


(b) If you submit the operations plan separately from the drilling permit application and program, you must:


(1) Submit the operations plan before the drilling permit application and drilling program to allow BLM time to comply with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); and


(2) Submit a completed and signed Sundry Notice for well pad and access road construction. Do not begin construction until we approve your Sundry Notice.
