# ยง 3261.17   How do I amend my operations plan or drilling permit?

(a) If BLM has not yet approved your operations plan or drilling permit, send us your amended plan and completed and signed permit application.


(b) To amend an approved operations plan or drilling permit, submit a completed and signed Sundry Notice describing your proposed change. Do not start any amended operations until after BLM approves your drilling permit or Sundry Notice.
