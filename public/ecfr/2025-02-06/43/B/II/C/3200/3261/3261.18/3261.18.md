# ยง 3261.18   Do I need to file a bond with BLM before I build a well pad or drill a well?

Before starting any operation, you must:


(a) File with BLM either a surety or personal bond in the following minimum amount:


(1) $10,000 for a single lease;


(2) $50,000 for all of your operations within a state; or


(3) $150,000 for all of your operations nationwide;


(b) Get our approval of your surety or personal bond; and


(c) To cover any drilling operations on all leases committed to a unit, either submit a bond for that unit in an amount we specify, or provide a rider to a statewide or nationwide bond specifically covering the unit in an amount we specify.


(d) See subparts 3214 and 3215 for additional details on bonding procedures.
