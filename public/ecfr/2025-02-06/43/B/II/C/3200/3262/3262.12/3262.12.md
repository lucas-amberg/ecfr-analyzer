# ยง 3262.12   Must I post a sign at every well?

Yes. Before you begin drilling a well, you must post a sign in a conspicuous place and keep it there throughout operations until the well site is reclaimed. Put the following information on the sign:


(a) The lessee or operator's name;


(b) Lease serial number;


(c) Well number; and


(d) Well location described by township, range, section, quarter-quarter section or lot.
