# ยง 3263.10   May I abandon a well without BLM's approval?

(a) You must have a BLM-approved Sundry Notice documenting your plugging and abandonment program before you start abandoning any well.


(b) You must also notify the local BLM office before you begin abandonment activities, so that we may witness the work. Contact your local BLM office before starting to abandon your well to find out what notification we need.
