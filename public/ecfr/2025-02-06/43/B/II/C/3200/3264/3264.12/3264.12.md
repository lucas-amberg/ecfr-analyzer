Send us a well abandonment report within 30 days after you abandon a well. If you plan to restore the site at a later date, you may submit a separate report within 30 days after completing site restoration. The well abandonment report must contain:


(a) A complete chronology of all work done;


(b) A description of each plug, including:


(1) Type and amount of cement used;


(2) Depth that the drill pipe or tubing was run to set the plug;


(3) Depth to top of plug; and


(4) If the plug was verified, whether it was done by tagging or pressure testing; and


(c) A description of surface restoration procedures.
