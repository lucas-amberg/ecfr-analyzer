# ยง 3271.13   How do I obtain approval to build pipelines and facilities connecting the well field to utilization facilities not located on Federal lands leased for geothermal resources?

Before constructing pipelines and well field facilities on Federal lands leased for geothermal resources, you as lessee, unit operator, or facility operator must submit to BLM a utilization plan and facility construction permit addressing any pipelines or facilities. Do not start construction of your pipelines or facilities until BLM approves your facility construction permit.
