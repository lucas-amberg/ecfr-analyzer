# ยง 3271.15   How do I get a permit to begin commercial operations?

Before using Federal geothermal resources, you as lessee, operator, or facility operator must send us a completed commercial use permit (see ยง 3274.11). This also applies when you use Federal resources allocated through any form of agreement. Do not start any commercial use operations until BLM approves your commercial use permit.
