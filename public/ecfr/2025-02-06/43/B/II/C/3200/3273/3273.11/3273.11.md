# ยง 3273.11   When is a site license unnecessary?

You do not need a site license if your facility will be located:


(a) On private land or on split estate land where the United States does not own the surface; or


(b) On Federal land not leased for geothermal resources. In this situation, the Federal surface management agency will issue you the permit you need.
