# ยง 3273.12   How will BLM review my site license application?

(a) When BLM receives your site license application, we will make sure it is complete. If we need more information for our review, we will ask you for that information and stop our review until we receive the information.


(b) If your site license is located on geothermal leases where the surface is managed by the Department of Agriculture, we will consult with that agency and obtain concurrence before we approve your application. The agency may require additional license terms and conditions.


(c) If the land is subject to section 24 of the Federal Power Act, we will issue the site license with the terms and conditions requested by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.


(d) If another Federal agency manages the surface, we will consult with them to determine if they recommend additional license terms and conditions.


(e) After our review, we will notify you whether we approved or denied your license, as well as any additional conditions we require.
