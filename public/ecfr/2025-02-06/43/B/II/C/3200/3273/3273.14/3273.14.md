# ยง 3273.14   What area does a site license cover?

A site license covers a reasonably compact tract of Federal land, limited to as much of the surface as is necessary to utilize geothermal resources. That means the site license area will only include the utilization facility itself and other necessary structures, such as substations and processing, repair, or storage facility areas.
