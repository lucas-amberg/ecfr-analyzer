# ยง 3273.23   May I renew my site license?

(a) You have a preferential right to renew your site license under terms and conditions BLM determines.


(b) If your site license is located on leased lands managed by the Department of Agriculture, we will consult with the surface management agency and obtain concurrence before renewing your license. The agency may require additional license terms and conditions. If another Federal agency manages the surface, we will consult with them before granting your renewal.
