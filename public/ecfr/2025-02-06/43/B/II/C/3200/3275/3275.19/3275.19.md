# ยง 3275.19   How do I apply to commingle production?

To request approval to commingle production, send us a completed and signed Sundry Notice. We will review your request to commingle production from wells on your lease with production from your other leases or from leases where you do not have an interest. Do not commingle production until we have approved your Sundry Notice.
