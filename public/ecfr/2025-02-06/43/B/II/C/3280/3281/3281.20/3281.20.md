# ยง 3281.20   When is a unit agreement effective?

The effective date of the unit agreement approval is the first day of the month following the date BLM approves and signs it. The unit operator may request that the effective date be the first day of the month in which the agreement is signed by BLM, or a more appropriate date agreed to by BLM.
