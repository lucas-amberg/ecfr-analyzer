# ยง 3281.5   What happens if BLM receives applications that include overlapping unit areas?

(a) If BLM receives unit area applications that include overlapping lands, we will request that each prospective unit operator resolve the issue with the other operator(s). If the prospective operators cannot reach a resolution, BLM may:


(1) Return all unit applications and request all applicants to revise their proposed unit areas;


(2) Designate any unit area proposal that is geologically appropriate for unitization and best meets public interest requirements; or


(3) Designate a different area for unitization when doing so is in the public interest.


(b) BLM will reject either an application or a portion of an application that includes lands already in an approved unit area.
