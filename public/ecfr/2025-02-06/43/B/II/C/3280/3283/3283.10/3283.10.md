# ยง 3283.10   If there is a change in the unit operator, when does the previous operator's liability end?

(a) The previous unit operator remains responsible for all duties and obligations of the unit agreement until BLM approves a new unit operator. The change of the unit operator does not release the previous unit operator from any liability for any obligations that accrued before the effective date of the change (see ยง 3215.14 of this chapter).


(b) The new unit operator is responsible for all unit duties and obligations after BLM approves the change.
