# ยง 3283.3   How will the unit operator know the status of a unit contraction revision request?

BLM will notify the unit operator in writing of our decision. If we approve the request, we:


(a) Will specify the term of the contraction extension and/or which lands will remain in the unit agreement;


(b) May require the unit operator to update the informational requirements of subpart 3282; and


(c) May terminate the participating area contraction revision if we find termination is necessary in the public interest.
