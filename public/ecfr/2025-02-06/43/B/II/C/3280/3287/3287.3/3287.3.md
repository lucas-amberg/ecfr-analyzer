# ยง 3287.3   How does a suspension of unit obligations affect the terms of the unit agreement?

(a) BLM may suspend any terms of the unit agreement during the period a suspension is effective. During the period of the suspension, the involved unit terms are tolled. The suspension may not relieve the unit operator of its responsibility to meet other requirements of the unit agreement. For example, the unit operator may continue to be required to diligently develop or produce the resource during a suspension of drilling obligations.


(b) The unit operator must ensure all interests in the agreement are notified of any suspension granted and the terms of the suspension.
