# § 3427.5   Unqualified surface owners.

(a) Lease tracts involving surface owners who are not qualified (see § 3400.0-5(gg)) shall be leased subject to the protections afforded the surface owner by the statute(s) under which the surface was patented and the coal reserved to the United States. No consent from an unqualified surface owner is required under this subpart before the authorized officer may issue a lease for such a tract (see section 9 of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (43 U.S.C. 249); the Act of March 3, 1909 (30 U.S.C. 81); section 3 of the Act of June 22, 1910 (30 U.S.C. 85); and section 5 of the Act of June 21, 1949 (30 U.S.C. 54)).


(b) The provisions of §§ 3427.1 through 3427.4 of this title are inapplicable to any lease tract on which a consent has been given by an unqualified surface owner. The high bidder at the sale of such a tract is not required to submit any evidence of written consent before the authorized officer may issue the lease unless the statute establishing the relative rights of the United States (and its lessees) and the surface owner so requires.
