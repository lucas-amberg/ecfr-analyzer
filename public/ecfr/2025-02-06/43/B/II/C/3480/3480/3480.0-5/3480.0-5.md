(1) *Advance royalty* means a payment under a Federal lease in advance of actual production when authorized by the authorized officer to be made in lieu of continued operation. Payments made under the minimum production clause, in lieu of actual production from a Federal lease issued prior to August 4, 1976, and not readjusted after August 4, 1976, are not advance royalty under the provisions at 43 CFR 3483.4

(8) *Continued operation* means the production of not less than commercial quantities of recoverable coal reserves in each of the first 2 continued operation years following the achievement of diligent development and an average amount of not less than commercial quantities of recoverable coal reserves per continued operation year thereafter, computed on a 3-year basis consisting of the continued operation year in question and the 2 preceding continued operation years.


(9) *Continued operation year* means the 12-month period beginning with the commencement of the first royalty reporting period following the date that diligent development is achieved and each 12-month period thereafter, except as suspended in accordance with 43 FR 3483.3(b).

(13) *Diligent development period* means a 10-year period which:


(i) For Federal leases shall begin on either—


(A) The effective date of the Federal lease for all Federal leases issued after August 4, 1976; or


(B) The effective date of the first lease readjustment after August 4, 1976, for Federal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976; and


(ii) For LMU's shall begin on either—


(A) The effective approval date of the LMU, if the LMU contains a Federal lease issued prior to August 4, 1976, but not readjusted after August 4, 1976, prior to LMU approval; or


(B) The effective date of the most recent Federal lease issuance or readjustment prior to LMU approval, for any LMU that does not contain a lease issued prior to August 4, 1976, that has not been readjusted after August 4, 1976, prior to LMU approval.


(14) *Exploration* means drilling, excavating, and geological, geophysical or geochemical surveying operations designed to obtain detailed data on the physical and chemical characteristics of Federal coal and its environment including the strata below the Federal coal, overburden, and strata above the Federal coal, and the hydrologic conditions associated with the Federal coal.


(15) *Exploration plan* means a detailed plan to conduct exploration; it shows the location and type of exploration to be conducted, environmental protection procedures, present and proposed roads, and reclamation and abandonment procedures to be followed upon completion of operations.


(16) *General mining order* means any numbered formal order, issued by the State Director, which is published in the _Federal Register_ after opportunity for public comment. General Mining Orders apply to coal exploration, mining, and related operations.


(17) *Gross value,* for the purpose of royalty calculations, means the unit sale or contract price times the number of units sold, subject to the provisions at § 3485.2(g) of this title under which gross value is determined. 


(18) *License* means a license to mine coal pursuant to the provisions of 43 CFR part 3440, or an exploration license issued pursuant to the provisions of 43 CFR part 3410.


(19) *Logical mining unit (LMU)* means an area of land in which the recoverable coal reserves can be developed in an efficient, economical, and orderly manner as a unit with due regard to conservation of recoverable coal reserves and other resources. An LMU may consist of one or more Federal leases and may include intervening or adjacent lands in which the United States does not own the coal. All lands in an LMU shall be under the effective control of a single operator/lessee, be able to be developed and operated as a single operation, and be contiguous.


(20) *Logical mining unit (LMU) recoverable coal reserves* means the sum of estimated Federal and non-Federal recoverable coal reserves in the LMU.


(21) *Maximum economic recovery (MER)* means that, based on standard industry operating practices, all profitable portions of a leased Federal coal deposit must be mined. At the times of MER determinations, consideration will be given to: existing proven technology; commercially available and economically feasible equipment; coal quality, quantity, and marketability; safety, exploration, operating, processing, and transportation costs; and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The requirement of MER does not restrict the authority of the authorized officer to ensure the conservation of the recoverable coal reserves and other resources and to prevent the wasting of coal.

(30) *Preparation* means any physical or chemical treatment to prepare coal for market. Treatment may include crushing, sizing, drying, mixing, or other processing, and removal of noncoal waste such as bone or other impurities to enhance the quality and therefore the value of the coal.


(31) *Production* means mining of recoverable coal reserves and/or commercial byproducts from a mine using surface, underground, auger, or *in situ* methods.


(32) *Recoverable coal reserves* means the minable reserve base excluding all coal that will be left, such as in pillars, fenders, and property barriers.
