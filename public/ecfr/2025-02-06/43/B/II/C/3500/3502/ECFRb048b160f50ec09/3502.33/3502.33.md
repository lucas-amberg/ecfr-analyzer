# ยง 3502.33   If I represent an applicant as an attorney-in-fact, do I have to submit anything to BLM?

Yes. Send us evidence of your authority to act on behalf of the applicant, and a statement of the applicant's qualifications and acreage holdings if you are empowered to make this statement. Otherwise, the applicant must send us this information separately.
