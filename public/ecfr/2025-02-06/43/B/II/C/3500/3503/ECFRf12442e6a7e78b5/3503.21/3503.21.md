# ยง 3503.21   What happens if the surface of the land I am interested in belongs to a non-Federal political subdivision or charitable organization?

(a) BLM will notify the entity who owns the surface of the lands included within your permit or lease application if that entity is:


(1) Any State or political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof;


(2) A college or any other educational corporation or association; or


(3) A charitable or religious corporation or association.


(b) The entity who owns the surface of the lands in your application will have up to 90 days to suggest any lease stipulations to protect existing surface improvements or uses, or to object to the permit or lease. BLM will then decide whether to issue the permit or lease and which, if any, stipulations identified by the surface owner to include, based on how the interests of the United States would best be served.
