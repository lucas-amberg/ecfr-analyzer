# ยง 3504.51   How do I file my bond?

File one copy of your bond in the BLM State office where you applied for a permit or lease. You must use an approved BLM form. You must sign the form if you are the principal of a personal bond. For surety bonds, both you and an acceptable surety must sign the form.
