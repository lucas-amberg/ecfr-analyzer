# ยง 3504.56   If I have more than one permit or lease, may I combine bond coverage?

Yes. Instead of filing separate bonds for each permit or lease, you may file a bond to cover all permits and leases for a specific mineral in any one state, or nationwide. We will establish the amount of the bond; however, the minimums are:


(a) $25,000 for statewide bonds. File these bonds in the BLM State Office for the state where your leases are located.


(b) $75,000 for nationwide bonds. File these bonds in any BLM State Office.
