# ยง 3504.65   What happens to my bond if I do not meet my permit or lease obligations?

BLM will demand payment from your bond to cover any obligations on which you default. Your bond will be reduced accordingly. If the surety makes a payment, we will reduce the face amount of the surety bond and the surety's liability by the amount of the payment.
