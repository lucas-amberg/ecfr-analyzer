# ยง 3504.22   How will I know what the royalty rate is on my lease production?

BLM determines the rate for each lease before we offer it. If BLM offered the lease competitively, the rates are in the notice of lease sale. If you applied for a noncompetitive lease, BLM will send you a royalty rate schedule for your concurrence and signature before we issue you the lease. BLM attaches royalty rates to, and makes them a part of, all leases.
