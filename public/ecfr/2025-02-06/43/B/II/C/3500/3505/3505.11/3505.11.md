# ยง 3505.11   Do I need a prospecting permit to collect mineral specimens for non-commercial purposes?

No. You may collect mineral specimens for hobby, recreation, scientific, research or similar purposes without a prospecting permit. However, the surface management agency may require a use permit. BLM's regulations for collecting mineral specimens are at part 8365 of this title.
