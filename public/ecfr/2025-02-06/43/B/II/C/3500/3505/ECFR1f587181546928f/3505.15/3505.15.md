# ยง 3505.15   Is there an acreage limit for my application?

The acreage in your application must not exceed the maximum allowed for the permit. See ยง 3503.37 of this part for the acreage limits applicable for the different minerals. BLM will not issue a permit if it causes you to exceed the limits shown in the table in that section.
