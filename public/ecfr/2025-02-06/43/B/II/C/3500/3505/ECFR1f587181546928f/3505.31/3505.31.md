# ยง 3505.31   May I withdraw my application after I file it?

Yes. Just send us a written request. If you withdraw your application in whole or in part before BLM signs the permit, we will refund the corresponding proportionate share of your rental payment. BLM will retain any fees already paid for processing the application.
