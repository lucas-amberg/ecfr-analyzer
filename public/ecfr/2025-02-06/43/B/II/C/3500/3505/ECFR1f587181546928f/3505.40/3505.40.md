# ยง 3505.40   After submitting my application, do I need to submit anything else?

Yes. After we initially review your permit application, but before we issue the prospecting permit, we will require you to submit three copies of an exploration plan under ยง 3505.45 of this part. You must also submit a bond. See 43 CFR part 3504, especially 43 CFR 3504.50, for information on bonds.
