# ยง 3505.50   How will I know if BLM has approved or rejected my application?

(a) BLM will review your application to determine compliance with land use plans, environmental requirements, unsuitability criteria and whether the lands are within a known leasing area. BLM's decision whether to approve your application is at BLM's complete discretion. If we approve your application, we will issue your permit. If we reject your application, we will mail you a written decision. This notice will:


(1) Detail the reasons why we rejected your application;


(2) Identify any items you will need to correct in your application; and


(3) Tell you how you may appeal an adverse decision.


(b) If we do not accept your application, we will refund your rental payment. We will retain any fees already paid for processing the application.
