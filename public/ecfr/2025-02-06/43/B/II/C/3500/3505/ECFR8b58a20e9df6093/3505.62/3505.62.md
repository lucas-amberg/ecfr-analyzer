# ยง 3505.62   Under what conditions will BLM extend my prospecting permit?

You must prove that:


(a) You explored with reasonable diligence and were unable to determine the existence and workability of a valuable deposit covered by the permit. Reasonable diligence means that, in BLM's opinion, you drilled a sufficient number of holes or performed other comparable prospecting to explore the permit area within the time allowed; or


(b) Your failure to perform diligent prospecting activities was due to conditions beyond your control.
