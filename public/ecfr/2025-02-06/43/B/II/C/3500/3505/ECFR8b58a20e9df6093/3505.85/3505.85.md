# ยง 3505.85   May BLM cancel my prospecting permit for reasons other than failure to pay rental?

Yes.


(a) We may cancel your permit if you do not comply with the Mineral Leasing Act, any of the other acts applicable to your specific permit, these regulations, or any of the permit terms or stipulations. We will give you 30 days notice, within which you must correct your default. If your default continues, BLM may cancel your permit.


(b) If we waive one cause for cancellation, we may still cancel your permit for another cause, or for the same cause occurring at another time. Unless you file an appeal, we will note your permit cancellation on the land status records. BLM may use your bond to reclaim the land or correct other deficiencies if we cancel your permit.
