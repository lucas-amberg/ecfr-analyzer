# ยง 3506.15   What will BLM do in response to my exploration license application?

(a) BLM will determine whether to issue the exploration license. If we decide to issue the license, we will name the participants and the acreage covered. We also will establish hole spacing requirements and include any stipulations needed to protect the environment.


(b) If there are inconsistencies between proposed exploration plans, the approved license will resolve them.
