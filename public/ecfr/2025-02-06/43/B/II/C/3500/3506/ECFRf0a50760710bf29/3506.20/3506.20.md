# ยง 3506.20   After my license is issued, may I modify my license or exploration plan?

BLM may approve modifications of your exploration plan upon your request. We may also permit you to remove lands from your exploration license at any time. However, once we issue your exploration license, you may not add lands to the area of your exploration license.
