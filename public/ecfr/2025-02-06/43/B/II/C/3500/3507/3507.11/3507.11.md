# ยง 3507.11   What must I do to obtain a preference right lease?

To obtain a preference right lease, you must have a prospecting permit for the area you want to lease and meet the following conditions and any other conditions established in this subpart:


(a) *All leasable minerals except asphalt.* You must demonstrate that you have discovered a valuable deposit within the period covered by your prospecting permit. However, paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section provide some limitations.


(b) *Sodium, potassium, and sulphur.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, BLM must determine that the lands are chiefly valuable for the subject minerals.


(c) *Asphalt.* You may not obtain a preference right lease for asphalt. However, you may obtain a competitive lease or a fringe acreage lease under subpart 3508 or 3510 of this part.


(d) *Permits issued under the authority of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946.* Prospecting permits for minerals BLM administers under the authority of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946 do not entitle you to a preference right lease. We may grant you a noncompetitive lease if you discover a valuable deposit during the permit term.
