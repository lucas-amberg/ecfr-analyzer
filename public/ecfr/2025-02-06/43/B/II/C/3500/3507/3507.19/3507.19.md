(2) You did not submit requested information in a timely manner;


(3) You did not otherwise comply with the requirements of this subpart; or


(4) In the case of sodium, potassium and sulphur, if BLM determines that the lands are not chiefly valuable for the mineral commodity specified in the permit.

(3) Any environmental impacts; and


(4) The purposes of the statute under which the lands were acquired.
