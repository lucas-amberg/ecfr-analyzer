# ยง 3508.20   How will BLM conduct the sale and handle bids?

We will open and announce all bids at the time and date specified in the notice of lease sale, but we will not accept or reject bids at that time. We must receive your bid by the deadline in the sale notice or we will not consider it. You may withdraw or modify your bid before the time specified in the notice of sale.
