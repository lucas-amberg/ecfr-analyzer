# ยง 3508.22   What happens if BLM rejects my bid?

(a) If your bid is the high bid and we reject it because you did not sign the lease form and pay the balance of the bonus bid, or otherwise comply with this subpart, you forfeit to the United States your deposit of one-fifth of the bonus bid amount.


(b) If we must reject your high bid for reasons beyond your control, we will return your bid deposit.


(c) If we reject your bid because it is not the high bid, we will return your bid deposit.
