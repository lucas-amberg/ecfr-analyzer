# ยง 3509.10   What are future interest leases?

BLM issues noncompetitive future interest leases to persons who hold present mineral interests that will revert to the Federal Government at some future date. Future interest leases allow the present interest holders to continue using their present mineral right once the Federal Government acquires it.
