# ยง 3509.16   How do I apply for a future interest lease?

No specific form is required. You must file at least one year before the mineral interest vests with the United States or BLM will deny your application. BLM will charge you a processing fee on a case-by-case basis as described in ยง 3000.11 of this chapter.
