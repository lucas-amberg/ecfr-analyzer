# ยง 3510.20   Do I have to pay a fee to modify my existing lease or obtain a fringe acreage lease?

Yes. Before BLM issues a new fringe acreage lease or modifies your existing lease, you must pay a bonus in an amount we will determine based on an appraisal or other appropriate means. The bonus cannot be less than $1 per acre or fraction of an acre.
