# ยง 3510.21   What terms and conditions apply to fringe acreage leases and lease modifications?

Your fringe acreage lease is a new Federal lease. Therefore, we may impose terms and conditions different from those in your original Federal lease. A modified lease will be subject to the same terms and conditions as in the original Federal lease.
