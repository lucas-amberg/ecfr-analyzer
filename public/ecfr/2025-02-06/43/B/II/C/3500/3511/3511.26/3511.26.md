# ยง 3511.26   What if I object to the terms and conditions BLM proposes for a readjusted lease?

(a) You have 60 days after receiving the proposed readjusted terms to object. If we do not receive your objection within 60 days, the proposed readjusted terms will be in effect. If you file an objection, BLM will issue a decision in response. If you disagree with the decision, you may appeal under parts 4 and 1840 of this title.
