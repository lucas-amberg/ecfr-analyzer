# ยง 3513.30   What is a suspension of operations (economic concerns)?

A suspension of operations (economic concerns) is an action by which BLM may approve your request to suspend operations on your lease when marketing conditions are such that you cannot operate your leases except at a loss. BLM may not order a suspension of operations (economic concerns) unless you request it.
