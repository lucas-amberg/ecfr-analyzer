# ยง 3513.12   What criteria does BLM consider in approving a waiver, suspension, or reduction in rental or minimum royalty, or a reduction in the royalty rate?

We will consider if approval:


(a) Is in the interest of conservation;


(b) Will encourage the greatest ultimate recovery of the resource; and


(c) Is necessary either to promote development of the mineral resources or because you cannot successfully operate the lease under existing terms.
