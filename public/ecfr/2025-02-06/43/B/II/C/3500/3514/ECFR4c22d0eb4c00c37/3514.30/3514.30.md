(a) Yes. BLM may institute appropriate proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to cancel your lease if:


(1) You do not comply with the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act, other relevant statutes, or regulations applicable to your lease; or


(2) You default on any of the lease terms, covenants or stipulations and continue to fail or default for 30 days after BLM notifies you in writing of your default.


(b) BLM may cancel your lease administratively if we issued it in violation of any law or regulation. In such a case, we may consider issuing an amended lease, if appropriate.
