# ยง 3514.32   Will BLM give me an opportunity to remedy a violation of the lease terms?

(a) If you own or control, directly or indirectly, an interest in a lease in violation of any of the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act, other relevant statutes, the lease terms or the regulations in this part, we will give you 30 days to remedy the violation or to show cause why we should not ask the Attorney General to institute court proceedings to:


(1) Cancel the lease;


(2) Forfeit your interest; or


(3) Compel disposal of the interest so owned or controlled.


(b) BLM will not give you 30 days if there is no legal remedy to the violation.
