# ยง 3515.18   Will I be notified when BLM is considering initiating an exchange that will affect my lease?

Yes. The notice you receive will:


(a) State why we believe an exchange would be in the public interest;


(b) Ask whether you are willing to negotiate for an exchange;


(c) Contain a description of the lands for which we would offer exchange terms; and


(d) Ask you to describe the lands on which you would accept a lease in exchange for your present holdings.
