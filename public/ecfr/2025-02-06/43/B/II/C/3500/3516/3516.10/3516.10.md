# ยง 3516.10   What are use permits?

Use permits allow you to use the surface of lands not included within your permit or lease to help you develop the mineral deposits. You may only get a use permit during the life of your permit or lease, and only for unentered, unappropriated, BLM-administered land. Use permits are not prospecting permits.
