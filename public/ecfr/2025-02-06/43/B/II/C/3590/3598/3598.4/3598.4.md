# ยง 3598.4   Enforcement orders.

(a) If the authorized officer determines that an operator/lessee has failed to comply with established requirements, and such noncompliance does not threaten immediate, serious or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine or deposit being mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other resources, the authorized officer shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the operator and lessee by delivery in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Failure of the operator/lessee to take action in accordance with the notice of noncompliance shall be grounds for the authorized officer to issue an order to cease operations or initiate legal proceedings to cancel the lease under ยง 3509.4 of this title, or, for Indian leases, recommend to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that action be taken in accordance with 25 CFR part 211. 


(b) A notice of noncompliance shall specify how the operator/lessee has failed to comply with established requirements, and shall specify the action which shall be taken to correct the noncompliance and the time limits within which such action shall be taken. The operator/lessee shall notify the authorized officer when noncompliance items have been corrected. 


(c) If, in the judgment of the authorized officer, the failure to comply with the established requirements threatens immediate, serious or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine or the deposit being mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other resources, the authorized officer may, either in writing or orally with written confirmation, order the cessation of operations without prior notice.
