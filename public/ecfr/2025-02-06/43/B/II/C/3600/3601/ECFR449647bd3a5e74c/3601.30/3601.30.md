# § 3601.30   Pre-application activities—how and when may I sample and test mineral materials?

(a) BLM may authorize you in writing to sample and test mineral materials. The authorization letter expires after 90 days, but BLM may extend it for an additional 90 days if you show us that an extension is necessary. BLM may authorize these activities before issuing a sales contract or free use permit. 


(b) You must submit your sampling and testing findings to BLM. All information you submit under this section is subject to part 2 of this title. That part sets forth the rules of the Department of the Interior relating to public availability of information contained in Departmental records. (*See* § 3601.8.) 


(c) A letter from BLM authorizing you to sample and test mineral materials does not give you a preference right to a sales contract or free use permit. 


(d) BLM may impose bonding and reclamation requirements on sampling and testing that you conduct under an authorization letter.
