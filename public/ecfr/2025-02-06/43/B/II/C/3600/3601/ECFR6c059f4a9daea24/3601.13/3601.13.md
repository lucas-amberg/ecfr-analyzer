# ยง 3601.13   How can I obtain mineral materials from Federal lands that have been withdrawn to aid a function of another Federal agency or of a State or local government agency?

If you wish to obtain mineral materials from lands withdrawn to aid a function of another Federal agency or of a State or local government agency, you may apply to BLM. BLM will dispose of the mineral materials only with the consent of that agency.
