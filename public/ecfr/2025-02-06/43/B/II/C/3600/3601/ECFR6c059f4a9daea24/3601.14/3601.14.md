# ยง 3601.14   When can BLM dispose of mineral materials from unpatented mining claims?

(a) BLM may dispose of mineral materials from unpatented mining claims if disposal does not endanger or materially interfere with prospecting, mining, or processing operations, or uses reasonably incident thereto. 


(b) BLM will ask a mining claimant for a waiver before disposing of mineral materials from a claim. If the mining claimant refuses to sign a waiver, BLM will make sure that disposal of the mineral materials will not be detrimental to the public interest. We also will consult with the Solicitor's Office, if necessary, before proceeding with the disposal.
