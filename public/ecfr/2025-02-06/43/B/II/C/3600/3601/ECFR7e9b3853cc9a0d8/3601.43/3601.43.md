# ยง 3601.43   What is the process for BLM to approve my mining and reclamation plans?

(a) After reviewing your mining and reclamation plans, BLM will notify you of any deficiencies in the plans and recommend the changes necessary. BLM will notify you in writing when we approve your plan. You must follow BLM-approved mining and reclamation plans, which become part of the contract or permit. 


(b) Your operation must not deviate from the plan BLM approves, unless it is modified under ยง 3601.44.
