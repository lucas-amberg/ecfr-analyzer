# § 3602.23   When will BLM make refunds or allow credits?

(a) BLM may make refunds or allow credits if— 


(1) When your contract expires, your total payments exceed the total value of mineral materials included in the contract; 


(2) BLM determines that insufficient mineral materials existed in the sales area to fulfill the terms of the contract; or 


(3) Materials you paid for are unavailable as a result of terminating your contract by mutual agreement under § 3602.22(b). 


(b) If your refund or credit is a result of terminating your contract by mutual agreement under § 3602.22(b), BLM will reduce the amount of the refund or credit by the amount of the administrative cost of processing the disposal action. If these administrative costs exceed your total payments, BLM will not make a refund or allow a credit. 


(c) BLM may credit to future production on the same contract, but not refund, payments that you make in lieu of production under § 3602.21(a)(3). However, if, upon expiration of the contract, the total value of payments you have made exceeds the total value of mineral materials included in your contract, BLM will refund the difference in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
