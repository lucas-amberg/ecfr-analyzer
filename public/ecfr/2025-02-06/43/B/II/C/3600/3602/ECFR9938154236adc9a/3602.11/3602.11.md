# § 3602.11   How do I request a sale of mineral materials?

(a) You may submit a written request for sale of mineral materials to the BLM office with jurisdiction over the site containing the materials. No particular form is required for this request. 


(b) BLM also may initiate a sale without a request under paragraph (a) of this section.
