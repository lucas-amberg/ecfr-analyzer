# ยง 3602.15   What will happen to my bond if I transferred all of my interests or operations to another bonded party?

BLM will cancel your bond obligations following approval of the transfer of your interests or operations if the transferee provides a bond that assumes all of your existing liabilities as required in ยง 3602.24. However, under ยง 3602.26, you remain liable for any reclamation or other obligation that accrued during the time you held your interest.
