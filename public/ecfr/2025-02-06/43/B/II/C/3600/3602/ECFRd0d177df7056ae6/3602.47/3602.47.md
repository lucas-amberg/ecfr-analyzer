# § 3602.47   When and how may I renew my competitive contract and what is the fee?

(a) *Applying for competitive contract renewal.* When you have paid the United States the full contract price for the mineral materials you purchased under a competitive contract, you may apply for renewal of the contract without further competitive bidding in order to purchase and extract additional material that may be available at the contract site. You must submit your request for renewal of the contract at least 90 days before it expires. You do not need to use a specific form. 


(b) *BLM's response to the application.* BLM will renew your contract if—


(1) You meet all the requirements of this section; 


(2) Your contract is not limited under § 3602.49; and 


(3) BLM determines that you are able to fulfill the obligations of a new contract. 


(c) *Renewal term.* BLM will renew your contract for a maximum term of 10 additional years. The renewal may be for less than 10 years if you do not request that much time, or if BLM finds that the quantity of material involved does not justify a 10-year term. 


(d) *Number of times BLM may renew a contract.* There is no maximum number of times BLM may renew a contract. 


(e) *Fee.* BLM will charge a processing fee on a case-by-case basis as described in § 3000.11 of this chapter.
