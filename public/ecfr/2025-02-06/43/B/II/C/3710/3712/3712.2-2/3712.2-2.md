# § 3712.2-2   Evidence necessary to support a request for publication.

(a) The second and third paragraphs of section 5(a) of the Act provide in detail for the filing by the head of a Federal department or agency of certain evidence in support of the request for publication of the notice referred to in § 3712.2-1 as follows: 


(b) This part of the Act requires the filing of an affidavit which may be made by any person or persons over twenty-one years of age who have examined the lands. It must show whether any person or persons were “in actual possession of or engaged in the working of such lands (the lands described in the request for publication of notice) or any part thereof” and, if they were, the name and address of each such person must be given if it can be learned by reasonable inquiry and if it cannot be so learned, the affidavit must show in detail what inquiry or inquiries were made to obtain each such name and address. No definition of the terms “in actual possession” or “engaged in the working of said lands” will be attempted here, but the affidavits should recite what evidences of occupancy or workings were found. The request for publication must also be accompanied by a certificate executed as provided in the third paragraph of section 5(a) and containing the information required by that paragraph to be furnished. If there are no tract indexes, as defined in the Act, in the county office of record affecting the lands described in the request for publication, a certificate executed as provided in the said third paragraph of section 5(a) to that effect must be furnished.
