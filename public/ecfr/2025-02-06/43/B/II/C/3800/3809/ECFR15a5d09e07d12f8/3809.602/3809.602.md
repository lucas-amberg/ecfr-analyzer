# § 3809.602   Can BLM revoke my plan of operations or nullify my notice?

(a) BLM may revoke your plan of operations or nullify your notice upon finding that—


(1) A violation exists of any provision of your notice, plan of operation, or this subpart, and you have failed to correct the violation within the time specified in the enforcement order issued under § 3809.601; or 


(2) a pattern of violations exists at your operations.


(b) The finding is not effective until BLM notifies you of its intent to revoke your plan or nullify your notice, and BLM provides you an opportunity for an informal hearing before the BLM State Director.
