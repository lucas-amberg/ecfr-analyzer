# § 3809.604   What happens if I do not comply with a BLM order?

(a) If you do not comply with a BLM order issued under §§ 3809.601 or 3809.602, the Department of the Interior may request the United States Attorney to institute a civil action in United States District Court for an injunction or order to enforce its order, prevent you from conducting operations on the public lands in violation of this subpart, and collect damages resulting from unlawful acts. This relief may be in addition to the enforcement actions described in §§ 3809.601 and 3809.602 and the penalties described in § 3809.700.


(b) If you fail to timely comply with a noncompliance order issued under § 3809.601(a), and remain in noncompliance, BLM may order you to submit plans of operations under § 3809.401 for current and future notice-level operations.
