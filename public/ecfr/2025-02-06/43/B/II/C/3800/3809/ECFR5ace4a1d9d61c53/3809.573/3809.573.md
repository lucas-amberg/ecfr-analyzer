When the State makes a demand against your financial guarantee, thereby reducing the available balance, you must do both of the following:


(a) Notify BLM within 15 calendar days; and 


(b) Replace or augment the financial guarantee within 30 calendar days if the available balance is insufficient to cover the remaining reclamation cost.
