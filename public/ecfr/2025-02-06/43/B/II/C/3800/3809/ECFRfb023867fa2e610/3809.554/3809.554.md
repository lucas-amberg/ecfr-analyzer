# ยง 3809.554   How do I estimate the cost to reclaim my operations?

(a) You must estimate the cost to reclaim your operations as if BLM were hiring a third-party contractor to perform reclamation of your operations after you have vacated the project area. Your estimate must include BLM's cost to administer the reclamation contract. Contact BLM to obtain this administrative cost information.


(b) Your estimate of the cost to reclaim your operations must be acceptable to BLM.
