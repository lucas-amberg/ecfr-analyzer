The owner of any unpatented mining claim located upon O. and C. lands on or after August 28, 1937, shall not acquire title, possessory or otherwise, to the timber, now or hereafter growing upon such claim. Such timber may be managed and disposed of under existing law or as may be provided by subsequent law. The owner of such unpatented mining claim, until such time as the timber is otherwise disposed of by the United States, if he wishes to cut and use so much of the timber upon his claim as may be necessary in the development and operation of his mine, shall file a written application with the district forester for permission to do so. The application shall set forth the estimated quantity and kind of timber desired and the use to which it will be put. The applicant shall not cut any of the timber prior to the approval of the application therefor.
