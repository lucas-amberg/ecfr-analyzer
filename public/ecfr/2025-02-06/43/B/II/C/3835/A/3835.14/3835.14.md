# § 3835.14   How do I submit a small miner waiver request for newly-recorded mining claims?

In order to obtain a small miner waiver for newly-recorded mining claims, you must— 


(a)(1) Submit the waiver request on or before September 1; or 


(2) If the mining claim or site was located before September 1 and recorded after September 1 in a timely manner, you must submit the waiver request at the time of recording the mining claim or site with BLM, and 


(b) File on or before the December 30 immediately following the September 1st for which you applied for a waiver a notice of intent to hold the mining claim or site. The Mining Law does not require you to perform assessment work in the assessment year in which you locate a mining claim. The notice of intent to hold must conform to §§ 3835.31 through 3835.33.
