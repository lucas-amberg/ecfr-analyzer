# § 3835.93   What happens if BLM finds a defect in my waiver request?

(a) BLM will send you a notice describing the defect by certified mail-return receipt requested at the most recent address you gave us on—


(1) Your notice or certificate of location; 


(2) An address correction you have filed with BLM; 


(3) A valid transfer document filed with BLM; or 


(4) The waiver request form. 


(b) If the certified mail is delivered to your most recent address of record, this constitutes legal service even if you do not actually receive the notice or decision. (See 43 CFR 1810.2.) 


(c) You must cure the defective waiver or pay the annual maintenance fees within 60 days of receiving BLM notification of the defects, or forfeit the claim or site.
