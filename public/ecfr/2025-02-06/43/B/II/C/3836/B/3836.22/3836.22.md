# § 3836.22   How do I qualify for a deferment of assessment work on my mining claims that are on National Park System (NPS) lands?

Correspondence from NPS merely denying your Plan of Operations for incompleteness or inadequacy will not suffice for a deferment of assessment work. To qualify for a deferment of assessment work on claims situated on NPS lands— 


(a) You must obtain a letter from NPS stating that— 


(1) NPS received and found your proposed Plan of Operations to be complete; 


(2) NPS cannot act on the plan until it conducts a validity exam; and 


(3) NPS anticipates completing the validity exam after the assessment year ends. 


(b) You must send NPS's letter to BLM, along with other documents and information that BLM requires (see § 3836.23) to support your petition for deferment of assessment work.
