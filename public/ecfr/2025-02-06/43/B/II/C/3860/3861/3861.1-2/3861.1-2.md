# ยง 3861.1-2   Survey must be made subsequent to recording notice of location.

The survey and plat of mineral claims required to be filed in the proper office with application for patent must be made subsequent to the recording of the location of the claim (if the laws of the State or the regulations of the mining district require the notice of location to be recorded), and when the original location is made by survey of a mineral surveyor such location survey cannot be substituted for that required by the statute, as above indicated. All matters relating to the duties of mineral surveyors, and to the field and office procedure to be observed in the execution of mineral surveys, are set forth in Chapter X of the Manual of Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands of the United States, 1947.
