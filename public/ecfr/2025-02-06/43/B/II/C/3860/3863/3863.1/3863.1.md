Where placer claims cannot be conformed to legal subdivisions, survey and plat shall be made as on unsurveyed lands. 


(b) The price of placer claims is fixed at $2.50 per acre or fractional part of an acre. 


(c) An applicant for a placer mining claim patent must pay fees as described in ยง 3860.1.
