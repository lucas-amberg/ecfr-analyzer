# ยง 3902.27   Heirs and devisees.

If an applicant or successful bidder for a lease dies before the lease is issued:


(a) The BLM will issue the lease to the heirs or devisees, or their guardian, if probate of the estate has been completed or is not required. Before the BLM will recognize the heirs or devisees or their guardian as the record title holders of the lease, they must provide to the proper BLM office:


(1) A certified copy of the will or decree of distribution, or if no will or decree exists, a statement signed by the heirs that they are the only heirs and citing the provisions of the law of the deceased's last domicile showing that no probate is required; and


(2) A statement signed by each of the heirs or devisees with reference to citizenship and holdings as required by ยง 3902.23 of this chapter. If the heir or devisee is a minor, the guardian or trustee must sign the statement; and


(b) The BLM will issue the lease to the executor or administrator of the estate if probate is required, but is not completed. In this case, the BLM considers the executor or administrator to be the record title holder of the lease. Before the BLM will issue the lease to the executor or administrator, the executor or administrator must provide to the proper BLM office:


(1) Evidence that the person who, as executor or administrator, submits lease and bond forms has authority to act in that capacity and to sign those forms;


(2) A certified list of the heirs or devisees of the deceased; and


(3) A statement signed by each heir or devisee concerning citizenship and holdings, as required by ยง 3902.23 of this chapter.
