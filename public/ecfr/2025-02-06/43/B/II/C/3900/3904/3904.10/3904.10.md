# ยง 3904.10   Bonding requirements.

(a) Prior to issuing a lease or exploration license, the BLM requires exploration license or lease bonds for each lease or exploration license that covers all liabilities, other than reclamation, that may arise under the lease or license. The bond must be executed by the lessee and cover all record title owners, operating rights owners, operators, and any person who conducts operations or is responsible for payments under a lease or license.


(b) Before the BLM will approve a POD, the lessee must provide to the proper BLM office a reclamation bond to cover all costs the BLM estimates will be necessary to cover reclamation.
