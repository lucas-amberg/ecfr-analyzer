(a) The BLM will not consent to termination of the period of liability under a bond unless an acceptable replacement bond has been filed.


(b) Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during which obligations continue to accrue, but does not relieve the surety of the responsibility for obligations that accrued during the period of liability.


(c) A lease bond will be released when BLM determines that all lease obligations accruing during the period of liability have been fulfilled.


(d) A reclamation bond or license bond will be released when the BLM determines that the reclamation obligations arising within the period of liability have been met and that the reclamation has succeeded to the BLM's satisfaction.


(e) The BLM will release a bond when it accepts a replacement bond in which the surety expressly assumes liability for all obligations that accrued within the period of liability of the original bond.
