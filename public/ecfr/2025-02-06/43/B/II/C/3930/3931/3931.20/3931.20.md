(2) Measures to isolate, remove, or control toxic materials; 


(3) Reshaping the area disturbed, application of the topsoil, and re-vegetation of disturbed areas, where reasonably practicable; and 


(4) Rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife habitat. 


(d) The operator or lessee must substantially fill in, fence, protect, or close all surface openings, subsidence holes, surface excavations, or workings which are a hazard to people or animals.
