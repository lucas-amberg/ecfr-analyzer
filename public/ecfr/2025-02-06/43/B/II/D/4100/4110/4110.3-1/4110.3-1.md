When monitoring or documented field observations show that additional forage is available for livestock grazing, either on a temporary or sustained yield basis, BLM may apportion additional forage to qualified applicants for livestock grazing use consistent with multiple-use management objectives specified in the applicable land use plan.


(a) *Additional forage temporarily available.* When the authorized officer determines that additional forage is temporarily available for livestock, he may authorize its use on a nonrenewable basis under ยง 4130.6-2 in the following order:


(1) To permittees or lessees who have preference for grazing use in the allotment where the forage is available, in proportion to their active use; and


(2) To other qualified applicants under ยง 4130.1-2.


(b) *Additional forage available on a sustained yield basis.* When the authorized officer determines that additional forage is available for livestock use on a sustained yield basis, he will apportion it in the following manner:


(1) First, to remove all or a part of the suspension of preference of permittees or lessees with permits or leases in the allotment where the forage is available; and


(2) Second, if additional forage remains after ending all suspensions, the authorized officer will consult, cooperate, and coordinate with the affected permittees or lessees, the state having lands or responsibility for managing resources within the area, the interested public, and apportion it in the following order:


(i) Permittees or lessees in proportion to their contribution to stewardship efforts that result in increased forage production;


(ii) Permittees or lessees in proportion to the amount of their grazing preference; and


(iii) Other qualified applicants under ยง 4130.1-2.
