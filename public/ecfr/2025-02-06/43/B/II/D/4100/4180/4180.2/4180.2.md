# ยง 4180.2   Standards and guidelines for grazing administration.

(a) The Bureau of Land Management State Director, in consultation with the affected resource advisory councils where they exist, will identify the geographical area for which standards and guidelines are developed. Standards and guidelines will be developed for an entire state, or an area encompassing portions of more than 1 state, unless the Bureau of Land Management State Director, in consultation with the resource advisory councils, determines that the characteristics of an area are unique, and the rangelands within the area could not be adequately protected using standards and guidelines developed on a broader geographical scale. 


(b) The Bureau of Land Management State Director, in consultation with affected Bureau of Land Management resource advisory councils, shall develop and amend State or regional standards and guidelines. The Bureau of Land Management State Director will also coordinate with Indian tribes, other State and Federal land management agencies responsible for the management of lands and resources within the region or area under consideration, and the public in the development of State or regional standards and guidelines. State or regional standards or guidelines developed by the Bureau of Land Management State Director may not be implemented prior to their approval by the Secretary. Standards and guidelines made effective under paragraph (f) of this section may be modified by the Bureau of Land Management State Director, with approval of the Secretary, to address local ecosystems and management practices. 


(c)(1) If a standards assessment indicates to the authorized officer that the rangeland is failing to achieve standards or that management practices do not conform to the guidelines, then the authorized officer will use monitoring data to identify the significant factors that contribute to failing to achieve the standards or to conform with the guidelines. If the authorized officer determines through standards assessment and monitoring that existing grazing management practices or levels of grazing use on public lands are significant factors in failing to achieve the standards and conform with the guidelines that are made effective under this section, the authorized officer will, in compliance with applicable laws and with the consultation requirements of this part, formulate, propose, and analyze appropriate action to address the failure to meet standards or to conform to the guidelines.


(i) Parties will execute a documented agreement and/or the authorized officer will issue a final decision on the appropriate action under ยง 4160.3 as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 months after a determination.


(ii) BLM may extend the deadline for meeting the requirements established in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section when legally required processes that are the responsibility of another agency prevent completion of all legal obligations within the 24-month time frame. BLM will make a decision as soon as practicable after the legal requirements are met.


(2) Upon executing the agreement and/or in the absence of a stay of the final decision, the authorized officer will implement the appropriate action as soon as practicable, but not later than the start of the next grazing year.


(3) The authorized officer will take appropriate action as defined in this paragraph by the deadlines established in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. Appropriate action means implementing actions pursuant to subparts 4110, 4120, 4130, and 4160 of this part that will result in significant progress toward fulfillment of the standards and significant progress toward conformance with the guidelines. Practices and activities subject to standards and guidelines include the development of grazing-related portions of activity plans, establishment of terms and conditions of permits, leases, and other grazing authorizations, and range improvement activities such as vegetation manipulation, fence construction, and development of water.


(d) At a minimum, state and regional standards developed or revised under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must address the following:


(1) Watershed function; 


(2) Nutrient cycling and energy flow; 


(3) Water quality; 


(4) Habitat for endangered, threatened, proposed, candidate, and other special status species; and 


(5) Habitat quality for native plant and animal populations and communities. 


(e) At a minimum, State or regional guidelines developed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must address the following: 


(1) Maintaining or promoting adequate amounts of vegetative ground cover, including standing plant material and litter, to support infiltration, maintain soil moisture storage, and stabilize soils; 


(2) Maintaining or promoting subsurface soil conditions that support permeability rates appropriate to climate and soils; 


(3) Maintaining, improving or restoring riparian-wetland functions including energy dissipation, sediment capture, groundwater recharge, and stream bank stability; 


(4) Maintaining or promoting stream channel morphology (e.g., gradient, width/depth ratio, channel roughness and sinuosity) and functions appropriate to climate and landform; 


(5) Maintaining or promoting the appropriate kinds and amounts of soil organisms, plants and animals to support the hydrologic cycle, nutrient cycle, and energy flow; 


(6) Promoting the opportunity for seedling establishment of appropriate plant species when climatic conditions and space allow; 


(7) Maintaining, restoring or enhancing water quality to meet management objectives, such as meeting wildlife needs; 


(8) Restoring, maintaining or enhancing habitats to assist in the recovery of Federal threatened and endangered species; 


(9) Restoring, maintaining or enhancing habitats of Federal proposed, Federal candidate, and other special status species to promote their conservation; 


(10) Maintaining or promoting the physical and biological conditions to sustain native populations and communities; 


(11) Emphasizing native species in the support of ecological function; and 


(12) Incorporating the use of non-native plant species only in those situations in which native species are not available in sufficient quantities or are incapable of maintaining or achieving properly functioning conditions and biological health. 


(f) Until such time as state or regional standards and guidelines are developed and in effect, the following standards provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and guidelines provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section will apply and will be implemented in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(1) *Fallback standards.* (i) Upland soils exhibit infiltration and permeability rates that are appropriate to soil type, climate and landform. 


(ii) Riparian-wetland areas are in properly functioning condition. 


(iii) Stream channel morphology (including but not limited to gradient, width/depth ratio, channel roughness and sinuosity) and functions are appropriate for the climate and landform. 


(iv) Healthy, productive and diverse populations of native species exist and are maintained. 


(2) *Fallback guidelines.* (i) Management practices maintain or promote adequate amounts of ground cover to support infiltration, maintain soil moisture storage, and stabilize soils; 


(ii) Management practices maintain or promote soil conditions that support permeability rates that are appropriate to climate and soils; 


(iii) Management practices maintain or promote sufficient residual vegetation to maintain, improve or restore riparian-wetland functions of energy dissipation, sediment capture, groundwater recharge and stream bank stability; 


(iv) Management practices maintain or promote stream channel morphology (e.g., gradient, width/depth ratio, channel roughness and sinuosity) and functions that are appropriate to climate and landform; 


(v) Management practices maintain or promote the appropriate kinds and amounts of soil organisms, plants and animals to support the hydrologic cycle, nutrient cycle, and energy flow; 


(vi) Management practices maintain or promote the physical and biological conditions necessary to sustain native populations and communities; 


(vii) Desired species are being allowed to complete seed dissemination in 1 out of every 3 years (Management actions will promote the opportunity for seedling establishment when climatic conditions and space allow.); 


(viii) Conservation of Federal threatened or endangered, proposed, candidate, and other special status species is promoted by the restoration and maintenance of their habitats;


(ix) Native species are emphasized in the support of ecological function; 


(x) Non-native plant species are used only in those situations in which native species are not readily available in sufficient quantities or are incapable of maintaining or achieving properly functioning conditions and biological health; 


(xi) Periods of rest from disturbance or livestock use during times of critical plant growth or regrowth are provided when needed to achieve healthy, properly functioning conditions (The timing and duration of use periods shall be determined by the authorized officer.); 


(xii) Continuous, season-long livestock use is allowed to occur only when it has been demonstrated to be consistent with achieving healthy, properly functioning ecosystems; 


(xiii) Facilities are located away from riparian-wetland areas wherever they conflict with achieving or maintaining riparian-wetland function; 


(xiv) The development of springs and seeps or other projects affecting water and associated resources shall be designed to protect the ecological functions and processes of those sites; and 


(xv) Grazing on designated ephemeral (annual and perennial) rangeland is allowed to occur only if reliable estimates of production have been made, an identified level of annual growth or residue to remain on site at the end of the grazing season has been established, and adverse effects on perennial species are avoided.
