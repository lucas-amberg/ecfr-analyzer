# ยง 4300.41   What will the permit say about the number of reindeer and where I can graze them?

(a) The permit will indicate the maximum number of reindeer you can graze on the permit area based on range conditions. BLM can adjust this number if range conditions change, as for example, by natural causes, overgrazing, or fire.


(b) The permit will restrict grazing to a definitely described area which BLM feels is usable and adequate for your needs.
