# ยง 4300.45   Must I submit any reports?

Yes. Before April 1 of the second permit year and each year afterwards, you must submit a report in duplicate to BLM which describes your grazing operations during the preceding year. Reports do not have to be on a BLM-approved form nor in a particular format.
