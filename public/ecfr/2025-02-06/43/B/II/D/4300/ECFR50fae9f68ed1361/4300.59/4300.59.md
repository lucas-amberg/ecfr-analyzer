# ยง 4300.59   If I want to assign my permit to another party, when must I notify BLM?

You must file a proposed assignment of your permit, in whole or in part, in duplicate with BLM within 90 days of the assignment execution date. No particular format is required. The assignment is effective when BLM approves it.
