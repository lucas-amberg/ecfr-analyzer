# ยง 4300.2   Is there a special form for my application?

All applications you submit to BLM must be on a BLM-approved form and in duplicate. The forms to be used in this part are the Grazing Lease or Permit Application (Form 4201-1), the Reindeer Grazing Permit (Form 4132-2), and the Range Improvement Permit (Form 4120-7).
