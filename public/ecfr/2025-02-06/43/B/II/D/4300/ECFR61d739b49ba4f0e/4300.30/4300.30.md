(a) Yes, anyone may file a protest with BLM. The protest does not have to be in a particular format nor on a BLM-approved form but it must:


(1) Be filed in duplicate with BLM;


(2) Contain a complete description of all facts upon which it is based;


(3) Describe the lands involved; and


(4) Be accompanied by evidence of service of a copy of the protest on the applicant.


(b) If the person protesting also wants a grazing permit for all or part of the land described in the protested application, the protest must be accompanied by a grazing permit application.
