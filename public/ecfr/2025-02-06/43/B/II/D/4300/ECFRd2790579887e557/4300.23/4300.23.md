# ยง 4300.23   After I file my application, can I use the land before BLM issues my permit?

No. You cannot use the land until BLM issues you a permit. Generally, BLM will issue a permit within 120 days after receiving an application and will keep you informed if there are delays in meeting that timeframe.
