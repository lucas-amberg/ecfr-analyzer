# ยง 4300.50   Are there other uses of the land that may affect my permit?

Yes. The lands described in your grazing permit and the subsurface can be affected by uses that BLM considers more important than grazing. Your permit can be modified or reduced in size or canceled by BLM to allow for:


(a) Protection, development and use of the natural resources, e.g., minerals, timber, and water, under applicable laws and regulations;


(b) Agricultural use;


(c) Applications for and the acquisition of homesites, easements, permits, leases or other rights and uses, or any disposal or withdrawal, under the applicable public land laws; or


(d) Temporary closing of portions of the permitted area to grazing whenever, because of improper handling of reindeer, overgrazing, fire or other cause, BLM judges this necessary to restore the range to its normal condition.
