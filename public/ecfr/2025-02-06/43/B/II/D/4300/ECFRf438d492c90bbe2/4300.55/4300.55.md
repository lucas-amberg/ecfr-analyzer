# ยง 4300.55   What if I don't agree with an adjustment of my permit area?

You must contact BLM within the notice period to show cause why the area should not be adjusted. After the BLM field office manager makes a decision on the adjustment, you have the right to appeal that decision to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) under 43 CFR part 4. The IBLA makes the final decision.
