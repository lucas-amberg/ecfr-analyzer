# ยง 5040.2   What will BLM do before it establishes sustained-yield forest units?

Before BLM designates sustained-yield forest units, it will:


(a) Hold a public hearing in the area where it proposes to designate the units. BLM will provide notice, approved by the BLM Director, to the public of any hearing concerning sustained-yield forest units. This notice must be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the forest units are situated. BLM may also publish the notice in a trade publication; and


(b) Forward the minutes or meeting records to the BLM Director, along with an appropriate recommendation concerning the establishment of the units.
