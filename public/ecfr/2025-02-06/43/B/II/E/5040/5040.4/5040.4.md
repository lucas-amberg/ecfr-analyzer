# ยง 5040.4   What is the effect of designating sustained-yield units?

Designating new sustained-yield forest units abolishes previous O. and C. master unit or sustained-yield forest unit designations. Until new sustained-yield forest units are designated for the first time in accordance with 43 CFR part 5040, the current master unit designations will continue to be in effect.
