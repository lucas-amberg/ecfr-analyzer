# ยง 5441.1-2   SBA set-aside sales.

Only bids of small business concerns which have filed a self-certification statement as required by ยง 5441.1 may be considered for sales subject to set-asides. When no such bids are received, the timber may be sold under ยง 5443.1 in the same manner as timber not previously made subject to a set-aside. When timber subject to a set-aside is not sold for any other reason, the sale may be rescheduled for a set-aside sale.
