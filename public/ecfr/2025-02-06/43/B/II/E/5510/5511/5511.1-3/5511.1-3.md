# § 5511.1-3   Use of timber on lands covered by grazing leases, by lessees, and others.

(a) Before taking timber under a lease issued under section 15 of the Taylor Grazing Act, as amended by the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1978; 43 U.S.C. 315m), the lessee should file application for and procure a permit in accordance with the regulations issued under the Acts of June 3, 1878 (20 Stat. 88; 16 U.S.C. 604 through 606), and March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1093; 16 U.S.C. 607), §§ 5510.0-3(a) and 5511.1-1(a) to 5511.1-1(g). 


(b) Where application is made by a person other than the lessee to take timber from lands embraced in a grazing lease issued under section 15 of the said Act, investigation should be made to ascertain the facts in the case and whether or not the cutting of the timber applied for would adversely affect the lands for grazing purposes. If no objection appears, the permit may issue but should contain a provision that the timber cutting thereunder must be done in such manner as will not interfere with the rights of the lessee. 


(c) All applications for timber should be filed with the State Director for the State in which the timber to be cut is located and should comply with the regulations contained in § 5511.1-1.
