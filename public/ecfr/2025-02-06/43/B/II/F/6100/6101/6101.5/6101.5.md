# ยง 6101.5   Principles for Ecosystem Resilience.

(a) Except where otherwise provided by law, public lands must be managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield.


(b) To ensure multiple use and sustained yield, the BLM's management must conserve the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archeological values; preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition (including ecological and environmental values); maintain the productivity of renewable natural resources in perpetuity; and consider the long-term needs of future generations, without permanent impairment of the productivity of the land.


(c) The BLM must conserve renewable natural resources at a level that maintains or improves future resource availability and ecosystem resilience, in a manner consistent with multiple use and sustained yield.


(d) Authorized officers must implement the foregoing principles through:


(1) Conservation as a land use within the multiple use framework, including in decision-making, authorization, and planning processes;


(2) Protection and maintenance of the fundamentals of land health and ecosystem resilience;


(3) Restoration and protection of public lands to support ecosystem resilience, including habitat connectivity and old-growth forests;


(4) Use of the full mitigation hierarchy to address impacts to species, habitats, and ecosystems from land use authorizations; and


(5) Prevention of unnecessary or undue degradation.
