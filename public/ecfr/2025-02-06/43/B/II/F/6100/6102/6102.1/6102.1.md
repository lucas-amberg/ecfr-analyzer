# ยง 6102.1   Protection of Landscape Intactness.

(a) The BLM must manage certain landscapes to protect their intactness, including habitat connectivity and old-growth forests. This requires:


(1) Maintaining ecosystem resilience and habitat connectivity through conservation actions;


(2) Conserving landscape intactness when managing compatible uses, especially where development or fragmentation that could permanently impair ecosystem resilience has the potential to occur on public lands;


(3) Maintaining or restoring resilient ecosystems through habitat and ecosystem restoration projects that are implemented over broader spatial and longer temporal scales;


(4) Coordinating and implementing actions across BLM programs, offices, and partners to protect intact landscapes; and


(5) Pursuing management actions that maintain or mimic characteristic disturbance, or mimic natural disturbance, when maintaining it is not possible.


(b) Authorized officers will seek to prioritize actions that conserve and protect landscape intactness in accordance with ยง 6101.2.
