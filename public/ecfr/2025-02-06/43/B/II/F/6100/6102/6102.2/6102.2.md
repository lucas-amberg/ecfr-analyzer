# § 6102.2   Management to Protect Intact Landscapes.

(a) The BLM will maintain an inventory of landscape intactness as a resource value using watershed condition assessments (*see* § 6103.2(a)) to establish a consistent baseline condition.


(b) When updating a resource management plan under part 1600 of this chapter, the BLM will use a baseline condition of intactness and available high-quality information about landscape intactness, such as watershed condition assessments, environmental disturbances, and monitoring (*see* § 6103.2), to:


(1) Identify and delineate boundaries for intact landscapes within the planning area, taking into consideration habitat connectivity and migration corridor data;


(2) Evaluate alternatives to protect intact landscapes or portions of the intact landscapes from activities that would permanently or significantly disrupt, impair, or degrade the ecosystem's structure or functionality of the intact landscapes; and


(3) Identify which intact landscapes or portions of intact landscapes will be managed for protection consistent with the principles enumerated in § 6102.1(a).


(c) The BLM will identify desired conditions and landscape objectives to guide implementation of decisions regarding management of intact landscapes, habitat connectivity, and old-growth forests. As part of carrying out paragraph (b) of this section, the BLM will seek to:


(1) Establish partnerships to work across Federal and non-Federal lands to promote and protect intact landscapes;


(2) Work with communities to identify geographic areas important for their strategic growth and development in order to allow for better identification of the most suitable areas to protect intact landscapes and habitat connectivity;


(3) Consult with Tribes to identify opportunities for co-stewardship to protect intact landscapes (*see* § 6102.5(b)(4) through (6)); and


(4) Use high-quality information including standardized quantitative monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions for ecosystem resilience (*see* § 6103.2).


(d) When determining whether to acquire lands or interests in lands through purchase, donation, or exchange, authorized officers must prioritize the acquisition of lands or interests in lands that would further protect and connect intact landscapes and functioning ecosystems.


(e) Authorized officers must collect and track landscape intactness data to support minimizing surface disturbance and inform conservation actions. This information must be included in a publicly available national tracking system.
