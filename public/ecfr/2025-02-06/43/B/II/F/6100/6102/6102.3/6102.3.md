# ยง 6102.3   Restoration.

(a) The BLM must emphasize restoration on the public lands to achieve its multiple use and sustained yield mandate.


(b) In determining the restoration actions required to achieve recovery of ecosystems and promote resilience, the BLM must consider the causes of degradation, the recovery potential of the ecosystem, and the allowable uses in the governing land use plan, such as whether an area is managed for recreation or is degraded land prioritized for development. The BLM must then develop commensurate restoration goals and objectives (*see* ยง 6103.1.1).


(c) The BLM should employ management actions to promote restoration. Over the long-term, restoration actions must be durable, self-sustaining, and expected to persist in a manner that supports land health and ecosystem resilience.


(d) When designing and implementing restoration actions on public lands, including authorizing restoration leases, authorized officers must adhere to the following principles:


(1) Ensure that restoration actions address causes of degradation, focus on process-based solutions, and where possible maintain attributes and resource values associated with the potential or capability of the ecosystem;


(2) Ensure that actions are designed, implemented, and monitored at appropriate spatial and temporal scales using suitable treatments and tools to achieve desired outcomes;


(3) Coordinate and implement actions across BLM programs, with partners, and in consideration of existing uses to develop holistic restoration actions;


(4) Ensure incorporation of locally appropriate best management practices, high-quality information, and adaptive management that supports restoration;


(5) Identify opportunities to implement nature-based or low-tech restoration activities and use seed from native plants; and


(6) Consult with Tribes to identify opportunities for co-stewardship or collaboration (*see* ยง 6102.5(b)(4) through (6)).
