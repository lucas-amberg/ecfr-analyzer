# ยง 6303.1   How does BLM carry out administrative and emergency functions?

As necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the wilderness area, BLM may: 


(a) Use, build, or install temporary roads, motor vehicles, motorized equipment, mechanical transport, structures or installations, and land aircraft, in designated wilderness; 


(b) Prescribe conditions under which other Federal, State, or local agencies or their agents may use, build, or install such items to meet the minimum requirements for protection and administration of the wilderness area, its resources and users; 


(c) Authorize officers, employees, agencies, or agents of the Federal, State, and local governments to occupy and use wilderness areas to carry out the purposes of the Wilderness Act or other Federal statutes; and 


(d) Prescribe measures that may be used in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons in the area, including, but not limited to, the conditions for use of motorized equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, installations, structures, rock drills, and fixed anchors. BLM will require any restoration activities that we find necessary to be undertaken concurrently with the emergency activities or as soon as practicable when the emergency ends.
