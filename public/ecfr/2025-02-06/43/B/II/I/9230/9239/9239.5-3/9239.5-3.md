# ยง 9239.5-3   Coal.

(a) *Determination of payment in coal trespass.* For coal trespass in a State where there is no State law governing such trespass, the measure of damages will be as follows: 


(1) For innocent trespass, payment must be made for the value of the coal in place before severance. United States v. Homestake Mining Company (117 Fed. 481). 


(2) For willful trespass, payment must be made for the full value of the coal at the time of conversion without deduction for labor bestowed or expense incurred in removing and marketing the coal. Liberty Bell Gold Mining Company v. Smuggler-Union Mining Company (203 Fed. 795). The mining of coal in trespass is presumed to be willful, in the absence of persuasive evidence of the innocence and good faith of the trespasser. United States v. Ute Coal and Coke Company (158 Fed. 20). 


(b) *Coal mined when there is no lease in effect.* Any mining of coal which is not pursuant to a coal lease in effect at the time of the mining shall constitute a trespass, and the coal so mined must be paid for on a trespass basis. 


(c) *Coal mined by successful bidder at public sale.* The successful bidder at public sale for a coal leasing unit does not acquire any right to mine coal until he has complied with all the formalities required by the regulations, including the furnishing of a bond, and a lease has been issued to him. Coal mined by such applicant prior to the date of the issuance of a lease is in trespass and must be paid for on a trespass basis. 


(d) *Coal permit, lease, or license not to issue until trespass account settled.* No coal permit, lease, or license will be issued to anyone known to have mined coal in trespass until the trespass account is settled.


(e) *Right of surface owner to mine coal for domestic use.* The owner of land patented with a reservation of the coal deposits, either under the act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 844; 30 U.S.C. 81), or under the Act of June 22, 1910 (36 Stat. 583; 30 U.S.C. 83-85), has the right to mine coal for use upon the land for domestic purposes at any time prior to the disposal by the United States of the coal deposits.


(f) *Penalties for unauthorized exploration for coal.* (1) Any person who willfully conducts coal exploration for commercial purposes without an exploration license issued under subpart 3507 of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of not more than $5,125 for each day of violation.


(2) All data collected by said person on any Federal lands as a result of such violations shall immediately be made available to the Secretary, who shall make the data available to the public as soon as possible.


(3) No penalty under this section may be assessed unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to such violation pursuant to part 4 of this chapter.
