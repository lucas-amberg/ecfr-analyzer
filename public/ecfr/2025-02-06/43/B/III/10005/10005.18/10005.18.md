As provided for in Section 301 of the Act, the Commission will make a formal invitation to Federal and State resource agencies, Indian tribes, and other interested parties to prepare recommendations concerning projects that will be considered for funding. This invitation will take the form of a “project solicitation packet.” The packet will contain a cover letter, this planning rule or a reference as to where it may be obtained, a format for preparing applications, and other materials that the Commission concludes will assist in the preparation of recommendations. Appropriate announcement will also be made in the Utah media and in the _Federal Register_ in order that other interested parties might be made aware of the opportunity to participate. To assist applicants, the format for preparing application may be made available in electronic form upon request.
