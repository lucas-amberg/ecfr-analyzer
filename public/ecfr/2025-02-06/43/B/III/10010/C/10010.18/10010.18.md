(a) At a minimum, an EA will include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E) of NEPA, of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and such alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons consulted (40 CFR 1508.9(b)).


(b) In addition, an EA may be expanded to more fully describe the proposal and a broader range of alternatives if this facilitates planning and decision making.


(c) The level of detail and depth of impact analysis should normally be limited to that needed to determine whether there are significant environmental effects.


(d) An EA will contain objective and credible analyses which support its environmental impact conclusions. It will not, in and of itself, conclude whether or not an EIS will be prepared. This conclusion will be made upon review of the EA by the responsible official and documented in either a NOI or FONSI.
