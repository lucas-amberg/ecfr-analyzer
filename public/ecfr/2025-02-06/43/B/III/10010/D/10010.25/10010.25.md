# ยง 10010.25   Supplemental environmental impact statements.

(a) Supplement Environmental Impact Statements (SEIS) are only required if such changes in the proposed action or alternatives, new circumstances, or resultant significant effects are not adequately analyzed in the previously prepared EIS.


(b) The Commission will consult with the Office of the Solicitor prior to proposing to CEQ to prepare a final supplement without preparing an intervening draft.


(c) If, after a Record of Decision has been executed based on a final EIS, a described proposal is further refined or modified and if there are only minor changes in effects or they are still within the scope of the earlier EIS, an EA and FONSI may be prepared for subsequent decisions rather than a SEIS. As identified in Sec. 10010.61(b)(1)(i), changes having no potential for significant environmental impact are categorically excluded from environmental documentation requirements.
