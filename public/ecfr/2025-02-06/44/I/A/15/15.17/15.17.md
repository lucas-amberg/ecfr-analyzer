Nothing in the rules and regulations in this part will be construed to abolish any other Federal laws or any State and local laws and regulations applicable to Mt. Weather or NETC premises. The rules and regulations in this part supplement penal provisions of Title 18, United States Code, relating to Crimes and Criminal Procedure, which apply without regard to the place of the offense and to those penal provisions that apply in areas under the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 7. They supersede provisions of State law, however, that Federal law makes criminal offenses under the Assimilated Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. 13) to the extent that State laws conflict with these regulations. State and local criminal laws apply as such only to the extent that the State reserved such authority to itself by the State consent or cession statute or that a Federal statute vests such authority in the State.
