(a) It is the policy of FEMA to make its records available to private litigants to the same extent and in the same manner as such records are made available to members of the general public, except where protected from disclosure by litigation procedural authority (e.g., Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) or other applicable law.


(b) It is FEMA's policy and responsibility to preserve its human resources for performance of the official functions of the Agency and to maintain strict impartiality with respect to private litigants. Participation by FEMA employees in private litigation in their official capacities is generally contrary to this policy.
