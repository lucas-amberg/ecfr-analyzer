# ยง 7.11   Conduct of investigations.

(a) *Periodic compliance reviews.* The responsible agency official or his designee shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this regulation.


(b) *Complaints.* Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this regulation may by himself or by a representative file a written complaint with the National Headquarters or any Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible agency official or his designee.


(c) *Investigations.* The responsible agency official or his designee will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this regulation. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this regulation occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this regulation.


(d) *Resolution of matters.* (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this regulation, the responsible agency official or his designee will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in section 12.


(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section the responsible agency official or his designee will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.


(e) *Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.* No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this regulation, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this regulation. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this regulation, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.
