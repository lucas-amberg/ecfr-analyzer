# ยง 9.10   Identify impacts of proposed actions.

(a) This section ensures that the effects of proposed Agency actions are identified.


(b) The Agency shall identify the potential direct and indirect adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and wetlands and the potential direct and indirect support of floodplain and wetland development that could result from the proposed action. Such identification of impacts shall be to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of this part to avoid floodplain and wetland locations unless they are the only practicable alternatives to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands.


(c) This identification shall consider whether the proposed action will result in an increase in the useful life of any structure or facility in question, maintain the investment at risk and exposure of lives to the flood hazard or forego an opportunity to restore the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains or wetlands.


(d) In the review of a proposed or alternative action, the Regional Administrator shall consider and evaluate: impacts associated with modification of wetlands and floodplains regardless of its location; additional impacts which may occur when certain types of actions may support subsequent action which have additional impacts of their own; adverse impacts of the proposed actions on lives and property and on natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values; and the three categories of factors listed below:


(1) *Flood hazard-related factors.* These include, but are not limited to, the factors listed in ยง 9.7(b)(3);


(2) *Natural values-related factors.* These include, but are not limited to: water resource values, as in storing and conveying floodwaters, maintaining water quality, and groundwater recharge; living resource values, as in providing habitats and enhancing biodiversity for fish and wildlife and plant resources; cultural resource values, as in providing open space, natural beauty, recreation, scientific study, historical and archaeological resources, and education; and cultivated resource values, as in creating rich soils for agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry.


(3) *Factors relevant to a proposed action's effects on the survival and quality of wetlands.* These include, but are not limited to: Public health, safety, and welfare, including water supply, quality, recharge and discharge; pollution; flood and storm hazards; and sediment and erosion; maintenance of natural systems, including conservation and long term productivity of existing flora and fauna, species and habitat diversity and stability, hydrologic utility, fish, wildlife, timber, and food and fiber resources; and other uses of wetlands in the public interest, including recreational, scientific, and cultural uses.
