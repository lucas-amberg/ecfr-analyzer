(d) Communities identified in part 65 of this subchapter as containing more than one type of hazard (e.g., any combination of special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion hazard areas) shall adopt flood plain management regulations for each type of hazard consistent with the requirements of §§ 60.3, 60.4 and 60.5.


(e) Local flood plain management regulations may be submitted to the State Coordinating Agency designated pursuant to § 60.25 for its advice and concurrence. The submission to the State shall clearly describe proposed enforcement procedures.
