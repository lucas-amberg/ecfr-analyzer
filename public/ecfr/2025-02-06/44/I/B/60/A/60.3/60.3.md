# § 60.3   Flood plain management criteria for flood-prone areas.

The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special flood hazard area designations and water surface elevations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining such special flood hazard designations are set forth in § 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases the minimum requirements governing the adequacy of the flood plain management regulations for flood-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data formally provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:


(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not defined the special flood hazard areas within a community, has not provided water surface elevation data, and has not provided sufficient data to identify the floodway or coastal high hazard area, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall:


(1) Require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community, including the placement of manufactured homes, so that it may determine whether such construction or other development is proposed within flood-prone areas;


(2) Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;


(3) Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall (i) be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, (iii) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and (iv) be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.


(4) Review subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to assure that (i) all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area, (ii) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (iii) adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;


(5) Require within flood-prone areas new and replacement water supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and


(6) Require within flood-prone areas (i) new and replacement sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and (ii) onsite waste disposal systems to be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.


(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has designated areas of special flood hazards (A zones) by the publication of a community's FHBM or FIRM, but has neither produced water surface elevation data nor identified a floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:


(1) Require permits for all proposed construction and other developments including the placement of manufactured homes, within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;


(2) Require the application of the standards in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section to development within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;


(3) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data;


(4) Obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, including data developed pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM meet the standards in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(5), (c)(6), (c)(12), (c)(14), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section;


(5) Where base flood elevation data are utilized, within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM:


(i) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures, and


(ii) Obtain, if the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed, and


(iii) Maintain a record of all such information with the official designated by the community under § 59.22 (a)(9)(iii);


(6) Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to the Federal Insurance Administrator;


(7) Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained;


(8) Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.


(c) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final flood elevations for one or more special flood hazard areas on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated other special flood hazard areas without base flood elevations on the community's FIRM, but has not identified a regulatory floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:


(1) Require the standards of paragraph (b) of this section within all A1-30 zones, AE zones, A zones, AH zones, and AO zones, on the community's FIRM;


(2) Require that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level, unless the community is granted an exception by the Federal Insurance Administrator for the allowance of basements in accordance with § 60.6 (b) or (c);


(3) Require that all new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the community's firm (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;


(4) Provide that where a non-residential structure is intended to be made watertight below the base flood level, (i) a registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (c)(8)(ii) of this section, and (ii) a record of such certificates which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained with the official designated by the community under § 59.22(a)(9)(iii);


(5) Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.


(6) Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites


(i) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,


(ii) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,


(iii) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or


(iv) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation collapse and lateral movement.


(7) Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);


(8) Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that level to meet the floodproofing standard specified in § 60.3(c)(3)(ii);


(9) Require within any A99 zones on a community's FIRM the standards of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4)(i) and (b)(5) through (b)(9) of this section;


(10) Require until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.


(11) Require within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.


(12) Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A-1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(6) of this section be elevated so that either


(i) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or


(ii) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement.


(13) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 60.3, a community may approve certain development in Zones Al-30, AE, and AH, on the community's FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision, fulfills the requirements for such a revision as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.


(14) Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either


(i) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,


(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or


(iii) Meet the permit requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes” in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.


(d) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones A1-30 and/or AE on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AO zones, AH zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community's FIRM, and has provided data from which the community shall designate its regulatory floodway, the community shall:


(1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) through (14) of this section;


(2) Select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point;


(3) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;


(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 60.3, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.


(e) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones A1-30 and/or AE on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AH zones, AO zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community's FIRM, and has identified on the community's FIRM coastal high hazard areas by designating Zones V1-30, VE, and/or V, the community shall:


(1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (14) of this section;


(2) Within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on a community's FIRM, (i) obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement, and (ii) maintain a record of all such information with the official designated by the community under § 59.22(a)(9)(iii);


(3) Provide that all new construction within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM is located landward of the reach of mean high tide;


(4) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V1-30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation data is available, on the community's FIRM, are elevated on pilings and columns so that (i) the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level; and (ii) the pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State or local building standards. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of paragraphs (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section.


(5) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purposes of this section, a breakway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:


(i) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and,


(ii) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural). Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State or local building standards.


(6) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM;


(7) Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM which would increase potential flood damage.


(8) Require that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM on sites


(i) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,


(ii) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,


(iii) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or


(iv) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, meet the standards of paragraphs (e)(2) through (7) of this section and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones VI-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(12) of this section.


(9) Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM either


(i) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,


(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or


(iii) Meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (e) (2) through (7) of this section.


(f) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones A1-30 or AE on the community's FIRM, and, if appropriate, has designated AH zones, AO zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community's FIRM, and has identified flood protection restoration areas by designating Zones AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A, the community shall:


(1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (14) and (d)(1) through (4) of this section.


(2) Adopt the official map or legal description of those areas within Zones AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A, or AR/AO that are designated developed areas as defined in § 59.1 in accordance with the eligibility procedures under § 65.14.


(3) For all new construction of structures in areas within Zone AR that are designated as developed areas and in other areas within Zone AR where the AR flood depth is 5 feet or less:


(i) Determine the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is 3 feet above highest adjacent grade; and
