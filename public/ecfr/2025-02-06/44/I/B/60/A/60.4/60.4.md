# ยง 60.4   Flood plain management criteria for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas.

The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard area designations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining such special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard designations are set forth in ยง 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases, the minimum requirements for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:


(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not yet identified any area within the community as an area having special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall


(1) Require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community so that it may determine whether development is proposed within mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas;


(2) Require review of each permit application to determine whether the proposed site and improvements will be reasonably safe from mudslides (i.e., mudflows). Factors to be considered in making such a determination should include but not be limited to (i) the type and quality of soils, (ii) any evidence of ground water or surface water problems, (iii) the depth and quality of any fill, (iv) the overall slope of the site, and (v) the weight that any proposed structure will impose on the slope;


(3) Require, if a proposed site and improvements are in a location that may have mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards, that (i) a site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering, (ii) the proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvements are adequately designed and protected against mudslide (i.e., mudflow) damages, (iii) the proposed grading, excavations, new construction and substantial improvements do not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances, and (iv) drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance be such as not to endanger slope stability.


(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated Zone M on the community's FIRM, the community shall:


(1) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and


(2) Adopt and enforce a grading ordinance or regulation in accordance with data supplied by the Federal Insurance Administrator which (i) regulates the location of foundation systems and utility systems of new construction and substantial improvements, (ii) regulates the location, drainage and maintenance of all excavations, cuts and fills and planted slopes, (iii) provides special requirements for protective measures including but not necessarily limited to retaining walls, buttress fills, sub-drains, diverter terraces, benchings, etc., and (iv) requires engineering drawings and specifications to be submitted for all corrective measures, accompanied by supporting soils engineering and geology reports. Guidance may be obtained from the provisions of the 1973 edition and any subsequent edition of the Uniform Building Code, sections 7001 through 7006, and 7008 through 7015. The Uniform Building Code is published by the International Conference of Building Officials, 50 South Los Robles, Pasadena, California 91101.
