# § 62.24   WYO participation criteria.

New companies or organizations eligible for the pilot project we describe in paragraph (b) of this section that seek to participate in the WYO program, as well as former WYO companies seeking to return to the WYO program, must meet standards for financial capability and stability for statistical and financial reporting and for commitment to program objectives. 


(a) To demonstrate the ability to meet the financial requirements, a private insurance company wishing to enter or reenter the WYO program must: 


(1) Be a licensed property insurance company; 


(2) Have a five (5) year history of writing property insurance; 


(3) Disclose any legal proceedings, suspensions, judgments, settlements, or agreements reached with any State insurance department, State attorney general, State corporation commission, or the Federal Government during the immediately prior five (5) years regarding the company's business practices; 


(4) Submit its most recent National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) annual statement; 


(5) Submit information, as data become available, to indicate that the company meets or exceeds NAIC standards for risk-based capital and surplus; and 


(6) Submit its last State or regional audit, which should contain no material negative findings. 


(b) To demonstrate the ability to meet the financial requirements, a public entity risk-sharing organization, an association of local governments, a State association of political subdivisions, a State-sponsored municipal league, and any other intergovernmental risk-sharing pool for covering public entity structures, wishing to enter the WYO program, which will end September 30, 2004, must: 


(1) Have authority by a State to provide property coverage to its members; 


(2) Have a five (5) year history of writing property coverage; 


(3) Disclose any legal proceedings, suspensions, judgments, settlements, or agreements reached with any State insurance department, State attorney general, State corporation commission, or the Federal Government during the immediately prior five (5) years regarding the other insurer's business practices; and 


(4) Submit its most recent two annual audits from an independent accounting firm performed in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles that show no material negative findings; and submit, as data become available, information to indicate that the other insurer meets or exceeds standards comparable to those of the NAIC for risk-based capital and surplus. 


(c) An applicant for entry or reentry in the WYO program must also pass a test to determine the applicant's ability to process flood insurance and meet the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRRP) Plan requirements of the WYO Financial Control Plan. Unless the test requirement is waived, e.g., where an already qualified performer will fulfill the applicant's reporting requirements, the applicant must prepare and submit test output monthly tape(s) and monthly financial statements and reconciliations for processing by the NFIP Bureau and Statistical Agent contractor. For test purposes, no error tolerance will be allowed. If the applicant fails the initial test, a second test will be run, which the applicant must pass to participate in the Program. 


(d) To satisfy the requirement for commitment to Program goals, including marketing of flood insurance policies, the applicant will submit information concerning its plans for the WYO Program including plans for the training and support of producers and staff, marketing plans and sales targets, and claims handling and disaster response plans. Applicants must also identify those aspects of their planned flood insurance operations to be performed by another organization, managing agent, another WYO Company, a WYO vendor, a service bureau or related organization. Applicants will also name, in addition to a Principal Coordinator, a corporate officer point of contact—an individual, e.g., at the level of Senior Executive Vice President, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Operating Officer. Each applicant shall furnish the latest available information regarding the number of its fire, allied lines, farm-owners multiple peril, homeowners multiple peril, and commercial multiple peril policies or coverage documents in force, by line.
