# § 64.1   Purpose of part.

(a) 42 U.S.C. 4012(c), 4022 and 4102 require that flood insurance in the maximum limits of coverage under the regular program shall be offered in communities only after the Federal Insurance Administrator has: (1) Identified the areas of special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion hazards within the community; and/or (2) completed a risk study for the applicant community. The priorities for conducting such risk studies are set forth in §§ 59.23 and 60.25 of this subchapter. The purpose of this part is to define the types of zones which the Agency will use for identifying the hazard areas on maps.


(b) 42 U.S.C. 4056 authorizes an emergency implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program whereby the Federal Insurance Administrator may make subsidized coverage available to eligible communities prior to the completion of detailed risk studies for such areas. This part also describes procedures under the emergency program and lists communities which become eligible under the NFIP.
