(a) The Federal Insurance Administrator may return the application for exemption upon finding it incomplete or upon finding that additional information is required in order to make a determination as to the adequacy of the self-insurance plan.

(c) Upon determining that the State's plan of self-insurance equals or exceeds the standards set forth in ยง 75.11 of this subpart, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall certify that the State is exempt from the requirement for the purchase of flood insurance for State-owned structures and their contents located or to be located in areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones.
