# § 77.6   Eligibility.

(a) *NFIP requirements.* (1) States, Indian Tribal governments, and communities must be participating in the NFIP and may not be suspended or withdrawn under the program.


(2) For projects that impact individual structures, for example, acquisitions and elevations, an NFIP policy for the structure must be in effect prior to the opening of the application period and be maintained for the life of the structure.


(b) *Plan requirement*—(1) *Applicants.* States must have a FEMA-approved mitigation plan meeting the requirements of § 201.4 of this chapter that provides for reduction of flood losses to structures for which NFIP coverage is available. Indian Tribal governments must have a FEMA-approved mitigation plan meeting the requirements of § 201.7 of this chapter that provides for reduction of flood losses to structures for which NFIP coverage is available. The FEMA-approved mitigation plan is required at the time of application and award.


(2) *Subapplicants.* To be eligible for FMA project grants, subapplicants must have an approved mitigation plan in accordance with part 201 of this chapter that provides for reduction of flood losses to structures for which NFIP coverage is available. The FEMA-approved mitigation plan is required at the time of application and award.


(c) *Eligible activities*—(1) *Planning.* FMA planning grants may be used to develop or update State, Indian Tribal and/or local mitigation plans that meet the planning criteria outlined in part 201 of this chapter and provide for reduction of flood losses to structures for which NFIP coverage is available.


(2) *Projects.* Projects funded under the FMA program are limited to activities that reduce flood damages to properties insured under the NFIP. Applications involving any activities for which implementation has already been initiated or completed are not eligible for funding, and will not be considered. Eligible activities are:


(i) Acquisition of real property from property owners, and demolition or relocation of buildings and/or structures to areas outside of the floodplain to convert the property to open space use in perpetuity, in accordance with part 80 of this subchapter;


(ii) Elevation of existing structures to at least base flood levels or higher, if required by FEMA or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator;


(iii) Floodproofing of existing non-residential structures in accordance with the requirements of the NFIP or higher standards if required by FEMA or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator;


(iv) Floodproofing of historic structures as defined in § 59.1 of this subchapter;


(v) Demolition and rebuilding of properties to at least base flood levels or higher, if required by FEMA or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator;


(vi) Localized flood risk reduction projects that lessen the frequency or severity of flooding and decrease predicted flood damages, and that do not duplicate the flood prevention activities of other Federal agencies. Non-localized flood risk reduction projects such as dikes, levees, floodwalls, seawalls, groins, jetties, dams and large-scale waterway channelization projects are not eligible unless the Administrator specifically determines in approving a mitigation plan that such activities are the most cost-effective mitigation activities for the National Flood Mitigation Fund;


(vii) Elevation, relocation, or floodproofing of utilities; and


(viii) Other mitigation activities not described or identified in (c)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section that are described in the State, Tribal or local mitigation plan.


(3) *Technical assistance.* If a recipient applied for and was awarded at least $1 million in the prior fiscal year, that recipient may be eligible to receive a technical assistance grant for up to $50,000.


(4) *Project scoping.* Activities that enable subapplicants to develop complete subapplications for eligible mitigation activities including but not limited to data development.


(d) *Minimum project criteria.* In addition to being an eligible project type, mitigation grant projects must also:


(1) Be in conformance with State, Tribal and/or local mitigation plans approved under part 201 of this chapter for the jurisdiction where the project is located;


(2) Be in conformance with applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, and agency policy, including parts 9 and 60 of this chapter, and other applicable Federal, State, Tribal, and local laws and regulations;


(3) Be technically feasible and cost-effective; or, eliminate future payments from the NFIF for severe repetitive loss structures through an acquisition or relocation activity;


(4) Solve a problem independently, or constitute a functional portion of a long-term solution where there is assurance that the project as a whole will be completed. This assurance will include documentation identifying the remaining funds necessary to complete the project, and the timeframe for completing the project;


(5) Consider long-term changes to the areas and entities it protects, and have manageable future maintenance and modification requirements. The subrecipient is responsible for the continued maintenance needed to preserve the hazard mitigation benefits of these measures; and


(6) Not duplicate benefits available from another source for the same purpose or assistance that another Federal agency or program has more primary authority to provide.
