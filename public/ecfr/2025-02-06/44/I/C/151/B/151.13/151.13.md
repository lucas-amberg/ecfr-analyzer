# ยง 151.13   Reconsideration of amount authorized for payment.

(a) If the claimant elects to protest the amount authorized for payment, after the applicable procedures of ยง 151.12 have been followed, it must within 30 days of receipt of notification of the amount authorized notify the Administrator in writing of its objections and set forth the reasons why the Administrator should reconsider the determination. The Administrator will upon notice of protest and receipt of additional evidence reconsider the determination of the amount of Federal payments under ยง 151.12(a)(2) but not the determination of the amount of costs under ยง 151.12(a)(1). The Administrator shall cause a reconsideration by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amount actually available and authorized for payment by the Treasury. The Administrator, upon receipt of the Secretary of the Treasury's reconsidered determination, will notify the claimant in writing of the amount authorized, upon reconsideration, for payment in full settlement of the claim.


(b) If the claimant elects to accept the amount authorized, upon reconsideration, for payment in full settlement of its claims, it must within 30 days (or a longer period of time acceptable to the Administrator) of its receipt of that determination notify the Administrator of its acceptance in writing accompanied by a properly executed document of release. Upon receipt of such notice and document of release, the Administrator will forward the claim, a copy of the Administrator's final determination, and the claimant's document of release to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of the claim in the amount of final authorization.
