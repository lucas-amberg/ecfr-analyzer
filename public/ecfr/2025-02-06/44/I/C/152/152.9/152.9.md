# ยง 152.9   Reconsideration.

(a) *Reconsideration of initial grant award decisions.* We will review our decision with respect to an initial grant award decision only when the applicant asserts that we have made a material technical or procedural error in the processing of the application and can substantiate such assertions. As grants are awarded on a competitive basis, in accordance with the findings of an independent panel of experts, we cannot consider requests for reconsideration based upon the merits of an original application. Similarly, we will not consider new information provided after the submission of the original application. In the case of new information, we encourage applicants to incorporate their changed circumstances into their applications for future grant cycles. 


(b) *Reconsideration of other decisions.* We will consider requests for reconsideration of decisions other than those related to the initial grant award on their merits. 


(c) We must receive a request for reconsideration under this section within 60 days of the date of the notice of the decision for which reconsideration is requested. 


(d) Requests for reconsideration should be directed to: Assistant Administrator, Grant Programs Directorate, Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, FEMA, 800 K Street, NW., South Tower 5th Floor, Washington, DC 20001.
