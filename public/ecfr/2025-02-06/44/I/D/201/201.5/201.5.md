# ยง 201.5   Enhanced State Mitigation Plans.

(a) A State with a FEMA approved Enhanced State Mitigation Plan at the time of a disaster declaration is eligible to receive increased funds under the HMGP, based on twenty percent of the total estimated eligible Stafford Act disaster assistance. The Enhanced State Mitigation Plan must demonstrate that a State has developed a comprehensive mitigation program, that the State effectively uses available mitigation funding, and that it is capable of managing the increased funding. In order for the State to be eligible for the 20 percent HMGP funding, FEMA must have approved the plan within 5 years prior to the disaster declaration. 


(b) Enhanced State Mitigation Plans must include all elements of the Standard State Mitigation Plan identified in ยง 201.4, as well as document the following: 


(1) Demonstration that the plan is integrated to the extent practicable with other State and/or regional planning initiatives (comprehensive, growth management, economic development, capital improvement, land development, and/or emergency management plans) and FEMA mitigation programs and initiatives that provide guidance to State and regional agencies. 


(2) Documentation of the State's project implementation capability, identifying and demonstrating the ability to implement the plan, including: 


(i) Established eligibility criteria for multi-hazard mitigation measures. 


(ii) A system to determine the cost effectiveness of mitigation measures, consistent with OMB Circular A-94, Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs, and to rank the measures according to the State's eligibility criteria. 


(iii) Demonstration that the State has the capability to effectively manage the HMGP as well as other mitigation grant programs, including a record of the following: 


(A) Meeting HMGP and other mitigation grant application timeframes and submitting complete, technically feasible, and eligible project applications with appropriate supporting documentation; 


(B) Preparing and submitting accurate environmental reviews and benefit-cost analyses; 


(C) Submitting complete and accurate quarterly progress and financial reports on time; and 


(D) Completing HMGP and other mitigation grant projects within established performance periods, including financial reconciliation. 


(iv) A system and strategy by which the State will conduct an assessment of the completed mitigation actions and include a record of the effectiveness (actual cost avoidance) of each mitigation action. 


(3) Demonstration that the State effectively uses existing mitigation programs to achieve its mitigation goals. 


(4) Demonstration that the State is committed to a comprehensive state mitigation program, which might include any of the following: 


(i) A commitment to support local mitigation planning by providing workshops and training, State planning grants, or coordinated capability development of local officials, including Emergency Management and Floodplain Management certifications. 


(ii) A statewide program of hazard mitigation through the development of legislative initiatives, mitigation councils, formation of public/private partnerships, and/or other executive actions that promote hazard mitigation. 


(iii) The State provides a portion of the non-Federal match for HMGP and/or other mitigation projects. 


(iv) To the extent allowed by State law, the State requires or encourages local governments to use a current version of a nationally applicable model building code or standard that addresses natural hazards as a basis for design and construction of State sponsored mitigation projects. 


(v) A comprehensive, multi-year plan to mitigate the risks posed to existing buildings that have been identified as necessary for post-disaster response and recovery operations. 


(vi) A comprehensive description of how the State integrates mitigation into its post-disaster recovery operations. 


(c) *Review and updates.* (1) A State must review and revise its plan to reflect changes in development, progress in statewide mitigation efforts, and changes in priorities, and resubmit it for approval to the appropriate Regional Administrator every 5 years. The Regional review will be completed within 45 days after receipt from the State, whenever possible. 


(2) In order for a State to be eligible for the 20 percent HMGP funding, the Enhanced State Mitigation plan must be approved by FEMA within the 5 years prior to the current major disaster declaration.
