# ยง 204.22   Submitting a request for a fire management assistance declaration.

The Governor of a State, or the Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR), may submit a request for a fire management assistance declaration. The request must be submitted while the fire is burning uncontrolled and threatens such destruction as would constitute a major disaster. The request must be submitted to the Regional Administrator and should address the relevant criteria listed in ยง 204.21, with supporting documentation that contains factual data and professional estimates on the fire or fire complex. To ensure that FEMA can process a State's request for a fire management assistance declaration as expeditiously as possible, the State should transmit the request by telephone, promptly followed by written documentation.
