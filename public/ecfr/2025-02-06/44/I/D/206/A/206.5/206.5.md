(a) In any declared major disaster, the Administrator, Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Operations Directorate, or the Regional Administrator may direct any Federal agency to utilize its authorities and the resources granted to it under Federal law (including personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, and managerial, technical, and advisory services) to support State and local assistance efforts.


(b) In any declared emergency, the Administrator, Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Operations Directorate, or the Regional Administrator may direct any Federal agency to utilize its authorities and the resources granted to it under Federal law (including personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, and managerial, technical, and advisory services) to support emergency efforts by State and local governments to save lives; protect property, public health and safety; and lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe.


(c) In any declared major disaster or emergency, the Administrator, Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Operations Directorate, or the Regional Administrator may direct any Federal agency to provide emergency assistance necessary to save lives and to protect property, public health, and safety by:

(2) Distributing medicine, food, and other consumable supplies; or


(3) Performing work or services to provide emergency assistance authorized in the Stafford Act.


(d) Disaster assistance by other Federal agencies is subject to the coordination of the FCO. Federal agencies shall provide any reports or information about disaster assistance rendered under the provisions of these regulations or authorities independent of the Stafford Act, that the FCO or Regional Administrator considers necessary and requests from the agencies.


(e) Assistance furnished by any Federal agency under paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section is subject to the criteria provided by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Operations Directorate under these regulations.


(f) Assistance under paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, when directed by the Administrator, Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Operations Directorate, or the Regional Administrator, does not apply to nor shall it affect the authority of any Federal agency to provide disaster assistance independent of the Stafford Act.


(g) In carrying out the purposes of the Stafford Act, any Federal agency may accept and utilize, with the consent of the State or local government, the services, personnel, materials, and facilities of any State or local government, agency, office, or employee. Such utilization shall not make such services, materials, or facilities Federal in nature nor make the State or local government or agency an arm or agent of the Federal Government.


(h) Any Federal agency charged with the administration of a Federal assistance program may, if so requested by the applicant State or local authorities, modify or waive, for a major disaster, such administrative conditions for assistance as would otherwise prevent the giving of assistance under such programs if the inability to meet such conditions is a result of the major disaster.
