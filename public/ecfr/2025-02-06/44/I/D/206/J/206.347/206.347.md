# § 206.347   Requirements.

(a) *Location determination.* For each disaster assistance action which is proposed on the Atlantic or Gulf Coasts, the Regional Administrator shall:


(1) Review a proposed action's location to determine if the action is on or connected to the CBRS unit and thereby subject to these regulations. The appropriate Department of Interior map identifying units of the CBRS will be the basis of such determination. The CBRS units are also identified on FEMA Flood Insurance Maps (FIRM's) for the convenience of field personnel.


(2) If an action is determined not to be on or connected to a unit of the CBRS, no further requirements of these regulations needs to be met, and the action may be processed under other applicable disaster assistance regulations.

(b) *Emergency disaster assistance.* For each emergency disaster assistance action listed in § 206.346(a), the Regional Administrator shall perform the required consultation.

(iii) Consultation in accordance with § 206.348 shall be accomplished.


(3) *Energy facilities.* For the repair of facilities necessary for the exploration, extraction or transportation of energy resources:

(7) *Improved project.* An improved project may not be approved for a facility in the CBRS if such grant is to be combined with other funding, resulting in an expansion of the facility beyond the predisaster design. If a facility is exempt from the expansion prohibitions of CBRA by virtue of falling into one of the categories identified in paragraph (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, then an improved project for such facilities is not precluded.


(8) *Alternate project.* A new or enlarged facility may not be constructed on a unit of the CBRS under the provisions of the Stafford Act unless the facility is exempt from the expansion prohibition of CBRA by virtue of falling into one of the categories identified in paragraph (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section.
