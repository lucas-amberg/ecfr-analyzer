DOI is expected to respond within 12 working days from the date of the FEMA request for consultation. If a response is not received within the time limit, the FEMA Regional Administrator shall contact the DOI representative to determine if the request for consultation was received in a timely manner.

In coordination with the Office of Chief Counsel (OCC), consultation will be accomplished at the FEMA National Office with the DOI consultation officer. After this consultation, the Director, Office of Environmental Planning and Historic Preservation, Mitigation Directorate, determines whether or not to approve the proposed action.
