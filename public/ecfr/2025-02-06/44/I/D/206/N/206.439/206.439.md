# ยง 206.439   Allowable costs.

(a) General requirements for determining allowable costs are established in 2 CFR part 200, Cost Principles. Exceptions to those requirements as allowed in 2 CFR 200.101 and 2 CFR 200.102 are explained in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) Administrative and management costs for major disasters will be paid in accordance with 44 CFR part 207.


(c) *Pre-award costs.* FEMA may fund eligible pre-award planning or project costs at its discretion and as funds are available. Recipients and subrecipients may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for activities directly related to the development of the project or planning proposal. These costs can only be incurred during the open application period of the grant program. Costs associated with implementation of the activity but incurred prior to grant award are not eligible. Therefore, activities where implementation is initiated or completed prior to award are not eligible and will not be reimbursed.
