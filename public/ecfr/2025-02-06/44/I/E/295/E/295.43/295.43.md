# ยง 295.43   Judicial review.

As an alternative to arbitration, a Claimant dissatisfied with the outcome of an Administrative Appeal may seek judicial review of the decision by bringing a civil lawsuit against FEMA in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico. This lawsuit must be brought within 60 Days of the date that appears on the Administrative Appeal decision. The court may only consider evidence in the Administrative Record. The court will uphold our decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. If the judge has awarded damages over and above those previously paid, FEMA will cause the damages to be paid to the Claimant upon receipt of the Release and Certification Form or as otherwise specified by order of the court. Claimants who have received any compensation under the CGFAA must return a Release and Certification Form as provided in ยง 295.30(c), regardless of whether the court awards additional compensation.
