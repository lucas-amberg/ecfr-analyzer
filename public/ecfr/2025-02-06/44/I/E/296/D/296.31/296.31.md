# ยง 296.31   Reimbursement of claim expenses.

(a) FEMA will reimburse claimants for the reasonable costs they incur in providing documentation requested by the Claims Office. FEMA will also reimburse claimants for the reasonable costs they incur in providing appraisals, or other third-party opinions that the Claims Office deems necessary to determine the amount of the claim. FEMA will not reimburse claimants for the cost of appraisals or other third-party opinions not deemed necessary by the Claims Office.


(b) FEMA will provide a lump sum payment for incidental expenses incurred in claims preparation to claimants that are awarded compensatory damages under the Act after a properly executed Release and Certification Form has been returned to the Claims Office. The amount of the lump sum payment will be the greater of $150 or 5% of the Act's compensatory damages and insurance proceeds recovered by the claimant for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries (not including the lump sum payment or monies reimbursed under the Act for the purchase of flood insurance) but will not exceed $25,000. Subrogation claimants and claimants whose only Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related loss is for flood insurance premiums will not be eligible.
