(a) *Initiating arbitration.* A claimant who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Administrative Appeal may elect to submit the dispute to a binding arbitration process. A claimant may initiate arbitration by submitting a written request to the Arbitration Administrator for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Claims. Additional information regarding how to submit a written arbitration request can be found at *http://www.fema.gov/hermits-peak.* The written request for arbitration must be electronically stamped or postmarked no later than 60 days after the date that appears on the Administrative Appeal decision.


(b) *Permissible claims.* A claimant may not arbitrate an issue unless it was raised and decided in the Administrative Appeal. Arbitration will be conducted on the evidence in the Administrative Record. Evidence not previously entered into the Administrative Record will not be considered.


(c) *Selection of arbitrator.* The Arbitration Administrator will maintain a list of qualified arbitrators who have agreed to serve. The arbitration will be decided by one arbitrator if the amount in dispute is $500,000 or less and a panel of three arbitrators if the amount in dispute exceeds $500,000. Arbitrators will be assigned by the Arbitration Administrator through a random drawing.


(d) *Conduct of arbitration.* Pursuant to guidelines from the Arbitration Administrator, which will be provided directly to claimants who have filed a request for arbitration, the arbitration process will include an arbitration hearing with consideration of the claimant's written request for arbitration, the Administrative Record, and oral testimony. Hearings will generally be conducted virtually. In limited circumstances, the arbitrator may convene an in-person hearing at a location in New Mexico designated by the Arbitration Administrator.


(e) *Decision.* After a hearing and reviewing the evidence, the arbitrator(s) will render a written decision and will transmit the decision to the Arbitration Administrator, the claimant, and the Director of the Claims Office. If a panel of three arbitrators conducts the arbitration, at least two of the three arbitrators must sign the decision. The arbitrator(s) should render a decision no later than 10 Days after a hearing is concluded. The Arbitration Administrator may extend the time for a decision with notice to the claimant and the Director of the Claims Office. The decision will establish the compensation due to the claimant, if any, and the reasons therefor.


(f) *Action on arbitration decision.* The Arbitration Administrator will forward the arbitration decision to the claimant and, if additional compensation is awarded to the claimant, a Release and Certification Form. Additional compensation awarded in the arbitration will be paid to the claimant after the signed Release and Certification Form is received by the Arbitration Administrator.


(g) *Final decision.* The decision of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on all parties and will not be subject to any administrative or judicial review. The arbitrator(s) may correct clerical, typographical or computational errors as requested by the Arbitration Administrator.


(h) *Administration of arbitration.* The Arbitration Administrator oversees arbitration procedures and will resolve any procedural disputes arising in the course of the arbitration.


(i) *Expenses.* The Arbitration Administrator will pay all fees and expenses of the arbitrator(s). The claimant is responsible for any expenses they incur, including travel costs.
