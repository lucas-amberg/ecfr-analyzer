(b) States and their political subdivisions may apply to FEMA for financial assistance under the Act in a manner prescribed by Federal Regulations governing grants and cooperative agreements. Such applications must be compatible with FEMA's goals and requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) Financial contributions to States and their political subdivisions are made by FEMA based on approval of the activities and projects described in the Annual Program Paper, and/or Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement, and which are in conformance with provisions of CPG 1-3, and applicable FEMA regulations set forth in chapter 1 of this title 44, chapter 1, subchapter E, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

The presence of unavoidable circumstances, and the good faith effort of the applicant, will be considered if certain objectives are not met.
