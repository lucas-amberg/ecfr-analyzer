A sustained state of mobilization production readiness is necessary to place the United States in a defense posture which will enable the nation to defend itself against aggression in peripheral conflicts or general war involving nuclear attacks on this country. Therefore, the facilities, machine tools, production equipment, and skilled workers necessary to produce the wartime requirements of the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration shall be maintained in a state of readiness which will facilitate their immediate use or conversion in time of emergency, with especial emphasis on measures to maximize the probability of continued post-attack production of those items judged to be vital to survival and victory.
