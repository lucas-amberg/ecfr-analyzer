# § 321.3   Maintaining the mobilization base.

(a) Facilities selected to produce “urgent” items shall be maintained within limits of existing procurement authority and funds available by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration in the following manners to the maximum practical degree:


(1) Current procurement shall be placed in these facilities to the extent which will maintain them in a state of readiness compatible with the plans of the procuring agency.


(2) Machine tools and production equipment will be installed in these facilities to the extent found necessary by the procuring agency.


(3) Develop and maintain plans for alternate production capacity in case disaster destroys current facilities, such capacity to be located to the maximum extent possible away from highly concentrated industrial areas and major military installations.


(b) Other facilities selected as part of the mobilization base, shall be maintained to the fullest extent possible.


(1) Procurement agencies shall integrate current procurement with their industrial mobilization plans to the greatest possible extent with the objective of supporting the mobilization base within authorities and funds available.


(2) Data assembled on essential mobilization suppliers by the industrial mobilization planning of these agencies shall be used in planning current procurement. The policy of using contractors and facilities essential to the mobilization base is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.


(3) Planned producers that are deemed to be a part of the mobilization base will be invited to participate in appropriate current procurement.


(4) Upon expiration of current procurement contracts in a facility, the procuring agency shall take such of the following actions as are compatible with its plans for maintaining a state of readiness:


(i) *Government-owned facilities and tools.* Within the limitations that may be imposed by Congressional appropriations, place government-owned facilities and tools in standby status and establish provisions for their adequate maintenance. This does not preclude the use of government-owned production equipment, on a loan basis, to enable the military departments to meet current production schedules, as provided in DMO-VII-4, Amendment 1.


(ii) *Privately-owned facilities and government-owned tools.* (A) Arrange with management of privately-owned facilities, wherever possible, to place government-owned tools and production equipment in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe location.


(B) Arrange with management, on a voluntary basis, to keep a group of key managers, engineers, and skilled workers familiar with the items planned for mobilization production.


(C) Determine the gaps which exist in government-owned packages of tools and production equipment needed to produce mobilization requirements in privately-owned plants. Within the limit of fund availability, plan the procurement of such tools and equipment with priority being given to long lead-time tools and equipment or those not used in general manufacturing. These tools and equipment, when procured, should be placed in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe locations.


(D) Determine which government-owned tools and equipment have become obsolete, or which would not be used in event of mobilization, and plan for their disposal in accordance with the provisions of DMO-VII-4, as amended.
