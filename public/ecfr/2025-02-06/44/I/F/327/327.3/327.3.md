# ยง 327.3   Policy.

(a) *General.* (1) Primary reliance for defense production shall be placed upon private industry.


(2) When it is determined by an agency that, because of the lack of specific industrial plant equipment, private industry of the United States cannot be relied upon for needed Government production, that agency may provide to private industry such Government-owned industrial plant equipment as is deemed necessary to ensure required production capability. Requirements for such equipment should be reviewed at least annually to ascertain the continuing need, particularly with a view toward private industry furnishing the equipment for long term requirements.


(3) When it is necessary for Federal agencies to supply Government-owned industrial plant equipment to private industry, these agencies will maintain uniformity and fairness in the arrangements for the use of this equipment by following regulations for the use of such equipment as developed and published by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 809 of Public Law 93-155. The regulations to be developed by the Secretary of Defense shall be in consonance with this order. These regulations will attempt to ensure that no Government contractor is afforded an advantage over his competitors and that Government-owned industrial plant equipment is maintained properly and kept immediately available for the emergency preparedness needs of the United States.


(b) *Interagency use of idle equipment.* In any instances in which a Government contractor cannot meet Government production schedules because necessary industrial plant equipment is not available from private industry or from the contracting Federal department or agency, idle industrial plant equipment under the control of other Federal agencies may be made available for this purpose through existing authorities on a transfer, loan, or replacement basis by interagency agreement.


(c) *Availability of equipment for emergency use.* Government-owned industrial plant equipment may be provided by controlling agencies for emergency use by essential Government contractors whose facilities have been damaged or destroyed.


(d) *Uniform rental rates.* All new agreements entered into by any agency of the Federal Government under which private business establishments are provided with Government-owned industrial plant equipment shall be subject to rental rates established by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 809 of Public Law 93-155. The rental rates shall ensure a fair and equitable return to the U.S. Government and be generally competitive with commercial rates for like equipment.


(e) *Use of Government-owned industrial plant equipment for commercial* (*non-Government*) *purposes.* Subject to adequate controls being established under DOD regulations pursuant to Public Law 93-155, and statutory authority for leasing, Government-owned industrial plant equipment may be authorized for commercial use by contractors performing contracts or subcontracts for the Government agency if it is necessary to keep the equipment in a high state of operational readiness through regular usage to support the emergency preparedness programs of the U.S. Government.
