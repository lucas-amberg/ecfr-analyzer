# § 332.3   Carrying out voluntary agreements.

(a) *Purpose and scope.* This section establishes the standards and procedures by which the participants in each approved voluntary agreement shall carry out the agreement.


(b) *Participants.* The participants in each voluntary agreement shall be reasonably representative of the appropriate industry or segment of that industry.


(c) *Conduct of meetings held to carry out an agreement.* (1) The sponsor of a voluntary agreement shall initiate, or approve in advance, each meeting of the participants in the agreement held to discuss problems, determine policies, recommend actions, and make decisions necessary to carry out the agreement.


(2) The sponsor shall provide to the Attorney General, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency adequate prior notice of the time, place, and nature of each meeting, and a proposed agenda of each meeting. The sponsor shall also publish in the _Federal Register,_ reasonably in advance of each meeting, a notice of time, place, and nature of the meeting. If the sponsor has determined, pursuant to § 332.5 of this part, to limit attendance at the meeting, the sponsor shall publish this _Federal Register_ notice within ten days of the meeting.


(3) Any interested person may attend a meeting held to carry out a voluntary agreement unless the sponsor has restricted attendance pursuant to § 332.5 of this part. A person attending a meeting under this section may present oral or written data, views, and arguments to any limitations on the manner of presentation that the sponsor may impose.


(4) No meeting shall be held to carry out any voluntary agreement unless a Federal employee, other than an individual employed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3109, is in attendance. Any meeting to carry out a voluntary agreement may be attended by the sponsor of the agreement, the Attorney General, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or their delegates.


(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a meeting between a single participant and the sponsor solely to deliver or exchange information is not subject to the requirements and procedures of this section, provided that a copy of the information is promptly delivered to the Attorney General, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.


(d) *Maintenance of records.* (1) The participants in any voluntary agreement shall maintain for five years all minutes of meetings, transcripts, records, documents, and other data, including any communications among themselves or with any other member of their industry, related to the carrying out of the voluntary agreement. The participants shall agree, in writing, to make available to the sponsor, the Attorney General, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for inspection and copying at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice any item that this section requires them to maintain.


(2) Any person required by this paragraph to maintain records shall indicate specific portions, if any, that such person believes should not be disclosed to the public pursuant to § 332.5 of this part, and the reasons therefor. Any item made available to a Government official named in this paragraph shall be available from that official for public inspection and copying to the extent set forth in § 332.5 of this part.
