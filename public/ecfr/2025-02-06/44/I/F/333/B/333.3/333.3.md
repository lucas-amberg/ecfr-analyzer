# ยง 333.3   Priority ratings and rated orders.

(a) Rated orders are identified by a priority rating and a program identification symbol. Rated orders take precedence over all unrated orders as necessary to meet required delivery dates. Among rated orders, DX rated orders take precedence over DO rated orders.


(b) Persons receiving rated orders must give them preferential treatment as required by this part.


(c) All rated orders must be scheduled to the extent possible to ensure delivery by the required delivery date.


(d) Persons who receive rated orders must in turn place rated orders with their suppliers for the items they need to fill the orders. This provision ensures that suppliers will give priority treatment to rated orders from contractor to subcontractor to suppliers throughout the procurement chain.


(e) Persons may place a priority rating on orders only when they are in receipt of a rated order, have been explicitly authorized to do so by FEMA or a Delegate Agency, or are otherwise permitted to do so by this part.
