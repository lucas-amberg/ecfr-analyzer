# § 333.11   Priority ratings.

(a) *Levels of priority.* (1) There are two levels of priority established by Federal Priorities and Allocations System regulations, identified by the rating symbols “DO” and “DX.”


(2) All DO rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All DX rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over DO rated orders and unrated orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal priority, see § 333.14(c)).


(3) In addition, a Directive issued by FEMA regarding priority treatment for a given item takes preference over any DX rated order, DO rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated in the Directive. (For a full discussion of Directives, see § 333.52).


(b) *Program identification symbols.* Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. Program identification symbols, in themselves, do not connote any priority.


(c) *Priority ratings.* A priority rating consists of the rating symbol—DO or DX—and the program identification symbol.
