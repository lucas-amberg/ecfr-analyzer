# § 333.12   Elements of a rated order.

(a) *Elements required for all rated orders.* (1) The appropriate priority rating and program identification symbol;


(2) A required delivery date or dates. The words “immediately” or “as soon as possible” do not constitute a delivery date. When a “requirements contract,” “basic ordering agreement,” “prime vendor contract,” or similar procurement document bearing a priority rating contains no specific delivery date or dates, but provides for the furnishing of items from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as “calls,” “requisitions,” and “delivery orders,” the purchase orders under such contracts or agreements must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document.


(3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order. The signature, manual or digital, certifies that the rated order is authorized under this part and that the requirements of this part are being followed; and


(4) A statement that reads in substance: “This is a rated order certified for national defense use and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Emergency Management Priorities and Allocations System regulations (44 CFR part 333).”


(b) *Additional element required for certain emergency preparedness rated orders.* If a rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness requirements and expedited action is necessary or appropriate to meet these requirements, the following statement must be included in the order: “This rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness. It must be accepted or rejected pursuant to the mandatory acceptance and mandatory rejection requirements found in 44 CFR 333.13 within [Insert a time limit no less than the minimum applicable time limit specified in § 333.13(d)(2)].”


(c) *Additional elements required for rated orders issued by FEMA or a Delegate Agency to facilitate sales to third parties.* If a rated order is placed by FEMA or the Delegate Agency to facilitate a sale to a third party who desires to order the materials, the following statement must also be included in the order: “This rated order is placed for the purpose of facilitating a sale to [Insert third party] to promote the national defense. It must be accepted or rejected pursuant to the mandatory acceptance and mandatory rejection requirements found in 44 CFR 333.13 within [Insert the applicable time limit consistent with § 333.13(d)], and it is subject to the additional requirements of 44 CFR 333.19. [Third party] is responsible for satisfying the applicable terms of sale and payment. The Federal Government is not be liable for any failure to meet the terms of sale or payment. For purposes of these and any other notification requirements set forth in FEMA's Emergency Management Priorities and Allocations System regulations (44 CFR part 333), both [Insert FEMA or Delegate Agency] and [Insert third party] are the `customer.'”
