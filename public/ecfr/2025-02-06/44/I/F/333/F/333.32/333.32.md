# ยง 333.32   Controlling the general distribution of a material in the civilian market.

No allocation action by FEMA may be used to control the general distribution of a material in the civilian market unless the President, the Administrator, or another official with lawful authority under section 101(b) of the Act has made a written finding that:


(a) Such material is a scarce and critical material essential to the national defense, and


(b) The requirements of the national defense for such material cannot otherwise be met without creating a significant dislocation of the normal distribution of such material in the civilian market to such a degree as to create appreciable hardship.
