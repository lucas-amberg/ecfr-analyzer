# § 334.5   GMR system description.

The GMR system contains three stages of mobilization activity (additional intermediate GMR stages may be developed). For example, a Federal department or agency might divide “Crisis Management” into two, three, or more levels as suits its needs.


(a) *Stage 3, Planning and Preparation.* During the planning and preparation stage, Federal departments and agencies develop their GMR plans and maintain capability to carry out their mobilization-related responsibilities in accordance with section 201 of Executive Order 12656. General types of problems likely to arise in a crisis situation are identified along with possible methods for dealing with them. Investment programs can be undertaken to overcome identified problems.


(b) *Stage 2, Crisis Management.* During the crisis management stage, GMR plans are reviewed and capabilities will be re-examined in light of an actual event or crisis perceived to be emerging.


(1) Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional data on selected resources or increase their preparedness activities. Costed Option Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for the response option measures in each of the department's and agency's area of responsibility. For example, when it appears likely that increased national resources may be required, resource readiness could be improved through the procurement of essential long lead time items, especially those that can be used even if the situation does not escalate. In general, long lead time preparedness actions would be considered for implementation at this time.


(2) Many preparedness actions at this stage would be handled through reprogramming, but the Costed Option Packages may also require new funding.


(3) If the crisis worsens, and prior to the declaration of national emergency, it may be necessary to surge certain production and stockpile items for future use.


(c) *Stage 1, National Emergency/War.* During a national emergency or declaration of war, mobilization of all national resources escalates and GMR will be subsumed into the overall mobilization effort. As military requirements increase, the national resources would increasingly be focused on the national security emergency. This would involve diverting non-essential demand for scarce resources from peacetime to defense uses, and converting industry from commercial to military production. Both surge production and expansion of the nation's productive capacity may also be necessary. Supplemental appropriations may be required for most Federal departments and agencies having national security emergency responsibilities.
