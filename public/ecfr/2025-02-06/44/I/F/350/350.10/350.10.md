This meeting shall be noticed in the local newspaper with the largest circulation in the area, or other such media as the Regional Administrator may select, on at least two occasions, one of which is at least two weeks before the meeting takes place and the other is within a few days of the meeting date. Local radio and television stations should be notified of the scheduled meeting at least one week in advance.

If, in the judgment of the FEMA Regional Administrator, the public meeting or meetings reveal deficiencies in the State plan and/or the joint exercise, the Regional Administrator shall inform the State of the fact together with recommendations for improvement. No FEMA approval of State and local plans and preparedness shall be made until a meeting described in this paragraph shall have been held at or near the nuclear power facility site for which the State is seeking approval.
