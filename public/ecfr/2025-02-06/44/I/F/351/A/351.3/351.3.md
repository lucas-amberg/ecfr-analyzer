# § 351.3   Limitation of scope.

(a) This part covers Federal agency assignments and responsibilities in connection with State and local emergency plans and preparedness measures. It does not set forth criteria used in the review and approval of these plans and does not include any of the requirements associated with FEMA findings and determinations on the adequacy of State and local government radiological emergency preparedness. FEMA has published a separate rule on procedures and criteria for reviewing and approving these plans and preparedness capabilities. Furthermore, this part does not set forth Federal agency responsibilities or capabilities for *responding to an accident* at a fixed nuclear facility or a transportation accident involving radioactive materials. These responsibilities are addressed in the “Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan” (50 FR 46542, November 8, 1985).


(b) Nothing in this part authorizes access to or disclosure of classified information required to be protected in accordance with Federal law or regulation in the interest of national security.
