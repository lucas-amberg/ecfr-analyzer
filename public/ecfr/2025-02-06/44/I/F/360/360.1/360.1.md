The Emergency Management Training Program is designed to enhance the States' emergency management training program to increase State capabilities and those of local governments in this field, as well as to give States the opportunity to develop new capabilities and techniques. The Program is an ongoing intergovernmental endeavor which combines financial and human resources to fill the unique training needs of local government, State emergency staffs and State agencies, as well as the general public. States will have the opportunity to develop, implement and evaluate various approaches to accomplish FEMA emergency objectives as well as goals and objectives of their own. The intended result is an enhanced capability to protect lives and property through planning, mitigation, operational skill, and rapid response in case of disaster or attack on this country.
