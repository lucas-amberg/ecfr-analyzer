*Eligible Activities* are activities for which FEMA may provide funding to States under this section. They include specific activities or projects related to earthquake hazards reduction which fall into one or more of the following categories: Preparedness and response planning; mitigation planning and implementation, including inventories preparation, seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety; and public awareness and education. The activities that will actually be funded shall be determined through individual negotiations between FEMA and the States (see criteria in ยง 361.3(3)).


*In-kind contributions* represent the value of non-cash contributions provided by the States and other non-Federal parties.

*Target Allocation* is the maximum amount of FEMA earthquake program funds presumably available to an eligible State in a fiscal year. It is based primarily upon the total amount of State assistance funds available to FEMA annually, the number of eligible States, and a nationally standardized comparison of these States' seismic hazard and population-at-risk. The target allocation is not necessarily the amount of funding that a State will actually receive from FEMA. Rather, it represents a planning basis of negotiations between the State and its FEMA Regional Office which will ultimately determine the actual amount of earthquake State assistance to be provided by FEMA.
