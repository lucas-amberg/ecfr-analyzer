# ยง 402.6   Relation to Transportation Order T-2.

Transportation Order T-1 applies to the transportation of commodities to, or in transit to, destinations in Sub-Group A, Hong Kong or Macao. It applies, however, only to commodities on the Positive List of the Office of International Trade, arms and ammunition, and commodities controlled under the Atomic Energy Act (see section 2 of this interpretation). Transportation Order T-2 applies to the transportation of commodities of any kind which are destined to Communist China (Order T-2 also prohibits American ships and aircraft from calling at any port or place in Communist China). Since Communist China is in Sub-Group A, the restrictions of both orders apply to the transportation of commodities to Communist China or to any other point in transit to Communist China.
