# ยง 101.40   General provisions.

(a) Once a priority rating has been authorized pursuant to this part, further action by HHS is generally not needed. However, from time-to-time, production or delivery problems will arise in connection with rated orders for health resources as covered under this part. In this event, a person should immediately contact ASPR for guidance, as specified in ยง 101.93. ASPR serves as the lead policy office for emergency preparedness and response operations on behalf of HHS and manages the Department's delegated DPA authorities. If ASPR is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, ASPR may forward the request to another agency with resource jurisdiction, such as the Department of Commerce, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is provided to alleviate problems that do arise.


(b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason consistent with this part. Generally, special priorities assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or to verify information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.
