# ยง 101.55   Mandatory acceptance of an allocation order.

(a) Except as otherwise specified in this section (see paragraph (c) of this section), a person shall accept and comply with every allocation order received.


(b) A person shall not discriminate against an allocation order in any manner such as by charging higher prices for materials, services, or facilities covered by the order or by imposing terms and conditions for contracts and orders involving allocated materials, services, or facilities that differ from the person's terms and conditions for contracts and orders for the materials, services, or facilities prior to receiving the allocation order.


(c) If a person is unable to comply fully with the required action(s) specified in an allocation order, the person must notify the ASPR, as specified in ยง 101.93, immediately, explain the extent to which compliance is possible, and give the reasons why full compliance is not possible. If notification is given verbally, then written or electronic confirmation must be provided within one (1) working day. Such notification does not release the person from complying with the order to the fullest extent possible, until the person is notified by HHS that the order has been changed or cancelled.
