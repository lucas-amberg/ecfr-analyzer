# § 16.5   How the Board operates.

(a) The Board's professional staff consists of a Chair (who is also a Board member) and full- and part-time Board members, all appointed by the Secretary; and a staff of employees and consultants who are attorneys or persons from other relevant disciplines, such as accounting.

(d) The Chair will assure that no Board or staff member will participate in a case where his or her impartiality could reasonably be questioned.


(e) The Board's powers and responsibilities are set forth in § 16.13.
