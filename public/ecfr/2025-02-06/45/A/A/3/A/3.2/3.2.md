(d) In accordance with the Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. 13), whoever is found guilty of an offense which, although not made punishable by any act of Congress, nor any provision of these regulations, would be punishable if committed within the State of Maryland, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict between a provision of this part and a Maryland statute governing the identical subject matter, this part shall control.


(e) *Federal criminal statutes which apply.* The following Federal criminal statutes in the United States Code apply to Federal enclaves and elsewhere without regard to the place of the offense. This listing is provided solely for the information of the public and is not all-inclusive. The omission of other Federal statutes does not mean that such other statutes do not apply. In any given situation, the cited statutory provisions and any amendments in effect when the alleged offense occurred shall determine the specifics of the offense, applicability, and penalty.


(f) *Maryland criminal statutes that apply.* The matters described in this paragraph are governed, in whole or in part, by the current version of the cited Maryland criminal statutory provisions, which are made Federal criminal offenses under the Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. 13). This listing sets forth areas of conduct particularly relevant to the enclave and is provided solely for the information of the public. The list is not all-inclusive and omission of other Maryland criminal statutes does not mean that such other statutes are not assimilated as Federal offenses under the Act. Generally, other Maryland criminal statutes will apply on the enclave, by force of the Act, unless superseded by Federal Law or a given provision of this part. In any given situation, the cited statutory provisions and any amendments in effect when the alleged offense occured shall determine the specifics of the offense, applicability, and penalty.
