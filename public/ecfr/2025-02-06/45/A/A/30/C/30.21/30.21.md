# ยง 30.21   Scope and application.

(a) *Scope.* The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. The Secretary may exercise such compromise authority for debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Department when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000, or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General.


(b) *Application.* Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept a compromise rests with Justice. The Secretary shall evaluate the compromise offer, using the factors set forth in this subpart. If an offer to compromise any debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to the Department, the Secretary shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in Justice using a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR), which may be obtained from Justice's National Central Intake Facility. The referral shall include appropriate financial information and a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. Justice approval is not required if the Secretary rejects a compromise offer.
