# ยง 34.8   Computation of award and settlement.

(a) The amount awarded on any item of property shall not exceed the adjusted cost of the item based on the cost of replacing it with a similar one of the same quality minus the appropriate depreciation rate. The amount normally payable on property damaged beyond economical repair shall not exceed its depreciated value. If the cost of repairs is less than the depreciated value it shall be considered economically repairable and the costs of repairs shall be the amount payable. 


(b) Depreciation in value of an item shall be determined by considering the type of article involved, its replacement cost, condition when lost or damaged beyond economical repair, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of accrual of the claim. 


(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, settlements of claims under the MPCE Act are final and conclusive. The acceptance of a settlement constitutes a complete release of any claim against the United States and any employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim by reason of the same claim.
