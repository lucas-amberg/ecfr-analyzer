# ยง 46.306   Permitted research involving prisoners.

(a) Nonexempt biomedical or behavioral research conducted or supported by DHHS may involve prisoners as subjects only if:




(1) The institution responsible for the conduct of the research has certified to the Secretary that the Institutional Review Board has approved the research under ยง 46.305 of this subpart; and 


(2) In the judgment of the Secretary the proposed research involves solely the following:


(i) Study of the possible causes, effects, and processes of incarceration, and of criminal behavior, provided that the study presents no more than minimal risk and no more than inconvenience to the subjects; 


(ii) Study of prisons as institutional structures or of prisoners as incarcerated persons, provided that the study presents no more than minimal risk and no more than inconvenience to the subjects;


(iii) Research on conditions particularly affecting prisoners as a class (for example, vaccine trials and other research on hepatitis which is much more prevalent in prisons than elsewhere; and research on social and psychological problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction and sexual assaults) provided that the study may proceed only after the Secretary has consulted with appropriate experts including experts in penology medicine and ethics, and published notice, in the _Federal Register,_ of his intent to approve such research; or


(iv) Research on practices, both innovative and accepted, which have the intent and reasonable probability of improving the health or well-being of the subject. In cases in which those studies require the assignment of prisoners in a manner consistent with protocols approved by the IRB to control groups which may not benefit from the research, the study may proceed only after the Secretary has consulted with appropriate experts, including experts in penology medicine and ethics, and published notice, in the _Federal Register,_ of his intent to approve such research.

(1) For research subject to the pre-2018 Requirements and this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, biomedical or behavioral research conducted or supported by DHHS shall not involve prisoners as subjects.


(2) For research subject to the 2018 Requirements and this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section or for research that is exempt pursuant to ยง 46.104(b)(2) and (d)(1) through (8) of the 2018 Requirements, biomedical or behavioral research conducted or supported by DHHS shall not involve prisoners as subjects.
