# ยง 46.504   How must an IRB be registered?

Each IRB must be registered electronically through *http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile* unless an institution or organization lacks the ability to register its IRB(s) electronically. If an institution or organization lacks the ability to register an IRB electronically, it must send its IRB registration information in writing to OHRP.
