# ยง 5.26   How does HHS determine estimated completion dates for FOIA requests?

(a) When we provide an estimated completion date, in accordance with ยง 5.24(f) and upon request, for the processing of records that do not require consultation with another agency, we estimate the completion date on the basis of our reasonable judgment as to how long it will take to complete the request. Given the uncertainty inherent in establishing any estimate, the estimated completion date is subject to change at any time.


(b) When we provide an estimated completion date, in accordance with ยง 5.24(f) and upon request, for records that must be reviewed by another agency, our estimate may also be based on information from the other agency.
