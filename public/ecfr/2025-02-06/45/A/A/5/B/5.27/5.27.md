# ยง 5.27   How do I request expedited processing?

(a) To request expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining the basis for your need for expedited processing. You must send the request to the appropriate FOIA Officer at the address listed at *http://www.hhs.gov/foia/contacts/index.html.* You may request expedited processing when you first request records or at any time during our processing of your request or appeal.


(b) We process requests on an expedited basis whenever we determine that one or more of the following criteria exist:


(1) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or


(2) There is an urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity (this criterion applies only to those requests made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public).


(c) We will respond to your request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days of our receipt of your request to expedite. If we grant your request, the OpDiv or StaffDiv responsible for the review of the requested records will process your request as a priority, and it will be processed as soon as practicable. We will inform you if we deny your request for expedited processing and provide you with appeal rights. If you decide to appeal that denial, we will expedite our review of your appeal.


(d) If we must refer records to another agency, we will inform you and suggest that you seek expedited review from that agency.
