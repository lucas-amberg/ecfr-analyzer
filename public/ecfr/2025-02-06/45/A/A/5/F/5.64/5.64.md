# ยง 5.64   What avenues are available to me if I disagree with HHS's appeal decision?

(a) In our response letter, we notify you of your right to seek judicial review of an adverse determination as set forth in the FOIA at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). Before seeking review by a court of an adverse determination, you generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.


(b) We also inform you that the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. As referenced in ยง 5.29(b) you may contact OGIS via mail, email, or telephone for assistance.
