# § 5b.11   Exempt systems.

(a) *General policy.* The Act permits certain types of specific systems of records to be exempt from some of its requirements. It is the policy of the Department to exercise authority to exempt systems of records only in compelling cases. 


(b) *Specific systems of records exempted.* (1) Those systems of records listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are exempt from the following provisions of the Act and this part: 


(i) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and paragraph (c)(2) of § 5b.9 of this part which require a subject individual to be granted access to an accounting of disclosures of a record. 


(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) (1) through (4) and (f) and §§ 5b.6, 5b.7, and 5b.8 of this part relating to notification of or access to records and correction or amendment of records.

An individual shall make requests for notification of or access to a record in an exempt system of records in accordance with the procedures of §§ 5b.5 and 5b.6 of this part. 


(2) An individual will be granted notification of or access to a record in an exempt system but only to the extent such notification or access would not reveal the identity of a source who furnished the record to the Department under an express promise, and prior to September 27, 1975 an implied promise, that his identity would be held in confidence, if: 


(i) The record is in a system of records which is exempt under subsection (k)(2) of the Act and the individual has been, as a result of the maintenance of the record, denied a right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be eligible; or,

(d) *Discretionary actions by the responsible Department official.* Unless disclosure of a record to the general public is otherwise prohibited by law, the responsible Department official may in his discretion grant notification of or access to a record in a system of records which is exempt under paragraph (b) of this section.
