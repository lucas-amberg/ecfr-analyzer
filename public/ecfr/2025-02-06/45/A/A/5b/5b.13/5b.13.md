# § 5b.13   Fees.

(a) *Policy.* Where applicable, fees for copying records will be charged in accordance with the schedule set forth in this section. Fees may only be charged where an individual requests that a copy be made of the record to which he is granted access. No fee may be charged for making a search of the system of records whether the search is manual, mechanical, or electronic. Where a copy of the record must be made in order to provide access to the record (*e.g.,* computer printout where no screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to the individual without cost. Where a medical record is made available to a representative designated by the individual or to a physician or health professional designated by a parent or guardian under § 5b.6 of this part, no fee will be charged. 


(b) *Fee schedule.* The fee schedule for the Department is as follows: 


(1) Copying of records susceptible to photocopying—$.10 per page. 


(2) Copying records not susceptible to photocopying (*e.g.,* punch cards or magnetic tapes)—at actual cost to be determined on a case-by-case basis. 


(3) No charge will be made if the total amount of copying does not exceed $25.
