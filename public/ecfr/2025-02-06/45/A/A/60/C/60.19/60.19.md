# § 60.19   Fees applicable to requests for information.

(a) *Policy on fees.* The fees described in this section apply to all requests for information from the NPDB. The amount of such fees will be sufficient to recover the full costs of operating the NPDB. The actual fees will be announced by the Secretary in periodic notices in the _Federal Register._ However, for purposes of verification and dispute resolution at the time the report is accepted, the NPDB will provide a copy—at the time a report has been submitted, automatically, without a request and free of charge, of the record to the health care practitioner, entity, provider, or supplier who is the subject of the report and to the reporter.


(b) *Criteria for determining the fee.* The amount of each fee will be determined based on the following criteria:


(1) Direct and indirect personnel costs, including salaries and fringe benefits such as medical insurance and retirement,


(2) Physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs (including materials and supplies, utilities, insurance, travel, and rent and depreciation on land, buildings, and equipment),


(3) Agency management and supervisory costs,


(4) Costs of enforcement, research, and establishment of regulations and guidance,


(5) Use of electronic data processing equipment to collect and maintain information—the actual cost of the service, including computer search time, runs and printouts, and


(6) Any other direct or indirect costs related to the provision of services.


(c) *Assessing and collecting fees.* The Secretary will announce through notice in the _Federal Register_ from time to time the methods of payment of NPDB fees. In determining these methods, the Secretary will consider efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience for the NPDB users and the Department. Methods may include: credit card, electronic fund transfer, and other methods of electronic payment.
