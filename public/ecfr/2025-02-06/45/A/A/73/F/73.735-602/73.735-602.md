# ยง 73.735-602   Permissible activities.

(a) Section 7324 of Title 5, United States Code, provides that employees have the right to vote as they please and to express their opinions on political subjects and candidates. Generally, however, employees are prohibited from taking an active part in political management or political campaigns or using official authority or influence to interfere with an election or affect its results. There are some exemptions from the restrictions of the statute: 


(1) Employees may engage in political activity in connection with any question not specifically identified with a national or State political party. They also may engage in political activity in connection with an election, if none of the candidates represents a party any of whose candidates for presidential elector received votes at the last preceding election at which presidential electors were selected. 


(2) An exception relates to political campaigns within, or in communities adjacent to, the District of Columbia, or in communities the majority of whose voters are employees of the Federal government. Communities to which the exception applies are specifically designated by the Office of Personnel Management. Information regarding the localities and the conditions under which the exceptions are granted may be obtained from personnel offices or the Department Counselor or deputy counselors. 


(b) A covered employee is permitted to: 


(1) Register and vote in any election; 


(2) Express his or her opinion as an individual citizen privately and publicly on political subjects and candidates; 


(3) Display a political picture, sticker, badge or button; 


(4) Participate in the nonpartisan activities of a civic, community, social, labor, or professional organization, or of a similar organization; 


(5) Be a member of a political party or other political organization and participate in its activities to the extent consistent with law; 


(6) Attend a political convention, rally, fund raising function; or other political gathering; 


(7) Sign a political petition as an individual citizen; 


(8) Make a financial contribution to a political party organization; 


(9) Take an active part, as an independent candidate, or support of an independent candidate, in a partisan election in localities identified as permissible for such activities by the Office of Personnel Management; 


(10) Take an active part, as a candidate or in support of a candidate, in a nonpartisan election; 


(11) Be politically active in connection with a question which is not specifically identified with a political party, such as a constitutional amendment, referendum, approval of a municipal ordinance or any other question or issue of a similar character;


(12) Serve as an election judge or clerk, or in a similar position to perform nonpartisan duties as prescribed by State or local law; and 


(13) Otherwise participate fully in public affairs, except as prohibited by law, in a manner which does not materially compromise his or her efficiency or integrity as an employee or the neutrality, efficiency, or integrity of his or her agency.


(c) The head of a principal operating component may prohibit or limit the participation of an employee or class of employees of his or her component in an activity permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, if participation in the activity would interfere with the efficient performance of official duties, or create a conflict or apparent conflict of interest.
