# ยง 73.735-707   Holding office in professional societies.

(a) Employees may be members of professional societies and be elected or appointed to office in such a society. Activity in professional associations is generally desirable from the point of view of both the Department and the employee. Employees shall avoid, however, any real or apparent conflict of interest in connection with such membership. For example, they must not:


(1) Directly or indirectly commit the Department or any portion of it on any matter unless such action is taken in an official capacity;


(2) Permit their names to be attached to documents the distribution of which would be likely to embarrass the Department; or


(3) Serve in capacities involving them as representatives of non-Government organizations in dealing with the Government.


(b) In undertaking any office or function beyond ordinary membership in a professional association, a Department employee must obtain advance approval in accordance with ยง 73.735-708 of this subpart in any situation in which his or her responsibilities as an officer would relate to his or her official duties or would create a real or apparent conflict of interest with responsibilities as a Department employee. For example, advance administrative approval must be obtained:


(1) Before an employee who is responsible for review and approval of grants or contracts, or is in a supervisory position over those who conduct review and approval, may hold office, or be a trustee or member of the governing board, or the chairman or member of a committee, in any organization which has or is seeking a grant or contract with the bureau or comparable organizational unit in which he or she is employed;


(2) Before an employee may hold office in an organization which customarily expresses publicly views on matters of legislative or administrative policy within the specific areas of concern to the Department.
