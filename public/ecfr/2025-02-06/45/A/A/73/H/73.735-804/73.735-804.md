# § 73.735-804   Waiver of the prohibitions in this subpart.

(a) An employee may request approval to participate in his or her official capacity in a matter in which he or she has a direct or indirect financial interest if the employee believes the interest is so remote and inconsequential that it would not affect the integrity of his or her official duties. Also an employee who has a financial interest that would otherwise be prohibited under these regulations may request an exemption from the prohibition for the reason stated in the preceding sentence.


(b) The request shall be in writing and shall include the following information:


(1) Employee's name, occupational title, grade or rank and Federal salary;


(2) Full description of financial interest: including whether ownership, service as officer, partner, etc.;


(3) Business or activity in which financial interest exists;


(4) Description of official matter in which employee is requesting approval to participate; 


(5) Basis for requesting determination that the interest is “not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect.” (If based on a small total value of investment, supply appropriate information on total value, such as total shares held and latest quoted market price. If other basis, explain fully.)
