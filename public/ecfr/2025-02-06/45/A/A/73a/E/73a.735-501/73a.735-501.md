(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this part permitting employees to hold financial interests in organizations subject to FDA regulation, an employee holding such an interest shall not participate in an official matter whose outcome would have a direct and predictable effect on his financial interest. However, this prohibition is not applicable to:

Any determination to authorize such exceptions shall be made in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) and documented for public inspection in accordance with ยง 73a.735-504.
