# Appendix XII to Part 75—Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters


If the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies exceeds $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of this Federal award, then you as the recipient during that period of time must maintain the currency of information reported to the System for Award Management (SAM) that is made available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) about civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings described in paragraph 2 of this award term and condition. This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.


Submit the information required about each proceeding that:


a. Is in connection with the award or performance of a grant, cooperative agreement, or procurement contract from the Federal Government;


b. Reached its final disposition during the most recent five year period; and


c. If one of the following:


(1) A criminal proceeding that resulted in a conviction, as defined in paragraph 5 of this award term and condition;


(2) A civil proceeding that resulted in a finding of fault and liability and payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more;


(3) An administrative proceeding, as defined in paragraph 5 of this award term and condition, that resulted in a finding of fault and liability and your payment of either a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more or reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000; or


(4) Any other criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding if:


(i) It could have led to an outcome described in paragraph 2.c.(1), (2), or (3) of this award term and condition;


(ii) It had a different disposition arrived at by consent or compromise with an acknowledgement of fault on your part; and


(iii) The requirement in this award term and condition to disclose information about the proceeding does not conflict with applicable laws and regulations.


Enter in the SAM Entity Management area the information that SAM requires about each proceeding described in paragraph 2 of this award term and condition. You do not need to submit the information a second time under assistance awards that you received if you already provided the information through SAM because you were required to do so under Federal procurement contracts that you were awarded.


During any period of time when you are subject to this requirement in paragraph 1 of this award term and condition, you must report proceedings information through SAM for the most recent five year period, either to report new information about any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to report. Recipients that have Federal contract, grant, and cooperative agreement awards with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 must disclose semiannually any information about the criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings.


For purposes of this award term and condition:


a. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (*e.g.*, Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.


b. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea, and includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere.


c. Total value of currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts includes—


(1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost share or match; and


(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even if not yet exercised
