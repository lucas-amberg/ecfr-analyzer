# § 75.100   Purpose.

(a)(1) This part establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards to non-Federal entities, as described in § 75.101. HHS awarding agencies must not impose additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in §§ 75.102 and 75.210, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive Order.


(2) This part provides the basis for a systematic and periodic collection and uniform submission by Federal agencies of information on all Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It also establishes Federal policies related to the delivery of this information to the public, including through the use of electronic media. It prescribes the manner in which General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and Federal agencies that administer Federal financial assistance programs are to carry out their statutory responsibilities under the Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101-6106).


(b) *Administrative requirements.* Subparts B through D of this part set forth the uniform administrative requirements for grant and cooperative agreements, including the requirements for HHS awarding agency management of Federal grant programs before the Federal award has been made, and the requirements HHS awarding agencies may impose on non-Federal entities in the Federal award.


(c) *Cost principles.* Subpart E of this part establishes principles for determining the allowable costs incurred by non-Federal entities under Federal awards. The principles are for the purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of Federal Government participation in the financing of a particular program or project. The principles are designed to provide that Federal awards bear their fair share of cost recognized under these principles except where restricted or prohibited by statute.


(d) *Single audit requirements and audit follow-up.* Subpart F of this part is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). It sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards. These provisions also provide the policies and procedures for HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities when using the results of these audits.
