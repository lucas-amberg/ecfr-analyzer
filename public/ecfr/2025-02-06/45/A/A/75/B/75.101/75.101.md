# § 75.101   Applicability.

(a) *General applicability to Federal agencies.* The requirements established in this part apply to Federal agencies that make Federal awards to non-Federal entities. These requirements are applicable to all costs related to Federal awards.


(b)(1) *Applicability to different types of Federal awards.* The following table describes what portions of this part apply to which types of Federal awards. The terms and conditions of Federal-awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise. This means that non-Federal entities must comply with requirements in this part regardless of whether the non-Federal entity is a recipient or subrecipient of a Federal award. Pass-through entities must comply with the requirements described in subpart D of this part, §§ 75.351 through 75.353, but not any requirements in this part directed towards Federal awarding agencies unless the requirements of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award indicate otherwise. This table must be read along with the other provisions in this section




(2) *Federal award of cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR to a non-Federal entity.* When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract, only subpart D of this part §§ 75.351 through 75.353 (in addition to any FAR related requirements for subaward monitoring), subpart E of this part and subpart F of this part are incorporated by reference into the contract. However, when the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract, they take precedence over the requirements of this part except for subpart F of this part when they are in conflict. In addition, costs that are made unallowable under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) as described in the FAR subpart 31.2 and subpart 31.603 are always unallowable. For requirements other than those covered in subpart D of this part, §§ 75.351 through 75.353, subpart E of this part and subpart F of this part, the terms of the contract and the FAR apply.


(3) With the exception of subpart F of this part, which is required by the Single Audit Act, in any circumstances where the provisions of Federal statutes or regulations differ from the provisions of this part, the provision of the Federal statutes or regulations govern. This includes, for agreements with Indian tribes, the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450-458ddd-2.


(c) HHS awarding agencies may apply subparts A through E of this part to Federal agencies (see § 75.217), for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations, except where the HHS awarding agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the statutes or regulations of a foreign government.


(d) Except for §§ 75.202 and 75.351 through 75.353 of subpart D of this part, the requirements in subpart C of this part, subpart D of this part, and subpart E of this part do not apply to the following programs:


(1) The block grant awards authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (including Community Services), except to the extent that subpart E of this part apply to subrecipients of Community Services Block Grant funds pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9916(a)(1)(B);
