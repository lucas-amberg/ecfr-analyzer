# § 75.201   Use of grant agreements (including fixed amount awards), cooperative agreements, and contracts.

(a) The HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity must decide on the appropriate instrument for the Federal award (*i.e.,* grant agreement, cooperative agreement, or contract) in accordance with the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08).


(b) Fixed Amount Awards. In addition to the options described in paragraph (a) of this section, HHS awarding agencies, or pass-through entities as permitted in § 75.353, may use fixed amount awards (see § 75.2 *Fixed amount awards*) to which the following conditions apply:


(1) The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles (or other pricing information) as a guide. The HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may use fixed amount awards if the project scope is specific and if adequate cost, historical, or unit pricing data is available to establish a fixed amount award based on a reasonable estimate of actual cost. Payments are based on meeting specific requirements of the Federal award. Accountability is based on performance and results. Except in the case of termination before completion of the Federal award, there is no governmental review of the actual costs incurred by the non-Federal entity in performance of the award. Some of the ways in which the Federal award may be paid include, but are not limited to:


(i) In several partial payments, the amount of each agreed upon in advance, and the “milestone” or event triggering the payment also agreed upon in advance, and set forth in the Federal award;


(ii) On a unit price basis, for a defined unit or units, at a defined price or prices, agreed to in advance of performance of the Federal award and set forth in the Federal award; or,


(iii) In one payment at Federal award completion.


(2) A fixed amount award cannot be used in programs which require mandatory cost sharing or match.


(3) The non-Federal entity must certify in writing to the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity at the end of the Federal award that the project or activity was completed or the level of effort was expended. If the required level of activity or effort was not carried out, the amount of the Federal award must be adjusted.


(4) Periodic reports may be established for each Federal award.


(5) Changes in principal investigator, project leader, project partner, or scope of effort must receive the prior written approval of the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity.
