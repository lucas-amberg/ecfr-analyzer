# ยง 75.217   Special provisions for awards to Federal agencies.

(a) In order for an HHS awarding agency to make a Federal award to a Federal agency, the HHS awarding agency must have statutory authority that makes such Federal agency explicitly eligible for a Federal award.


(b) All provisions of this part and other HHS regulations apply to Federal entities receiving Federal awards, except for the following:


(1) Except for grants for research, any program income earned by a Federal institution must be used under the deduction alternative. Any program income earned after the end of grant support should be returned to the United States Treasury.


(2) No salary or fringe benefit payments may be made from HHS awarding agency grant funds to support career, career-conditional, or other Federal employees (civilian or uniformed services) without permanent appointments at a Federal institution receiving a grant. While the level of effort required for the project must be allowed by the recipient as part of each individual's official duties, salary costs associated with an individual participating in an official capacity as a Federal employee under a grant to that Federal institution are not allowable costs under an HHS awarding agency grant.


(3) Federal agencies may not be reimbursed for indirect costs under Federal awards.
