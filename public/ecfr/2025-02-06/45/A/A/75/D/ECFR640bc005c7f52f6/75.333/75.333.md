# § 75.333   HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity review.

(a) The non-Federal entity must make available, upon request of the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity believes such review is needed to ensure that the item or service specified is the one being proposed for acquisition. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the non-Federal entity desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.


(b) The non-Federal entity must make available upon request, for the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity pre-procurement review, procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates, when:


(1) The non-Federal entity's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part;


(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation;


(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, specifies a “brand name” product;


(4) The proposed contract is more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or


(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.


(c) The non-Federal entity is exempt from the pre-procurement review in paragraph (b) of this section if the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this part.


(1) The non-Federal entity may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews must occur where there is continuous high-dollar funding, and third party contracts are awarded on a regular basis;


(2) The non-Federal entity may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification must not limit the HHS awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, the HHS awarding agency may rely on written assurances from the non-Federal entity that it is complying with these standards. The non-Federal entity must cite specific policies, procedures, regulations, or standards as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review.
