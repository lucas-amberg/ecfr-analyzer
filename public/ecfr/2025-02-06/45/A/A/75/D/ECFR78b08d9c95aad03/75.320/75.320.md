(a) *Title.* Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity. Unless a statute specifically authorizes the Federal agency to vest title in the non-Federal entity without further obligation to the Federal Government, and the Federal agency elects to do so, the title must be a conditional title. Title must vest in the non-Federal entity subject to the following conditions:


(1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance, or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.


(2) Not encumber the property without approval of the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity.


(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of this section.


(b) A state must use, manage and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures. Other non-Federal entities must follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.


(c) *Use.* (1) Equipment must be used by the non-Federal entity in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by the Federal award, and the non-Federal entity must not encumber the property without prior approval of the HHS awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities supported by the HHS awarding agency, in the following order of priority:


(i) Activities under a Federal award from the HHS awarding agency which funded the original program or project, then


(ii) Activities under Federal awards from other HHS awarding agencies. This includes consolidated equipment for information technology systems.


(2) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the non-Federal entity must also make the equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, provided that such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use must be given to other programs or projects supported by the HHS awarding agency that financed the equipment and second preference must be given to programs or projects under Federal awards from other Federal awarding agencies. Use for non-federally-funded programs or projects is also permissible. User fees should be considered if appropriate.


(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in ยง 75.307 to earn program income, the non-Federal entity must not use equipment acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services unless specifically authorized by Federal statute for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.


(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the non-Federal entity may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property subject to the approval of the HHS awarding agency.


(d) *Management requirements.* Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part under a Federal award, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:


(1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of funding for the property (including the FAIN), who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the project costs for the Federal award under which the property was acquired, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property.


(2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.


(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft must be investigated.


(4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.


(5) If the non-Federal entity is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.


(e) *Disposition.* When original or replacement equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a HHS awarding agency, except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or HHS awarding agency disposition instructions, the non-Federal entity must request disposition instructions from the HHS awarding agency if required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as follows, in accordance with HHS awarding agency disposition instructions:


(1) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or less may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the HHS awarding agency.


(2) Except as provided in ยง 75.319(b), or if the HHS awarding agency fails to provide requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current per-unit fair-market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained by the non-Federal entity or sold. The HHS awarding agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the HHS awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase. If the equipment is sold, the HHS awarding agency may permit the non-Federal entity to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for its selling and handling expenses.


(3) The non-Federal entity may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the non-Federal entity must be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.


(4) In cases where a non-Federal entity fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the HHS awarding agency may direct the non-Federal entity to take disposition actions.
