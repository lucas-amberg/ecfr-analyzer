# § 75.373   Notification of termination requirement.

(a) The HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity must provide to the non-Federal entity a notice of termination.


(b) If the Federal award is terminated for the non-Federal entity's material failure to comply with the Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award, the notification must state that—


(1) The termination decision will be reported to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS);


(2) The information will be available in the OMB-designated integrity and performance system for a period of five years from the date of the termination, then archived;


(3) HHS awarding agencies that consider making a Federal award to the non-Federal entity during that five year period must consider that information in judging whether the non-Federal entity is qualified to receive the Federal award, when the Federal share of the Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;


(4) The non-Federal entity may comment on any information the OMB-designated integrity and performance system contains about the non-Federal entity for future consideration by HHS awarding agencies. The non-Federal entity may submit comments to the awardee integrity and performance portal accessible through SAM (currently CPARS).


(5) Federal awarding agencies will consider non-Federal entity comments when determining whether the non-Federal entity is qualified for a future Federal award.


(c) Upon termination of a Federal award, the HHS awarding agency must provide the information required under FFATA to the Federal Web site established to fulfill the requirements of FFATA, and update or notify any other relevant government-wide systems or entities of any indications of poor performance as required by 41 U.S.C. 417b and 31 U.S.C. 3321 and implementing guidance at 2 CFR part 77 (forthcoming at time of publication). See also the requirements for Suspension and Debarment at 2 CFR part 180.
