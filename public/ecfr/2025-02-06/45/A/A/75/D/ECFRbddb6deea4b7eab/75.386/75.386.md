The HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity must make any cost disallowance determination and notify the non-Federal entity within the record retention period.

(4) Property management and disposition requirements in §§ 75.317 through 75.323.


(5) Records retention as required in §§ 75.361 through 75.365.


(b) After closeout of the Federal award, a relationship created under the Federal award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity and the non-Federal entity, provided the responsibilities of the non-Federal entity referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the non-Federal entity, as appropriate.
