Relocation costs are allowable, subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, provided that:


(1) The move is for the benefit of the employer.


(2) Reimbursement to the employee is in accordance with an established written policy consistently followed by the employer.


(3) The reimbursement does not exceed the employee's actual (or reasonably estimated) expenses.


(b) Allowable relocation costs for current employees are limited to the following:


(1) The costs of transportation of the employee, members of his or her immediate family and his household, and personal effects to the new location.


(2) The costs of finding a new home, such as advance trips by employees and spouses to locate living quarters and temporary lodging during the transition period, up to maximum period of 30 calendar days.


(3) Closing costs, such as brokerage, legal, and appraisal fees, incident to the disposition of the employee's former home. These costs, together with those described in (4), are limited to 8 per cent of the sales price of the employee's former home.


(4) The continuing costs of ownership (for up to six months) of the vacant former home after the settlement or lease date of the employee's new permanent home, such as maintenance of buildings and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, and property insurance.
