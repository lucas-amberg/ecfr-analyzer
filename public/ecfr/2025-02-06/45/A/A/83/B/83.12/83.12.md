(1) Prominently include a statement of its policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in each announcement, bulletin, catalogue, or application form which describes the training program of such entity or is used in connection with the recruitment of employees who will work directly with applicants for or students enrolled in a training program; 


(2) Distribute without discrimination on the basis of sex any announcements, bulletins, catalogues, or other materials used in connection with the recruitment of students for a training program or employees who will work directly with applicants for such program or such students; and
