# § 84.1   Purpose and broad coverage.

(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of this part is to implement section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.


(b) *Broad coverage.* The definition of “disability” in this part shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of section 504. The primary object of attention in cases brought under section 504 should be whether entities receiving Federal financial assistance have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of “disability.” The question of whether an individual meets the definition of “disability” under this part should not demand extensive analysis.
