# § 84.77   General.

(a)(1) A recipient shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with applicants, participants, members of the public, and companions with disabilities are as effective as communications with others.


(2) For purposes of this section, *companion* means a family member, friend, or associate of an individual seeking access to a program or activity of a recipient, who, along with such individual, is an appropriate person with whom the recipient should communicate.


(b)(1) The recipient shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford qualified individuals with disabilities, including applicants, participants, beneficiaries, companions, and members of the public, an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity of a recipient.


(2) The type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to ensure effective communication will vary in accordance with the method of communication used by the individual; the nature, length, and complexity of the communication involved; and the context in which the communication is taking place. In determining what types of auxiliary aids and services are necessary, a recipient shall give primary consideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities. In order to be effective, auxiliary aids and services must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and in such a way as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual with a disability.


(c)(1) A recipient shall not require an individual with a disability to bring another individual to interpret for him or her.


(2) A recipient shall not rely on an adult accompanying an individual with a disability to interpret or facilitate communication except—


(i) In an emergency involving an imminent threat to the safety or welfare of an individual or the public where there is no interpreter available; or


(ii) When the individual with a disability specifically requests that the accompanying adult interpret or facilitate communication, the accompanying adult agrees to provide such assistance, and reliance on that adult for such assistance is appropriate under the circumstances.


(3) A recipient shall not rely on a minor child to interpret or facilitate communication, except in an emergency involving an imminent threat to the safety or welfare of an individual or the public when there is no interpreter available.


(d) When the recipient chooses to provide qualified interpreters via video remote interpreting services (VRI), it shall ensure that it provides—


(1) Real-time, full-motion video and audio over a dedicated high-speed, wide-bandwidth video connection or wireless connection that delivers high-quality video images that do not produce lags, choppy, blurry, or grainy images, or irregular pauses in communication;


(2) A sharply delineated image that is large enough to display the interpreter's face, arms, hands, and fingers, and the participating individual's face, arms, hands, and fingers, regardless of their body position;


(3) A clear, audible transmission of voices; and


(4) Adequate training to users of the technology and other involved individuals so that they may quickly and efficiently set up and operate the VRI.
