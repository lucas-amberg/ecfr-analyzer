# ยง 84.91   Requirements for medical diagnostic equipment.

No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of the programs or activities of a recipient offered through or with the use of medical diagnostic equipment (MDE), or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance because the recipient's MDE is not readily accessible to or usable by persons with disabilities.
