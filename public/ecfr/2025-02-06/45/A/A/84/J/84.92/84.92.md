# § 84.92   Newly purchased, leased, or otherwise acquired medical diagnostic equipment.

(a) *Requirements for all newly purchased, leased, or otherwise acquired medical diagnostic equipment.* All MDE that recipients purchase, lease (including via lease renewals), or otherwise acquire more than July 8, 2024, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in this section, meet the Standards for Accessible MDE, unless and until the recipient satisfies the scoping requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Scoping requirements*—(1) *General requirement for medical diagnostic equipment.* Where a program or activity of a recipient, including physicians' offices, clinics, emergency rooms, hospitals, outpatient facilities, and multi-use facilities, utilizes MDE, at least 10 percent of the total number of units, but no fewer than one unit, of each type of equipment in use must meet the Standards for Accessible MDE.


(2) *Facilities that specialize in treating conditions that affect mobility.* In rehabilitation facilities that specialize in treating conditions that affect mobility, outpatient physical therapy facilities, and other programs or activities that specialize in treating conditions that affect mobility, at least 20 percent, but no fewer than one unit, of each type of equipment in use must meet the Standards for Accessible MDE.


(3) *Facilities with multiple departments.* In any facility or program with multiple departments, clinics, or specialties, where a program or activity uses MDE, the facility shall disperse the accessible MDE required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section in a manner that is proportionate by department, clinic, or specialty using MDE.


(c) *Requirements for examination tables and weight scales.* Within 2 years after July 8, 2024, recipients shall, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in this section, purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire the following, unless the recipient already has them in place:


(1) At least one examination table that meets the Standards for Accessible MDE, if the recipient uses at least one examination table; and


(2) At least one weight scale that meets the Standards for Accessible MDE, if the recipient uses at least one weight scale.


(d) *Equivalent facilitation.* Nothing in this section prevents the use of designs, products, or technologies as alternatives to those prescribed by the Standards for Accessible MDE, provided they result in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability of the program or activity. The responsibility for demonstrating equivalent facilitation rests with the recipient.


(e) *Fundamental alteration and undue burdens.* This section does not require a recipient to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity, or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where personnel of the recipient believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, a recipient has the burden of proving that compliance with paragraph (a) or (c) of this section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the head of a recipient or their designee after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, a recipient shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by the recipient.


(f) *Diagnostically required structural or operational characteristics.* A recipient meets its burden of proving that compliance with paragraph (a) or (c) of this section would result in a fundamental alteration under paragraph (e) of this section if it demonstrates that compliance with paragraph (a) or (c) would alter diagnostically required structural or operational characteristics of the equipment, and prevent the use of the equipment for its intended diagnostic purpose. This paragraph (f) does not excuse compliance with other technical requirements where compliance with those requirements does not prevent the use of the equipment for its diagnostic purpose.
