# ยง 86.3   Remedial and affirmative action and self-evaluation.

(a) *Remedial action.* If the Director finds that a recipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, such recipient shall take such remedial action as the Director deems necessary to overcome the effects of such discrimination.

(2) Modify any of these policies and practices which do not or may not meet the requirements of this part; and 


(3) Take appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any discrimination which resulted or may have resulted from adherence to these policies and practices. 


(d) *Availability of self-evaluation and related materials.* Recipients shall maintain on file for at least three years following completion of the evaluation required under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall provide to the Director upon request, a description of any modifications made pursuant to paragraph (c) (2) of this section and of any remedial steps taken pursuant to paragraph (c) (3) of this section.
