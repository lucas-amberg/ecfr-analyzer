# ยง 90.32   Review of agency policies and administrative practices.

(a) Each agency shall conduct a review of age distinctions it imposes on its recipients by regulations, policies, and administrative practices. The purpose of this review is to identify how age distinctions are used by each Federal agency and whether those age distinctions are permissible under the Act and implementing regulations.


(b) No later than 12 months from the date the agency published its final regulations, the agency shall publish, for public comment, a report in the _Federal Register_ containing:


(1) The results of the review conducted under paragraph (a) of this section;


(2) A list of the age distinctions contained in regulations which are to be continued;


(3) The justification under the requirements of the Act and these regulations for each age distinction to be continued;


(4) A list of the age distinctions not contained in regulations but which will be adopted by regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act using the notice and comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553; and


(5) A list of the age distinctions to be eliminated. 


(c) Beginning with the effective date of an agency's final regulations, the agency may not impose a new age distinction unless the age distinction is adopted by regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act using the notice and comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553. 


(d) Beginning 12 months after the publication of its age discrimination regulations, an agency may not continue an existing age distinction, unless the age distinction has already been adopted by regulation or is adopted by regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act using the notice and comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553.
