HHS may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.


(3) HHS will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official at HHS.


(4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of HHS, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.
