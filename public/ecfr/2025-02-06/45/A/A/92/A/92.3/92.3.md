# ยง 92.3   Relationship to other laws.

(a) Neither section 1557 nor this part shall be construed to apply a lesser standard for the protection of individuals from discrimination than the standards applied under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, or the regulations issued pursuant to those laws.


(b) Nothing in this part shall be construed to invalidate or limit the rights, remedies, procedures, or legal standards available under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Age Discrimination Act of 1975.


(c) Insofar as the application of any requirement under this part would violate applicable Federal protections for religious freedom and conscience, such application shall not be required. For example, 42 U.S.C. 18023 provides (among other things) that nothing in section 1557 shall be construed to have any effect on Federal laws regarding conscience protection; willingness or refusal to provide abortion; and discrimination on the basis of the willingness or refusal to provide, pay for, cover, or refer for abortion or to provide or participate in training to provide abortion.


(d) Nothing in this part shall be construed to supersede State or local laws that provide additional protections against discrimination on any basis described in ยง 92.1.
