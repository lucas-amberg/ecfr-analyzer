(a) *Remedial action.* (1) If the Director finds that a recipient or State Exchange has discriminated against an individual on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability, in violation of section 1557 or this part, such recipient or State Exchange must take such remedial action as the Director may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination.


(2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against an individual on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability, in violation of section 1557 or this part, and where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, the Director, where appropriate, may require either or both entities to take remedial action.

(b) *Voluntary action.* A covered entity may take nondiscriminatory steps, in addition to any action that is required by section 1557 or this part, to overcome the effects of conditions that result or resulted in limited participation in the covered entity's health programs or activities by persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability.
