# § 92.304   Procedures for health programs and activities administered by the Department.

(a) The procedural provisions applicable to section 504 shall apply with respect to administrative enforcement actions against the Department, including Federally-facilitated Exchanges, concerning discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, or any combination thereof, under section 1557 or this part. These procedures are found at 45 CFR 85.61 and 85.62. Where this section cross-references regulatory provisions that use the term “handicap,” the term “race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability, or any combination thereof,” shall apply in its place.


(b) The Department must permit access by OCR to its books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with section 1557 or this part. Where any information required of the Department is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person, and the other agency, institution or person fails or refuses to furnish this information, the Department shall so certify and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information. Asserted considerations of privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar OCR from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance with section 1557 or this part. Information of a confidential nature obtained in connection with compliance evaluation or enforcement shall not be disclosed except where necessary under the law.


(c) The Department must not intimidate, threaten, coerce, retaliate, or otherwise discriminate against any individual or entity for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 1557 or this part, or because such individual or entity has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under section 1557 or this part. The identity of complainants must be kept confidential by OCR in accordance with applicable Federal law.
