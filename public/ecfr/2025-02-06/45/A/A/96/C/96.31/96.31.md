# § 96.31   Audits.

(a) *Basic rule.* Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of State, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.” The audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted Government auditing standards covering financial audits.


(b) *Subgrantees.* State or local governments, as those terms are defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, expending $300,000 or more (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year, shall:


(1) Determine whether subgrantees have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental organizations) providing goods and services to State and local governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;


(2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance with the Act or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;


(3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in instances of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;


(4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the grantee's own records; and


(5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements.
