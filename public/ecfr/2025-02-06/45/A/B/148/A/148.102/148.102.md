(a) *Scope and applicability.* (1) Individual health insurance coverage includes all health insurance coverage (as defined in § 144.103 of this subchapter) that is neither health insurance coverage sold in connection with an employment-related group health plan, nor short-term, limited-duration coverage as defined in § 144.103 of this subchapter.


(2) The requirements that pertain to guaranteed renewability for all individuals, to protections for mothers and newborns with respect to hospital stays in connection with childbirth, and to protections against discrimination based on genetic information apply to all issuers of individual health insurance coverage in the State.


(b) *Applicability dates.* Except as provided in §§ 148.124, 148.170, and 148.180, the requirements of this part apply to health insurance coverage offered, sold, issued, renewed, in effect, or operated in the individual market after June 30, 1997. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for short-term, limited-duration insurance sold or issued on or after September 1, 2024, the definition of *short-term, limited-duration insurance* in § 144.103 of this subchapter applies for coverage periods beginning on or after September 1, 2024. For short-term, limited-duration insurance sold or issued before September 1, 2024 (including any subsequent renewal or extension consistent with applicable law), the definition of *short-term, limited-duration insurance* in 45 CFR 144.103, revised as of October 1, 2023, continues to apply, except that paragraph (1)(ii) of the definition of *short-term, limited-duration insurance* in § 144.103 applies for coverage periods beginning on or after September 1, 2024.
