The good faith estimate must include a disclaimer directly above this list that includes the following information: Separate good faith estimates will be issued to an uninsured (or self-pay) individual upon scheduling or upon request of the listed items or services; notification that for items or services included in this list, information such as diagnosis codes, service codes, expected charges and provider or facility identifiers do not need to be included as that information will be provided in separate good faith estimates upon scheduling or upon request of such items or services; and include instructions for how an uninsured (or self-pay) individual can obtain good faith estimates for such items or services;


(vii) [Reserved]


(viii) A disclaimer that informs the uninsured (or self-pay) individual that there may be additional items or services the convening provider or convening facility recommends as part of the course of care that must be scheduled or requested separately and are not reflected in the good faith estimate;


(ix) A disclaimer that informs the uninsured (or self-pay) individual that the information provided in the good faith estimate is only an estimate regarding items or services reasonably expected to be furnished at the time the good faith estimate is issued to the uninsured (or self-pay) individual and that actual items, services, or charges may differ from the good faith estimate; and

(e) *Required Methods for Providing Good Faith Estimates for Uninsured (or Self-Pay) Individuals.* (1) A good faith estimate must be provided in written form either on paper or electronically, pursuant to the uninsured (or self-pay) individual's requested method of delivery, and within the timeframes described in paragraph (b) of this section. Good faith estimates provided electronically must be provided in a manner that the uninsured (or self-pay) individual can both save and print. A good faith estimate must be provided and written using clear and understandable language and in a manner calculated to be understood by the average uninsured (or self-pay) individual.


(2) To the extent that an uninsured (or self-pay) individual requests a good faith estimate in a method other than paper or electronically (for example, by phone or orally in person), the convening provider may orally inform the uninsured (or self-pay) individual of information contained in the good faith estimate using the method requested by the uninsured (or self-pay) individual; however, in order for a convening provider or convening facility to meet the requirements of this section, the convening provider or convening facility must issue the good faith estimate to the uninsured (or self-pay) individual in written form as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(f) *Additional compliance provisions.* (1) A good faith estimate issued to uninsured (or self-pay) individual under this section is considered part of the patient's medical record and must be maintained in the same manner as a patient's medical record. Convening providers and convening facilities must provide a copy of any previously issued good faith estimate furnished within the last 6 years to an uninsured (or self-pay) individual upon the request of the uninsured (or self-pay) individual.


(2) Providers or facilities that issue good faith estimates issued under State processes that do not meet the requirements set forth in this section fail to comply with the requirements of this section.


(3) A provider or facility will not fail to comply with this section solely because, despite acting in good faith and with reasonable due diligence, the provider or facility makes an error or omission in a good faith estimate required under this section, provided that the provider or facility corrects the information as soon as practicable. If items or services are furnished before an error in a good faith estimate is addressed, the provider or facility may be subject to patient-provider dispute resolution if the actual billed charges are substantially in excess of the good faith estimate (as described in § 149.620).


(4) To the extent compliance with this section requires a provider or facility to obtain information from any other entity or individual, the provider or facility will not fail to comply with this section if it relied in good faith on the information from the other entity, unless the provider or facility knows, or reasonably should have known, that the information is incomplete or inaccurate. If the provider or facility learns that the information is incomplete or inaccurate, the provider or facility must provide corrected information to the uninsured (or self-pay) individual as soon as practicable. If items or services are furnished before an error in a good faith estimate is addressed, the provider or facility may be subject to patient-provider dispute resolution if the actual billed charges are substantially in excess of the good faith estimate (as described in § 149.620).


(g) *Applicability*—(1) *Applicability date.* The requirements of this section are applicable for good faith estimates requested on or after January 1, 2022 or for good faith estimates required to be provided in connection with items or services scheduled on or after January 1, 2022.


(2) *Applicability with other laws.* Nothing in this section alters or otherwise affects a provider's or facility's requirement to comply with other applicable State or Federal laws, including those governing the accessibility, privacy, or security of information required to be disclosed under this section, or those governing the ability of properly authorized representatives to access uninsured (or self-pay) individuals' information held by providers or facilities, except to the extent a state law prevents the application of this section.
