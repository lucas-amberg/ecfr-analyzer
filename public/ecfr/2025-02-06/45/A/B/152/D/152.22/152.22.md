(a) *General rule.* A PCIP may specify the networks of providers from whom enrollees may obtain plan services. The PCIP must demonstrate to HHS that it has a sufficient number and range of providers to ensure that all covered services are reasonably available and accessible to its enrollees.

(1) The enrollee had a reasonable concern that failure to obtain immediate treatment could present a serious risk to his or her life or health; and


(2) The services were required to assess whether a condition requiring immediate treatment exists, or to provide such immediate treatment where warranted.
