(e) *Duties of a Navigator.* An entity that serves as a Navigator must carry out at least the following duties:


(1) Maintain expertise in eligibility, enrollment, and program specifications and conduct public education activities to raise awareness about the Exchange;


(2) Provide information and services in a fair, accurate, and impartial manner, which includes: providing information that assists consumers with submitting the eligibility application; clarifying the distinctions among health coverage options, including QHPs; and helping consumers make informed decisions during the health coverage selection process.

(8) Provide targeted assistance to serve underserved or vulnerable populations, as identified by the Exchange, within the Exchange service area.


(i) In a Federally-facilitated Exchange, this paragraph (e)(8) will apply beginning with the Navigator grant application process for Navigator grants awarded in 2018. The Federally-facilitated Exchange will identify populations as vulnerable or underserved that are disproportionately without access to coverage or care, or that are at a greater risk for poor health outcomes, in the funding opportunity announcement for its Navigator grants, and applicants for those grants will have an opportunity to propose additional vulnerable or underserved populations in their applications for the Federally-facilitated Exchange's approval.


(ii) [Reserved]


(9) The Exchange may require or authorize Navigators to provide information and assistance with any of the following topics. In federally-facilitated Exchanges, FY 2021 Navigator grantees will be required to perform these duties beginning with the Navigator grant funding awarded in FY 2022 for the second 12-month budget period of the 36-month period of performance.
