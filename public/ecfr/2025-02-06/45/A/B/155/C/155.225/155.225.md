(c) *Duties.* Certified application counselors are certified to—


(1) Provide information to individuals and employees about the full range of QHP options and insurance affordability programs for which they are eligible, which includes: providing fair, impartial, and accurate information that assists consumers with submitting the eligibility application; clarifying the distinctions among health coverage options, including QHPs; and helping consumers make informed decisions during the health coverage selection process;


(2) Assist individuals and employees to apply for coverage in a QHP through the Exchange and for insurance affordability programs; and


(3) Help to facilitate enrollment of eligible individuals in QHPs and insurance affordability programs.


(d) *Standards of certification.* An organization designated by the Exchange to provide certified application counselor services, or an Exchange that chooses to certify individual staff members or volunteers directly under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, may certify a staff member or volunteer to perform the duties specified in paragraph (c) of this section only if the staff member or volunteer—
