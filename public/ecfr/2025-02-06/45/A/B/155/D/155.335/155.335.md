(iv) Notwithstanding the other provisions in this paragraph (j)(2), to the extent permitted by applicable State law, if the enrollee's current QHP is a catastrophic plan as described in section 1302(e) of the ACA, and the enrollee will no longer meet the criteria for enrollment in a catastrophic plan as described in section 1302(e)(2) of the ACA:

(5) For purposes of this section, catastrophic coverage is not a coverage level that is considered higher or lower than metal level coverage when re-enrolling an enrollee to a plan that is a metal level higher or lower than their current plan, and an Exchange may not re-enroll an enrollee that has coverage under section 1302(d) into catastrophic coverage.
