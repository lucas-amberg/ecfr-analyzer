# § 155.340   Administration of advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions.

(a) *Requirement to provide information to enable advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions.* In the event that the Exchange determines that a tax filer is eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit, an applicant is eligible for cost-sharing reductions, or that such eligibility for such programs has changed, the Exchange must, simultaneously—


(1) Transmit eligibility and enrollment information to HHS necessary to enable HHS to begin, end, or change advance payments of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions; and


(2) Notify and transmit information necessary to enable the issuer of the QHP to implement, discontinue the implementation, or modify the level of advance payments of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions, as applicable, including:


(i) The dollar amount of the advance payment; and


(ii) The cost-sharing reductions eligibility category.


(b) *Requirement to provide information related to employer responsibility.* (1) In the event that the Exchange determines that an individual is eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions based in part on a finding that an individual's employer does not provide minimum essential coverage, or provides minimum essential coverage that is unaffordable, within the standard of 26 CFR 1.36B-2(c)(3)(v), or provide minimum essential coverage that does not meet the minimum value standard of § 156.145, the Exchange must transmit the individual's name and taxpayer identification number to HHS.


(2) If an enrollee for whom advance payments of the premium tax credit are made or who is receiving cost-sharing reductions notifies the Exchange that he or she has changed employers, the Exchange must transmit the enrollee's name and taxpayer identification number to HHS.


(3) In the event that an individual for whom advance payments of the premium tax credit are made or who is receiving cost-sharing reductions terminates coverage from a QHP through the Exchange during a benefit year, the Exchange must—


(i) Transmit the individual's name and taxpayer identification number, and the effective date of coverage termination, to HHS, which will transmit it to the Secretary of the Treasury; and,


(ii) Transmit the individual's name and the effective date of the termination of coverage to his or her employer.


(c) *Requirement to provide information related to reconciliation of advance payments of the premium tax credit.* The Exchange must comply with the requirements of 26 CFR 1.36B-5 regarding reporting to the IRS and to taxpayers.


(d) *Timeliness standard.* The Exchange must transmit all information required in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section promptly and without undue delay.


(e) *Allocation of advance payments of the premium tax credit among policies.* If one or more advance payments of the premium tax credit are to be made on behalf of a tax filer (or two tax filers covered by the same plan(s)), and individuals in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled in more than one QHP or stand-alone dental plan, then the advance payment must be allocated as follows:


(1) That portion of the advance payment of the premium tax credit that is less than or equal to the aggregate adjusted monthly premiums, as defined in 26 CFR 1.36B-3(e), for the QHP policies properly allocated to EHB must be allocated among the QHP policies in a reasonable and consistent manner specified by the Exchange; and


(2) Any remaining advance payment of the premium tax credit must be allocated among the stand-alone dental policies in a reasonable and consistent manner specified by the Exchange.


(f) *Allocation of advance payments of the premium tax credit among policies offered through a Federally-facilitated Exchange.* If one or more advance payments of the premium tax credit are to be made on behalf of a tax filer (or two tax filers covered by the same plan(s)), and individuals in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled in more than one QHP or stand-alone dental plan offered through a Federally-facilitated Exchange, then that portion of the advance payment of the premium tax credit that is less than or equal to the aggregate adjusted monthly premiums, as defined in 26 CFR 1.36B-3(e), properly allocated to EHB for the QHP policies, will be allocated among the QHP policies, as described in § 155.340(f)(1); and any remaining advance payment of the premium tax credit will be allocated among the stand-alone dental policies based on the methodology described in § 155.340(f)(2).


(1) That portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit to be allocated among QHP policies will be allocated based on the number of enrollees covered under the QHP, weighted by the age of the enrollees, using the default uniform age rating curve established by the Secretary of HHS under 45 CFR 147.102(e), with the portion allocated to any single QHP policy not to exceed the portion of the QHP's adjusted monthly premium properly allocated to EHB. If the portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit allocated to a QHP under this subparagraph exceeds the portion of the same QHP's adjusted monthly premium properly allocated to EHB, the remainder will be allocated evenly among all other QHPs in which individuals in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled.


(2) That portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit to be allocated among stand-alone dental policies will be allocated based on the number of enrollees covered under the stand-alone dental policy, weighted by the age of the enrollees, using the default uniform age rating curve established by the Secretary of HHS under 45 CFR 147.102(e), with the portion allocated to any single stand-alone dental policy not to exceed the portion of the stand-alone dental policy premium properly allocated to EHB. If the portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit allocated to a stand-alone dental policy under this subparagraph exceeds the portion of the same policy's premium properly allocated to EHB, the remainder will be allocated evenly among all other stand-alone dental policies in which individuals in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled.


(g) *Reduction of enrollee's portion of premium to account for advance payments of the premium tax credit.* If an Exchange is facilitating the collection and payment of premiums to QHP issuers and stand-alone dental plans on behalf of enrollees under § 155.240, and if a QHP issuer or stand-alone dental plan has been notified that it will receive an advance payment of the premium tax credit on behalf of an enrollee for whom the Exchange is facilitating such functions, the Exchange must—


(1) Reduce the portion of the premium for the policy collected from the individual for the applicable month(s) by the amount of the advance payment of the premium tax credit; and


(2) Include with each billing statement, as applicable, to or for the individual the amount of the advance payment of the premium tax credit for the applicable month(s) and the remaining premium owed for the policy.


(h) *Failure to reduce enrollee's premiums to account for advance payments of the premium tax credit.* If the Exchange discovers that it did not reduce an enrollee's premium by the amount of the advance payment of the premium tax credit, then the Exchange must notify the enrollee of the improper reduction within 45 calendar days of discovery of the improper reduction and refund the enrollee any excess premium paid by or for the enrollee as follows:


(1) Unless a refund is requested by or for the enrollee, the Exchange must, within 45 calendar days of discovery of the error, apply the excess premium paid by or for the enrollee to the enrollee's portion of the premium (or refund the amount directly). If any excess premium remains, the Exchange must then apply the excess premium to the enrollee's portion of the premium for each subsequent month for the remainder of the period of enrollment or benefit year until the excess premium is fully refunded (or refund the remaining amount directly). If any excess premium remains at the end of the period of enrollment or benefit year, the Exchange must refund any excess premium within 45 calendar days of the end of the period of enrollment or benefit year, whichever comes first.


(2) If a refund is requested by or for the enrollee, the refund must be provided within 45 calendar days of the date of the request.




(i) *Calculation of advance payments of the premium tax credit when policy coverage lasts less than the full coverage month.* (1) For plan years beginning with 2024 and beyond, when an Exchange determines that an individual is eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit and the enrollee is enrolled in a policy for less than the full coverage month, including when the enrollee is enrolled in multiple policies within a month, each lasting less than the full coverage month—




(i) In an Exchange using the Federal eligibility and enrollment platform, the amount of the advance payment of the premium tax credit paid to the issuer of the policy must equal the product of—




(A) The advance payments of the premium tax credit applied to the policy for one month of coverage divided by the number of days in the month; and




(B) The number of days for which coverage is being provided in the month under the policy described in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section.




(ii) [Reserved]




(2) For plan years beginning with 2024 and beyond, a State Exchange operating its own platform will be required to calculate advance payments of the premium tax credit in accordance with a methodology that does not cause the amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit applied to an enrollee's monthly premium to exceed their expected monthly premium assistance credit amount when the enrollee is enrolled in a policy for less than the full coverage month, including when the enrollee is enrolled in multiple policies within a month, each lasting less than the full coverage month, and to prospectively report the methodology it intends to implement in the subsequent plan year to HHS under § 155.1200(b)(2).
