(D) If an enrollee or his or her enrolled dependents qualify for a special enrollment period in accordance with paragraph (d)(16) of this section, the Exchange must allow the enrollee and his or her enrolled dependents to change to any available silver-level QHP if they elect to change their QHP enrollment. If a qualified individual or a dependent who is not an enrollee qualifies for a special enrollment period in accordance with paragraph (d)(16) of this section and has one or more household members who are enrollees, the Exchange must allow the enrollee to add the newly enrolling household member to his or her current QHP; or, to change to a silver-level QHP and add the newly enrolling household member to this silver-level QHP; or, to change to a silver level QHP and enroll the newly enrolling qualified individual or dependent in a separate QHP;

(ii) For a QHP selection received by the Exchange under a special enrollment period for which special effective dates specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section would apply, the Exchange may provide a coverage effective date that is earlier than specified in such paragraph.


(4) *Advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions.* Notwithstanding the standards of this section, the Exchange must ensure that advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions adhere to the effective dates specified in § 155.330(f).


(5) *Option for earlier effective dates due to untimely notice of triggering event.* At the option of a qualified individual, enrollee or dependent who is eligible to select a plan during a period provided for under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the Exchange must provide the earliest effective date that would have been available under paragraph (b) of this section, based on the applicable triggering event under paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Availability and length of special enrollment periods*—(1) *General rule.* Unless specifically stated otherwise herein, a qualified individual or enrollee has 60 days from the date of a triggering event to select a QHP.

At the option of the Exchange, a qualified individual or their dependent who is described in paragraph (d)(7) of this section; who is described in paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of this section becomes newly eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit as a result of a permanent move to a new State; or who is described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and becomes newly eligible for enrollment in a QHP through the Exchange because they newly satisfy the requirements under § 155.305(a)(2), has 60 days before or after the triggering event to select a QHP.

(5) *Availability for individuals who did not receive timely notice of triggering events.* If a qualified individual, enrollee, or dependent did not receive timely notice of an event that triggers eligibility for a special enrollment period under this section, and otherwise was reasonably unaware that a triggering event described in paragraph (d) of this section occurred, the Exchange must allow the qualified individual, enrollee, or when applicable, his or her dependent to select a new plan within 60 days of the date that he or she knew, or reasonably should have known, of the occurrence of the triggering event.

(4) The qualified individual's or his or her dependent's, enrollment or non-enrollment in a QHP is unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous and is the result of the error, misrepresentation, misconduct, or inaction of an officer, employee, or agent of the Exchange or HHS, its instrumentalities, or a non-Exchange entity providing enrollment assistance or conducting enrollment activities. For purposes of this provision, misconduct includes the failure to comply with applicable standards under this part, part 156 of this subchapter, or other applicable Federal or State laws as determined by the Exchange.


(5) The enrollee or, his or her dependent adequately demonstrates to the Exchange that the QHP in which he or she is enrolled substantially violated a material provision of its contract in relation to the enrollee;

(11) A qualified individual or dependent—


(i) Applies for coverage on the Exchange during the annual open enrollment period or due to a qualifying event, is assessed by the Exchange as potentially eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and is determined ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP by the State Medicaid or CHIP agency either after open enrollment has ended or more than 60 days after the qualifying event; or

(13) At the option of the Exchange, the qualified individual provides satisfactory documentary evidence to verify his or her eligibility for an insurance affordability program or enrollment in a QHP through the Exchange following termination of Exchange enrollment due to a failure to verify such status within the time period specified in § 155.315 or is under 100 percent of the Federal poverty level and did not enroll in coverage while waiting for HHS to verify his or her citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence; or


(14) The qualified individual, enrollee, or dependent newly gains access to an individual coverage HRA (as defined in 45 CFR 146.123(b)) or is newly provided a qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement (QSEHRA) (as defined in section 9831(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code). The triggering event is the first day on which coverage for the qualified individual, enrollee, or dependent under the individual coverage HRA can take effect, or the first day on which coverage under the QSEHRA takes effect. An individual, enrollee, or dependent will qualify for this special enrollment period regardless of whether they were previously offered or enrolled in an individual coverage HRA or previously provided a QSEHRA, so long as the individual, enrollee, or dependent is not enrolled in the individual coverage HRA or covered by the QSEHRA on the day immediately prior to the triggering event.


(15) The qualified individual or his or her dependent is enrolled in COBRA continuation coverage for which an employer is paying all or part of the premiums, or for which a government entity is providing subsidies, and the employer completely ceases its contributions to the qualified individual's or dependent's COBRA continuation coverage or government subsidies completely cease. The triggering event is the last day of the period for which COBRA continuation coverage is paid for or subsidized, in whole or in part, by an employer or government entity. For purposes of this paragraph, “COBRA continuation coverage” has the meaning provided for in § 144.103 of this subchapter and includes coverage under a similar State program.

(e) *Loss of coverage.* Loss of coverage described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section includes those circumstances described in 26 CFR 54.9801-6(a)(3)(i) through (iii) and in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section. Loss of coverage does not include voluntary termination of coverage or other loss due to—


(1) Failure to pay premiums on a timely basis, including COBRA continuation coverage premiums prior to expiration of COBRA continuation coverage, except for circumstances in which an employer completely ceases its contributions to COBRA continuation coverage, or government subsidies of COBRA continuation coverage completely cease as described in paragraph (d)(15) of this section, or


(2) Situations allowing for a rescission as specified in 45 CFR 147.128.


(f) For purposes of this section, references to eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit refer to being eligible for such advance payments in an amount greater than zero dollars per month. References to ineligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit refer to being ineligible for such payments or being eligible for such payments but being eligible for a maximum of zero dollars per month of such payments.




(g) *Pre-enrollment special enrollment period verification.* At the option of the Exchange, an Exchange may verify prior to processing a qualified individual's plan selection that the qualified individual is eligible for a special enrollment period under this section. In circumstances where the Exchange determines that such pre-enrollment special enrollment period verification may cause undue burden on qualified individuals, the Exchange may provide an exception to the pre-enrollment special enrollment period verification process, provided it does so in a manner consistent with the non-discrimination requirements under § 155.120(c). Exchanges on the Federal platform will conduct pre-enrollment special enrollment verification of eligibility only for special enrollment periods under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
