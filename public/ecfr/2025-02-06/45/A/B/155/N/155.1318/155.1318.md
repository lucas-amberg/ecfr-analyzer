# § 155.1318   Modification from the normal public notice requirements during an emergent situation.

(a) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury may modify, in part, the State public notice requirements under § 155.1312(a)(1), (b), (c), and (d) and the Federal public notice procedures under § 155.1316(b) to expedite a decision on a proposed section 1332 waiver request during an emergent situation, when a delay would undermine or compromise the purpose of the proposed waiver request and be contrary to the interests of consumers. These flexibilities are limited to emergent situations, including natural disasters; public health emergencies; or other emergent situations that threaten consumers' access to comprehensive coverage, consumers' access to health care, or human life.


(b) A State must meet all of the following criteria to request a modification under paragraph (a) of this section:


(1) The State must request a modification under paragraph (a) of this section, in the form and manner specified by the Secretaries.


(2) The State must have acted in good faith, and in a diligent, timely, and prudent manner in the preparation of the request for a modification under paragraph (a) of this section, and the waiver application request, as applicable.


(3) The State must, as applicable, detail in its request for a modification from State-level notice procedures under paragraph (a) of this section the justification for the request as it relates to the emergent situation and the alternative public notice procedures it proposes to implement at the State level, including public hearings, that are designed to provide the greatest opportunity and level of meaningful public input from impacted stakeholders that is practicable given the emergency circumstances underlying the State's request for a modification.


(4) The State must, as applicable, detail in its request for a modification from Federal-level notice procedures under paragraph (a) of this section the justification for the request and the alternative public notice procedures it requests to be implemented at the Federal level.


(5) The State must explain in its request for a modification from State-level notice procedures under paragraph (a) of this section how the emergent circumstances underlying its request result from a natural disaster; public health emergency; or other emergent situations that threaten consumers' access to comprehensive coverage, consumers' access to health care, or human life could not reasonably have been foreseen and how a delay would undermine or compromise the purpose of the waiver and be contrary to the interests of consumers.


(c) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury will evaluate a State's request for a modification under paragraph (a) of this section and issue their modification determination within approximately 15 calendar days after the request is received.


(d) The Secretary will publish on the CMS website any modification determinations within 15 calendar days of the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury making such a determination, as well as the approved revised timeline for public comment under the approved alternative State or Federal public notice procedures, as applicable.


(e) The State must publish on its website any modification requests and determinations within 15 calendar days of receipt of the determination, as well as the approved revised timeline for public comment under the alternative State or Federal public notice procedures, as applicable.


(f) The State must, as applicable, implement the alternative public notice procedures at the State level if the State's modification request is approved and, if required, amend the waiver application request.


(g) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury will consider circumstances to be emergent when they could not have been reasonably foreseen. The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury will assess “reasonable foreseeability” based on the specific issues that a section 1332 waiver proposes to address and other relevant factors, and will not make this assessment based solely on the number of days a State may have been aware of such issues.
