# § 156.120   Collection of data to define essential health benefits.

*Health benefits* means benefits for medical care, as defined at § 144.103 of this subchapter, which may be delivered through the purchase of insurance or otherwise.


*Health plan* has the meaning given to the term “Portal Plan” in § 159.110 of this subchapter.


*State* has the meaning given to that term in § 155.20 of this subchapter.


*Treatment limitations* include limits on benefits based on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment.
