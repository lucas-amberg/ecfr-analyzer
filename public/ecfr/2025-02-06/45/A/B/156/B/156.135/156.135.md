# ยง 156.135   AV calculation for determining level of coverage.

(a) *Calculation of AV.* Subject to paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, to calculate the AV of a health plan, the issuer must use the AV Calculator developed and made available by HHS for the given benefit year.


(b) *Exception to the use of the AV Calculator.* If a health plan's design is not compatible with the AV Calculator, the issuer must meet the following:


(1) Submit the actuarial certification from an actuary, who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries, on the chosen methodology identified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section:


(2) Calculate the plan's AV by:


(i) Estimating a fit of its plan design into the parameters of the AV Calculator; and


(ii) Having an actuary, who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries, certify that the plan design was fit appropriately in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and methodologies; or


(3) Use the AV Calculator to determine the AV for the plan provisions that fit within the calculator parameters and have an actuary, who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries calculate and certify, in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and methodologies, appropriate adjustments to the AV identified by the calculator, for plan design features that deviate substantially from the parameters of the AV Calculator.


(4) The calculation methods described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section may include only in-network cost-sharing, including multi-tier networks.


(c) *Employer contributions to health savings accounts and amounts made available under certain health reimbursement arrangements.* For plans other than those in the individual market that at the time of purchase are offered in conjunction with an HSA or with integrated HRAs that may be used only for cost-sharing, annual employer contributions to HSAs and amounts newly made available under such HRAs for the current year are:


(1) Counted towards the total anticipated medical spending of the standard population that is paid by the health plan; and


(2) Adjusted to reflect the expected spending for health care costs in a benefit year so that:


(i) Any current year HSA contributions are accounted for; and


(ii) The amounts newly made available under such integrated HRAs for the current year are accounted for.


(d) *Use of state-specific standard population for the calculation of AV.* Beginning in 2015, if submitted by the State and approved by HHS, a state-specific data set will be used as the standard population to calculate AV in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The data set may be approved by HHS if it is submitted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and:


(1) Supports the calculation of AVs for the full range of health plans available in the market;


(2) Is derived from a non-elderly population and estimates those likely to be covered by private health plans on or after January 1, 2014;


(3) Is large enough that: (i) The demographic and spending patterns are stable over time; and (ii) Includes a substantial majority of the State's insured population, subject to the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;


(4) Is a statistically reliable and stable basis for area-specific calculations; and (5) Contains claims data on health care services typically offered in the then-current market.


(e) *Submission of state-specific data.* AV will be calculated using the default standard population described in paragraph (f) of this section, unless a data set in a format specified by HHS that can support the use of the AV Calculator as described in paragraph (a) of this section is submitted by a State and approved by HHS consistent with paragraph (d) of this section by a date specified by HHS.


(f) *Default standard population.* The default standard population for AV calculation will be developed and summary statistics, such as in continuance tables, will be provided by HHS in a format that supports the calculation of AV as described in paragraph (a) of this section.


(g) *Updates to the AV Calculator.* HHS will update the AV Calculator annually for material changes that may include costs, plan designs, the standard population, developments in the function and operation of the AV Calculator and other actuarially relevant factors.
