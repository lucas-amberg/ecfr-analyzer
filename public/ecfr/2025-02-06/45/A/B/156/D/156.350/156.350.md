# § 156.350   Eligibility and enrollment standards for Qualified Health Plan issuers on State-based Exchanges on the Federal platform.

(a) In order to participate in a State-based Exchange on the Federal platform, a QHP issuer must comply with HHS regulations, and guidance pertaining to issuer eligibility and enrollment functions as if the issuer were an issuer of a QHP on a Federally-facilitated Exchange. These requirements include—


(1) Section 156.285(a)(4)(ii) regarding the premiums for plans offered on the SHOP, for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2018;


(2) Section 156.285(c)(5) and (c)(8)(iii) regarding the enrollment process for SHOP, for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2018; and


(3) Section 156.715 regarding compliance reviews of QHP issuers, to the extent relating directly to applicable eligibility and enrollment functions.


(4) Section 156.265(d) of this subchapter regarding binder payments and premium payment deadlines.


(b) HHS will permit issuers of QHPs in each State-based Exchange on the Federal platform to directly enroll applicants in a manner that is considered to be through the Exchange, as if the issuers were issuers of QHPs on Federally-facilitated Exchanges under § 156.1230(a), to the extent permitted by applicable State law.


(c) If the State-based Exchange on the Federal platform does not substantially enforce a requirement in paragraph (a) of this section against the issuer or plan, then HHS may do so, in accordance with the enforcement remedies in subpart I of this part, subject to the administrative review process in subpart J of this part.
