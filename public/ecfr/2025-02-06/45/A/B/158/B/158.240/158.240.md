# § 158.240   Rebating premium if the applicable medical loss ratio standard is not met.

(a) *General requirement.* For each MLR reporting year, an issuer must provide a rebate to each enrollee if the issuer's MLR does not meet or exceed the minimum percentage required by §§ 158.210 and 158.211 of this subpart.


(b) *Definition of enrollee for purposes of rebate.* For the sole purpose of determining whom is entitled to receive a rebate pursuant to this part, the term “enrollee” means the subscriber, policyholder, and/or government entity that paid the premium for health care coverage received by an individual during the respective MLR reporting year.




(c) *Amount of rebate to each enrollee.* (1) For each MLR reporting year, an issuer must rebate to the enrollee, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the total amount of premium revenue, as defined in § 158.130, received by the issuer from the enrollee, after subtracting Federal and State taxes and licensing and regulatory fees as provided in §§ 158.161(a) and 158.162(a)(1) and (b)(1), and after accounting for payments or receipts for risk adjustment, risk corridors, and reinsurance as provided in § 158.130(b)(5), multiplied by the difference between the MLR required by § 158.210 or § 158.211, and the issuer's MLR as calculated under § 158.221.




(2) For example, an issuer must rebate a pro rata portion of premium revenue if it does not meet an 80 percent MLR for the individual market in a State that has not set a higher MLR. If an issuer has a 75 percent MLR for the coverage it offers in the individual market in a State that has not set a higher MLR, the issuer must rebate 5 percent of the premium paid by or on behalf of the enrollee for the MLR reporting year after subtracting a pro rata portion of taxes and fees and accounting for payments or receipts related to the reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors programs (calculated using an adjustment percentage, as described in § 153.500 of this subchapter, equal to zero percent). If the issuer is not a qualifying issuer (defined in § 158.103), or is a qualifying issuer that does not opt to apply risk adjustment transfer amounts as described in § 158.140(b)(4)(ii), the issuer's total earned premium for the MLR reporting year in the individual market in the State is $200,000, incurred claims are $121,250, the issuer received transitional reinsurance payments of $2,500, and made net payments related to risk adjustment and risk corridors of $20,000 (calculated using an adjustment percentage, as described in § 153.500 of this subchapter, equal to zero percent), then the issuer's gross earned premium in the individual market in the State would be $200,000 plus $2,500 minus $20,000, for a total of $182,500. If the issuer's Federal and State taxes and licensing and regulatory fees, including reinsurance contributions, that may be excluded from premium revenue as described in §§ 158.161(a), 158.162(a)(1), and 158.162(b)(1), allocated to the individual market in the State are $15,000, and the net payments related to risk adjustment and risk corridors, reduced by reinsurance receipts, that must be accounted for in premium revenue as described in §§ 158.130(b)(5), 158.221, and 158.240, are $17,500 ($20,000 reduced by $2,500), then the issuer would subtract $15,000 and add $17,500 to gross premium revenue of $182,500, for a base of $185,000 in adjusted premium. The issuer would owe rebates of 5 percent of $185,000, or $9,250 in the individual market in the State. In this example, if an enrollee of the issuer in the individual market in the State paid $2,000 in premiums for the MLR reporting year, or 1/100 of the issuer's total premium in that State market, then the enrollee would be entitled to 1/100 of the total rebates owed by the issuer, or $92.50.


(3) As another example, if an issuer is a qualifying issuer (defined in § 158.103) that opts to apply risk adjustment transfer amounts as described in § 158.140(b)(4)(ii), the issuer's total earned premium for the MLR reporting year in the individual market in the State is $90,000, incurred claims are $151,250, and the issuer received transitional reinsurance payments of $12,500 and net receipts related to risk adjustment of $110,000, then the issuer's gross earned premium in the individual market in the State would be $90,000 plus $12,500, for a total of $102,500. If the qualifying issuer's Federal and State taxes and licensing and regulatory fees, including reinsurance contributions, that may be excluded from premium revenue as described in §§ 158.161(a), 158.162(a)(1), and 158.162(b)(1), allocated to the individual market in the State are $15,000, and the reinsurance payments that must be accounted for in premium revenue as described in §§ 158.130(b)(5), 158.221, and 158.240 are $12,500, then the qualifying issuer would subtract $15,000 and $12,500 from gross premium revenue of $102,500, for a subtotal of $75,000. The qualifying issuer would then add $110,000 in net receipts related to risk adjustment, for a base of $185,000 in adjusted premium. The qualifying issuer would owe rebates of 5 percent of $185,000, or $9,250 in the individual market in the State. In this example, if an enrollee of the issuer in the individual market in the State paid $900 in premiums for the MLR reporting year, or 1/100 of the issuer's total premium in that State market, then the enrollee would be entitled to 1/100 of the total rebates owed by the issuer, or $92.50.








(d) *Limitation on total rebate payable for each year in the aggregation.* For any State and market, an issuer may elect to limit the amount of rebate payable for the MLR reporting year to the issuer's total outstanding rebate liability with respect to all years included in the aggregation. If an issuer elects this option, the outstanding rebate liability with respect to a specific year in the aggregation must be calculated by multiplying the denominator with respect to that year, as defined in § 158.221(c), by the difference between the MLR required by § 158.210 or § 158.211 for the MLR reporting year, and the sum of the issuer's preliminary MLR for that year, as defined under § 158.232(f), and the credibility adjustment applicable to the current MLR reporting year. The outstanding rebate liability with respect to a specific year must be reduced by any rebate payments applied against it in prior MLR reporting years. A rebate paid for an MLR reporting year must be applied first to reduce the outstanding rebate liability with respect to the earliest year in the aggregation.


(e) *Timing of rebate.* For each of the 2011, 2012, and 2013 MLR reporting years, an issuer must provide any rebate owing to an enrollee no later than August 1 following the end of the MLR reporting year. Beginning with the 2014 MLR reporting year, an issuer must provide any rebate owing to an enrollee no later than September 30 following the end of the MLR reporting year.


(f) *Late payment interest.* An issuer that fails to pay any rebate owing to an enrollee or subscriber in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section or to take other required action within the time periods set forth in this part must, in addition to providing the required rebate to the enrollee, pay the enrollee interest at the current Federal Reserve Board lending rate or ten percent annually, whichever is higher, on the total amount of the rebate, accruing from the date payment was due under paragraph (e) of this section.


(g) *Rebate prepayment and safe harbor.* An issuer may choose to pay a portion or all of its estimated rebate amount for a given MLR reporting year to enrollees in any form specified in § 158.241 prior to the rebate payment deadlines set forth in §§ 158.240(e) and 158.241(a)(2) and in advance of submitting the MLR report required in § 158.110 to the Secretary. Issuers that choose to prepay a portion or all of their rebates must do so for all eligible enrollees in a given state and market in a non-discriminatory manner, and consistently with State law or other applicable state authority. If, after submitting the MLR report required in § 158.110, an issuer determines that its rebate prepayment amount in a given state and market is at least 95 percent, but less than 100 percent, of the total rebate amount owed for the applicable MLR reporting year to enrollees in that state and market, the issuer may, without penalty or late payment interest under paragraph (f) of this section, provide the remaining rebate amount to those enrollees no later than the rebate deadlines in §§ 158.240(e) and 158.241(a)(2) applicable to the following MLR reporting year. If the total rebate owed to an enrollee for the MLR reporting year is above the *de minimis* threshold established in § 158.243(a), the issuer cannot treat the remaining rebate owed to an enrollee after prepayment as *de minimis,* even if the remaining rebate is below the *de minimis* threshold.
