# ยง 158.243   

(a) *Minimum threshold.* An issuer is not required to provide a rebate to an enrollee based upon the premium that enrollee paid, under the following circumstances:


(1) For a group policy for which the issuer distributes the rebate to the policyholder, if the total rebate owed to the policyholder and the subscribers combined is less than $20 for a given MLR reporting year; or for a group policy for which the issuer distributes the rebate directly to the subscribers, as provided in ยง 158.242(a)(3) and (4) of this subpart, if the total rebate owed to each subscriber is less than $5.


(2) In the individual market, if the total rebated owed to the subscriber is less than $5.


(b) *Distribution.* (1) An issuer must aggregate and distribute any rebates not provided because they did not meet the minimum threshold set forth in paragraph (a) of this section by aggregating the unpaid rebates by individual market, small group market and large group market in a State and use them to increase the rebates provided to enrollees who receive rebates based upon the same MLR reporting year as the aggregated unpaid rebates. An issuer must distribute such aggregated rebates by providing additional premium credit or payment divided evenly among enrollees who are being provided a rebate.


(2) For example, an issuer in the individual market has aggregated unpaid rebates totaling $2,000, and the issuer has 10,000 enrollees who are entitled to be provided a rebate above the minimum threshold for the applicable MLR reporting year. The $2,000 must be redistributed to the 10,000 and added on to their existing rebate amounts. The $2,000 is divided evenly among the 10,000 enrollees, so the issuer increases each enrollee's rebate by $0.20.
