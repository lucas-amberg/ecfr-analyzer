(a) Each issuer subject to the reporting requirement of this part must allow access and entry to its premises, facilities and records, including computer and other electronic systems, to HHS, the Comptroller General, or their designees to evaluate, through inspection, audit, or other means, compliance with the requirements for reporting and calculation of data submitted to HHS, and the timeliness and accuracy of rebate payments made under this part.

(1) HHS determines there is a special need to retain a particular record or group of records for a longer period and notifies the issuer at least 30 days before the disposition date.


(2) There has been a dispute, or allegation of fraud or similar fault by the issuer, in which case the retention may be extended to 6 years from the date of any resulting final resolution of the dispute, fraud, or similar fault.
