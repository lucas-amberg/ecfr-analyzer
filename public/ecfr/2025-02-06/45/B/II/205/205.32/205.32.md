# ยง 205.32   Procedures for issuance of replacement checks.

(a) *State plan requirements.* A State plan under title IV-A of the Social Security Act shall provide that (1) procedures are in effect to ensure that no undue delays occur in issuing a replacement check; and (2) when applicable, prior to the issuance of a replacement check, the State agency must: 


(i) Issue a stop payment order on the original AFDC check through appropriate banking procedures; and 


(ii) Require recipients to execute a signed statement attesting to the nonreceipt, loss, or theft of the original FDC check. However, if obtaining such a statement from the recipient will cause the issuance of the check to be unduly delayed, the statement may be obtained within a reasonable time after the check is issued. 


(b) *State option.* A State plan may provide that as a condition for issuance of a replacement check, a recipient is required to report a lost or stolen AFDC check to the police or other appropriate authorities. Under this provision, the State agency may require that the recipient verify that a report was made to the police or other appropriate authorities and, if so, the agency will establish procedures for such verification.
