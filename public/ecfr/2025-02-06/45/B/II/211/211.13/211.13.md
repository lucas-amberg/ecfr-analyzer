# ยง 211.13   Financial responsibility of the eligible person; collections, compromise, or waiver of payment.

(a) *For temporary care and treatment.* If an eligible person receiving temporary care, treatment, and assistance, pursuant to the Act, has financial resources available to pay all or part of the costs of such care, the Administrator shall require him to pay for such costs, either in advance or by way of reimbursement, unless in his judgment it would be inequitable or impracticable to require such payment. 


(b) *For continuing care and treatment.* Any eligible person receiving continuing care and treatment in a hospital, or his estate, shall be liable to pay or contribute toward the payment of the costs or charges therefor, to the same extent as such person would, if a resident of the District of Columbia, be liable to pay, under the laws of the District of Columbia, for his care and maintenance in a hospital for the mentally ill in that jurisdiction. 


(c) *Collections, compromise, or waiver of payment.* The Administrator may, in his discretion, where in his judgment substantial justice will be best served thereby or the probable recovery will not warrant the expense of collection, compromise, or waive the whole or any portion of, any claim for continuing care and treatment, and assistance, and in the process of arriving at such decision, the Administrator may make or cause to be made such investigations as may be necessary to determine the ability of the patient to pay or contribute toward the cost of his continuing care and treatment in a hospital.
