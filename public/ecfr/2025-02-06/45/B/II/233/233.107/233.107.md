# § 233.107   Restriction in payment to households headed by a minor parent.

(a) *State plan requirements.* A State in its title IV-A State plan may provide that a minor parent and the dependent child in his or her care must reside in the household of a parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, or in an adult-supervised supportive living arrangement in order to receive, AFDC unless: 


(1) The minor parent has no living parent or legal guardian whose whereabouts is known; 


(2) No living parent or legal guardian of the minor parent allows the minor parent to live in his or her home; 


(3) The minor parent lived apart from his or her own parent or legal guardian for a period of at least one year before either the birth of the dependent child or the parent's having made application for AFDC; 


(4) The physical or emotional health or safety of the minor parent or dependent child would be jeopardized if they resided in the same residence with the minor parent's parent or legal guardian; 


(5) There is otherwise good cause for the minor parent and dependent child to receive assistance while living apart from the minor parent's parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, or an adult-supervised supportive living arrangement. 


(b) *Allegations.* If a minor parent makes allegations supporting the conclusion that paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies, the State agency shall determine whether it is justified. 


(c) *Good Cause.* The circumstances justifying a determination of good cause must be set forth in the State plan. 


(d) *Protective Payments.* When a minor parent and his or her dependent child are required to live with the minor parent's parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, or in an adult-supervised supportive living arrangement, then AFDC is paid (where possible) in the form of a protective payment.


(e) *Definitions:* For purposes of this section: 


(1) A *minor parent* is an individual who (i) is under the age of 18, (ii) has never been married, and (iii) is either the natural parent of a dependent child living in the same household or eligible for assistance paid under the State plan to a pregnant woman as provided in § 233.90(c)(2)(iv) of this part. 


(2) A *household of a parent, legal guardian, or other adult relatives* means the place of residence of (i) a natural or adoptive parent or a stepparent, or (ii) a legal guardian as defined by the State, or (iii) another individual who is age 18 or over and related to the minor parent as specified in § 233.90(c)(1)(v) of this part provided that the residence is maintained as a home for the minor parent and child as provided in § 233.90(c)(1)(v)(B) of this part. 


(3) *An adult-supervised supportive living arrangement* means a private family setting or other living arrangement (not including a public institution), which, as determined by the State, is maintained as a family setting, as evidenced by the assumption of responsibility for the care and control of the minor parent and dependent child or the provision of supportive services, such as counseling, guidance, or supervision. For example, foster homes and maternity homes are “adult-supervised supportive living arrangements.” 


(f) *Notice Requirements.* Minor applicants shall be informed about the eligibility requirements and their rights and obligations consistent with the provisions at § 206.10(a)(2)(i). For example, a State may wish to: (1) Advise the minor of the possible exemptions and specifically ask whether one or more of these exemptions is applicable; and (2) assist the minor in attaining the necessary verifications if one or more of these exemptions is alleged.
