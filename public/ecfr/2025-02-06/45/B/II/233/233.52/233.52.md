A State Plan under title IV-A of the Social Security Act, shall provide that: 


(a) Any sponsor of an alien and the alien shall be jointly and severally liable for any overpayment of aid under the State plan made to the alien during the three years after the alien's entry into the United States due to the sponsor's failure to provide correct information under the provisions of ยง 233.51, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(b) When a sponsor is found to have good cause or to be without fault (as defined in the State plan) for not providing information to the agency, the sponsor will not be held liable for the overpayment and recovery will not be made from this sponsor.


(c) An overpayment for which the alien or the sponsor and the alien are liable (as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) shall be repaid to the State or recovered in accordance with ยง 233.20(a)(13). If the agency is unable to recover the overpayment through this method, funds to reimburse the agency for the overpayment shall be withheld from future payments to which the alien or the alien and the individual sponsor are entitled under: 


(1) Any State administered or supervised program established by the Social Security Act, or 


(2) Any federally administered cash benefit program established by the Social Security Act.
