# § 233.80   Disability.

(a) *State plan requirements.* A State plan under title XIV or XVI of the Social Security Act must: 


(1) Contain a definition of permanently and totally disabled, showing that: 


(i) “Permanently” is related to the duration of the impairment or combination of impairments; and 


(ii) “Totally” is related to the degree of disability. 


(2) Provide for the review of each medical report and social history by technically competent persons—not less than a physician and a social worker qualified by professional training and pertinent experience—acting cooperatively, who are responsible for the agency's decision that the applicant does or does not meet the State's definition of permanent and total disability. Under this requirement: 


(i) The medical report must include a substantiated diagnosis, based either on existing medical evidence or upon current medical examination; 


(ii) The social history must contain sufficient information to make it possible to relate the medical findings to the activities of the “useful occupation” and to determine whether the individual is totally disabled, and 


(iii) The review physician is responsible for setting dates for reexamination; the review team is responsible for reviewing reexamination reports in conjunction with the social data to determine whether disabled recipients whose health condition may improve continue to meet the State's definition of permanent and total disability. 


(3) Provide for cooperative arrangements with related programs, such as vocational rehabilitation services. 


(b) *Federal financial participation*—(1) *Assistance payments.* Federal financial participation is available in payments to or in behalf of any otherwise eligible individual who is permanently and totally disabled. Permanent and total disability may be considered as continuing until the review team establishes the fact that the recipient's disability is no longer within the State's definition of permanent and total disability. 


(2) *Administrative expenses.* Federal financial participation is available in any expenditures incident to the medical examinations necessary to determine whether an individual is permanently and totally disabled.
