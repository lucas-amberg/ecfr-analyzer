# § 234.70   Protective payments for the aged, blind, or disabled.

(a) *State plan requirements.* If a State plan for OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD under the Social Security Act includes provisions for protective payments, the State plan must provide that: 


(1) Methods will be in effect to determine that needy individuals have, by reason of physical or mental condition, such inability to manage funds that making payment to them would be contrary to their welfare; such methods to include medical or psychological evaluations, or other reports of physical or mental conditions including observation of gross conditions such as extensive paralysis, serious mental retardation, continued disorientation, or severe memory loss. 


(2) There will be responsibility to assure referral to social services for appropriate action to protect recipients where problems and needs for services and care of the recipients are manifestly beyond the ability of the protective payee to handle. (See paragraph (a)(5) of this section.) 


(3) Standards will be established for selection of protective payees who are interested in or concerned with the individual's welfare, to act for the individual in receiving and managing assistance, with the selection of a protective payee being made by the individual, or with his participation and consent, to the extent possible. If it is in the best interest of the individual for a staff member of a private agency, of the public welfare department, or of any other appropriate organization to serve as a protective payee, such selection will be made preferably from the staff of an agency or that part of the agency providing protective services for families or for the disabled or aged group of which the recipient is a member; and such staff of the public welfare department will be utilized only to the extent that the department has adequate staff for this purpose. The selection will not include: The executive head of the agency administering public assistance; the person determining financial eligibility for the individual; special investigative or resource staff, or staff handling fiscal processes related to the recipient; or landlords, grocers, or other vendors of goods or services dealing directly with the recipient—such as the proprietor, administrator or fiscal agent of a nursing home, or social care, medical or nonmedical institution, except for the superintendent of a public institution for mental diseases or a public institution for the mentally retarded, or the designee of such superintendent, when no other suitable protective payee can be found and there are appropriate staff available to assist the superintendent in carrying out the protective payment function. 


(4) Protective payments will be made only in cases in which the assistance payment, with other available income, meets all the needs of the individual, using the State's standards for assistance for the pertinent program, not standards for protective payment cases only. 


(5) The agency will undertake and continue special efforts to protect the welfare of such individuals and to improve, to the extent possible, their capacity for self-care and to manage funds. 


(6) Reconsideration of the need for protective payments and the way in which a protective payee's responsibilities are carried out will be as frequent as indicated by the individual's circumstances and at least every 6 months. 


(7) Provision will be made for appropriate termination of protective payments as follows: 


(i) When individuals are considered able to manage funds in their best interest, there will be a return to money payment status. 


(ii) When a judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative appears to serve the best interest of the individual, such appointment will be sought and the protective payment will terminate when the appointment has been made. 


(8) Opportunity for a fair hearing will be given to any individual claiming assistance in relation to the determination that a protective payment should be made or continued, and in relation to the payee selected. 


(b) *Federal financial participation.* Federal financial participation is available for payments, which otherwise qualify as money payments with respect to a needy individual, but which are made to a protective payee under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The payment must be supported by an authorization of award through amendment of an existing authorization document for such case or by preparation of a separate authorization document. In either instance, the authorization document must be a formal agency record signed by a responsible agency official showing the name of each eligible individual, the amount of payment authorized and the name of the protective payee. Payrolls must identify protective payment cases either by use of a separate payroll for these cases or by using a special identifying code or symbol on the regular payroll.
