# ยง 260.59   What penalty relief is available to a State that failed to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance because it provided federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers?

(a)(1) We will determine that a State has reasonable cause if it failed to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance because of federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers granted to victims of domestic violence.


(2) More specifically, to receive reasonable cause under the provisions at ยง 264.3(b) of this chapter, a State must demonstrate that:


(i) It granted federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers to extend time limits based on the need for continued assistance due to current or past domestic violence or the risk of further domestic violence; and


(ii) When individuals and their families are excluded from the calculation, the percentage of families receiving federally funded assistance for more than 60 months did not exceed 20 percent of the total.


(b) We may take federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers to extend time limits into consideration in deciding whether a State has achieved compliance or made significant progress towards achieving compliance in meeting the five-year limit on Federal assistance during a corrective compliance period.


(c) To receive the penalty relief specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the State must submit the information specified at ยง 265.9(b)(5) of this chapter.
