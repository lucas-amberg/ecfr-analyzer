# ยง 261.50   What happens if a State fails to meet the participation rates?

(a) If we determine that a State did not achieve one of the required minimum work participation rates, we must reduce the SFAG payable to the State. 


(b)(1) If there was no penalty for the preceding fiscal year, the base penalty for the current fiscal year is five percent of the adjusted SFAG.


(2) For each consecutive year that the State is subject to a penalty under this part, we will increase the amount of the base penalty by two percentage points over the previous year's penalty. However, the penalty can never exceed 21 percent of the State's adjusted SFAG.


(c) We impose a penalty by reducing the SFAG payable for the fiscal year that immediately follows our final determination that a State is subject to a penalty and our final determination of the penalty amount.


(d) In accordance with the procedures specified at ยง 262.4 of this chapter, a State may dispute our determination that it is subject to a penalty.
