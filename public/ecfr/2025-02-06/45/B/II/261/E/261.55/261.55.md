# ยง 261.55   Under what circumstances will we reduce the amount of the penalty for not properly imposing penalties on individuals?

(a) We will reduce the amount of the penalty based on the degree of the State's noncompliance.


(b) In determining the size of any reduction, we will consider objective evidence of:


(1) Whether the State has established a control mechanism to ensure that the grants of individuals are appropriately reduced for refusing to engage in required work; and


(2) The percentage of cases for which the grants have not been appropriately reduced.
