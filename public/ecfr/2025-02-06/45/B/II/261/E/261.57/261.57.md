# § 261.57   What happens if a State sanctions a single parent of a child under six who cannot get needed child care?

(a) If we determine that a State has not complied with the requirements of § 261.56, we will reduce the SFAG payable to the State by no more than five percent for the immediately succeeding fiscal year unless the State demonstrates to our satisfaction that it had reasonable cause or it achieves compliance under a corrective compliance plan pursuant to §§ 262.5 and 262.6 of this chapter.


(b) We will impose the maximum penalty if:


(1) The State does not have a statewide process in place to inform parents about the exception to the work requirement and enable them to demonstrate that they have been unable to obtain child care; or


(2) There is a pattern of substantiated complaints from parents or organizations verifying that a State has reduced or terminated assistance in violation of this requirement.


(c) We may impose a reduced penalty if the State demonstrates that the violations were isolated or that they affected a minimal number of families.
