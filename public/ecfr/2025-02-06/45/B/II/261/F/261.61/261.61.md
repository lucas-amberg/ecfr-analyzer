# ยง 261.61   How must a State document a work-eligible individual's hours of participation?

(a) A State must support each individual's hours of participation through documentation in the case file. In accordance with ยง 261.62, a State must describe in its Work Verification Plan the documentation it uses to verify hours of participation in each activity.


(b) For an employed individual, the documentation may consist of, but is not limited to pay stubs, employer reports, or time and attendance records substantiating hours of participation. A State may presume that an employed individual participated for the total number of hours for which that individual was paid.


(c) The State must document all hours of participation in an activity; however, if a State is reporting projected hours of actual employment in accordance with ยง 261.60(c), it need only document the hours on which it bases the projection.


(d) For an individual who is self-employed, the documentation must comport with standards set forth in the State's approved Work Verification Plan. Self-reporting by a participant without additional verification is not sufficient documentation.


(e) For an individual who is not employed, the documentation for substantiating hours of participation may consist of, but is not limited to, time sheets, service provider attendance records, or school attendance records. For homework time, the State must also document the homework or study expectations of the educational program.
