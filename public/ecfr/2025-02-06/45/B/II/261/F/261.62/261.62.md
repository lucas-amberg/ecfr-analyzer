(4) Establish and employ internal controls to ensure compliance with the procedures; and


(5) Submit to the Secretary for approval the State's Work Verification Plan in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) A State's Work Verification Plan must include the following:

(i) A description demonstrating how the activity meets the relevant definition at ยง 261.2;


(ii) A description of how the State determines the number of countable hours of participation; and


(iii) A description of the documentation it uses to monitor participation and ensure that the actual hours of participation are reported;
