# § 261.64   How will we determine whether a State's work verification procedures ensure an accurate work participation measurement?

(a) We will determine that a State has met the requirement to establish work verification procedures if it submitted an interim Work Verification Plan by September 30, 2006 and a complete Work Verification Plan that we approved by September 30, 2007.


(b) A “complete” Work Verification Plan means that:


(1) The plan includes all the information required by § 261.62(b); and


(2) The State certifies that the plan includes all the information required by § 261.62(b) and that it accurately reflects the procedures under which the State is operating.


(c) For conduct occurring after October 1, 2007, we will use 45 CFR part 75, subpart F in conjunction with other reviews, audits, and data sources, as appropriate, to assess the accuracy of the data filed by States for use in calculating the work participation rates.
