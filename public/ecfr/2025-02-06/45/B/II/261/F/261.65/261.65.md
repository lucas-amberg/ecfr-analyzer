# § 261.65   Under what circumstances will we impose a work verification penalty?

(a) We will take action to impose a penalty under § 262.1(a)(15) of this chapter if:


(1) The requirements under § 261.64(a) and (b) have not been met; or

(1) One percent for the first year;


(2) Two percent for second year;


(3) Three percent for the third year;


(4) Four percent for the fourth year; and,


(5) Five percent for the fifth and subsequent years.
