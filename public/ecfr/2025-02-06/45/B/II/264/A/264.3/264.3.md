# § 264.3   How can a State avoid a penalty for failure to comply with the five-year limit?

(a) We will not impose the penalty if the State demonstrates to our satisfaction that it had reasonable cause for failing to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance or it achieves compliance under a corrective compliance plan, pursuant to §§ 262.5 and 262.6 of this chapter.


(b) In addition, we will determine a State has reasonable cause if it demonstrates that it failed to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance because of federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers provided to victims of domestic violence in accordance with provisions of subpart B of part 260.
