# ยง 264.74   How will we determine the Contingency Fund MOE level for the annual reconciliation?

(a)(1) The Contingency Fund MOE level includes the State's share of expenditures for AFDC benefit payments, administration, and FAMIS; EA; and the JOBS program for FY 1994.


(2) We will use the same data sources and date, i.e., April 28, 1995, that we used to determine the basic MOE levels for FY 1994. We will exclude the State's share of expenditures from the former IV-A child care programs (AFDC/JOBS, Transitional and At-Risk child care) in the calculation.


(b) We will reduce a State's Contingency Fund MOE level by the same percentage that we reduce the basic MOE level for any fiscal year in which we reduce the State's annual SFAG allocation to provide funding to Tribal grantees operating a Tribal TANF program.
