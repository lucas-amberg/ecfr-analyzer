# § 284.35   What action will we take in response to the State's assessment and other information?

(a) We will review the State's assessment along with other available information. If we determine that the increase in the child poverty rate of five percent or more is not the result of the TANF program(s) in the State, we will notify the State that no further information from, or action by, the State is required for the applicable two-calendar-year period. 


(b) Based on our review of the State's assessment and other information, if we determine that the increase in the State's child poverty rate of five percent or more is the result of the TANF program(s) in the State, we will notify the State that it must submit a corrective action plan as specified in §§ 284.40 and 284.45.
