# § 284.50   What information will we use to determine the child poverty rate in each Territory?

(a) Our intent is that, to the extent that reliable data are available and the procedures are appropriate, the Territories must meet the requirements in §§ 284.11 through 284.45 as specified for the 50 States and the District of Columbia.


(b) When reliable Census Bureau data are available for the Territories, we will:


(1) Notify the Territories through guidance of our intent to use these data in the implementation of this part; and


(2) Begin the process by providing to each Territory the number and percent of children in poverty in each jurisdiction, as specified in § 284.20(b).
