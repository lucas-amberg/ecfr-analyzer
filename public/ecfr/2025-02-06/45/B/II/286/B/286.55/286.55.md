# § 286.55   What types of costs are subject to the administrative cost limit on Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds?

(a) Activities that fall within the definition of “administrative costs” at § 286.5 are subject to the limit determined under § 286.50. 


(b) Information technology and computerization for tracking, data entry and monitoring, including personnel and other costs associated with the automation activities needed for Tribal TANF monitoring, data entry and tracking purposes, are excluded from the administrative cost cap, even if they fall within the definition of “administrative costs.” 


(c) Designing, administering, monitoring, and controlling a sample are not inherent parts of information technology and computerization and, thus, costs associated with these tasks must be considered administrative costs. 


(d) Indirect Costs negotiated by BIA, the Department's Division of Cost Allocation, or another federal agency must be considered to be part of the total administrative costs.
