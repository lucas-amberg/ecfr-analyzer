# § 286.215   When are the TANF penalty provisions applicable?

(a) A Tribe may be subject to penalties, as described in § 286.195(a)(1), § 286.195(a)(2) and § 286.195(a)(4), for conduct occurring on and after the first day of implementation of the Tribe's TANF program. 


(b) A Tribe may be subject to penalties, as described in § 286.195(a)(3), for conduct occurring on and after the date that is six months after the Tribe begins operating the TANF program. 


(c) We will not apply the regulations retroactively. We will judge Tribal actions that occurred prior to the effective date of these rules and expenditures of funds received prior to the effective date only against a reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions in title IV-A of the Act. 


(1) To the extent that a Tribe's failure to meet the requirements of the penalty provisions is attributable to the absence of Federal rules or guidance, Tribes may qualify for reasonable cause, as discussed in § 286.225. 


(2) [Reserved]
