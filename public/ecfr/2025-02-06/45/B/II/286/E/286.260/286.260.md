# § 286.260   May Tribes use sampling and electronic filing?

(a) Each Tribe may report disaggregated data on all recipient families (universal reporting) or on a sample of families selected through the use of a scientifically acceptable sampling method. The sampling method must be approved by ACF in advance of submitting reports. 


(1) Tribes may not use a sample to generate the aggregated data. 


(2) [Reserved]


(b) “Scientifically acceptable sampling method” means a probability sampling method in which every sampling unit has a known, non-zero chance to be included in the sample, and the sample size requirements are met. 


(c) Each Tribe may file quarterly reports electronically, based on format specifications that we will provide. Tribes who do not have the capacity to submit reports electronically may submit quarterly reports on a disk or in hard copy.
