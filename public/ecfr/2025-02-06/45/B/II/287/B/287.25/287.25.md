# § 287.25   May Tribes form a consortium to operate a NEW Program?

(a) Yes, as long as each Tribe forming the consortium is an “eligible Indian tribe.” 


(b) To apply for and conduct a NEW Program, the consortium must submit a plan to ACF. 


(c) The plan must include a copy of a resolution from each Tribe indicating its membership in the consortium and authorizing the consortium to act on its behalf in regard to administering a NEW Program. If an Alaska Native organization forms a consortium, submission of the required resolution from the governing board of the organization is sufficient to satisfy this requirement.
