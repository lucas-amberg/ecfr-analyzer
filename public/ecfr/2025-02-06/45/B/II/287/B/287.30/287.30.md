# ยง 287.30   If an eligible consortium breaks up, what happens to the NEW Program grant?

(a) If a consortium should break up or any Tribe withdraws from a consortium, it will be necessary to allocate unobligated funds and future grants among the Tribes that were members of the consortium, if each individual Tribe obtains ACF approval to continue to operate a NEW Program. 


(b) Each withdrawing Tribe must submit to ACF a copy of the Tribal resolution that confirms the Tribe's decision to withdraw from the consortium and indicates whether the Tribe elects to continue its participation in the program. 


(c) The allocation can be accomplished by any method that is recommended and agreed to by the leaders of those Tribes. 


(d) If no recommendation is made by the Tribal leaders or no agreement is reached, the Secretary will determine the allocation of funds based on the best available data.
