# ยง 287.55   What time frames and guidelines apply regarding the obligation and liquidation periods for NEW Program funds?

(a) NEW Program funds provided for a FY are for use during the period July 1 through June 30 and must be obligated no later than June 30. Carry forward of an unobligated balance of NEW funds is not permitted. A NEW fund balance that is unobligated as of June 30 will be returned to the Federal government through the issuance of a negative grant award. Unobligated funds are to be reported on the SF-269A that Tribes must submit within 30 days after the funding period, *i.e.,* no later than July 30. This report is called the interim financial report. 


(b) A Tribe must liquidate all obligations incurred under the NEW Program grant awards not later than one year after the end of the obligation period, *i.e.,* no later than June 30 of the following FY. An unliquidated balance at the close of the liquidation period will be returned to the Federal government through the issuance of a negative grant award. Unliquidated obligations are to be reported on the SF-269A that Tribes must submit within 90 days after the liquidation period, *i.e.,* by September 28. This report is called the final financial report.
