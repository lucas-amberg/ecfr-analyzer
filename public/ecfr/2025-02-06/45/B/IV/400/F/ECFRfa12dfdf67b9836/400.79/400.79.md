# § 400.79   Development of an employability plan.

(a) An individual employability plan must be developed as part of a family self-sufficiency plan where applicable for each recipient of refugee cash assistance in a family unit who is not exempt under § 400.76 of this part. 


(b) If such a plan has been developed by the local resettlement agency which sponsored the refugee, or its designee, the State agency, or its designee, may accept this plan if it determines that the plan is appropriate for the refugee and meets the requirements of this subpart. 


(c) The employability plan must— 


(1) Be designed to lead to the earliest possible employment and not be structured in such a way as to discourage or delay employment or job-seeking; and


(2) Contain a definite employment goal, attainable in the shortest time period consistent with the employability of the refugee in relation to job openings in the area.
