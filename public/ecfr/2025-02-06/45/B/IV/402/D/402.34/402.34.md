# § 402.34   Allocation of unexpended funds.

(a) Any unexpended funds, as defined in this part, from allotments awarded to States under §§ 402.31 and 402.33 of this part, will be allocated to States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, as defined in this part. 


(b) To determine the allocations, the ratio of each State's unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs to the total of all such costs in all States will be calculated. The ratio for each State with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs will be multiplied by total unexpended funds to determine the allocation for each State. The amount allotted to a State will be the amount of the State's allocation under this section or the amount of the State's unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, whichever is less.
