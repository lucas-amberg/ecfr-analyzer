A State may either (1) adopt as its official State-level estimate the estimate of the State's number of eligible legalized aliens provided by the Department, or (2) provide its own estimate, including detailed information on the method and data used in deriving the estimate. If a State has previously provided this information to the Department, it need not be included in the application unless the information has changed.


(c) Contain an estimate of likely SLIAG-related costs for the fiscal year for which application is being made for each program or activity in which SLIAG-related costs will be incurred. Programs and activities must be identified by the purposes listed in ยง 402.10(a). Such estimates for FY 1988 should include, as a discrete subset, costs incurred in FY 1987, pursuant to ยง 402.12.

(1)(i) Descriptions of the programs and activities for which SLIAG-related costs will be incurred; and, 


(ii) If a State elects to use its allotment for employment discrimination education and outreach, a description of the State's planned education and outreach activities, including: descriptions of the kinds of government or private agencies or other entities, if any, through which these activities will be conducted; brief descriptions of the targeted audience(s) for these activities; and, preproduction copies or the text of any material intended for distribution to the public to be produced or disseminated with SLIAG funds, if available at the time the application is submitted.

This description is to include (i) the methodology used in determining the proportion (or actual number) of eligible legalized aliens who are likely to participate in or benefit from the program or service, and (ii) a description of how a unit or other measure of the cost of providing services or benefits was calculated, or, if the estimate is based on actual cost data, a description of how the data were obtained. For SLIAG administrative costs, Phase II outreach, and employment discrimination education and outreach, the descriptions must instead include the basis for the estimate of SLIAG-related costs, as defined in this part. 


(e) Contain information on the criteria for and administrative methods of disbursing funds received under this part.

If the grantee agency is different from the SPOC, also provide the name, title, mailing address, and telephone number of the official in that agency responsible for State administration of funds available under this part. In either case, provide the employer identification number of the grantee agency. If the State elects to use SLIAG funds for employment discrimination education and outreach, it must also designate in its application a contact person for this activity, if different from the single point of contact.
