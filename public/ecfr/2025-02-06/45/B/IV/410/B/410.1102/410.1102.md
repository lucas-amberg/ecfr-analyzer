# ยง 410.1102   Care provider facility types.

ORR may place unaccompanied children in care provider facilities as defined at ยง 410.1001, including but not limited to shelters, group homes, individual family homes, heightened supervision facilities, or secure facilities, including RTCs. ORR may place unaccompanied children in out-of-network (OON) placements, subject to ยง 410.1103, if ORR determines that a child has a specific need that cannot be met within the ORR network of facilities, if no in-network care provider facility equipped to meet the child's needs has the capacity to accept a new placement, or if transfer to a less restrictive facility is warranted and ORR is unable to place the child in a less restrictive in-network facility. Unaccompanied children shall be separated from delinquent offenders in OON placements (except those unaccompanied children who meet the requirements for a secure placement pursuant to ยง 410.1105). In times of influx or emergency, as further discussed in subpart I of this part, ORR may place unaccompanied children in care provider facilities that may not meet the standards of a standard program, but rather meet the standards in subpart I.
