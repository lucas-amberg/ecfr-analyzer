# ยง 410.1106   Unaccompanied children who need particular services and treatment.

ORR shall assess each unaccompanied child in its care to determine whether the unaccompanied child requires particular services and treatment by staff to address their individualized needs while in the care and custody of the UC Program. An unaccompanied child's assessed needs may require particular services, equipment, and treatment by staff for various reasons, including, but not limited to disability, alcohol or substance use, a history of serious neglect or abuse, tender age, pregnancy, or parenting. If ORR determines that an unaccompanied child's individualized needs require particular services and treatment by staff or particular equipment, ORR shall place the unaccompanied child, whenever possible, in a standard program in which the unaccompanied child with individualized needs can interact with children without those individualized needs to the fullest extent possible, but which provides services and treatment or equipment for such individualized needs.
