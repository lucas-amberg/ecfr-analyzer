# § 410.1210   Post-release services.

(a) *General.* (1) Before releasing unaccompanied children, care provider facilities shall work with sponsors and unaccompanied children to prepare for safe and timely release of the unaccompanied children, to assess whether the unaccompanied children may need assistance in accessing community resources, and to provide guidance regarding safety planning and accessing services.


(2) ORR shall offer post-release services (PRS) for unaccompanied children for whom a home study was conducted pursuant to § 410.1204. An unaccompanied child who receives a home study and PRS may also receive home visits by a PRS provider.


(3) To the extent that ORR determines appropriations are available, and in its discretion, ORR may offer PRS for all released children. ORR may give additional consideration, consistent with paragraph (c), for cases involving unaccompanied children with mental health or other needs who could particularly benefit from ongoing assistance from a community-based service provider, to prioritize potential cases as needed. ORR shall make an initial determination of the level and extent of PRS, if any, based on the needs of the unaccompanied children and the sponsors and the extent appropriations are available. PRS providers may conduct subsequent assessments based on the needs of the unaccompanied children and the sponsors that result in a modification to the level and extent of PRS assigned to the unaccompanied children.


(4) ORR shall not delay the release of an unaccompanied child if PRS are not immediately available.


(b) *Service areas.* PRS include services in the areas listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (12) of this section, which shall be provided in a manner that is sensitive to the individual needs of the unaccompanied child and in a way they effectively understand regardless of spoken language, reading comprehension, or disability to ensure meaningful access for all eligible children, including those with limited English proficiency. The comprehensiveness of PRS shall depend on the extent appropriations are available.


(1) *Placement stability and safety.* PRS providers shall work with sponsors and unaccompanied children to address challenges in parenting and caring for unaccompanied children. This may include guidance about maintaining a safe home; supervision of unaccompanied children; protecting unaccompanied children from threats by smugglers, traffickers, and gangs; and information about child abuse, neglect, separation, grief, and loss, and how these issues affect children.


(2) *Immigration proceedings.* The PRS provider shall help facilitate the sponsor's plan to ensure the unaccompanied child's attendance at all immigration court proceedings and compliance with DHS requirements.


(3) *Guardianship.* If the sponsor is not a parent or legal guardian of the unaccompanied child, then the PRS provider shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child information about the benefits of obtaining legal guardianship of the child. If the sponsor is interested in becoming the unaccompanied child's legal guardian, then the PRS provider may assist the sponsor in identifying the legal resources to do so.


(4) *Legal services.* PRS providers shall assist sponsors and unaccompanied children in accessing relevant legal service resources including resources for immigration matters and unresolved juvenile justice issues.


(5) *Education.* PRS providers shall assist sponsors with school enrollment and shall assist the sponsors and unaccompanied children with addressing issues relating to the unaccompanied children's progress in school, including attendance. PRS providers may also assist with alternative education plans for unaccompanied children who exceed the State's maximum age requirement for mandatory school attendance. PRS providers may also assist sponsors with obtaining evaluations for unaccompanied children reasonably suspected of having a disability to determine eligibility for a free appropriate public education (which can include special education and related services) or reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services.


(6) *Employment.* PRS providers shall educate sponsors and unaccompanied children on U.S. child labor laws and requirements.


(7) *Medical services.* PRS providers shall assist the sponsor in obtaining medical insurance for the unaccompanied child if available and in locating medical providers that meet the individual needs of the unaccompanied child and the sponsor. If the unaccompanied child requires specialized medical assistance, the PRS provider shall assist the sponsor in making and keeping medical appointments and monitoring the unaccompanied child's medical requirements. PRS providers shall provide the unaccompanied child and sponsor with information and referrals to services relevant to health-related considerations for the unaccompanied child.


(8) *Individual mental health services.* PRS providers shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child with relevant mental health resources and referrals for the child. The resources and referrals shall take into account the individual needs of the unaccompanied child and sponsor. If an unaccompanied child requires specialized mental health assistance, PRS providers shall assist the sponsor in making and keeping mental health appointments and monitoring the unaccompanied child's mental health requirements.


(9) *Family stabilization/counseling.* PRS providers shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child with relevant resources and referrals for family counseling and/or individual counseling that meet individual needs of the child and the sponsor.


(10) *Substance use.* PRS providers shall assist the sponsor and unaccompanied child in locating resources to help address any substance use-related needs of the child.


(11) *Gang prevention.* PRS providers shall provide the sponsor and unaccompanied child information about gang prevention programs in the sponsor's community.


(12) *Other services.* PRS providers may assist the sponsor and unaccompanied child with accessing local resources in other specialized service areas based on the needs and at the request of the unaccompanied child or the sponsor.


(c) *Additional considerations for prioritizing provision of PRS.* ORR may prioritize referring unaccompanied children with the following needs for PRS if appropriations are not available for it to offer PRS to all children:
