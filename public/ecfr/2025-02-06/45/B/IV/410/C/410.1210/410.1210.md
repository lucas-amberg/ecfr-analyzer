# ยง 410.1210   Post-release services.

(a) *General.* (1) Before releasing unaccompanied children, care provider facilities shall work with sponsors and unaccompanied children to prepare for safe and timely release of the unaccompanied children, to assess whether the unaccompanied children may need assistance in accessing community resources, and to provide guidance regarding safety planning and accessing services.

ORR shall make an initial determination of the level and extent of PRS, if any, based on the needs of the unaccompanied children and the sponsors and the extent appropriations are available.
