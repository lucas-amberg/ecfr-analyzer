# § 410.1307   Healthcare services.

(a) ORR shall ensure that all unaccompanied children in ORR custody will be provided with routine medical and dental care; access to medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement, consistent with paragraph (c) of this section; family planning services; and emergency healthcare services.


(b) Standard programs and restrictive placements shall be responsible for:


(1) Establishment of a network of licensed healthcare providers established by the care provider facility, including specialists, emergency care services, mental health practitioners, and dental providers that will accept ORR's fee-for-service billing system;


(2) A complete medical examination (including screening for infectious disease) within 2 business days of admission, excluding weekends and holidays, unless the unaccompanied child was recently examined at another facility and if unaccompanied children are still in ORR custody 60 to 90 days after admission, an initial dental exam, or sooner if directed by State licensing requirements;


(3) Appropriate immunizations as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule and approved by HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;


(4) An annual physical examination, including hearing and vision screening, and follow-up care for acute and chronic conditions;


(5) Administration of prescribed medication and special diets;


(6) Appropriate mental health interventions when necessary;


(7) Having policies and procedures for identifying, reporting, and controlling communicable diseases that are consistent with applicable State, local, and Federal laws and regulations.


(8) Having policies and procedures that enable unaccompanied children, including those with language and literacy barriers, to convey written and oral requests for emergency and non-emergency healthcare services;


(9) Having policies and procedures based on State or local laws and regulations to ensure the safe, discreet, and confidential provision of prescription and nonprescription medications to unaccompanied children, secure storage of medications, and controlled administration and disposal of all drugs. A licensed healthcare provider must write or orally order all nonprescription medications, and oral orders must be documented in the unaccompanied child's file;


(10) Medical isolation may be used according to the following requirements:


(i) An unaccompanied child may be placed in medical isolation and excluded from contact with the general population in order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease due to a potential exposure, protect other unaccompanied children, and care provider facility staff for a medical purpose or as required under State, local, or other licensing rules, as long as the medically required isolation is limited only to the extent necessary to ensure the health and welfare of the unaccompanied child, other unaccompanied children at a care provider facility and care provider facility staff, or the public at large.


(ii) Standard programs and restrictive placements must provide all mandated services under this subpart to the greatest extent practicable under the circumstances to unaccompanied children in medical isolation. Medically isolated unaccompanied children still must be supervised under State, local, or other licensing ratios, and, if multiple unaccompanied children are in medical isolation, they should be placed in units or housing together (as practicable, given the nature or type of medical issue giving rise to the requirement for isolation in the first instance); and


(11) Urgent dental care if an unaccompanied child is experiencing an urgent dental issue (acute tooth pain, procedure(s) needed to maintain basic function, *i.e.,* severe and/or acute infection or a severe and/or acute infection is imminent). Care should be provided as soon as possible and not be delayed while awaiting the initial dental exam.


(c) ORR must not prevent unaccompanied children in ORR care from accessing healthcare services, including medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement and family planning services. ORR must make reasonable efforts to facilitate access to those services if requested by the unaccompanied child. Further, if there is a potential conflict between the standards and requirements set forth in this section and State law, such that following the requirements of State law would diminish the services available to unaccompanied children under this section and ORR policies, ORR will review the circumstances to determine how to ensure that it is able to meet its responsibilities under Federal law. If a State law or license, registration, certification, or other requirement conflicts with an ORR employee's duties within the scope of their ORR employment, the ORR employee is required to abide by their Federal duties, subject to applicable Federal religious freedom and conscience protections, to ensure unaccompanied children have access to all services available under this section and other ORR policies.


(1) *Initial placement and transfer considerations*—(i) *Initial placement.* Consistent with § 410.1103, when placing an unaccompanied child, ORR shall consider the child's individualized needs and any specialized services or treatment required or reasonably requested. Such services or treatment include but are not limited to access to medical specialists, family planning services, and medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement. When such care is determined to be medically necessary during the referral, intake process, Initial Medical Exam, or at any point while the unaccompanied child is in ORR custody, or the unaccompanied child reasonably requests such medical care while in ORR custody, ORR shall, to the greatest extent possible, identify available and appropriate bed space and place the unaccompanied child at a care provider facility that is able to provide or arrange such care, is in an appropriate location to support the unaccompanied child's healthcare needs, and affords access to an appropriate medical provider who is able to perform any reasonably requested or medically necessary services.


(ii) *Transfers.* If an appropriate initial placement is not immediately available or if the unaccompanied child's need or request for medical care is identified after the Initial Medical Exam, care providers shall immediately notify ORR and ORR shall, to the greatest extent possible, transfer the unaccompanied child needing medical care to an ORR program that meets the qualifications in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.


(2) *Transportation.* ORR shall ensure unaccompanied children have access to medical care, including transportation across State lines and associated ancillary services if necessary to access appropriate medical services, including access to medical specialists, family planning services, and medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement. The requirement in this paragraph (c)(2) applies regardless of whether Federal appropriations law prevents ORR from paying for the medical care itself.


(d) Care provider facilities shall notify ORR within 24 hours of an unaccompanied child's need or request for medical services requiring heightened ORR involvement or the discovery of a pregnancy.
