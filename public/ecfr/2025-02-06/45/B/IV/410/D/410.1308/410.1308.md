(a) *Child advocates.* This section sets forth the provisions relating to the appointment and responsibilities of independent child advocates for child trafficking victims and other especially vulnerable unaccompanied children.


(b) *Role of the child advocate.* Child advocates are third parties who make independent recommendations regarding the best interests of an unaccompanied child. Their recommendations are based on information obtained from the unaccompanied child and other sources (including, but not limited to, the unaccompanied child's parents, the family, potential sponsors/sponsors, government agencies, legal service providers, protection and advocacy system representatives in appropriate cases, representatives of the unaccompanied child's care provider, health professionals, and others). Child advocates formally submit their recommendations to ORR and/or the immigration court, where appropriate, in the form of best interest determinations (BIDs).


(c) *Responsibilities of the child advocate.* The child advocate's responsibilities include, but are not limited to:


(1) Visiting with their unaccompanied child client;


(2) Explaining the consequences and potential outcomes of decisions that may affect their unaccompanied child client;


(3) Advocating for their unaccompanied child client's best interest with respect to care, placement, services, release, and within proceedings to which the child is a party;


(4) Providing best interest determinations, where appropriate and within a reasonable time to ORR, an immigration court, and/or other stakeholders involved in a proceeding or matter in which the unaccompanied child is a party or has an interest; and,


(5) Regularly communicating case updates with the care provider facility, ORR, and/or other stakeholders in the planning and performance of advocacy efforts, including updates related to services provided to an unaccompanied child after their release from ORR care.


(d) *Appointment of child advocates.* ORR may appoint child advocates for unaccompanied children who are victims of trafficking or especially vulnerable.


(1) An interested party may refer an unaccompanied child for a child advocate when the unaccompanied child is currently, or was previously in, ORR's care and custody, and when that child has been determined to be a victim of trafficking or especially vulnerable. As used in this paragraph (d)(1), *interested parties* means individuals or organizations involved in the care, service, or proceeding involving an unaccompanied child, including but not limited to, ORR Federal or contracted staff; an immigration judge; DHS Staff; a legal service provider, attorney of record, or DOJ Accredited Representative; an ORR care provider; healthcare professional; or a child advocate organization.


(2) ORR shall make an appointment decision within five (5) business days of a referral for a child advocate, except under exceptional circumstances which may delay a decision regarding an appointment. ORR will appoint child advocates for unaccompanied children who are currently in or were previously in ORR care and custody. ORR does not appoint child advocates for unaccompanied children who are not in or were not previously in ORR care and custody.


(3) Child advocate appointments terminate upon the closure of the unaccompanied child's case by the child advocate; when the unaccompanied child turns 18; or when the unaccompanied child obtains lawful immigration status.


(e) *Child advocate's access to information.* After a child advocate is appointed for an unaccompanied child, the child advocate shall be provided access to materials to effectively advocate for the best interest of the unaccompanied child. Child advocates shall be provided access to their clients during normal business hours at an ORR care provider facility and shall be provided access to all their client's case file information and may request copies of the case file directly from the unaccompanied child's care provider without going through ORR's standard case file request process.


(f) *Child advocate's responsibility with respect to confidentiality of information.* Child advocates shall keep the information in the case file, and information about the unaccompanied child's case, confidential. A child advocate may only disclose information from the case file with informed consent from the child when this is in the child's best interests. With regard to an unaccompanied child in ORR care, ORR shall allow the child advocate of that unaccompanied child to conduct private communications with the unaccompanied child, in a private area that allows for confidentiality for in-person and virtual or telephone meetings.


(g) *Non-retaliation against child advocates.* ORR shall presume that child advocates are acting in good faith with respect to their advocacy on behalf of unaccompanied children, and shall not retaliate against a child advocate for actions taken within the scope of their responsibilities. For example, ORR shall not retaliate against child advocates because of any disagreement with a best interest determination in regard to an unaccompanied child, or because of a child advocate's advocacy on behalf of an unaccompanied child.
