# § 410.1310   Psychotropic medications.

(a) Except in the case of a psychiatric emergency, ORR shall ensure that authorized individuals provide informed consent prior to the administration of psychotropic medications to unaccompanied children.


(1) Three categories of persons can serve as an “authorized consenter” and provide informed consent for the administration of psychotropic medication to unaccompanied children in ORR custody: the child's parent or legal guardian, followed by a close relative sponsor, and then the unaccompanied child themself if the child is of sufficient age and a doctor has obtained informed consent; and


(2) Consent must be obtained voluntarily, without undue influence or coercion, and ORR will not retaliate against an unaccompanied child or an authorized consenter for refusing to take or consent to any psychotropic medication; and


(3) Any emergency administration of psychotropic medication must be documented, the child's authorized consenter must be notified as soon as possible, and the care provider and ORR must review the incident to ensure compliance with ORR policies and reasonably avoid future emergency administrations of medication.


(b) ORR shall ensure meaningful oversight of the administration of psychotropic medication(s) to unaccompanied children including reviewing cases flagged by care providers and conducting additional reviews of the administration of psychotropic medications in high-risk circumstances, including but not limited to cases involving young children, simultaneous administration of multiple psychotropic medications, and high dosages. ORR must engage qualified professionals who are able to oversee prescription practices and provide guidance to care providers, such as a child and adolescent psychiatrist.


(c) ORR shall permit unaccompanied children to have the assistance of counsel, at no cost to the Federal Government, with respect to the administration of psychotropic medications.
