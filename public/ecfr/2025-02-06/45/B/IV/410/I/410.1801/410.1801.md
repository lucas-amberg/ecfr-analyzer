(13) EIFs, whether state-licensed or not, must comply, to the greatest extent possible, with all State child welfare laws and regulations (such as mandatory reporting of abuse), as well as all State and local building, fire, health and safety codes, that ORR determines are applicable to non-State licensed facilities.


(14) EIFs must deliver services in a manner that is sensitive to the age, culture, native language, and complex needs of each unaccompanied child. EIFs must develop an individual service plan for the care of each child.


(c) EIFs shall do the following when providing services to unaccompanied children:


(1) Maintain safe and sanitary conditions that are consistent with ORR's concern for the particular vulnerability of children;


(2) Provide access to toilets, showers and sinks, as well as personal hygiene items such as soap, toothpaste and toothbrushes, floss, towels, feminine care items, and other similar items;

(12) Provide a comprehensive orientation regarding program intent, services, rules (written and verbal), expectations, information about U.S. child labor laws, and the availability of legal assistance.


(13) Maintain records of case files and make regular reports to ORR. EIFs must have accountability systems in place, which preserve the confidentiality of client information and protect the records from unauthorized use or disclosure.


(d) ORR may grant waivers of standards under paragraph (b) of this section, in whole or in part, during the first six months of an EIF activation, to the extent that ORR determines that the specific waivers requested are necessary because it would be operationally infeasible to comply with the specified standards, and are granted for no longer than necessary in light of operational feasibility, and the waivers are granted in accordance with law. Such waiver or waivers must be made publicly available. Even where a waiver is granted, EIFs shall make all efforts to meet requisite standards under § 410.1801(b) as expeditiously as possible.
