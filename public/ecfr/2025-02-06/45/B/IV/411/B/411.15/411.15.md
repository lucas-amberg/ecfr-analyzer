(a) Care provider facilities must take appropriate steps to ensure that UCs with disabilities (including, for example, UCs who are deaf or hard of hearing, those who are blind or have low vision, or those who have intellectual, psychiatric, or speech disabilities) have an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from all aspects of the care provider facility's efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Such steps must include, when necessary to ensure effective communication with UCs who are deaf or hard of hearing, providing access to in-person, telephonic, or video interpretive services that enable effective, accurate, and impartial interpretation, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. In addition, the care provider facility must ensure that any written materials related to sexual abuse and sexual harassment are translated and provided in formats or through methods that ensure effective communication with UCs with disabilities, including UCs who have intellectual disabilities, limited reading skills, or who are blind or have low vision.


(b) Care provider facilities must take appropriate steps to ensure that UCs who are limited English proficient have an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from all aspects of the care provider facility's efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse and sexual harassment, including steps to provide quality in-person or telephonic interpretive services and quality translation services that enable effective, accurate, and impartial interpretation and translation, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary.


(c) In matters relating to allegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment, the care provider facility must provide quality in-person or telephonic interpretation services that enable effective, accurate, and impartial interpretation by someone other than another UC. Care provider facilities also must ensure that any written materials related to sexual abuse and sexual harassment, including notification, orientation, and instruction not provided by ORR, are translated either verbally or in written form into the preferred languages of UCs.
