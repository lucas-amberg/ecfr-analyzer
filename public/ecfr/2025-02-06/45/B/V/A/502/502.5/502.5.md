(a) Proposed and Final Decisions (including dissenting opinions) and all orders made with respect thereto, except when exempted from public disclosure by statute; 


(b) Statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the Commission which have not been published in the _Federal Register_; and 


(c) A current index, which will be updated at least quarterly, covering the foregoing material adopted, issued or promulgated after July 4, 1967.
