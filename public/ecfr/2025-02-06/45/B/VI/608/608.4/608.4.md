# ยง 608.4   Reductions of tax refunds.

(a) In accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 and the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A, NSF will participate in the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program for offset against income tax refunds of persons owing past due legally enforceable debts to NSF. 


(b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the United States and: 


(1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months but has not been delinquent for more than ten years at the time the offset is made; 


(2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1); 


(3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by NSF against amounts payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of NSF; 


(4) With respect to which NSF has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax; 


(5) With respect to which NSF has given the taxpayer at least 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, has considered the evidence presented by such taxpayer, and has determined that an amount of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable; 


(6) Has been disclosed by NSF to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00; 


(7) Is at least $25.00; 


(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Internal Revenue Service regulations at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied. 


(c) NSF will make a request for reduction of an IRS tax refund only after the NSF determines that an amount is owed and past-due and provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. NSF's notice of intention to collect by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state: 


(1) The amount of the debt; 


(2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of the NSF's Notice of Intent, NSF intends to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges; 


(3) That the debtor has a right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable; and 


(4) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and a contact name and phone number for any questions. 


(d) A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent has the right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor must: 


(1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the address provided in the notice. 


(2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally enforceable. 


(3) Include with the request any documents which the debtor wishes to be considered or state that additional information will be submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period. 


(e) The failure of a debtor to respond as provided in paragraph (d) of this section will result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without further action by NSF. If the debtor responds, NSF will consider all available evidence related to the debt and issue a written determination, including supporting rationale, whether its prior determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable is sustained, amended, or canceled. Before this determination is made the matter shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review. NSF will give prompt notification of this determination to the debtor.
