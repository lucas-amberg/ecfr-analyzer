# ยง 611.8   Procedure for effecting compliance.

(a) *General.* If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law. 


(b) *Noncompliance with ยง 611.4.* If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under ยง 611.4 or otherwise fails to comply with that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Foundation shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such subsection, except that the Foundation shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part. 


(c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:


(1) The responsible Foundation official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, 


(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearings, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, 


(3) The action has been approved by the Director pursuant to ยง 611.10(e) and 


(4) The expiration of thirty days after the Director has filed with the Committee of the House and the Committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. 


(d) *Other means authorized by law.* No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Foundation official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least ten days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least ten days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
