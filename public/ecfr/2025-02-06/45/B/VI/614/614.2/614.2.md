(8) Is likely to disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;

(10) Is likely to specifically concern the Foundation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration. 


(b) Anyone who believes his interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting may request that the Board close it to the public for any reason referred to in paragraph (a) (5), (6), or (7) of this section.
