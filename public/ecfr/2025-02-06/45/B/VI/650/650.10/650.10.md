# ยง 650.10   Inventions also supported by another Federal Agency.

Section 401.13(a) of the implementing regulation for the Bayh-Dole Act (37 CFR 401.13(a)) provides that in the event that an invention is made under funding agreements of more than one federal agency, the agencies involved will, at the request of the grantee or contractor or on their own initiative, designate one agency to be responsible for the administration of the invention. Whenever the NSF Patent Assistant finds that another agency also supported an NSF subject invention, he or she will consult with the grantee or contractor and appropriate personnel in the other agency to determine if a single agency should be designated to administer the Government's rights in the invention. The Patent Assistant may transfer to, or accept from, any other Federal agency, responsibility for administering a jointly-supported invention.
