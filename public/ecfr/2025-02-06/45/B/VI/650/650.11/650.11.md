# § 650.11   Utilization reports.

Paragraph (h) of the standard Patent Rights clause set forth in § 650.4 obliges grantees “to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization”. At this time, the Foundation does not plan to request such reports except in connection with march-in investigations conducted under § 650.13. This section will be amended to describe periodic reporting requirements if such are ever established.
