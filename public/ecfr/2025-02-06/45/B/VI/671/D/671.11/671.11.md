# § 671.11   Waste storage.

(a) Pending the treatment, disposal or removal of any wastes pursuant to § 671.12, all wastes shall be contained, confined or stored in a manner that will prevent dispersal into the environment; 


(b) All Antarctic hazardous wastes generated at or transported to any USAP station may be temporarily stored at such station prior to the treatment, disposal or removal of any wastes pursuant to § 671.12, provided all such Antarctic hazardous waste is stored in either closed containers or tanks labeled to indicate their contents and the beginning date of accumulation of such waste, and further provided the following conditions are satisfied: 


(1) If Antarctic hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, or medical wastes, are generated at or transported to McMurdo Station, they may be temporarily stored at that station for a period not to exceed 15 months; 


(2) If Antarctic hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, or medical wastes, are generated at or transported to South Pole Station, they may be temporarily stored at that station while awaiting transport to McMurdo Station, for a period not to exceed 15 months; 


(3) If Antarctic hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, or medical wastes, are generated at or transported to Palmer Station, they may be temporarily stored at that station while awaiting transport to McMurdo Station or other disposition, for a period not to exceed 28 months; 


(4) Containers holding Antarctic hazardous wastes must be: 


(i) In good, non-leaking condition with sufficient structural integrity for the storage of Antarctic hazardous waste; 


(ii) Made of or lined with materials which will not react with, and are otherwise compatible with, the Antarctic hazardous waste to be stored, so that the ability of the containers to contain such waste is not impaired; 


(iii) Stored in a manner that allows access for inspection and response to emergencies; and 


(iv) Inspected at least weekly for leakage and deterioration. All inspections must be appropriately documented. 


(5) Tank systems used for storing Antarctic hazardous wastes must be in good, non-leaking condition with sufficient structural integrity for the storing of hazardous wastes; and systems must be inspected weekly to detect corrosion or releases of waste and to collect data from monitoring and leak detection equipment, to the extent available, to ensure that they are functioning properly. All inspections must be appropriately documented. Prior to the expiration of the 15 month period referred to in § 671.11(b)(1), all Antarctic hazardous wastes shall be treated or removed from Antarctica in accordance with § 671.12. 


(6) Ignitable, reactive or incompatible wastes shall be properly segregated and protected from sources of ignition or reaction, as appropriate. 


(c) All Antarctic hazardous wastes generated at a location other than a permanent station may be temporarily stored at such location for a period not to exceed 12 months, in closed, non-leaking containers marked to indicate their contents. Such containers must be in good condition and made of or lined with material which will not react with and is otherwise compatible with the Antarctic hazardous waste stored therein so as not to impair the ability of the container to contain the waste. Prior to the expiration of the 12 month period referred to above, all such hazardous wastes shall be either: 


(1) Treated or processed, disposed of or removed from Antarctica pursuant to § 671.12, or 


(2) Removed to a permanent station and temporarily stored at that station in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
