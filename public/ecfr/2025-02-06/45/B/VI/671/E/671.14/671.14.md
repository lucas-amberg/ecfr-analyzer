# ยง 671.14   Annual review.

The Director shall review the list of banned substances and designated pollutants at least annually, and may propose the designation or redesignation of any substance as a banned substance, designated pollutant or other waste, based on the following criteria: 


(a) If the Director determines that a substance, including a designated pollutant, poses a substantial immediate hazard to health or the environment and such hazard cannot be eliminated through waste management practices or other methods, or if the Parties to the Protocol or Treaty agree that a substance should be banned from use in Antarctica, the Director may designate such substance a banned substance. 


(b) If the Director determines that a substance is liable to create a hazard to health or the environment if improperly treated or processed, stored, transported, or disposed of, the Director may designate such substance a designated pollutant. 


(c) If the Director determines that a substance previously designated a banned substance no longer displays the characteristics described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director may remove such substance from the list of banned substances (to the extent consistent with the provisions of the Protocol), but if the Director determines that such substance has the characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this section, it shall be redesignated a designated pollutant. 


(d) If the Director determines that a substance previously designated a designated pollutant no longer displays the characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Director may remove such substance from the list of designated pollutants. 


(e) In making the determinations referred to in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, the Director shall take into account all relevant new information obtained through monitoring activities or otherwise.
