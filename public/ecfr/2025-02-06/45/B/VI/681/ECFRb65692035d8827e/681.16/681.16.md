(1) The motion must be supported by an affidavit containing specific facts establishing that personal bias or other reason for disqualification exists, including the time and circumstances of the discovery of such facts;


(2) The motion must be filed promptly after discovery of the grounds for disqualification or the objection will be deemed waived; and


(3) The party, or representative of record, must certify in writing that the motion is made in good faith.
