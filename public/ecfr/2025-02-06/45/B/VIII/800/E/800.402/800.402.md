# ยง 800.402   Contract quality assurance.

(a) *General.* This section prescribes general policies and procedures to ensure that services acquired under MSP Program contracts conform to the contract's quality requirements.


(b) *Internal controls.* OPM may periodically evaluate the contractor's system of internal controls under the quality assurance program required by the contract and will acknowledge in writing if the system is inconsistent with the requirements set forth in the contract. OPM's reviews do not diminish the contractor's obligation to implement and maintain an effective and efficient system to apply the internal controls.


(c) *Performance standards.* (1) OPM will issue specific performance standards for MSP Program contracts and will inform MSP issuers of the applicable performance standards prior to negotiations for the contract year. OPM may benchmark its standards against standards generally accepted in the insurance industry. OPM may authorize nationally recognized standards to be used to fulfill this requirement.


(2) MSP issuers must comply with the performance standards issued pursuant to this section.
