# ยง 1080.7   Funding of Indian tribes.

(a) Not less than 1.5 percent of the funds provided in each fiscal year for the Emergency Community Services Homeless Grant Program shall be allocated by the Secretary directly to Indian tribes that have applied for and received a direct grant award under section 674(c) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (41 U.S.C. 9903(c)) for that fiscal year.


(b) An Indian tribe funded under this section is not required to submit an application for Emergency Community Services Homeless Grant Program funds. A tribe's application for a direct grant award under section 674(c) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9903(c)) that is submitted by September 1 for the succeeding fiscal year will be considered as an application for Emergency Community Services Homeless Grant Program funds for that fiscal year. Acceptance of the Community Services Block Grant application by the Office of Community Services will constitute approval of an award of funds under this section. 


(c) Funds allocated under this section shall be allotted to an Indian tribe in an amount that bears the same ratio to all the funds allocated under this section as the tribe's poverty population bears to the total poverty population of all tribes funded under this section, except that no tribe shall receive an amount of less than: 


(1) $500, for those tribes whose allocation under this section would otherwise be at least $1 but no more than $500; or 


(2) $1000, for those tribes whose allocation under this section would otherwise be at least $501 but less than $1000. 


(d) For purposes of this section, an Indian tribe's poverty population shall be calculated by multiplying the tribe's overall population by the Indian rural poverty rate for the State in which it is located, using the population and rural poverty rate figures established for the purposes of making direct grants under section 674(c) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9903(c)).
