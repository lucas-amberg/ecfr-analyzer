# ยง 1151.5   Inconsistent State laws and effect of employment opportunities.

(a) Recipients are not excused from complying with this part as a result of state or local laws which limit the eligibility of handicapped persons to receive services or to practice a profession or occupation. 


(b) The presence of limited employment opportunities in a particular profession does not excuse a recipient from complying with the regulation. For example, a music school receiving Endowment financial assistance could not deny admission to a qualified blind applicant because a blind singer may experience more difficulty than a nonhandicapped singer in finding a job.
