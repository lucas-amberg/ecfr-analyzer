# § 1152.9   How does the Chairman receive and respond to comments?

(a) The Chairman follows the procedures in § 1152.10 if:


(1) A state office or official is designated to act as a single point of contact between a state process and all Federal agencies; and


(2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation for a program selected under § 1152.6.


(b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit comments from state, areawide, regional or local officials and entities where there is no state process recommendation.


(2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.


(c) If a state has not established a process, or is unable to submit a state process recommendation, state, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments to the Endowment.


(d) If a program or activity is not selected for a state process, state, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments to the Endowment. In addition, if a state process recommendation for a nonselected program or activity is transmitted to the Endowment by the single point of contact, the Chairman follows the procedure of § 1152.10 of this part.


(e) The Chairman considers comments which do not constitute a state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for which the Chairman is not required to apply the procedures of § 1152.10 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single point of contact or directly to the Endowment by a commenting party.
