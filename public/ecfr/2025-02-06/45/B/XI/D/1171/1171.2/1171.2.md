# ยง 1171.2   General provisions.

This part contains the regulations the NEH follows in processing requests for NEH records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. The NEH also follows these regulations to process all FOIA requests made to the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities (FCAH), an organization established by the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 for which the NEH provides legal counsel. These regulations should be read together with the FOIA and OMB's Free Guidelines, which provides additional information about access to NEH and FCAH records. FOIA applies to requests for records concerning the general activities of the government and of the NEH in particular. When individuals seek records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, NEH processes those requests under both NEH's Privacy regulations at part 1115 of this chapter, and this part. Although requests are considered either FOIA requests or Privacy Act requests, agencies process requests in accordance with both laws, which provides the greatest degree of lawful access while safeguarding an individual's personal privacy.
