# ยง 1172.1   Purpose.

The purpose of this part is to set out the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) policies and procedures for implementing the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6101 *et seq.,* (the Act or the Age Act). The Act is designed to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act also permits federally assisted programs or activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use certain age distinctions and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part. The regulations in this part are based upon the general, government-wide age discrimination regulations issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at 45 CFR part 90. Complaints of employment discrimination based on age may be subject to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 621 *et seq.,* (ADEA) and should be filed administratively with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) (29 CFR part 1626).
