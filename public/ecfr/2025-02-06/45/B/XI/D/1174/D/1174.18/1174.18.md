(1) Review any relevant and material documents, transcripts, records, and other materials that relate to the allegations set out in the complaint and upon which the investigating official based his or her findings and conclusions, unless such documents are subject to a privilege under Federal law, and obtain copies of such documents upon payment of duplication fees; and


(2) Obtain a copy of all exculpatory information in the reviewing official's or investigating official's possession that relates to the allegations in the complaint, even if it appears in a document that would otherwise be privileged. If the document would otherwise be privileged, the other party only must disclose the portion containing exculpatory information.


(b) The notice that the reviewing official sends to the Attorney General, as described in ยง 1174.5(b), is not discoverable under any circumstances.


(c) If the reviewing official does not respond to the defendant's request within twenty days, the defendant may file with the ALJ a motion to compel disclosure of the documents, subject to the provisions of this section. The defendant may only file such a motion with the ALJ after filing an answer pursuant to ยง 1174.9.
