# ยง 1177.4   Compromise, waiver, or disposition under other statutes not precluded.

Nothing in this part precludes NEH's disposition of any claim under statutes and implementing regulations other than 31 U.S.C. 37, subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government). See *e.g.,* the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act, Public Law 87-693, 76 Stat. 593 (September 25, 1962) (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2651 *et seq.*), and applicable regulations, 28 CFR 43. In such cases, the laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to NEH's claims collection activities generally take precedence over this part.
