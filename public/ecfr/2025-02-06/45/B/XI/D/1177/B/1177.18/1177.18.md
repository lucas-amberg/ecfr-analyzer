# ยง 1177.18   Analysis of costs.

NEH will periodically compare costs incurred and amounts collected. NEH will use data on costs and corresponding recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed recoveries, assist in evaluating compromise offers, and establish minimum debt amounts below which collection efforts need not be taken.
