# ยง 1177.27   Mutual releases of the debtor and the Government.

In all appropriate instances, NEH will implement acceptable compromises by means of a mutual release, in which the debtor is released from further non-tax liability on the compromised debt in consideration of payment in full of the compromise amount and the Government and its officials, past and present, are released and discharged from any and all of the debtor's claims and causes of action arising from the same transaction. In the event NEH does not execute a mutual release when it compromises a debt, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against the Government and its officials related to the transaction that gave rise to the compromised debt.
