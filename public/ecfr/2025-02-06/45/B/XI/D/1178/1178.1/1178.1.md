# ยง 1178.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) The Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) may direct the agency to use penalty mail to assist in the location and recovery of missing children. When determined to be appropriate and cost-effective, the National Endowment for the Humanities may print, insert or use any other effective method to affix pictures and biographical data relating to missing children on NEH mail. The contact person for matters related to the implementation of this part is Tracy J. Joselson, Esq. Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Humanities, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20506, (202) 786-0322.


(b) The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will be the exclusive source from which the National Endowment for the Humanities will obtain photographic and biographical information for dissemination to the public.


(c) It is estimated that the National Endowment for the Humanities will incur no additional costs to implement this program during its initial year. This estimate is based on a review of Endowment mailings that would maximize dissemination of this information.
