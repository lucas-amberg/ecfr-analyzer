# ยง 1182.8   Procedures for acquiring access to Institute records pertaining to an individual.

The following procedures apply to records that are contained in an Institute system:


(a) You may request review of records pertaining to you by writing to the Office of the General Counsel (see ยง 1182.3). You also may call the Office of the General Counsel at (202) 653-4787 on business days, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., to schedule an appointment to make such a request in person. A request for records should be presented in writing and should identify specifically the Institute systems involved.


(b) Access to the record, or to any other information pertaining to you that is contained in the system shall be provided if the identification requirements of ยง 1182.9 are satisfied and the record is determined otherwise to be releasable under the Privacy Act and these regulations. The Institute shall provide you an opportunity to have a copy made of any such record about you. Only one copy of each requested record will be supplied, based on the fee schedule in ยง 1182.12.


(c) The Institute will comply promptly with requests made in person at scheduled appointments, if the requirements of this section are met and the records sought are immediately available. The institute will acknowledge, within 10 business days, mailed requests or personal requests for documents that are not immediately available, and the information requested will be provided promptly thereafter.


(d) If you make your request in person at a scheduled appointment, you may, upon your request, be accompanied by a person of your choice to review your record. The Institute may require that you furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of your record in the accompanying person's presence. A record may be disclosed to a representative chosen by you upon your proper written consent.


(e) Medical or psychological records pertaining to you shall be disclosed to you unless, in the judgment of the Institute, access to such records might have an adverse effect upon you. When such a determination has been made, the Institute may refuse to disclose such information directly to you. The Institute will, however, disclose this information to a licensed physician designated by you in writing.
