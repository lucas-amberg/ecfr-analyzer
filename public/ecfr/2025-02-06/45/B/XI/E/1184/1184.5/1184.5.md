(b) *Clarifications.* If there is any uncertainty, IMLS will attempt to communicate with you to clarify the scope of your request.


(c) *Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.* Upon request, IMLS will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester.

If IMLS decides to grant your request in whole or in part, the agency will notify you in writing. The notice will include any applicable fee and the agency will disclose records to you promptly upon payment of applicable fees. IMLS will mark or annotate any records disclosed in part to show the amount, the location, and the FOIA exemptions under which the redaction is made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.


(f) *Denials of requests.* Denials of your FOIA request, either whole or in part, will be made in writing by the FOIA Public Liaison. IMLS will inform you of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the agency in denying the request, and notify you of your right to appeal the determination as described in ยง 1184.6. IMLS will, as appropriate, provide a brief description of the information being withheld.
