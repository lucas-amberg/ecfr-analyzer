# § 1201.3   Service of summonses and complaints.

(a) Only the Corporation's General Counsel or his/her designee (hereinafter “General Counsel”), is authorized to receive and accept summonses or complaints sought to be served upon the Corporation or its employees. All such documents should be delivered or addressed to General Counsel, Corporation for National and Community Service, 250 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20525.


(b) In the event any summons or complaint is delivered to a Corporation Employee other than in the manner specified in this part, such attempted service shall be ineffective, and the recipient thereof shall either decline to accept the proffered service or return such document under cover of a written communication that refers the person attempting to effect service to the procedures set forth in this part. 


(c) Except as otherwise provided in § 1201.4(c), the Corporation is not an authorized agent for service of process with respect to civil litigation against Corporation Employees purely in their personal, non-official capacity. Copies of summonses or complaints directed to Corporation Employees in connection with legal proceedings arising out of the performance of official duties may, however, be served upon the General Counsel.
