(a) *Periodic compliance reviews.* ACTION may from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part. 


(b) *Complaints.* Any person who believes himself or any specific class of persons to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or by a representative file with ACTION a written complaint. A complaint shall be filed not later than 180 days after the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by ACTION. 


(c) *Investigations.* ACTION will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation will include, when appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part. 


(d) *Resolution of matters.* (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, ACTION will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by voluntary means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by voluntary means, action will be taken as provided for in ยง 1203.8. 


(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, ACTION will so inform, in writing, the recipient and the complainant, if any. 


(e) *Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.* A recipient or other person shall not intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against an individual for the purpose of interfering with a right or privilege secured by section 601 of title VI of this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential, except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of an investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.
