(4) The agent failed to consult a Counselor in a timely manner;


(5) It lacks specificity and detail;

(2) Within 30 days of his or her receipt of the request.


(g) An agent must be informed by the EEOP Director in a request under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section that his or her complaint may be rejected if the information is not provided.
