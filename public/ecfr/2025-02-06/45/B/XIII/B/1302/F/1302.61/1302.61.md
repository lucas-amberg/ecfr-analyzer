# ยง 1302.61   Additional services for children.

(a) *Additional services for children with disabilities.* Programs must ensure the individualized needs of children with disabilities, including but not limited to those eligible for services under IDEA, are being met and all children have access to and can fully participate in the full range of activities and services. Programs must provide any necessary modifications to the environment, multiple and varied formats for instruction, and individualized accommodations and supports as necessary to support the full participation of children with disabilities. Programs must ensure all individuals with disabilities are protected from discrimination under and provided with all services and program modifications required by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794), the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 *et seq.*), and their implementing regulations.


(b) *Services during IDEA eligibility determination.* While the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA determines a child's eligibility, a program must provide individualized services and supports, to the maximum extent possible, to meet the child's needs. Such additional supports may be available through a child's health insurance or it may be appropriate or required to provide the needed services and supports under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act if the child satisfies the definition of disability in section 705(9)(b) of the Rehabilitation Act. When such supports are not available through alternate means, pending the evaluation results and eligibility determination, a program must individualize program services based on available information such as parent input and child observation and assessment data and may use program funds for these purposes.


(c) *Additional services for children with an IFSP or IEP.* To ensure the individual needs of children eligible for services under IDEA are met, a program must:


(1) Work closely with the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA, the family, and other service partners, as appropriate, to ensure:


(i) Services for a child with disabilities will be planned and delivered as required by their IFSP or IEP, as appropriate;


(ii) Children are working towards the goals in their IFSP or IEP;


(iii) Elements of the IFSP or IEP that the program cannot implement are implemented by other appropriate agencies, related service providers and specialists;


(iv) IFSPs and IEPs are being reviewed and revised, as required by IDEA; and,


(v) Services are provided in a child's regular Head Start classroom or family child care home to the greatest extent possible.


(2) Plan and implement the transition services described in subpart G of this part, including at a minimum:


(i) For children with an IFSP who are transitioning out of Early Head Start, collaborate with the parents, and the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA, to ensure appropriate steps are undertaken in a timely and appropriate manner to determine the child's eligibility for services under Part B of IDEA; and,


(ii) For children with an IEP who are transitioning out of Head Start Preschool to kindergarten, collaborate with the parents, and the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA, to ensure steps are undertaken in a timely and appropriate manner to support the child and family as they transition to a new setting.
