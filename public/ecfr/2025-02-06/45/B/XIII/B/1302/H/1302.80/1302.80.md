# § 1302.80   Enrolled pregnant women.

(a) Within 30 days of enrollment, a program must determine whether each enrolled pregnant woman has an ongoing source of continuous, accessible health care—provided by a health care professional that maintains her ongoing health record and is not primarily a source of emergency or urgent care—and, as appropriate, health insurance coverage.


(b) If an enrolled pregnant woman does not have a source of ongoing care as described in paragraph (a) of this section and, as appropriate, health insurance coverage, a program must, as quickly as possible, facilitate her access to such a source of care that will meet her needs.


(c) A program must facilitate the ability of all enrolled pregnant women to access comprehensive services through referrals that, at a minimum, include nutritional counseling, food assistance, oral health care, mental health services, substance abuse prevention and treatment, and emergency shelter or transitional housing in cases of domestic violence.


(d) A program must provide a newborn visit with each mother and baby to offer support and identify family needs. A program must schedule the newborn visit within two weeks after the infant's birth. At a minimum, the visit must include a discussion of the following: maternal mental and physical health, safe sleep, infant health, and support for basic needs.


(e) A program must track and record services an enrolled pregnant woman receives both from the program and through referrals, to help identify specific prenatal care services and resources the enrolled pregnant woman needs to support a healthy pregnancy.


(f) The program must provide services that help reduce barriers to healthy maternal and birthing outcomes for each family, including services that address disparities across racial and ethnic groups, and use data on enrolled pregnant women to inform program services.
