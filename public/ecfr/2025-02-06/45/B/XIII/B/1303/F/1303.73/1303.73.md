(a) A program must consider safety of the children it transports when it plans fixed routes.


(b) A program must also ensure:


(1) The time a child is in transit to and from the program must not exceed one hour unless there is no shorter route available or any alternative shorter route is either unsafe or impractical;


(2) Vehicles are not loaded beyond maximum passenger capacity at any time;


(3) Drivers do not back up or make U-turns, except when necessary for safety reasons or because of physical barriers;


(4) Stops are located to minimize traffic disruptions and to afford the driver a good field of view in front of and behind the vehicle;


(5) When possible, stops are located to eliminate the need for children to cross the street or highway to board or leave the vehicle;


(6) Either a bus monitor or another adult escorts children across the street to board or leave the vehicle if curbside pick-up or drop off is impossible; and,


(7) Drivers use alternate routes in the case of hazardous conditions that could affect the safety of the children who are being transported, such as ice or water build up, natural gas line breaks, or emergency road closing.
