# ยง 1304.10   Purpose and scope.

The purpose of this subpart is to set forth policies and procedures for the designation renewal of Head Start programs. It is intended that these programs be administered effectively and responsibly; that applicants to administer programs receive fair and equitable consideration; and that the legal rights of current Head Start grant recipients be fully protected. The Designation Renewal System is established in this part to determine whether Head Start agencies deliver high-quality services to meet the educational, health, nutritional, and social needs of the children and families they serve; meet the program and financial requirements and standards described in section 641A(a)(1) of the Head Start Act; and qualify to be designated for funding for five years without competing for such funding as required under section 641(c) or 645A(b)(12) and (d) of the Head Start Act. A competition to select a new Head Start agency to replace a Head Start agency that has been terminated voluntarily or involuntarily is not part of the Designation Renewal System established in this part, and is subject instead to the requirements of ยง 1304.20.
