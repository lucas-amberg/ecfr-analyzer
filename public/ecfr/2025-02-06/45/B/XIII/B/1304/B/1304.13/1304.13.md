# ยง 1304.13   Requirements to be considered for designation for a five-year period when the existing grant recipient in a community is not determined to be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program and is not automatically renewed.

In order to compete for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year grant, an agency must submit an application to the responsible HHS official that demonstrates that it is the most qualified entity to deliver a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program. The application must address the criteria for selection listed at section 641(d)(2) of the Head Start Act. Any agency that has had its Head Start grant terminated for cause in the preceding five years is excluded from competing in such competition for the next five years. A Head Start agency that has had a denial of refunding, as defined in 45 CFR part 1305, in the preceding five years is also excluded from competing.
