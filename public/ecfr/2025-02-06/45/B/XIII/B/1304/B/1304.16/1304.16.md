# ยง 1304.16   Use of CLASS: Pre-K instrument in the Designation Renewal System.

Except when all children are served in a single classroom, ACF will conduct observations of multiple classes operated by the grant recipient based on a random sample of all classes and rate the conduct of the classes observed using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. When the grant recipient serves children in its program in a single class, that class will be observed and rated using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. The domain scores for that class will be the domain scores for the grant recipient for that observation. After the observations are completed, ACF will report to the grant recipient the scores of the classes observed during the CLASS: Pre-K observations in each of the domains covered by the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. ACF will average CLASS: Pre-K instrument scores in each domain for the classes operated by the agency that ACF observed to determine the agency's score in each domain.
