# § 1321.77   Purpose of services—person- and family-centered, trauma-informed.

(a) Services must be provided to older adults and family caregivers in a manner that is person-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally sensitive. Services should be responsive to their interests, physical and mental health, social and cultural needs, available supports, and desire to live where and with whom they choose. Person-centered services may include community-centered and family-centered approaches consistent with the traditions, practices, beliefs, and cultural norms and expectations of older adults and family caregivers.


(b) Services should, as appropriate, provide older adults and family caregivers with the opportunity to develop a person-centered plan that is led by the individual or, if applicable, by the individual and the individual's authorized representative. Services should be incorporated into existing person-centered plans, as appropriate.


(c) State and area agencies and service providers should provide training to staff and volunteers on person-centered and trauma-informed service provision.
