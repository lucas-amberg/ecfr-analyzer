# ยง 1322.35   Flexibilities under a major disaster declaration.

(a) If a State or Indian Tribe requests and receives a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5121-5207), the Tribal organization or Hawaiian Native grantee may use disaster relief flexibilities as set forth in this section to provide disaster relief services within its approved service area for areas of the State or Indian Tribe where the specific major disaster declaration is authorized and where older Native Americans and family caregivers are affected.


(b) Flexibilities a Tribal organization or Hawaiian Native grantee may exercise under a major disaster declaration include allowing use of any portion of the funds of any open grant awards under Title VI of the Act for disaster relief services for older individuals and family caregivers.


(c) Disaster relief services may include any allowable services under the Act to eligible older Native Americans or family caregivers during the period covered by the major disaster declaration.


(d) Expenditures of funds under disaster relief flexibilities must be reported separately from the grant where funding was expended. A Tribal organization or Hawaiian Native grantee may expend funds from any source within open grant awards under Title VI of the Act but must track the source of all expenditures.


(e) A Tribal organization or Hawaiian Native grantee must have policies and procedures outlining eligibility, use, and reporting of services and funds provided under these flexibilities.


(f) A Tribal organization or Hawaiian Native grantee may only make obligations exercising this flexibility during the major disaster declaration incident period or 90 days thereafter or with prior approval from the Assistant Secretary for Aging.
