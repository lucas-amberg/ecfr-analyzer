# § 1324.11   Establishment of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman.

(a) The Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman shall be an entity headed by the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, who shall carry out all of the functions and responsibilities set forth in § 1324.13 and, directly and/or through local Ombudsman entities, the duties set forth in § 1324.19.


(b) The State agency shall establish the Office and thereby carry out the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program in either of the following ways:


(1) The Office is a distinct entity, separately identifiable, and located within or connected to the State agency; or


(2) The State agency enters into a contract or other arrangement with any public agency or nonprofit organization which shall establish a separately identifiable, distinct entity as the Office.


(c) The State agency shall require that the Ombudsman serve on a full-time basis. In providing leadership and management of the Office, the functions, responsibilities, and duties, as set forth in §§ 1324.13 and 1324.19 are to constitute the entirety of the Ombudsman's work. The State agency or other agency carrying out the Office shall not require or request the Ombudsman to be responsible for leading, managing or performing the work of non-ombudsman services or programs except on a time-limited, intermittent basis.


(1) This provision does not limit the authority of the Ombudsman program to provide ombudsman services to populations other than residents of long-term care facilities so long as the appropriations under the Act are utilized to serve residents of long-term care facilities, as authorized by the Act.


(2) [Reserved]


(d) The State agency, and other entity selecting the Ombudsman, if applicable, shall ensure that the Ombudsman meets minimum qualifications which shall include, but not be limited to, demonstrated expertise in:


(1) Long-term services and supports or other direct services for older individuals or individuals with disabilities;


(2) Consumer-oriented public policy advocacy;


(3) Leadership and program management skills; and


(4) Negotiation and problem resolution skills.


(e) Where the Ombudsman has the legal authority to do so, they shall establish policies and procedures, in consultation with the State agency, to carry out the Ombudsman program in accordance with the Act. Where State law does not provide the Ombudsman with legal authority to establish policies and procedures, the Ombudsman shall recommend policies and procedures to the State agency or other agency in which the Office is organizationally located, and such agency shall establish Ombudsman program policies and procedures as recommended by the Ombudsman. Where local Ombudsman entities are designated within area agencies on aging or other entities, the Ombudsman and/or appropriate agency shall develop such policies and procedures in consultation with the agencies hosting local Ombudsman entities, area agencies on aging, and representatives of the Office. The policies and procedures must address the following:


(1) *Program administration.* Policies and procedures regarding program administration must include, but not be limited to:


(i) A requirement that the agency in which the Office is organizationally located must not have personnel policies or practices that prohibit the Ombudsman from performing the functions and responsibilities of the Ombudsman, as set forth in § 1324.13, or from adhering to the requirements of section 712 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 3058g). Nothing in this provision shall prohibit such agency from requiring that the Ombudsman, or other employees or volunteers of the Office, adhere to the personnel policies and procedures of the entity which are otherwise lawful.


(ii) A requirement that an agency hosting a local Ombudsman entity must not have personnel policies or practices which prohibit a representative of the Office from performing the duties of the Ombudsman program or from adhering to the requirements of section 712 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 3058g). Nothing in this provision shall prohibit such agency from requiring that representatives of the Office adhere to the personnel policies and procedures of the host agency which are otherwise lawful.


(iii) A requirement that the Ombudsman shall, on a regular basis, monitor the performance of local Ombudsman entities which the Ombudsman has designated to carry out the duties of the Office.


(iv) A description of the process by which the agencies hosting local Ombudsman entities will coordinate with the Ombudsman in the employment or appointment of representatives of the Office.


(v) Standards to ensure that the Office and/or local Ombudsman entities provide prompt response to complaints, with priority given to complaints regarding abuse, neglect, exploitation, and complaints that are time sensitive. At a minimum, the standards shall require consideration of the severity of the risk to the resident, the imminence of the threat of or potential harm to the resident, and the opportunity for mitigating harm to the resident through provision of Ombudsman program services.


(vi) Procedures that clarify appropriate fiscal responsibilities of the local Ombudsman entity, including but not limited to clarifications regarding access to programmatic fiscal information by appropriate representatives of the Office.


(vii) Procedures that establish standard retention periods for files, records, and other information maintained by the Ombudsman program and allowable methods of storage and destruction.

(C) The resident is unable to communicate consent to the review and has no legal representative, and the representative of the Office obtains the approval of the Ombudsman; or


(D) Access is necessary in order to investigate a complaint, the resident representative refuses to consent to the access, a representative of the Office has reasonable cause to believe that the resident representative is not acting in the best interests of the resident, and the representative of the Office obtains the approval of the Ombudsman.


(v) Access to the administrative records, policies, and documents, to which the residents have, or the general public has access, of long-term care facilities;
