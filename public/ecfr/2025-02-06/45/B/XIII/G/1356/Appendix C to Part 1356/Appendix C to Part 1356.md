# Appendix C to Part 1356—Calculating Sample Size for NYTD Follow-Up Populations


The Finite Population Correction (FPC) is applied when the sample is drawn from a population of one to 5,000 youth, because the sample is more than five percent of the population.


• (Py)(Pn), an estimate of the percent of responses to a dichotomous variable, is (.50)(.50) for the most conservative estimate.



• Acceptable level of error = .05 (results are plus or minus five percentage points from the actual score)


• Z = 1.645 (90 percent confidence interval)



• N = number of youth from whom the sample is being drawn



The FPC is not applied when the sample is drawn from a population of over 5,000 youth.
