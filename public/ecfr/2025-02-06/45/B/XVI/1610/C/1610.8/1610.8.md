# ยง 1610.8   Program integrity of recipient.

(a) A recipient must have objective integrity and independence from any organization that engages in restricted activities. A recipient will be found to have objective integrity and independence from such an organization if:


(1) The other organization is a legally separate entity;


(2) The other organization receives no subgrant of LSC funds from the recipient, as defined in 45 CFR part 1627, and LSC funds do not subsidize restricted activities; and


(3) The recipient is physically and financially separate from the other organization. Mere bookkeeping separation of LSC funds from other funds is not sufficient. LSC will determine whether sufficient physical and financial separation exists on a case-by-case basis and will base its determination on the totality of the facts. The presence or absence of any one or more factors will not be determinative. Factors relevant to this determination shall include but will not be limited to:


(i) The existence of separate personnel;


(ii) The existence of separate accounting and timekeeping records;


(iii) The degree of separation from facilities in which restricted activities occur, and the extent of such restricted activities; and


(iv) The extent to which signs and other forms of identification that distinguish the recipient from the organization are present.


(b) Each recipient's governing body must certify to LSC on an annual basis that the recipient is in compliance with the requirements of this section.
