Except when the Board or council finds that the public interest requires otherwise, a meeting or a portion thereof may be closed to public observation, and information pertaining to such meeting or portion thereof may be withheld, if the Board or council determines that such meeting or portion thereof, or disclosure of such information, will more probably than not:


(a) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Corporation;


(b) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552): Provided, That such statute (1) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or 


(2) Establishes particular types of matters to be withheld;


(c) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;


(d) Involve accusing any person of a crime or formally censuring any person;


(e) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(f) Disclose investigatory records compiled for the purpose of enforcing the Act or any other law, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that production of such records or information would: (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings, 


(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, 


(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, 


(4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source, 


(5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or 


(6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;


(g) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to frustrate significantly implementation of a proposed Corporation action, except that this paragraph shall not apply in any instance where the Corporation has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Corporation is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final action on such proposal; or


(h) Specifically concern the Corporation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Corporation of a particular case involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
