# ยง 1630.11   Review of questioned costs.

(a) LSC may identify questioned costs:


(1) When the Office of Inspector General, the General Accounting Office, or an independent auditor or other audit organization authorized to conduct an audit of a recipient has identified and referred a questioned cost to LSC;


(2) In the course of its oversight of recipients; or


(3) As a result of complaints filed with LSC.


(b) If LSC determines that there is a basis for disallowing a questioned cost, LSC must provide the recipient with written notice of its intent to disallow the cost. The notice of questioned costs must state the amount of the cost and the factual and legal basis for disallowing it.


(c) If a questioned cost is disallowed solely because it is excessive, only the amount that is larger than reasonable shall be disallowed.


(d)(1) Within 30 days of receiving the notice of questioned costs, the recipient may respond with written evidence and argument to show that the cost was allowable, or that LSC, for equitable, practical, or other reasons, should not recover all or part of the amount, or that the recovery should be made in installments.


(2) The written notice shall become LSC's final written decision unless:


(i) The recipient responds to LSC's written notice within 30 days;


(ii) The recipient requests an extension of time pursuant to ยง 1630.3(b) within 30 days; or


(iii) LSC grants an extension of time pursuant to ยง 1630.3(b) within 30 days.


(e) Within 60 days of receiving the recipient's written response to the notice of questioned costs, LSC management must issue a final written decision stating whether the cost has been disallowed and the reasons for the decision.


(f) If LSC has determined that the questioned cost should be disallowed, the final written decision must:


(1) State that the recipient may appeal the decision as provided in ยง 1630.12 and describe the process for seeking an appeal;


(2) Describe how it expects the recipient to repay the cost, including the method and schedule for collection of the amount of the cost;


(3) State whether LSC is requiring the recipient to make financial adjustments or take other corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the circumstances giving rise to the disallowed cost.
