# ยง 1631.6   Characteristics of procurements.

(a) Characteristics indicative of a procurement relationship between a recipient and another entity are when the other entity:


(1) Provides the goods and services within its normal business operations;


(2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;


(3) Normally operates in a competitive environment;


(4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the LSC grant; and


(5) Is not subject to LSC's compliance requirements as a result of the agreement, though similar requirements may apply for other reasons.


(b) In determining whether an agreement between a recipient and another entity constitutes a contract under this part or a subgrant under part 1627 of this chapter, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. All the characteristics above may not be present in all cases, and a recipient must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subgrant or a contract.
