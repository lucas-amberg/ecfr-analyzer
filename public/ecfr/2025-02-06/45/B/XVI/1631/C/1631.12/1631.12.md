# ยง 1631.12   Disposing of personal property purchased with LSC funds.

(a) *Disposal by LSC recipients.* During the term of an LSC grant or contract, a recipient may dispose of personal property purchased with LSC funds by:


(1) Trading in the personal property when it acquires replacement property;


(2) Selling or otherwise disposing of the personal property with no further obligation to LSC when the fair market value of the personal property is negligible;


(3) Where the current fair market value of the personal property is $15,000 or less, selling the property at a reasonable negotiated price, without advertising;


(4) Where the current fair market value of the personal property exceeds $15,000, advertising the property for 14 days and selling the property after receiving reasonable offers. If the recipient receives no reasonable offers after advertising the property for 14 days, it may sell the property at a reasonable negotiated price;


(5) Transferring the property to another recipient of LSC funds; or


(6) With the approval of LSC, transferring the personal property to another nonprofit organization serving the poor in the same service area.


(b) *Disposal when no longer a recipient.* When a recipient stops receiving LSC funds, it must obtain LSC's approval to dispose of personal property purchased with LSC funds in one of the following ways:


(1) Transferring the property to another recipient of LSC funds, in which case the former recipient will be entitled to compensation in the amount of the percentage of the property's current fair market value that is equal to the percentage of the property's purchase cost borne by non-LSC funds;


(2) Transferring the property to another nonprofit organization serving the poor in the same service area, in which case LSC will be entitled to compensation from the recipient for the percentage of the property's current fair market value that is equal to the percentage of the property's purchase cost borne by LSC funds;


(3) Selling the property and retaining the proceeds from the sale after compensating LSC for the percentage of the property's current fair market value that is equal to the percentage of the property's purchase cost borne by LSC funds; or


(4) Retaining the property, in which case LSC will be entitled to compensation from the recipient for the percentage of the property's current fair market value that is equal to that percentage of the property's purchase cost borne by LSC funds.


(c) *Disposal upon merger with or succession by another LSC recipient.* When a recipient stops receiving LSC funds because it merged with or is succeeded by another grantee, the recipient may transfer the property to the new recipient, if the two entities execute an LSC-approved successor in interest agreement that requires the new recipient to use the property primarily to provide legal services to eligible clients under the requirements of the LSC Act, applicable appropriations acts, and LSC regulations.


(d) *Prohibition.* A recipient may not dispose of personal property by sale, donation, or other transfer of the property to its board members or employees.
