# ยง 1703.202   Provisions under which a meeting may be closed.

(a) A meeting or portion thereof may be closed to public observation, and information pertaining to such meeting may be withheld from the public, where the Commission determines that such portion or portions of its meeting or disclosure of such information is likely to: 


(1) Disclose matters that are: (i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and 


(ii) In fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order; 


(2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency; 


(3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552 of this title). Provided that such statute: (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or 


(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; 


(4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; 


(5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person; 


(6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; 


(7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would: (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings, 


(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, 


(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, 


(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, 


(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or 


(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel; 


(8) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; 


(9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action, except this subparagraph shall not apply in any instance where the agency has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the agency is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final agency action on such proposal; or 


(10) Specifically concern the agency's issuance of a subpoena, or the agency's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the agency of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in section 554 of this title or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing. 


(b) The Commission may exercise its authority to open to public observation a meeting which could be closed under one of the provisions of ยง 1703.202(a), if it would be in the public interest to do so. The Commission will determine whether the discussion comes within one of the specific exemptions. If the discussion is determined to be exempt, the Commission will consider and determine whether the public interest nevertheless requires that the meeting be open.
