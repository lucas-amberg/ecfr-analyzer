# ยง 1703.302   Role of observers.

The public may attend open meetings for the sole purpose of observation and may not record any of the discussions by means of electronic or other devices or cameras unless approved in advance by the Executive Committee of the Commission. Observers may not participate in meetings unless expressly invited or create distractions to interfere with the conduct and disposition of Commission business. Such participation or attempted participation shall be cause for removal of any person so engaged at the discretion of the presiding member of the Commission. When meetings are partially closed, observers will leave the meeting room promptly upon request so that discussion, of matters exempt under provisions of subpart B of this part, ยง 1703.202, may take place expeditiously.
