# ยง 1705.8   Appeal of an initial adverse agency determination on correction or amendment of the record.

An individual who disagrees with the refusal of the System Manager to correct or to amend his or her record may submit a request for review of such refusal to the Chairman of the Commission, 1717 K Street NW., Suite 601, Washington, DC 20036.
