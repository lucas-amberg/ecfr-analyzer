# ยง 1801.23   Recommendation by panel.

(a) Each Panel is asked to recommend to the Board of Trustees the name of one candidate from each state in the region to be appointed as a Truman Scholar. The Foundation may authorize each regional review panel to recommend additional Scholars from the States in its region. 


(b) A panel's recommendations are based on the material required under ยง 1801.17 and, as determined in the interview, the panel's assessment of each Finalist in terms of criteria presented in ยง 1801.22. 


(c) In the event that a regional review panel determines that none of the Finalists from a state meets all the requirements expected of a Truman Scholar, it does not provide a recommendation. The Foundation will carry over the Scholarship for that state making two Scholarships available the following year.
