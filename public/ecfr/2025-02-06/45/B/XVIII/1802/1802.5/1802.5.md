# § 1802.5   Procedure for announcing meetings.

(a) Except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of § 1802.4, in the case of each Board or committee meeting, the Executive Secretary, acting at the direction of the Board, shall publish in the _Federal Register,_ at least seven days before the meeting, the following information: 


(1) Time of the meeting; 


(2) Place of the meeting; 


(3) Subject matter of the meeting; 


(4) Whether the meeting or parts thereof are to be open or closed to the public; and 


(5) The name and phone number of the person designated by the Board or committee to respond to requests for information about the meeting. 


(b) The seven-day period for the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced if a majority of the members of the Board or committee, as applicable, determine by a recorded vote that Board or committee business requires that such expedited meeting be called at an earlier date. The Board or committee shall make public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time. 


(c) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a) only if the Executive Secretary, acting at the direction of the Board, publicly announces such change at the earliest practicable time. Such change need not be voted on by the members. 


(d) The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Board or committee, as applicable, to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section only if: (1) A majority of the entire voting membership of the Board or a majority of the entire voting membership of a committee, determines by a recorded vote that Board or committee business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and 


(2) The Board or committee publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon such change at the earliest practicable time. 


(e) The “earliest practicable time” as used in this section, means as soon as possible, which should in few, if any, instances be no later than commencement of the meeting or portion in question. 


(f) Immediately following each public announcement required by this section, notice of the time, place and subject matter of a meeting, whether the meeting is open or closed, any change in one of the preceding, and the name and phone number of the person designated by the Board or committee to respond to requests for information about the meeting, shall be submitted for publication in the _Federal Register._
