# § 1802.6   Procedure for closing meetings.

(a) Action to close a meeting or a portion thereof, pursuant to the exemptions set forth in § 1802.4, shall be taken only when a majority of the entire voting membership of the Board or a majority of the entire voting membership of a committee, as applicable, vote to take such action. Any such action shall include a specific finding by the Board that an open meeting is not required by the public interest. 


(b) A separate vote of the Board or committee members shall be taken with respect to each Board or committee meeting, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to § 1802.4 or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld under § 1802.4. 


(c) A single vote of the Board or committee may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series. 


(d) The vote of each member shall be recorded, and may be by notation voting, telephone polling or similar consideration. 


(e) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Board or a committee close such portion to the public under any of the exemptions relating to personal privacy, criminal accusation, or law enforcement information referred to in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of § 1802.4, the Board or committee, as applicable, upon request of any one of its members, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting. Where the Board receives such a request prior to a meeting, the Board may ascertain by notation voting, or similar consideration, the vote of each member of the Board, or committee, as applicable, as to the following: 


(1) Whether the business of the Board or committee permits consideration of the request at the next meeting, and delay of the matter in issue until the meeting following, or 


(2) Whether the members wish to close the meeting. 


(f) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (e), of this section, the Board or committee shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Board or committee shall, within one day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section, make publicly available a full written explanation of its action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation. The information required by this paragraph shall be disclosed except to the extent it is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of § 1802.4. 


(g) For every meeting closed pursuant to § 1802.4, the General Counsel of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation shall certify before the meeting may be closed that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the Board as part of the transcript, recording or minutes required by § 1802.7.
