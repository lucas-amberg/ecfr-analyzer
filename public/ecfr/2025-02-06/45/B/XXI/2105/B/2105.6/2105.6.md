# § 2105.6   What information should you include about your fee category?

(a) A request should indicate your fee category (that is, whether you are a commercial-use requester, news media, educational or noncommercial scientific institution, or other requester as described in §§ 2105.36 and 2105.37).


(b) If you submit a FOIA request on behalf of another person or organization (for example, if you are an attorney submitting a request on behalf of a client), the Agency will determine the fee category by considering the underlying requester's identity and intended use of the information.


(c) If your fee category is unclear, the Agency may ask you for additional information (*see* § 2105.49).
