# ยง 2105.11   What should you know about how the Agency processes requests?

(a) Except as described in ยง 2105.12, the Agency is responsible for responding to the request and for making a reasonable effort to search for responsive records.


(b) In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Agency will include only records in its possession and control on the date that it begins its search.


(c) The Agency will make reasonable efforts to search for the requested records. As part of its reasonable efforts, the Agency will search paper and/or electronic records (for example, emails), as appropriate. The Agency will not search for records in an electronic form or format if these efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the Agency's automated information system.


(d) If the Agency receives a request for records in its possession that it did not create or that another Federal agency is substantially concerned with, it may undertake consultations and/or referrals as described in ยง 2105.12.
