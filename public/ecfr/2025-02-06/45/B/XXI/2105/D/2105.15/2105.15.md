# ยง 2105.15   What is the basic time limit for responding to a request?

(a) Ordinarily, the Agency has 20 workdays (including the date of receipt) to determine whether to comply with a request, but unusual circumstances may allow the Agency to take longer than 20 workdays (*see* ยง 2105.17).


(b) A consultation or referral under ยง 2105.12 does not restart the statutory time limit for responding to a request.
