# ยง 2105.25   When will the Agency notify a submitter of a request for their possibly confidential information?

(a) Except as outlined in ยง 2105.27, an Agency must promptly notify a submitter in writing when it receives a FOIA request if:


(1) The requested information has been designated by the submitter as confidential information under ยง 2105.24(a); or


(2) The requested information has not been designated as confidential information by the submitter under ยง 2105.24(a), but the Agency identifies it as possibly confidential information.


(b) If a voluminous number of submitters are involved, the Agency may publish a notice in a manner reasonably calculated to reach the attention of the submitters (for example, in newspapers or newsletters, the Agency's website, or the _Federal Register_) instead of providing a written notice to each submitter.
