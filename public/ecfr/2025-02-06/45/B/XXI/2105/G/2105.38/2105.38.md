# ยง 2105.38   How will fee amounts be determined?

(a) The Agency will charge the types of fees discussed in this subpart unless a waiver of fees is required under ยง 2105.37 or has been granted under ยง 2105.43.


(b) Because the types of fees discussed in this subpart already account for the overhead costs associated with a given fee type, the Agency should not add any additional costs to those charges.
