# ยง 2105.53   What if other statutes require the Agency to charge fees?

(a) The fee schedule in appendix A to this part does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires the Agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records.


(b) If records otherwise responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule, the Agency will inform you whom to contact to obtain the records.
