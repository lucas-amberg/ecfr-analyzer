# ยง 2105.58   How are decisions on appeals issued?

(a) A decision on an appeal must be made in writing.


(b) A decision that upholds the Agency's determination in whole or in part must contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision must provide you with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform you of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Agency's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the Agency will notify you of that determination in writing. The Agency will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to you.


(c) Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Agency agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
