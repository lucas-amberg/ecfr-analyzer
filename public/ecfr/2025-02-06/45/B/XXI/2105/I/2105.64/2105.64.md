# ยง 2105.64   When will the Agency make records available without a FOIA request?

(a) Each Agency must:


(1) Determine which of its records must be made publicly available under the FOIA (for example, certain frequently requested records);


(2) Identify additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure; and


(3) Post those records in FOIA libraries.


(b) Because of these proactive disclosures, you are encouraged to review the Agency's FOIA libraries before filing a FOIA request. The material you seek may be immediately available electronically at no cost.
