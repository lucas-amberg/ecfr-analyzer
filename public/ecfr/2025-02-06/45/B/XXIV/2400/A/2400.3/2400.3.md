(3) Have demonstrated records of willingness to devote themselves to civic responsibilities and to professional and collegial activities within their schools and school districts; 


(4) Are highly recommended by their department heads, school heads, school district superintendents, or other supervisors; 


(5) Qualify for admission with graduate standing at accredited universities of their choice that offer master's degree programs allowing at least 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of the origins, principles, and development of the Constitution of the United States and of its comparison with the constitutions of other forms of government; 


(6) Are able to complete their proposed courses of graduate study within five calendar years from the commencement of study under their fellowships, normally through part-time study during summers or in evening or weekend programs;
