# ยง 2400.50   Allowances and Summer Institute costs.

At the Foundation's discretion, Fellows may be paid an allowance to help offset income foregone by their required attendance. The Foundation also funds the costs of the Institute and Fellows' round-trip transportation to and from the Institute site. The costs of tuition, required fees, books, room, and board entailed by the Institute will be paid for by the Foundation directly but may be offset against fellowship award limits if the credits earned for the Institute are included within the Fellows' degree requirements.
