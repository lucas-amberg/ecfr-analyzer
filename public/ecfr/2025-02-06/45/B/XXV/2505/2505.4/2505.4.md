# § 2505.4   On what grounds may the Board close a meeting or withhold information?

The Board may close a meeting or withhold information that otherwise would be required to be disclosed under §§ 2505.5, 2505.6 and 2505.7 if it properly determines that an open meeting or disclosure is likely to—


(a) Disclose matters that are—


(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy; and


(2) In fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;


(b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Corporation;


(c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552), provided that such statute—


(1) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or


(2) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;


(d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;


(e) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;


(f) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which, if written, would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would—


(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;


(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;


(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;


(5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or


(6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;


(h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institution;


(i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed action of the Corporation, except that this provision shall not apply in any instance where the Corporation has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Corporation is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final action; or


(j) Specifically concerning the Corporation's issuance of a subpoena or the Corporation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Corporation of a particular case of formal adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
