(2) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the Corporation related to the debt;


(3) An opportunity for a review within the Corporation of the decision of the Corporation related to the debt; and


(4) An opportunity to make a written agreement with the Chief Executive Officer to repay the amount of the debt.


(c) No collection by administrative offset will be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years, unless facts material to the Corporation's or the requesting Federal agency's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting the debt.


(d) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to:


(1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly prohibited by statute; or
