# ยง 2507.22   Aggregating requests to ensure payment of fees.

(a) When AmeriCorps reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a single request into multiple smaller requests so as to avoid fees, AmeriCorps may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly.


(1) AmeriCorps may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees.


(2) For requests separated by more than 30 days, AmeriCorps will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is justified in view of all the circumstances involved.


(b) Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
