# § 2509.14   What is the purpose of the review and clearance procedure?

CNCS's guidance issuance process shall ensure that each proposed guidance document satisfies the following requirements:


(a) The guidance document complies with all relevant statutes and regulations (including any statutory deadlines for Agency action);


(b) The guidance document identifies or includes:


(1) The term “guidance” or its functional equivalent;


(2) The issuing CNCS responsible office name;


(3) A unique identifier, including, at a minimum, the date of issuance and title of the document and its regulatory identification number (RIN), if applicable;


(4) The activity or entities to which the guidance applies;


(5) Citations to applicable statutes and regulations;


(6) A statement noting whether the guidance is intended to revise or replace any previously issued guidance and, if so, sufficient information to identify the previously issued guidance; and


(7) A short summary of the subject matter covered in the guidance document at the top of the document;


(c) The guidance document avoids using mandatory language, such as “shall,” “must,” “required,” or “requirement,” unless the language is describing an established statutory or regulatory requirement or is addressed to CNCS employees and will not foreclose CNCS's consideration of positions advanced by affected private parties;


(d) The guidance document is written in plain and understandable English; and


(e) All guidance documents should include the following disclaimer prominently in each guidance document: “The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.” When CNCS's guidance document is binding because binding guidance is authorized by law or because the guidance is incorporated into a contract, CNCS will modify the disclaimer above to reflect either of those facts.
