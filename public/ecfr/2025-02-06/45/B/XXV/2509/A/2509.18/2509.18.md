# § 2509.18   What procedures apply to guidance documents identified as “significant”?

(a) OGC review of proposed guidance documents will include a preliminary determination as to whether the proposed guidance document is significant within the meaning of §  2509.20. Unless exempt, each proposed guidance document determined to be significant must be approved by the Chief Executive Officer before issuance. In such instances, CNCS will:


(1) Obtain a RIN to report what CNCS is planning to issue;


(2) Coordinate the guidance document with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for the interagency review, final significance determination, and clearance; and


(3) Coordinate internal review and clearance of the guidance document before submitting it to the Chief Executive Officer for approval, consistent with CNCS Policy 103.


(b) If the guidance document is determined to be significant under §  2509.20, CNCS may proceed with publication in the _Federal Register._ For each significant guidance document, the originating CNCS office should include a statement in the clearance memorandum indicating that the guidance document has been reviewed and cleared in accordance with this section.
