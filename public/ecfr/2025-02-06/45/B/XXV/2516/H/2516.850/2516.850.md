# § 2516.850   What will the Corporation do to evaluate the overall success of the service-learning program?

(a) The Corporation will conduct independent evaluations. These evaluations will consider the opinions of participants and members of the communities where services are delivered. If appropriate, these evaluations will compare participants with individuals who have not participated in service-learning programs. These evaluations will— 


(1) Study the extent to which service-learning programs as a whole affect the involved communities; 


(2) Determine the extent to which service-learning programs as a whole increase academic learning of participants, enhance civic education, and foster continued community involvement; and 


(3) Determine the effectiveness of different program models. 


(b) The Corporation will also determine by June 30, 1995, whether outcomes of service-learning programs are defined and measured appropriately, and the implications of the results from such a study for authorized funding levels.
