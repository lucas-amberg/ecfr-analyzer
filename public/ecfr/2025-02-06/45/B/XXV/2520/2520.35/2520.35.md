# ยง 2520.35   Must my program recruit or support volunteers?

(a) Unless AmeriCorps or the State commission, as appropriate, approves otherwise, some component of your program that is supported through the grant awarded by AmeriCorps must involve recruiting or supporting volunteers.


(b) If you demonstrate that requiring your program to recruit or support volunteers would constitute a fundamental alteration to your program structure, AmeriCorps (or the State commission for formula programs) may waive the requirement in response to your written request for such a waiver in the grant application.
