# ยง 2521.80   What matching level applies if my program was funded in the past but has not recently received an AmeriCorps grant?

(a) If you have not been a direct recipient of an AmeriCorps operational grant from AmeriCorps or a State commission for five years or more, as determined by the end date of your most recent grant period, you may begin matching at the year one level, as reflected in the timetable in ยง 2521.60(a) of this part, upon receiving your new grant award.


(b) If you have not been a direct recipient of an AmeriCorps operational grant from AmeriCorps or a State commission for fewer than five years, you must begin matching at the same level you were matching at the end of your most recent grant period.
