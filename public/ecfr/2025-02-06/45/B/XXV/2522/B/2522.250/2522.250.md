# § 2522.250   What other benefits do AmeriCorps participants serving in approved AmeriCorps positions receive?

(a) *Child Care.* Grantees must provide child care through an eligible provider or a child care allowance in an amount determined by AmeriCorps to those full-time participants who need child care in order to participate. 


(1) *Need.* A participant is considered to need child care in order to participate in the program if he or she:


(i) Is the parent or legal guardian of, or is acting in loco parentis for, a child under 13 who resides with the participant; 


(ii) Has a family income that does not exceed 75 percent of the State's median income for a family of the same size; 


(iii) At the time of acceptance into the program, is not currently receiving child care assistance from another source, including a parent or guardian, which would continue to be provided while the participant serves in the program; and 


(iv) Certifies that he or she needs child care in order to participate in the program. 


(2) *Provider eligibility.* Eligible child care providers are those who are eligible child care providers as defined in the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858n(5)).


(3) *Child care allowance.* The amount of the child-care allowance may not exceed the applicable payment rate to an eligible provider established by the State for child care funded under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858c(4)(A)).


(4) *AmeriCorps share.* AmeriCorps will pay 100 percent of the child care allowance, or, if the program provides child care through an eligible provider, the actual cost of the care or the amount of the allowance, whichever is less. 


(b) *Health care.* (1) Grantees must provide to all eligible participants who meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section health care coverage that—


(i) Provides the minimum benefits determined by AmeriCorps; 


(ii) Provides the alternative minimum benefits determined by AmeriCorps; or 


(iii) Does not provide all of either the minimum or the alternative minimum benefits but that has a fair market value equal to or greater than the fair market value of a policy that provides the minimum benefits. 


(2) *Participant eligibility.* A full-time participant is eligible for health care benefits if he or she is not otherwise covered by a health benefits package providing minimum benefits established by AmeriCorps at the time he or she is accepted into a program. If, as a result of participation, or if, during the term of service, a participant demonstrates loss of coverage through no deliberate act of his or her own, such as parental or spousal job loss or disqualification from Medicaid, the participant will be eligible for health care benefits. 


(3) *AmeriCorps share.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, AmeriCorps' share of the cost of health coverage may not exceed 85 percent. 


(ii) AmeriCorps will pay no share of the cost of a policy that does not provide the minimum or alternative minimum benefits described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
