# ยง 2522.610   What is the difference in performance measurements requirements for competitive and formula programs?

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, State commissions are responsible for making the final determination of performance measures for State formula programs, while AmeriCorps makes the final determination for all other programs.


(b) AmeriCorps may, through the State commission, require that formula programs meet certain national performance measures above and beyond what the State commission has individually negotiated with its formula grantees.


(c) While State commissions must hold their sub-grantees responsible for their performance measures, a State commission, as a grantee, is responsible to AmeriCorps for its formula programs' performance measures.
