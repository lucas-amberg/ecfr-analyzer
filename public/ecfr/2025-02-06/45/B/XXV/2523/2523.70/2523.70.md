# ยง 2523.70   Will the Corporation give special consideration to Federal agency applications that address certain needs?

Yes. The Corporation will give special consideration to those applications that address the national priorities established by the Corporation. The Corporation may also give special consideration to those applications that demonstrate the agency's intent to leverage its own funds through a Corporation-approved partnership or consortium, by raising other funds from Federal or non-Federal sources, by giving grantees incentives to build service opportunities into their programs, by committing appropriate in-kind resources, or by other means.
