# ยง 2524.50   What are the guidelines for assistance with disaster relief?

(a) *Purpose.* Disaster relief funds are intended to provide emergency assistance not otherwise available to enable national and community service programs to respond quickly and effectively to a Presidentially-declared disaster. 


(b) *Eligibility.* Any AmeriCorps program (including youth corps, the National Civilian Community Corps, VISTA, and other programs authorized under the Domestic Volunteer Services Act) or grant making entity (such as a State or Federal agency) that is supported by the Corporation may apply for disaster relief grants. 


(c) *Application process.* Eligible applicants must comply with the requirements specified in the Corporation's application materials. 


(d) *Waivers.* In appropriate cases, due to the limited nature of disaster activities, the Corporation may waive specific program requirements such as matching requirements and the provision of AmeriCorps educational awards for participants supported with disaster relief funds.
