# § 2525.45   Can an Eligible Individual or Designated Recipient appeal a denied request for an extension?

(a) If an Eligible Individual or Designated Recipient submits a timely application for an extension and the application is denied, the individual may file an appeal. The appeal must:


(1) Be received within 30 days of the denial determination;


(2) Be made in writing—either online through the *My AmeriCorps* portal if the education award has not expired—or through a submission to the National Service Hotline at 1-800-942-2677;


(3) Explain why the initial determination was erroneous/should be reviewed; and,


(4) Include supporting documentation, if applicable.


(b) AmeriCorps may grant an appeal when, after review of all the information provided originally and on appeal, it appears that the extension should have been granted. AmeriCorps may ask for additional documentation to inform the appeal determination.


(c) Individuals who submit appeals will be notified in writing of the final determination.
