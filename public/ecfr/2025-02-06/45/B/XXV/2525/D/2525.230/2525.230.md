# § 2525.230   What steps are necessary to use an education award to pay all or part of the current educational expenses at an institution of higher education?

(a) *Required information.* Before disbursing funds from an education award to pay all or part of the current educational expenses at an institution of higher education, AmeriCorps must receive:


(1) An Eligible Individual's written authorization and request for a specific payment amount;


(2) Information from the institution of higher education as requested by AmeriCorps, including verification that—


(i) It has in effect a program participation agreement under section 487 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1094);


(ii) Its eligibility to participate in any of the programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 has not been limited, suspended, or terminated;


(iii) If an Eligible Individual who has used an education award withdraws or otherwise fails to complete the period of enrollment for which the education award was provided, the institution of higher education will ensure an appropriate refund to AmeriCorps of the unused portion of the education award under its own published refund policy, or if it does not have one, provide a pro-rata refund to AmeriCorps of the unused portion of the education award;


(iv) Individuals using education awards to pay for current educational expenses at that institution do not comprise more than 15 percent of the institution's total student population;


(v) The requested amount will be used to pay all or part of the Eligible Individual's educational expenses attributable to a course offered by the institution;


(vi) The requested amount does not exceed the difference between:


(A) The Eligible Individual's cost of attendance and other educational expenses; and


(B) The Eligible Individual's estimated student financial assistance for that period under Part A of Title IV of the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1070 *et seq.*).


(b) *Payment.* When AmeriCorps receives the information required under paragraph (a) of this section, it will pay the institution and notify the Eligible Individual of the payment.


(c) *Installment payments.* AmeriCorps will disburse the education award payment to the institution in at least two separate installments, none of which exceeds 50 percent of the total amount. The interval between installments may not be less than one-half of the period of enrollment, except as necessary to permit the second installment to be paid at the beginning of the second semester, quarter, or other division of a period of enrollment.
