# § 2525.270   What steps are necessary to use an education award to pay expenses incurred in enrolling in a G.I. Bill-approved program?

(a) *Required information.* Before disbursing funds from an education award for this purpose, AmeriCorps must receive:


(1) An individual's written authorization and request for a specific payment amount;


(2) Verification from the individual that they meet the criteria in § 2525.260; and


(3) Information from the educational institution or training establishment as requested by AmeriCorps, including verification that—


(i) The amount requested will be used to pay all or part of the individual's expenses attributable to a course, program of education, apprenticeship, or job training offered by the institution or establishment;


(ii) The course(s) or program(s) for which the individual is requesting to use the education award has been and is currently approved by the State approving agency for the State where the institution or establishment is located, or by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and


(iii) If an individual who has used an education award withdraws or otherwise fails to complete the period of enrollment for which the education award was provided, the institution or establishment will ensure a pro-rata refund to AmeriCorps of the unused portion of the education award.


(b) *Payment.* When AmeriCorps receives the information required under paragraph (a) of this section, it will pay the institution or establishment and notify the individual of the payment.
