# ยง 2525.450   Is there a limit on the amount of transferred education awards a Designated Recipient may receive?

(a) If the sum of the value of the requested transfer plus the aggregate value of education awards a Designated Recipient has previously earned or received, through the Designated Recipient's own service term or having previously been transferred an education award, would exceed the aggregate value of two full-time education awards, as determined pursuant to ยง 2525.50(b), the Designated Recipient will be deemed to have rejected that portion of the education award that would result in the excess.


(b) If a Designated Recipient has already received the aggregate value of two full-time education awards, they may not receive a transferred education award, and the Designated Recipient will be deemed to have rejected the education award in full.
