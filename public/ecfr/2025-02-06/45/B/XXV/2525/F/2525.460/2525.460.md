# ยง 2525.460   What is the impact of transferring or receiving a transferred education award on an Eligible Individual's eligibility to receive additional education awards?

(a) *Impact on transferring individual.* Pursuant to ยง 2525.50, an education award is considered to be received at the time it becomes available for a Designated Recipient's use. Transferring all or part of an award does not reduce the aggregate value of education awards the transferring individual is considered to have received.


(b) *Impact on Designated Recipient.* For the purposes of determining the value of the transferred education award under ยง 2525.50, a Designated Recipient will be considered to have received a value equal to the amount received divided by the amount of a full-time education award in the year the transferring Eligible Individual's position for that education award was approved.


(c) *Result of revocation on education award value.* If the Eligible Individual revokes the transferred education award, in whole or in part, the value of the education award considered to have been received by the Designated Recipient for purposes of ยง 2525.50 will be reduced accordingly.
