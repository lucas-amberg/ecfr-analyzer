# ยง 2525.485   What steps are necessary to revoke a transfer?

(a) *Request for revocation.* Before revoking a transfer, the transferring Eligible Individual must submit a request to AmeriCorps that includes:


(1) The Eligible Individual's written authorization to revoke the education award;


(2) The year in which the education award was earned;


(3) The specific amount to be revoked; and


(4) The identity of the Designated Recipient.


(b) *Used education awards.* A revocation may only apply to the portion of the transferred education award that has not been used by the Designated Recipient. If the Designated Recipient has used the entire transferred amount before AmeriCorps receives the revocation request, no amount will be returned to the transferring Eligible Individual. An amount is considered to be used when it is disbursed from the National Service Trust, not when a request is received for its use.


(c) *Notification to Designated Recipient.* AmeriCorps will notify the Designated Recipient of the amount being revoked as of the date of its receipt of the revocation request.


(d) *Timing of revocation.* AmeriCorps must receive the request to revoke the transfer from the transferring Eligible Individual before the education award's expiration as calculated pursuant to ยง 2525.40(a)(2), from the date the education award was originally earned.
