# § 2540.220   Under what circumstances and subject to what conditions are participants in Corporation-assisted programs eligible for family and medical leave?

(a) *Participants in State, local, or private nonprofits programs.* A participant in a State, local, or private nonprofit program receiving support from the Corporation is considered an eligible employee of the program's project sponsor under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 CFR part 825) if— 


(1) The participant has served for at least 12 months and 1,250 hours during the year preceding the start of the leave; and 


(2) The program's project sponsors engages in commerce or any industry or activity affecting commerce, and employs at least 50 employees for each working day during 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. 


(b) *Participants in Federal programs.* Participants in Federal programs operated by the Corporation or by another Federal agency will be considered Federal employees for the purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act if the participants have completed 12 months of service and the project sponsor is an employing agency as defined in 5 U.S.C 6381 *et seq.;* such participants therefore will be eligible for the same family and medical leave benefits afforded to such Federal employees. 


(c) *General terms and conditions.* Participants that qualify as eligible employees under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section are entitled to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a 12 month period for any of the following reasons (in the cases of both paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section the entitlement to leave expires 12 months after the birth or placement of such child): (1) The birth of a child to a participant; 


(2) The placement of a child with a participant for adoption or foster care; 


(3) The serious illness of a participant's spouse, child or parent; or 


(4) A participant's serious health condition that makes that participant unable to perform his or her essential service duties (a serious health condition is an illness or condition that requires either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider). 


(d) *Intermittent leave or reduced service.* The program, serving as the project sponsor, may allow a participant to take intermittent leave or reduce his or her service hours due to the birth of or placement of a child for adoption or foster care. The participant may also take leave to care for a seriously ill immediate family member or may take leave due to his or her own serious illness whenever it is medically necessary. 


(e) *Alternate placement.* If a participant requests intermittent leave or a reduced service hours due to a serious illness or a family member's sickness, and the need for leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the program, or project sponsor may temporarily transfer the participant to an alternative service position if the participant: (1) Is qualified for the position; and 


(2) Receives the same benefits such as stipend or living allowance and the position better accommodates the participants recurring periods of leave. 


(f) *Certification of cause.* A program, or project sponsor may require that the participant support a leave request with a certification from the health care provider of the participant or the participant's family member. If a program sponsor requests a certification, the participant must provide it in a timely manner. 


(g) *Continuance of coverage.* (1) If a State, local or private program provides for health insurance for the full-time participant, the sponsor must continue to provide comparable health coverage at the same level and conditions that coverage would have been provided for the duration of the participant's leave. 


(2) If the Federal program provides health insurance coverage for the full-time participant, the sponsor must also continue to provide the same health care coverage for the duration of the participant's leave. 


(h) *Failure to return.* If the participant fails to return to the program at the end of leave for any reason other than continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition or other circumstances beyond his or her control, the program may recover the premium that he or she paid during any period of unpaid leave. 


(i) *Applicability to term of service.* Any absence, due to family and medical leave, will not be counted towards the participant's term of service.
