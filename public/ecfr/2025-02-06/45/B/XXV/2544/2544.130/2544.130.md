(a) The Corporation will solicit and accept a donation only for the purpose of furthering the mission and goals of the Corporation.

(c) An official or employee of the Corporation will not solicit or accept a donation if the solicitation or acceptance would present a real or apparent conflict of interest.

(2) Has pecuniary interests that may be substantially affected by performance or nonperformance of the Corporation; or 


(3) Is an organization a majority of whose members are described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
