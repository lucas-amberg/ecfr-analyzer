(a) In general, an offer of donation should be made by providing a letter of tender that offers a donation. The letter should be directed to an official authorized to accept donations, describe the property or service offered, and specify any purpose for, or condition on, the use of the donation. 


(b) If an offer is made orally, the Corporation will send a letter of acknowledgment to the offeror. If the donor is anonymous, the Corporation will prepare a memorandum to the file acknowledging receipt of a tendered donation and describing the donation including any special terms or conditions. 


(c) Only those employees or officials with expressed notice of authority may accept donations on behalf of the Corporation. If an offer is directed to an unauthorized employee or official of the Corporation, that person must immediately forward the offer to an appropriate official for disposition.
