# ยง 2553.107   What must a sponsor do if it cannot meet its performance measures?

When a sponsor finds it is not on track to meet its performance measures, the sponsor must develop a plan to get back on track or submit a request to AmeriCorps to amend its performance measures. AmeriCorps may limit when amendments to performance measure can be submitted, as well as limit the types of changes a sponsor can make to performance measures. The request must include all of the following:


(a) Why the project is not on track to meet its performance requirements;


(b) How the project has been tracking performance measures;


(c) Evidence of corrective steps taken;


(d) Any new proposed performance measures; and


(e) A plan to ensure that the project will meet the new proposed measure(s).
