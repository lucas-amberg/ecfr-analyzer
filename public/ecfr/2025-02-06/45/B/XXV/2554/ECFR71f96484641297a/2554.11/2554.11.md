# § 2554.11   What is contained in a complaint?

(a) A complaint is a written statement giving notice to the person alleged to be liable under 31 U.S.C. 3802 of the specific allegations being referred for adjudication and of the person's right to request a hearing with respect to those allegations. The person alleged to have made false statements or to have submitted false claims to the Corporation is referred to as the “defendant.”


(b) The reviewing official may join in a single complaint, false claims or statements that are unrelated, or that were not submitted simultaneously, regardless of the amount of money or the value of property or services demanded or requested.


(c) The complaint will state that the Corporation seeks to impose civil penalties, assessments, or both, against each defendant and will include:


(1) The allegations of liability against each defendant, including the statutory basis for liability, identification of the claims or statements involved, and the reasons liability allegedly arises from such claims or statements;


(2) The maximum amount of penalties and assessments for which each defendant may be held liable;


(3) A statement that each defendant may request a hearing by filing an answer and may be represented by a representative;


(4) Instructions for filing such an answer;


(5) A warning that failure to file an answer within 30 days of service of the complaint will result in imposition of the maximum amount of penalties and assessments.


(d) The reviewing official must serve any complaint on the defendant and, if a hearing is requested by the defendant, provide a copy to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) assigned to the case.
