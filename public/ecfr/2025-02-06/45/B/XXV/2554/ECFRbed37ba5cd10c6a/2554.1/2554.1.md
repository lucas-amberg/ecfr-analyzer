# § 2554.1   Overview of regulations.

(a) *Statutory basis.* This part implements the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986, 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812 (“the Act”). The Act provides the Corporation and other federal agencies with an administrative remedy to impose civil penalties and assessments against persons making false claims and statements. The Act also provides due process protections to all persons who are subject to administrative proceedings under this part.


(b) *Possible remedies for program fraud.* In addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, a person who submits, or causes to be submitted, a false claim or a false statement to the Corporation is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $14,308 for each statement or claim, regardless of whether property, services, or money is actually delivered or paid by the Corporation. If the Corporation has made any payment, transferred property, or provided services in reliance on a false claim, the person submitting it also is subject to an assessment of not more than twice the amount of the false claim. This assessment is in lieu of damages sustained by the Corporation because of the false claim.
