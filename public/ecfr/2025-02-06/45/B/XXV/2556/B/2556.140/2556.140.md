(a) Termination means any action by AmeriCorps that permanently terminates or curtails assistance to all or any part of a sponsor's VISTA project prior to the time that the project term is concluded.


(b) AmeriCorps may terminate assistance to a sponsor in whole or in part for the sponsor's material failure to comply with an applicable term(s) or condition(s) of the DVSA, the regulations in this part, VISTA program policy, or an applicable Memorandum of Agreement.


(c) To initiate termination proceedings, AmeriCorps will notify the sponsor in writing that AmeriCorps is proposing to terminate assistance in whole or in part. The written notice will contain the following:


(1) A description of the VISTA assistance proposed for termination, the grounds that warrant such proposed termination, and the proposed date of effective termination;


(2) Instructions regarding the sponsor's opportunity, within 21 calendar days from the date the notice is issued, to respond in writing to the merits of the proposed termination and their right to request a full and fair hearing before a mutually agreed-upon impartial hearing officer; and


(3) Invitation of voluntary action by the sponsor to adequately correct the deficiency or deficiencies which led to AmeriCorps' notice of proposed termination.


(d) In deciding whether to effect termination of VISTA assistance, AmeriCorps will consider any relevant, timely material presented in writing; any relevant material presented during the course of any full and fair hearing; and any showing that the sponsor has adequately corrected the deficiency which led to the initiation of termination proceedings.


(e) Regardless of whether or not a full and fair hearing takes place, AmeriCorps retains all authority to make the final determination as to whether termination of VISTA assistance is appropriate.


(f) The sponsor will be informed of AmeriCorps' final determination on the proposed termination of VISTA assistance, and the basis or bases for the determination.


(g) AmeriCorps may, at its discretion, modify the terms, conditions, and nature of a termination action or rescind a termination action at any time on its own initiative, or upon a showing that the sponsor has adequately corrected the deficiency which led to the termination or the initiation of termination proceedings, and that repetition is not threatened.
