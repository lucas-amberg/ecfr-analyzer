(c) *Certificates issued.* (1) If a vessel meets the applicable requirements of the Convention, it shall be issued appropriate certificates listed in paragraph (a) of this section.

(f) *Availability of Certificates.* The Convention certificates must be on board the vessel and readily available for examination at all times. 


(g) *Foreign flag vessels.* At the request of the government of a country in which is registered a vessel engaged in an international voyage, such a vessel may be issued the applicable certificate or certificates listed in paragraph (a) of this section. The certificate will be issued only after inspection has been made by the issuing agency, providing the vessel is found to comply with the requirements of the Convention.
