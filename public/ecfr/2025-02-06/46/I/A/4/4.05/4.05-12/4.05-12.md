# § 4.05-12   Alcohol or drug use by individuals directly involved in casualties.

(a) For each marine casualty required to be reported by § 4.05-10, the marine employer shall determine whether there is any evidence of alcohol or drug use by individuals directly involved in the casualty.


(b) In the written report (Forms CG-2692 and CG-2692B) submitted for the casualty, the marine employer must include information that—


(1) Identifies those individuals for whom evidence of drug or alcohol use, or evidence of intoxication, has been obtained; and,


(2) Specifies the method used to obtain such evidence, such as personal observation of the individual, or by chemical testing of the individual.


(c) An entry shall be made in the official log book, if carried, pertaining to those individuals for whom evidence of intoxication is obtained. The individual must be informed of this entry and the entry must be witnessed by a second person.


(d) If an individual directly involved in a casualty refuses to submit to, or cooperate in, the administration of a timely chemical test, when directed by a law enforcement officer or by the marine employer, this fact must be noted in the official log book, if carried, and in the written report (Forms CG-2692 and CG-2692B), and shall be admissible as evidence in any administrative proceeding.
