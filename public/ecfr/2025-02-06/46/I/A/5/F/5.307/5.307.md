Upon application and for good cause shown, or upon its own initiative, the Coast Guard will seek judicial enforcement of subpoenas issued by investigating officers or Administrative Law Judges. This is done by making application to the United States District Court, through the office of the appropriate U.S. Attorney, to issue an order compelling the attendance of, and/or giving of testimony by, witnesses, or for the production of books, papers, documents, or any other relevant evidence.
