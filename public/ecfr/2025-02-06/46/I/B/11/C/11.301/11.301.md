(ii) Successful completion of an approved course; or


(iii) Successful completion of an approved program.


(3) The Coast Guard will publish assessment guidelines that should be used to document assessments that demonstrate meeting the standard of competence, as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Organizations may develop alternative assessment documentation for demonstrations of competence; however, such documentation must be approved by the Coast Guard prior to its use and submittal with an application.


(b) *Service.* (1) Service as a rating will not be accepted to raise of grade from the operational-level to management-level STCW endorsements.


(2) Service on the Great Lakes will be credited on a day-for-day basis for up to 100 percent of the total required service.


(3) Service on inland waters other than Great Lakes, which are navigable waters of the United States, will be credited on a day-for-day basis for up to 50 percent of the total required service.


(4) Service accrued onboard vessels with dual tonnages (both domestic and international) will be credited using the international tonnage for the credential sought.


(5) Applicants who cannot meet the requirement for 1 year of sea service within the last 5 years as described in § 11.303(c) of this subpart, will be required to meet the requirements of § 11.303(a) of this subpart.


(c) *Operational-level endorsement.* Applicants holding national officer endorsements, who seek to add an STCW endorsement at the operational level, must provide evidence of meeting the STCW requirements found in this subpart, including—


(1) Meeting the service requirements for the operational-level STCW endorsement;


(2) Satisfactory completion of the STCW operational-level standards of competence; and


(3) Satisfactory completion of the STCW operational-level training as required in this part.


(d) *Management-level endorsement.* Applicants holding national officer endorsements as Master, Chief Mate, Chief Engineer, or First Assistant Engineer, and who seek to add an STCW endorsement at the management level, must provide evidence of meeting the STCW requirements found in this subpart, including—


(1) Meeting the service requirements for the management-level STCW endorsement;


(2) Satisfactory completion of the STCW operational- and management-level standards of competence; and


(3) Satisfactory completion of the STCW operational- and management-level training as required in this part.


(e) *Training and assessment for Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA), Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), or Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).* Training and assessment in the use of ARPA, ECDIS, or GMDSS is not required for those who serve exclusively on ships not fitted with ARPA, ECDIS, or GMDSS. For ARPA and ECDIS, this limitation must be reflected in the endorsement issued to the seafarer concerned. GMDSS is a separate endorsement that will only be added if the applicant qualifies for it.


(f) *Exemptions and Limitations.* (1) The Coast Guard may exempt an applicant from meeting any individual knowledge, understanding, and proficiency required in the appropriate table of competence in the STCW Code. These exemptions must be approved by the Coast Guard based upon vessel type. Under these circumstances, the certificate may include a corresponding limitation. (2) A seafarer may have a limitation removed by providing the Coast Guard with evidence of having completed the individual knowledge, understanding, and proficiency required.


(g) Notwithstanding § 11.901 of this part, each mariner found qualified to hold any of the following national officer endorsements will also be entitled to hold an STCW endorsement corresponding to the service or other limitations or officer endorsements on the MMC. The vessels concerned are not subject to further obligation under STCW because of their special operating conditions as small vessels engaged in domestic, near-coastal voyages.


(1) Masters, Mates, or engineers endorsed for service on small passenger vessels that are subject to subchapter T or K of this chapter and that operate beyond the boundary line.


(2) Masters, Mates, or engineers endorsed for service on seagoing vessels of less than 200 GRT, other than passenger vessels subject to subchapter H of this chapter.


(h) Mariners serving on, and owners or operators of any of the following vessels, do not need to hold an STCW endorsement, because they are exempt from application of STCW:


(1) Fishing vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(11)(a).


(2) Fishing vessels used as fish-tender vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(11)(c).

(i) Mariners serving on, and owners or operators of uninspected passenger vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(42)(B), do not need to hold an STCW endorsement. The vessels concerned are not subject to further obligation under STCW because of their special operating conditions as small vessels engaged in domestic, near-coastal voyages.
