(f) A limited OUPV endorsement may be issued to an applicant to be employed by organizations such as formal camps, yacht clubs, educational institutions, and marinas. An endorsement issued under this paragraph will be limited to the specific activity and the locality of the camp, yacht club, or marina. In order to obtain this restricted endorsement, an applicant must—

An endorsement under this paragraph will be limited to specific bodies of water that have been approved by the cognizant OCMI. In order to obtain this endorsement, the applicant must be qualified for the endorsement under this section; however, the OCMI may modify the service and examination requirements as follows:
