# ยง 11.901   General provisions.

(a) Where required by ยง 11.903 of this subpart, each applicant for an endorsement listed in that section must pass an examination on the appropriate subjects listed in this subpart.


(b) If the endorsement is to be limited in a manner that would render any of the subject matter unnecessary or inappropriate, the examination may be amended accordingly by the Coast Guard. Limitations that may affect the examination content are as follows:


(1) Restricted routes for reduced service officer endorsements (Master or Mate of vessels of less than 200 GRT, OUPV, or Master or Mate (Pilot) of Towing Vessels).


(2) Limitations to a certain class or classes of vessels.


(c) Simulators used in assessments of competence required by subpart C of this part must meet the appropriate performance standards set out in Section A-I/12 of the STCW Code (incorporated by reference, see ยง 11.102 of this part). However, simulators installed or brought into use before February 1, 2002, need not meet these performance standards if they fulfill the objective of the assessment of competence or demonstration of proficiency.
