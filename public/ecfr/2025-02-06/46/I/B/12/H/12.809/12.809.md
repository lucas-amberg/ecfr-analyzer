(b) To meet the citizenship and identity requirements of this subpart, an applicant must provide an unexpired passport issued by the government of the country of which the applicant is a citizen or subject, and either a valid U.S. C-1/D Crewmember Visa or another valid U.S. visa or authority deemed acceptable by the Coast Guard.


(c) Any non-resident alien applying for an MMC under this subpart may not be a citizen of, or a temporary or permanent resident of, a country designated by the Department of State as a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371).
