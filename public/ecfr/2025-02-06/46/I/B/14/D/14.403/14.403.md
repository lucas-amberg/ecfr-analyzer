# § 14.403   Exemptions.

(a) Certain requirements of Title 46, United States Code do not apply to the employment of merchant mariners on oceanographic research vessels. These requirements are those concerned with, among other things, the shipment and discharge of mariners, their pay and allotments, and the adequacy of their clothing. 46 U.S.C. 2113(2) allows exemptions of oceanographic research vessels from certain requirements of parts B, C, F, or G of subtitle II of 46 U.S.C., upon such terms as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security deems suitable. The exemptions available under this subpart are subject to the following terms:


(1) No use of any exemption relieves the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel of other statutory responsibilities for the protection of every mariner under their command.


(2) If it is provided at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, the master or individual in charge must receive, consider, and appropriately address the legitimate complaint of any mariner.
