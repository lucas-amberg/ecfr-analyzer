(1) Meet the technical standards of the applicable Navigation Rules;


(2) Be certified by a laboratory listed by the Coast Guard to the standards of ABYC A-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 25.01-3), or equivalent, although portable battery-powered lights need only meet the requirements of the standard applicable to them; and


(3) Bear a permanent and indelible label stating the following:


(i) “USCG Approval 33 CFR 183.810”


(ii) “MEETS __.” (Insert the identification name or number of the standard under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to which the light was type-tested.)


(iii) “TESTED BY __.” (Insert the name or registered certification-mark of the laboratory listed by the Coast Guard that tested the fixture to the standard under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)


(iv) Name of Manufacturer.


(v) Number of Model.


(vi) Visibility of the light in nautical miles (nm).


(vii) Date on which the light was type-tested.
