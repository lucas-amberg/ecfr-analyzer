# § 27.209   What are the requirements for training crews to respond to fires?

(a) *Drills and instruction.* The master or person in charge of a vessel must ensure that each crewmember participates in drills and receives instruction at least once each month. The instruction may coincide with the drills, but need not. You must ensure that all crewmembers are familiar with their fire-fighting duties, and, specifically, with the following contingencies:


(1) Fighting a fire in the engine room and elsewhere on board the vessel, including how to—


(i) Operate all of the fire-extinguishing equipment on board the vessel;


(ii) Stop any mechanical ventilation system for the engine room and effectively seal all natural openings to the space to prevent leakage of the extinguishing agent; and


(iii) Operate the fuel shut-off for the engine room.


(2) Activating the general alarm.


(3) Reporting inoperative alarm systems and fire-detection systems.


(4) Putting on a fireman's outfit and a self-contained breathing apparatus, if the vessel is so equipped.


(b) *Alternative form of instruction.* The master or person in charge of a vessel may substitute, for the instruction required in paragraph (a) of this section, the viewing of video training materials concerning at least the contingencies listed in paragraph (a), followed by a discussion led by someone familiar with these contingencies. This instruction may occur either on board or off the vessel.


(c) *Participation in drills.* Drills must take place on board the vessel, as if there were an actual emergency. They must include—


(1) Participation by all crewmembers;


(2) Breaking out and using, or simulating the use of, emergency equipment;


(3) Testing of all alarm and detection systems; and


(4) Putting on protective clothing (by at least one person), if the vessel is so equipped.


(d) *Safety orientation.* The master or person in charge of a vessel must ensure that each crewmember who has not (i) participated in the drills required by paragraph (a) of this section, and (ii) received the instruction required by that paragraph, receives a safety orientation within 24 hours of reporting for duty.


(e) The safety orientation must cover the particular contingencies listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
