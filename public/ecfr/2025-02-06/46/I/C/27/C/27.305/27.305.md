# § 27.305   What are the requirements for fire-extinguishing equipment on towing vessels in ocean or coastal service whose construction was contracted for on or after August 27, 2003?

(a) You must carry on your towing vessel both—


(1) The minimum number of hand-portable fire extinguishers required by subpart 25.30 of this part; and


(2) An approved 160-B or 100 lb. CO_2_ extinguisher, regardless of rating, to protect the engine room.


(b) You must have a fixed fire-extinguishing system installed to protect the engine room of the vessel.


(c) This section does not apply to any towing vessel pushing a barge ahead, or hauling a barge alongside, when the barge's coastwise or Great Lakes route is restricted (as indicated on its certificate of inspection), so that the barge may operate “in fair weather only, within 12 miles of shore,” or with words to that effect.
