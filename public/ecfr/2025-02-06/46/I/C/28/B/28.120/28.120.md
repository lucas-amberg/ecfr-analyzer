(b) The requirements of this section do not apply to vessels less than 10.97 meters (36 feet) in length with 3 or fewer individuals on board which operate within 12 miles of the coastline.


(c) A buoyant apparatus may be substituted instead of the requirements in this section for vessels 10.97 meters (36 feet) or more in length with 3 or fewer individuals on board which operate within 12 miles of the coastline.


(d) Each survival craft installed on board a vessel before September 15, 1991, may continue to be used to meet the requirements of this section provided the survival craft is—


(1) Of the same type as required in tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel type; and


(2) Maintained in good and serviceable condition.


(e) Each inflatable liferaft installed on board a vessel before September 15, 1991, may continue to be used to meet the requirements for an approved inflatable liferaft, provided the existing liferaft is—

(2) Equipped with the equipment pack required by tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), as appropriate for the vessel type. Where no equipment pack is specified in tables 28.120(a), 28.120(b), or 28.120(c), a coastal service pack is the minimum required.

If the auxiliary craft is equipped with a Coast Guard required capacity plate, the boat must not be loaded so as to exceed the rated capacity.
