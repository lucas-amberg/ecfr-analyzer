(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, each vessel must be equipped as follows.


(1) Each vessel must be equipped with a VHF radiotelephone capable of transmitting and receiving on the frequency or frequencies within the 156-162 MHz band necessary to communicate with a public coast station or U.S. Coast Guard station serving the area in which the vessel is operating.


(2) Each vessel that operates more than 20 miles from the coastline, in addition to the VHF radiotelephone required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, must be equipped with a radiotelephone transceiver capable of transmitting and receiving on frequencies in the 2-4 MHz band necessary to communicate with a public coast station or U.S. Coast Guard station serving the area in which the vessel is operating.


(3) Each vessel that operates more than 100 miles from the coastline, in addition to the communication equipment required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be equipped with a radiotelephone transceiver capable of transmitting and receiving on frequencies in the 2-27.5 MHz band necessary to communicate with a public coast station or U.S. Coast Guard station serving the area in which the vessel is operating.


(4) Each vessel that operates in waters contiguous to Alaska where no public coast station or U.S. Coast Guard station is within communications range of a VHF radio transceiver operating on the 156-162 MHz band or the 2-4 MHz band, in addition to the VHF radio communication equipment required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, must be equipped with a radiotelephone transceiver capable of transmitting and receiving on frequencies in the 2-27.5 MHz band necessary to communicate with a public coast station or a U.S. Coast Guard station serving the area in which the vessel is operating.


(b) A single radio transceiver capable of meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) (2) and (3), or paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section, is acceptable.
