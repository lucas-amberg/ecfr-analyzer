(1) For a vessel 79 feet (24 meters) or more in length, the coaming must be at least 24 inches (0.61 meters) in height; or


(2) For a vessel less than 79 feet (24 meters) in length, the coaming must be at least 12 inches (0.30 meters) in height.


(c) A coaming to a fish hold that is under constant attention when the closure is not in place need only be 6 inches (0.15 meters) in height.


(d) The coaming of an opening fitted with a quick-acting watertight closure device need only be of sufficient height to accommodate the device.

This means of closing must be operable from a location which is outside the space containing the opening.
