# § 32.02-1   Means of escape—T/ALL.

On all tankships where the plans and arrangements will possibly permit, all passageways leading to living quarters, or places where anyone may be regularly employed, shall be provided with not less than two avenues of escape so located that if one of such avenues is not available another may be. The locality and arrangement of such additional means of escape shall be determined by the inspectors as will in their judgment best carry out the purpose for which this provision was made.
