# § 32.02-15   Guards at dangerous places—TB/ALL.

All exposed and dangerous places such as gears and machinery shall be properly protected with covers, guards or rails in order that the danger of accidents may be minimized. On vessels equipped with radio communication, the lead-ins shall be efficiently incased or insulated to insure against accidental shock. Such lead-ins shall be located so as not to interfere with the launching of lifeboats and life rafts.
