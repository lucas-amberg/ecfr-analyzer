# § 32.60-20   Pumprooms on tank vessels carrying Grade A, B, C, D and/or E liquid cargo—TB/ALL.

(a) *Cargo pumps.* In tank vessels carrying Grade A, B, C, or D liquid cargo, cargo pumps shall be isolated from source of vapor ignition by gastight bulkheads. A gastight bulkhead between the pumproom and the pump engine room may be pierced for drive shaft and pump engine control rods provided such openings are fitted with stuffing boxes or other approved gland arrangement. A steam driven pump shall not be considered a source of vapor ignition provided the steam temperature does not exceed 500 °F. 


(b) *Ventilation for pumprooms on tank vessels the construction or conversion of which is started between July 1, 1951, and January 1, 1963.* (1) Pumprooms of all tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started between July 1, 1951, and January 1, 1963, shall be ventilated in such a way as to remove vapors from points near the floor level or bilges. Pumprooms on tankships handling Grade A, B, or C liquid cargo, with machinery located below the freeboard deck, shall be equipped with power ventilation. Pumprooms equipped with power ventilation shall have the ventilation outlets terminate more than six feet from any opening to the interior part of the vessel which normally contains sources of vapor ignition. 


(2) For all tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started between October 1, 1959, and January 1, 1963, the power ventilation shall not produce a source of vapor ignition in either the pumproom or the ventilation systems associated with the pumproom. The capacity of power ventilation units shall be sufficient to effect a complete change of air in not more than 3 minutes, based upon the volume of the pumproom and associated trunks up to the deck at which access from the weather is provided. 


(c) *Ventilation for pumprooms on tank vessels the construction or conversion of which is started on or after January 1, 1963.* (1) For all tank vessels, the construction or conversion of which is started on or after January 1, 1963, the cargo pumprooms shall be fitted in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section. Cargo pumprooms on these vessels shall be ventilated in such a way as to remove vapors from points near the floor level or bilges. Cargo pumprooms on tank vessels handling Grade A, B, or C liquid cargo, shall be equipped with power ventilation of the exhaust type having capacity sufficient to effect a complete change of air in not more than 3 minutes based upon the volume of the pumproom and associated trunks up to the deck at which access from the weather is provided. 


(2) The power ventilation units shall not produce a source of vapor ignition in either the pumproom or the ventilation systems associated with the pumproom. Inlets to exhaust ducts shall be provided and located near the floor level at points where concentrations of vapors may be expected. Ventilation from the weather deck shall be provided. Power supply ventilation may be fitted in lieu of natural ventilation, but when fitted shall be arranged to avoid turbulence in the cargo pumproom. Cargo pumprooms equipped with power ventilation shall have the ventilation outlets terminate more than 6 feet from any opening to the interior part of the vessel which normally contains sources of vapor ignition, and shall be so located as to minimize the possibility of recirculating contaminated air through the pumproom. 


(3) Cargo pumprooms handling Grade D and/or E liquid cargo only shall be fitted with at least two ducts extended to the weather deck, one of which shall be extended to a point near the floor level. This does not preclude installation of power ventilation, if desired. 


(4) The ventilation required in this paragraph shall be sufficient to properly ventilate the pumproom with the access openings closed. 


(d) *Access.* The access to a cargo pumproom in a tank vessel carrying Grade A, B, C, or D liquid cargo shall be from the open deck.
