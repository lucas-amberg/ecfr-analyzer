# § 32.63-10   Rakes and coamings—B/ALL.

(a) Each barge hull shall be constructed with a suitable blow form (length, shape, and height of headlog) to protect against diving at the maximum speed at which the barge is designed to be towed. In any integrated tow, only the lead barge need comply with this requirement. In any case, the operator of the towing vessel shall be guided by appropriate speed limitations. 


(b) All open hopper type barge hulls shall be provided with coamings around the hopper space and, additionally, a 36-inch minimum height plowshare breakwater on the forward rake. Coamings shall have a minimum height of 36 inches forward graduated to a minimum height of 24 inches at midlength and 18 inches thereafter.
