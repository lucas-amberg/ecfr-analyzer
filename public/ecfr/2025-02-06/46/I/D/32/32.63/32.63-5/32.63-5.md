# § 32.63-5   Barge hull classifications—B/ALL.

(a) Each barge subject to the provision of this subpart shall be assigned a hull type number. The Commandant will designate the barge hull types to be used for carrying cargoes in order to insure that the vessel is designed consistent with the degree and nature of the hazard of the commodity carried. 


(b) For this purpose the barge hull types shall be as follows: 


(1) *Type I barge hull.* Barge hulls classed as Type I are those designed to carry products which require the maximum preventive measures to preclude the uncontrolled release of the cargo to the waterways and/or atmosphere. 


(2) *Type II barge hull.* Barge hulls classed as Type II are those designed to carry products which require substantial preventive measures to preclude uncontrolled release to the atmosphere, but whose uncontrolled release to the waterways does not constitute a longlasting public or operating personnel hazard, though local and temporary pollution may occur. 


(3) *Type III barge hull.* Barge hulls classed as Type III are those designed to carry products of sufficient hazard to require a moderate degree of control.
