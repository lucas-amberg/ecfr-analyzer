If cargo compartments are “specially suited for vehicles,” they shall be so indicated on the plan. Alternatively, at the discretion of the Commandant, the aforementioned details may be set out in any other medium, such as a booklet or on computer software, provided that the aforementioned details are available to each officer and a copy is retained on board at all times and is accessible during emergencies. For vessels constructed on or after September 30, 1997 or for existing vessels which have their plans redrawn, the symbols used to identify the aforementioned details shall be in accordance with IMO Assembly resolution A.654(16). These identical symbols can also be found in ASTM Adjunct F 1626 (incorporated by reference, see § 35.01-3).
