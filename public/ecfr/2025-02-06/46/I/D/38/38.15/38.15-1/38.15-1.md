A reduction in the required outage may be permitted by the Commandant when warranted by special design considerations. Normally then, the maximum volume to which a tank may be loaded is: 


(b) Nonrefrigerated tanks shall be filled so that their filling densities shall not exceed the ratios indicated in table 38.15-1(b).
