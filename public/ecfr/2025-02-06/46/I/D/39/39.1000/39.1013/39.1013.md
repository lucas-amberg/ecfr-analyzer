# § 39.1013   U.S.-flagged tank vessel certification procedures for vapor control system designs—TB/ALL.

(a) For an existing Coast Guard-approved vapor control system (VCS) that has been operating before July 23, 1990, the tank vessel owner or operator must submit detailed engineering drawings, calculations, and specifications to the Marine Safety Center (MSC) for review and approval before modifying the system or transferring vapor to a facility that was not approved by the Coast Guard for that kind of vapor transfer.


(b) For a Coast Guard-approved vessel VCS that began operating on or after July 23, 1990, the tank vessel owner or operator must submit plans, calculations, and specifications to the MSC for review and approval before modifying the system.


(c) A tank vessel owner or operator must submit plans, calculations, and specifications for a new tank vessel VCS to the MSC for review and approval before installing the system. A permanent or portable vapor processing unit onboard a tank vessel will be reviewed, together with the tank vessel, as a complete and integrated system.


(d) Once the plan review and inspection of the tank vessel VCS satisfy the requirements of this part, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) will endorse the Certificate of Inspection for the U.S.-flagged tank vessel.
