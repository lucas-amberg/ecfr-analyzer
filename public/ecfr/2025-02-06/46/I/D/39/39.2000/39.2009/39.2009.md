# § 39.2009   Tank barge liquid overfill protection—B/ALL.

(a) Each cargo tank of a tank barge must have one of the following liquid overfill protection arrangements:


(1) A system meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 39.2007 that—


(i) Includes a self-contained power supply;


(ii) Is powered by generators on the barge; or


(iii) Receives power from a facility and is fitted with a shore tie cable and a 120-volt, 20-ampere explosion-proof plug that meets—


(A) ANSI NEMA WD-6 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 39.1005);


(B) NFPA 70, Articles 406.9 and 501-145 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 39.1005); and


(C) 46 CFR 111.105-9;


(2) An intrinsically safe overfill control system that—


(i) Is independent of the cargo-gauging device required by 46 CFR 39.2003(a);


(ii) Activates an alarm and automatic shutdown system at the facility overfill control panel 60 seconds before the tank is 100 percent liquid-full during a facility-to-vessel cargo transfer;


(iii) Activates an alarm and automatic shutdown system on the vessel discharging cargo 60 seconds before the tank is 100 percent liquid-full during a vessel-to-vessel cargo transfer;


(iv) Can be inspected at the tank for proper operation prior to each loading;


(v) Consists of components that, individually or in series, will not generate or store a total of more than 1.2 volts (V), 0.1 amperes (A), 25 megawatts (MW), or 20 microJoules (µJ);


(vi) Has at least one tank overfill sensor switch per cargo tank that is designed to activate an alarm when its normally closed contacts are open;


(vii) Has all tank overfill sensor switches connected in series;


(viii) Has interconnecting cabling that meets 46 CFR 111.105-11(b) and (d), and 46 CFR 111.105-17(a); and


(ix) Has a male plug with a five-wire, 16-A connector body meeting IEC 60309-1 and IEC 60309-2 (both incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 39.1005), that is—


(A) Configured with pins S2 and R1 for the tank overfill sensor circuit, pin G connected to the cabling shield, and pins N and T3 reserved for an optional high-level alarm circuit meeting the requirements of this paragraph; and


(B) Labeled “Connector for Barge Overflow Control System” and labeled with the total inductance and capacitance of the connected switches and cabling;


(3) A spill valve that meets ASTM F1271 requirements (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 39.1005), and—


(i) Relieves at a predetermined pressure higher than the pressure at which the pressure relief valves meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 39.2011 operate;


(ii) Limits the maximum pressure at the top of the cargo tank during liquid overfill to not more than the maximum design working pressure for the tank when at the maximum loading rate for the tank; and


(iii) Has a means to prevent opening due to cargo sloshing while the vessel is in ocean or coastwise service; or


(4) A rupture disk arrangement that meets paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section and is approved by the Commandant.


(b) A tank barge authorized to carry a cargo having toxic properties, meaning they are listed in 46 CFR Table 151.05 with the “Special requirements” column referring to 46 CFR 151.50-5, must comply with the requirements of 46 CFR 39.2001(m).
