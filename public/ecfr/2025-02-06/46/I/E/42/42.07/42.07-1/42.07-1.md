(c) For Great Lakes vessels operating solely on Great Lakes voyages, the requirements for the applicable load line marks are in part 45 of this subchapter. Great Lakes vessels when making other international or unlimited coastwise voyages shall comply with the applicable requirements in parts 42, 44, and 45 of this subchapter. 


(d) For coastwise steam colliers, barges, and self-propelled barges in special services, the requirements for the applicable load line marks are in part 44 of this subchapter. These requirements also include certain regulations governing such vessels when they additionally engage in Great Lakes voyages, international voyages or unlimited coastwise voyages. Load line requirements in this part 42 also apply to such vessels when engaged on international or unlimited coastwise voyages. 


(e) Existing U.S.-flag vessels, as defined in § 42.05-30(a) of this chapter, engaged in international or coastwise voyages, may retain the load line assigned under previous regulations, provided:

(1) Signatory to or adhering to the 1966 Convention;


(2) Adhering to the 1930 Convention and not acceding to the 1966 Convention, or;


(3) Not adhering to either the 1930 Convention or the 1966 Convention but subject to the load line acts.
