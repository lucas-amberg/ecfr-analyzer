# ยง 42.13-30   Lines to be used with the load line mark.

(a) The lines which indicate the load line assigned in accordance with the regulations in this part shall be horizontal lines 9 inches in length and 1 inch in breadth which extend forward of, unless expressly provided otherwise, and at right angles to, a vertical line 1 inch in breadth marked at a distance 21 inches forward of the center of the ring (as illustrated in Figure 42.13-25(a)). 


(b) The following load lines shall be used: 


(1) The summer load line indicated by the upper edge of the line which passes through the center of the ring and also by a line marked *S.*

(2) The winter load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *W.*

(3) The winter North Atlantic load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *WNA.*

(4) The tropical load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *T.*

(5) The fresh water load line in summer indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *F.* The fresh water load line in summer is marked abaft the vertical line. The difference between the fresh water load line in summer and the summer load line is the allowance to be made for loading in fresh water at the other load lines. 


(6) The tropical fresh water load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *TF,* and marked abaft the vertical line. 


(c) If timber freeboards are assigned, the timber load lines shall be marked in addition to ordinary load lines. These lines shall be horizontal lines 9 inches in length and 1 inch in breadth which extend abaft unless expressly provided otherwise, and are at right angles to, a vertical line 1 inch in breadth marked at a distance 21 inches abaft the center of the ring (as illustrated in Figure 42.13-30(c)).


(d) The following timber load lines shall be used: 


(1) The summer timber load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *LS.*

(2) The winter timber load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *LW.*

(3) The winter North Atlantic timber load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *LWNA.*

(4) The tropical timber load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *LT.*

(5) The fresh water timber load line in summer indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *LF* and marked forward of the vertical line. 


(6) The tropical fresh water timber load line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked *LTF* and marked forward of the vertical line. 


(e) Where the characteristics of a vessel, or the nature of the vessel's service or navigational limits make any of the seasonal lines inapplicable, these lines may be omitted. 


(f) Where a vessel is assigned a greater than minimum freeboard so that the load line is marked at a position corresponding to, or lower than, the lowest seasonal load line assigned at minimum freeboard in accordance with the present Convention, only the fresh water load line need be marked. 


(g) On sailing vessels only the fresh water load line and the winter North Atlantic load line need be marked (as illustrated in Figure 42.13-30(g)). 


(h) Where a winter North Atlantic load line is identical with the winter load line corresponding to the same vertical line, this load line shall be marked *W.*

(i) Additional load lines required by other international conventions in force may be marked at right angles to and abaft the vertical line specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
