# ยง 42.15-30   Hatchways closed by weathertight covers of steel or other equivalent material fitted with gaskets and clamping devices.

(a) *Hatchway coamings.* At positions 1 and 2 the height above the deck of hatchway coamings fitted with weathertight hatch covers of steel or other equivalent material fitted with gaskets and clamping devices shall be as specified in ยง 42.15-25(a)(1). The height of these coamings may be reduced, or the coamings omitted entirely, on condition that the assigning authority is satisfied that the safety of the vessel is not thereby impaired in any sea conditions. Where coamings are provided they shall be of substantial construction. 


(b) *Weathertight covers.* (1) Where weathertight covers are of mild steel the strength shall be calculated with assumed loads not less than 358 pounds per square foot on hatchways in position 1, and not less than 255 pounds per square foot on hatchways in position 2, and the product of the maximum stress thus calculated and the factor of 4.25 shall not exceed the minimum ultimate strength of the material. They shall be so designed as to limit the deflection to not more than 0.0028 times the span under these loads. Mild steel plating forming the tops of covers shall be not less in thickness than one percent of the spacing of stiffeners or 0.24 inches if that be greater. The provisions of ยง 42.15-25(b)(4) are applicable for vessels of not more than 328 feet in length. 


(2) The strength and stiffness of covers made of materials other than mild steel shall be equivalent to those of mild steel to the satisfaction of the assigning authority. 


(c) *Means for securing weathertightness.* (1) The means for securing and maintaining weathertightness shall be to the satisfaction of the assigning authority. 


(2) The arrangements shall ensure that the tightness can be maintained in any sea conditions. For this purpose tests for tightness shall be required at the initial surveys, and may be required at periodical surveys and at annual surveys or at more frequent intervals.
