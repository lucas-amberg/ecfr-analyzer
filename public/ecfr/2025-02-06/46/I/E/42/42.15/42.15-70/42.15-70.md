# ยง 42.15-70   Freeing ports.

(a) Where bulwarks on the weather portions of freeboard or superstructure decks form wells, ample provision shall be made for rapidly freeing the deck of water and for draining them. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the minimum freeing port area (*A*) on each side of the vessel for each well on the freeboard deck shall be that given by the following formulae in cases where the sheer in way of the well is standard or greater than standard. The minimum area for each well on superstructure decks shall be one-half of the area given by the formulae. 


(1) Where the length of bulwark (*l*) in the well is 66 feet or less *A* = 7.6 + 0.115*l* (square feet) 


(2) Where *l* exceeds 66 feet *A* = 0.23*l* (square feet) 


(3) *l* need in no case be taken as greater than 0.7*L.*

(4) If the bulwark is more than 3.9 feet in average height the required area shall be increased by 0.04 square feet per foot of length of well for each foot difference in height. If the bulwark is less than 3 feet in average height, the required area may be decreased by 0.04 square feet per foot of length for each foot difference in height. 


(b) In vessels with no sheer the area calculated according to paragraph (a) of this section shall be increased by 50 percent. Where the sheer is less than the standard the percentage shall be obtained by linear interpolation. 


(c) Where a vessel is fitted with a trunk which does not comply with the requirements of ยง 42.20-55(a)(5) or where continuous or substantially continuous hatchway side coamings are fitted between detached superstructures the minimum area of the freeing port openings shall be calculated from table 42.15-70(c): 


(d) In vessels having superstructures which are open at either or both ends, adequate provision for freeing the space within such superstructures shall be provided to the satisfaction of the assigning authority. 


(e) The lower edges of the freeing ports shall be as near the deck as practicable. Two-thirds of the freeing port area required shall be provided in the half of the well nearest the lowest point of the sheer curve. 


(f) All such openings in the bulwarks shall be protected by rails or bars spaced approximately 9 inches apart. If shutters are fitted to freeing ports, ample clearance shall be provided to prevent jamming. Hinges shall have pins or bearings of noncorrodible material. If shutters are fitted with securing appliances, these appliances shall be of approved construction.
