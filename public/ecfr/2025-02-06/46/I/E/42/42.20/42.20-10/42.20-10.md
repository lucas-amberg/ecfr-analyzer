# § 42.20-10   Free surface.

When doing the calculations required in §§ 42.20-6(a), 42.20-7(a) and 42.20-8(a), the effect of free surface of the following liquids must be included:


(a) For each type of consumable liquid, the maximum free surface of at least one transverse pair of tanks or a single centerline tank must be included. The tank or combination of tanks must be that resulting in the greatest free surface effect.


(b) For cargo liquids, unless the compartment is assumed to be empty as required by § 42.20-9(b)(3), the free surface of those compartments containing liquids is calculated at an angle of heel of not more than 5 degrees.
