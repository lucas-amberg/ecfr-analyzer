# ยง 42.20-45   Length of superstructure.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the length of a superstructure (*S*) shall be the mean length of the parts of the superstructure which lie within the length (*L*). 


(b) Where the end bulkhead of an enclosed superstructure extends in a fair convex curve beyond its intersection with the superstructure sides, the length of the superstructure may be increased on the basis of an equivalent plane bulkhead. This increase shall be two-thirds of the fore and aft extent of curvature. The maximum curvature which may be taken into account in determining this increase is one-half the breadth of the superstructure at the point of intersection of the curved end of the superstructure with its side.
