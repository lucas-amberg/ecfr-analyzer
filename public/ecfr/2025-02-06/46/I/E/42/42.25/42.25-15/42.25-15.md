(a) *General.* (1) Openings in the weather deck over which cargo is stowed shall be securely closed and battened down. The ventilators shall be efficiently protected. 


(2) Timber deck cargo shall extend over at least the entire available length which is the total length of the well or wells between superstructures. Where there is no limiting superstructure at the after end, the timber shall extend at least to the after end of the aftermost hatchway. The timber shall be stowed as solidly as possible, to at least the standard height of a superstructure other than a raised quarter deck. 


(3) On a vessel within a seasonal winter zone in winter, the height of the deck cargo above the weather deck shall not exceed one-third of the extreme breadth of the vessel. 


(4) The timber deck cargo shall be compactly stowed, lashed, and secured. It shall not interfere in any way with the navigation and necessary work of the vessel. 


(b) *Upright.* (1) Uprights, when required by the nature of the timber, shall be of adequate strength considering the breadth of the vessel; the spacing shall be suitable for the length and character of timber carried, but shall not exceed 9.8 feet. Strong angles or metal sockets or equally efficient means shall be provided for securing the uprights. 


(c) *Lashings.* (1) Timber deck cargo shall be efficiently secured throughout its length by independent overall lashings spaced not more than 9.8 feet apart. Eye plates for these lashings shall be efficiently attached to the sheer strake or to the deck stringer plate at intervals of not more than 9.8 feet. The distance from an end bulkhead of a superstructure to the first eye plate shall be not more than 6.6 feet. Eye plates and lashings shall be provided 23
1/2 inches and 4.9 feet from the ends of timber deck cargoes where there is no bulkhead. 


(2) Lashings shall be not less than 
3/4-inch close link chain or flexible wire rope of equivalent strength, fitted with sliphooks and turnbuckles, which shall be accessible at all times. Wire rope lashings shall have a short length of long link chain to permit the length of lashings to be regulated. 


(3) When timber is in lengths less than 11.8 feet the spacing of the lashings shall be reduced or other suitable provisions made to suit the length of timber. 


(4) All fittings required for securing the lashings shall be of strength corresponding to the length of the lashings. 


(d) *Stability.* (1) Provision shall be made for a safe margin of stability at all stages of the voyage, regard being given to additions of weight, such as those due to absorption of water and icing and to losses of weight such as those due to consumption of fuel and stores. 


(e) *Protection of crew, access to machinery spaces, etc.* (1) In addition to the requirements of ยง 42.15-75(e) guardrails or life lines spaced not more than 13 inches apart vertically shall be provided on each side of the deck cargo to a height of at least 39
1/2 inches above the cargo. 


(f) *Steering arrangements.* (1) Steering arrangements shall be effectively protected from damage by cargo and, as far as practicable, shall be accessible. Efficient provision, shall be made for steering in the event of a breakdown in the main steering arrangements.
