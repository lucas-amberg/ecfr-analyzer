(a) *Northern boundary of the Tropical Zone.* The northern boundary of the Tropical Zone is the parallel of latitude 13° N. from the east coast of the American continent to longitude 60° W.; thence the rhumb line to a point in latitude 10° N., longitude 58° W.; thence the parallel of latitude 10° N. to longitude 20° W.; thence the meridian of longitude 20° W. to latitude 30° N.; thence the parallel of latitude 30° N. to the west coast of Africa; from the east coast of Africa the parallel of latitude 8° N. to longitude 70° E.; thence the meridian of longitude 70° E. to latitude 13° N.; thence the parallel of latitude 13° N. to the west coast of India; thence around the south coast of India to latitude 10°30′ N. on the east coast of India; thence the rhumb line to a point in latitude 9° N., longitude 82° E.; thence the meridian of longitude 82° E. to latitude 8° N.; thence the parallel of latitude 8° N. to the west coast of Malaysia; thence the coast of Southeast Asia to the east coast of Vietnam at latitude 10° N.; thence the parallel of latitude 10° N. to longitude 145° E.; thence the meridian of longitude 145° E. to latitude 13° N.; and thence the parallel of latitude 13° N. to the west coast of the American continent. 


(1) Saigon is to be considered as being on the boundary line of the Tropical Zone and the Seasonal Tropical Area. 


(b) *Southern boundary of the Tropical Zone.* The southern boundary of the Tropical Zone is the rhumb line from the Port of Santos, Brazil, to the point where the meridian of longitude 40° W. intersects the Tropic of Capricorn; thence the Tropic of Capricorn to the west coast of Africa; from the east coast of Africa the parallel of latitude 20° S. to the west coast of Madagascar; thence the west and north coasts of Madagascar to longitude 50° E.; thence the meridian of longitude 50° E. to latitude 10° S.; thence the parallel of latitude 10° S. to longitude 98° E.; thence the rhumb line to Port Darwin, Australia; thence the coasts of Australia and Wessel Island eastwards to Cape Wessel; thence the parallel of latitude 11° S. to the west side of Cape York; from the east side of Cape York the parallel of latitude 11° S. to longitude 150° W.; thence the rhumb line to the point latitude 26° S., longitude 75° W.; and thence the rhumb line to the west coast of the American continent at latitude 30° S. 


(1) Coquimbo and Santos are to be considered as being on the boundary line of the Tropical and Summer Zones. 


(c) *Areas to be included in the Tropical Zone.* The following areas are to be treated as included in the Tropical Zone: 


(1) The Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden, from Port Said to the meridian of longitude 45° E. 


(i) Aden and Berbera are to be considered as being on the boundary line of the Tropical Zone and the Seasonal Tropical Area. 


(2) The Persian Gulf of the meridian of longitude 59° E. 


(3) The area bounded by the parallel of latitude 22° S. from the east coast of Australia to the Great Barrier Reef, thence the Great Barrier Reef to latitude 11° S. The northern boundary of the area is the southern boundary of the Tropical Zone.
