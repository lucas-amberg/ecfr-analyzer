# § 44.05-25   Freeboards.

(a) *General.* (1) When the assigning authority is satisfied that the requirements of this part as applicable to the type of vessel under consideration are complied with the freeboards will be computed as described in this section. 


(2) The requirements in §§ 42.09-1 and 42.09-10 that relate to the assignment of freeboards and to stability are applicable to each vessel subject to the requirements in this part. 


(3) The assigning authority that assigns a vessel subject to the requirements in this part a freeboard under part 45 of this chapter shall do so in accordance with the requirements in effect as of October 1, 1972. 


(b) *Steam colliers.* Steam colliers that have constructional features similar to those of a tanker which afford extra invulnerability against the sea may be assigned a reduction of freeboard from that determined under part 42 of this subchapter. The amount of such reduction shall be determined by the assigning authority, in relation to the freeboard assigned to tankers, having regard to the degree of compliance with the supplementary conditions of assignment laid down for these ships, but without regard to the degree of subdivision provided. The freeboard assigned to such a vessel shall in no case be less than would be assigned the vessel as a tanker, as determined under part 42 of this subchapter. 


(c) *Towed cargo barges with cargo under deck.* The freeboard is to be computed under §§ 45.15-1 to 45.15-97 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter. 


(d) *Towed cargo barges with cargo only on deck.* The freeboard for barges of this type is to be computed in accordance with the requirements of §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be the same as determined under part 42 of this subchapter. 


(e) *Towed cargo barges of the open type.* The load line shall be placed where, in the judgment of the assigning authority, the draft will be such that no unusual hazard will be experienced. In general, drafts assigned will be such that the barge will remain afloat with a reasonable freeboard after flooding of the net available open space. 


(f) *Towed tank barges.* The freeboard is to be computed in accordance with §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter. 


(g) *Self-propelled cargo barges.* The freeboard is to be computed under §§ 45.15-1 to 45.20-15 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter. 


(h) *Self-propelled tank barges.* The freeboard is to be computed in accordance with §§ 45.20-1 to 45.20-70 of this subchapter. The fresh water and seasonal markings where applicable are to be determined under part 42 of this subchapter.
