# § 44.330   Obtaining working freeboards for hopper dredges.

A hopper dredge may be issued a working freeboard on a limited service domestic voyage load line certificate or a Great Lakes load line certificate if the following are met:

(b) The hopper dredge must— 


(1) Meet subpart I of part 174 of this chapter; and 


(2) Have on its bridge remote draft indicators that: 


(i) Show the fore, aft, and mean draft of the dredge at all times while the dredge is operating; and 


(ii) Have each indicator marked with the assigned freeboard and the working freeboard.
