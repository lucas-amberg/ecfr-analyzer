# ยง 45.15   Exemptions.

(a) The Commandant may exempt a ship from any of the requirements in this part if the chairman of the board of Steamship Inspections, Department of Transport, Canada, and the Commandant agree that the sheltered nature or the condition of that voyage make it unreasonable or impracticable to apply requirements of this part. 


(b) The Commandant may exempt a vessel that embodies features of a novel kind from any of the requirements of this part if those requirements might seriously impede research into the development of such features and their incorporation in ships. Any such vessel must comply with the safety requirements that, in the opinion of the Commandant, are adequate for the service for which the vessel is intended and will insure the overall safety of the vessel. If the Commandant grants an exemption pursuant to this paragraph he communicates the details of the exemption and the reasons therefor to the chairman of the board of Steamship Inspections. 


(c) A vessel that is not normally engaged on voyages to which this part applies but that, in exceptional circumstances, is required to undertake a single such voyage between two specific ports may be exempted by the Commandant from any of the requirements of this part, if the ship complies with safety requirements that, in the opinion of the Commandant are adequate for the voyage that is to be undertaken by the vessel. 


(d) Unmanned dry cargo river barges carrying non-hazardous cargoes on certain routes on Lake Michigan may be exempted from load line requirements in accordance with the conditions specified in subpart E of this part.
