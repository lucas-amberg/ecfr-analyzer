# § 45.61   Correction for superstructures and trunks.

(a) Where the effective length *E* of superstructures and trunks that meet the requirements of subpart D of this part is 1.0*L,* the minimum summer freeboard may be corrected by subtracting 
1/2H_s_. 


(b) Where the effective length of superstructures and trunks is less than 1.0*L* the minimum summer freeboard may be corrected by subtracting a percentage of one-half of the standard superstructure height (*H*_s_) determined by the formula: 


(c) To be eligible for the correction a trunk must—


(1) Be at least as strong and as stiff as a superstructure; 


(2) Have no opening in the freeboard deck in way of the trunk, except small access openings; 


(3) Have hatchway coamings and covers that meet §§ 45.143 through 45.147; 


(4) Provide a permanent working platform fore and aft with guardrails; 


(5) Provide fore and aft access between detached trunks and superstructures by permanent gangways; 


(6) Be at least 60 percent of the breadth of the ship in way of the trunk; and 


(7) Be at least 0.6 *L* in length, if no superstructure, is provided.
