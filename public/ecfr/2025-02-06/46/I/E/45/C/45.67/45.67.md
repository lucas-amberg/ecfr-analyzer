# ยง 45.67   Sheer measurement.

(a) The sheer is measured from the freeboard deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line at amidships; 


(b) In ships designed with a rake of keel or designed to trim by the stern, the sheer must be measured in reference to a line drawn through the sheer line at amidships parallel to the design load waterline. 


(c) In flush deck ships and in ships with detached superstructures, the sheer must be measured at the freeboard deck. 


(d) In ships with a step or break in the topsides, the sheer must be measured from the equivalent depth amidships. 


(e) In vessels with a superstructure of standard height that extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer must be measured on the superstructure deck. Where the height of superstructure exceeds the standard, the least difference (Z) between the actual and standard heights must be added to each end ordinate. Similarly, the intermediate ordinates at distance of 
1/6*L* and 
1/3*L* from each perpendicular must be increased by 0.444 Z and 0.111 Z respectively.
