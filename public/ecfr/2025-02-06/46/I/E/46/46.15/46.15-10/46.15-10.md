# § 46.15-10   Subdivision load lines.

(a) Subdivision load lines shall be located by measuring vertically down from the deck line required by part 42 of this subchapter. 


(b) The length, width, and manner of marking the lines shall be as provided in subpart 42.13 of this subchapter. 


(c) No subdivision load line is to be placed so that the freeboard is reduced from that determined by the highest seasonal mark permitted by part 42. 


(d) When the highest subdivision load line is located on a vessel used as a passenger vessel in a position between the highest and lowest seasonal load line marks, the seasonal load line marks above the subdivision load line will be omitted and those below will be marked. 


(e) When the freeboard from the highest subdivision load line on a vessel used as a passenger vessel is greater than the freeboard from the lowest load line permitted by part 42 of this subchapter, the load lines required by part 42 of this subchapter shall be omitted and the disk with its horizontal line located in line with the highest subdivision load line. 


(f) One fresh water line shall be marked. When a subdivision and a normal load line are combined, the normal fresh water line only shall be used unless the position of the subdivision load line is such that confusion will result, in which case a subdivision fresh water line may be used, marked FC_1_ and the normal fresh water line omitted. 


(g) Subdivision load lines shall be aft of the vertical line. The vertical line shall be extended as necessary to connect the lowest and highest load lines marked on the vessel. 


(h) When a vessel has spaces used for cargo and passengers alternatively so that the position of the subdivision load line varies with the service, subdivision load lines for the principal passenger condition shall be marked and denoted by C_1_ and the alternative conditions marked and denoted by C_2_, C_3_, etc. The position of each load line and the conditions under which a particular load line is applicable shall be noted in the certificate. 


(i) The principal passenger condition for a vessel having spaces used for passengers and cargo alternatively is the condition where only those spaces appropriated exclusively to passengers are taken into consideration for determination of the subdivision load line. 


(j) For Great Lakes vessels, references to part 42 shall read part 45 and a “diamond” shall be substituted for the “disk”. No “fresh water” line will be marked.
