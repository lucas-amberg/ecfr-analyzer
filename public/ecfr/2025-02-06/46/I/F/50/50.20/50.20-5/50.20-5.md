# ยง 50.20-5   Procedures for submittal of plans.

(a) As the relative locations of shipyards, design offices, and Coast Guard offices vary throughout the country, no specific routing will be required in the submittal of plans. In general, one of the procedures outlined in this section apply, but if a more expeditious procedure can be used, there will normally be no objection to it.


(b) The plans may be submitted in duplicate to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, at or nearest the place where the vessel is to be built. Alternatively, the plans may be submitted to the Marine Safety Center.


(c) In the case of classed vessels, upon specific request by the submitter, the American Bureau of Shipping will arrange to forward the necessary plans to the Coast Guard indicating its action thereon.
