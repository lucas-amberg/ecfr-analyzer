# § 52.01-135   Inspection and tests (modifies PG-90 through PG-100).

(a) *Requirements.* Inspection and test of boilers and boiler pressure parts must be as indicated in PG-90 through PG-100 of Section I of the ASME BPVC (incorporated by reference; see § 52.01-1) except as noted otherwise in this section.


(b) *Inspection personnel.* The inspections required by PG-90 through PG-100 of Section I of the ASME BPVC must be performed by the “Authorized Inspector” as defined in PG-91 of Section I of the ASME BPVC. The Authorized Inspector must hold a valid commission issued by the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors. After installation, boilers will be inspected for compliance with this part by the “Marine Inspector” as defined in § 50.10-15 of this subchapter.


(c) *Hydrostatic test.* (Modifies PG-99.) Each new boiler must be hydrostatically tested after installation to 1.5 times the maximum allowable working pressure as indicated in PG-99 of Section I of the ASME BPVC. Before the boilers are insulated, accessible parts of the boiler must be emptied, opened, and all interior surfaces must be examined by the marine inspector to ascertain that no defects have occurred due to the hydrostatic test.


(d) *Operating tests.* In addition to hydrostatic tests prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, automatically controlled propulsion and auxiliary boilers must be subjected to operating tests as specified in §§ 61.30-20, 61.35-1, 61.35-3, 62.30-10, 63.15-9, 63.25-3, and 63.25-5 of this subchapter, as appropriate, or as directed by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, for propulsion boilers. These tests are to be performed after final installation.
