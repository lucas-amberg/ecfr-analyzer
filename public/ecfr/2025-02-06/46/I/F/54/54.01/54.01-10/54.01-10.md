(a) Pressure vessels in which steam is generated are classed as “Unfired Steam Boilers” except as required otherwise by paragraph (b) of this section. Unfired steam boilers must be fitted with an efficient water level indicator, a pressure gage, a blowdown valve, and an approved safety valve as required by § 54.15-15. Unfired steam boilers must be constructed in accordance with this part other than when the pressures are more than 206 kPa (30 psig) or the temperatures of the working fluid are more than 454  °C (850  °F) when such boilers must be constructed in accordance with part 52 of this subchapter.


(b) Vessels known as “Evaporators” or “Heat Exchangers” are not classified as unfired steam boilers. They must be fitted with an approved safety device as required under § 54.15-15 and constructed in accordance with this part.
