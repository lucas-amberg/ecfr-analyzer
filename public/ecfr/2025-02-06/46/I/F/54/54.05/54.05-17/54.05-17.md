# ยง 54.05-17   Weld toughness test acceptance criteria.

(a) For Charpy V-notch impact tests the energy absorbed in both the weld metal and heat affected zone impact tests in weld qualification and production must be:


(1) For weld metal specimens, not less than the transverse values required for the parent material.


(2) For heat affected zone specimens, when the specimens are transversely oriented, not less than the transverse values required for the parent material.


(3) For heat affected zone specimens, when the specimens are longitudinally oriented, not less than 1.5 times the transverse values required for the parent material.


(b) For drop-weight tests both specimens from each required set must exhibit a no-break performance.
