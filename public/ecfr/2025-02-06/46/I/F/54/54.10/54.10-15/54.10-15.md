# § 54.10-15   Pneumatic test (modifies UG-100).

(a) Pneumatic testing of welded pressure vessels is permitted only for those units which are so designed and supported that they cannot be safely filled with water, or for those units which cannot be dried and are to be used in a service where traces of the testing medium cannot be tolerated.


(b) Proposals to pneumatically test must be submitted to the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, for approval.


(c) Except for enameled vessels, for which the pneumatic test pressure must be at least equal to, but need not exceed, the maximum allowable working pressure to be marked on the vessel, the pneumatic test pressure must be at least equal to one and one-tenth (1.10) times the maximum allowable working pressure to be stamped on the vessel multiplied by the lowest ratio (for the materials of which the vessel is constructed) of the stress value “S” for the test temperature of the vessel to the stress value “S” for the design temperature (see UG-21 of Section VIII of the ASME BPVC (incorporated by reference; see § 54.01-1)). In no case must the pneumatic test pressure exceed one and one-tenth (1.10) times the basis for calculated test pressure as defined in UA-60(e) of Section VIII of the ASME BPVC.


(d) The pneumatic test of pressure vessels must be accomplished as follows:


(1) The pressure on the vessel must be gradually increased to not more than half the test pressure.


(2) The pressure will then be increased at steps of approximately one-tenth the test pressure until the test pressure has been reached.


(3) The pressure will then be reduced to the maximum allowable working pressure of the vessel to permit examination.


(e) Pressure vessels pneumatically tested must also be leak tested. The test must be capable of detecting leakage consistent with the design requirements of the pressure vessel. Details of the leak test shall be submitted to the Commandant for approval.


(f) After satisfactory completion of the pneumatic pressure test, the vessel may be stamped in accordance with § 54.10-20. A marine inspector must observe the pressure vessel in a loaded condition at the first opportunity following the pneumatic test. The tank supports and saddles, connecting piping, and insulation if provided must be examined to determine if they are satisfactory and that no leaks are evident.


(g) The pneumatic test is inherently more hazardous than a hydrostatic test, and suitable precautions must be taken to protect personnel and adjacent property.
