# § 54.15-13   Rupture disks (modifies UG-127).

(a) Paragraph UG-127 of Section VIII of the ASME BPVC (incorporated by reference; see § 54.01-1) provides for the use of rupture disks in series with spring loaded safety or relief valves.


(b) For certain pressure vessels containing substances which may render a relief or safety valve inoperative, or where the installation of a valve is considered impractical, the Commandant may authorize or require the use of a rupture disk in parallel with or in lieu of a spring-loaded safety or relief valve. These rupture disks must:


(1) Comply with the general provisions of § 54.15-5 except as noted otherwise in this section;


(2) Have a capacity for discharge such that the volume of release is sufficient to prevent the internal pressure from exceeding 120 percent of the “maximum allowable working pressure” with the pressure vessel exposed to fire conditions (see § 54.15-25); and,


(3) Operate at a pressure level which does not produce fatigue failure of the disk. The normal maximum operating pressure multiplied by 1.3 must not exceed the nominal disk burst pressure. (Notice that this restriction for protection of the rupture disk will usually require operation below the “maximum allowable working pressure” of the pressure vessel and therefore should be considered in design.)


(c) All disks must be oriented so that if rupture occurs, the disk fragments and pressure vessel discharge will be directed away from operating personnel and vital machinery.
