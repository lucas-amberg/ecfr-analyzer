# § 54.30-10   Method of performing mechanical stress relief.

(a) The mechanical stress relief must be carried out in accordance with the following stipulations using water as the pressurizing medium:


(1) At a hydrostatic pressure (measured at the tank top) of 1.5 times the design pressure. (See UA-60(e) of Section VIII of the ASME BPVC (incorporated by reference; see § 54.01-1).)


(2) At a temperature of 70  °F or the service temperature plus 50  °F, whichever is higher. Where the ambient temperature is below 70  °F, and use of water at that temperature is not practical, the minimum temperature for mechanical stress relief may be below 70  °F but must not be less than 50  °F above service temperature.


(3) The stress relief must be at the required temperature and pressure and held for a period not less than 2 hours per inch of metal thickness, but in no case less than 2 hours.


(b) It is considered preferable that mechanical stress relief be accomplished with the tanks in place on their saddles or supporting structure in the barge or ship in which they will be utilized. In any case, it is considered mandatory that the tank be supported only by its regular saddles or supporting structure, without any auxiliary or temporary supports.
