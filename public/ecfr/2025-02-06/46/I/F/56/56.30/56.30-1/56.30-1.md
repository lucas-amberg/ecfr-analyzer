# § 56.30-1   Scope (replaces 110 through 118).

The selection and limitation of piping joints must be as required by this subpart rather than as required by 110 through 118 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see § 56.01-2); however, certain requirements are marked “reproduced” in this subpart.
