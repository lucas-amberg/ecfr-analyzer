# § 56.30-30   Brazed joints.

(a) *General (refer also to subpart 56.75).* The minimum socket depth must be sufficient for the intended service. Brazing alloy must either be end-fed into the socket or must be provided in the form of a preinserted ring in a groove in the socket. The brazing alloy must be sufficient to fill completely the annular clearance between the socket and the pipe or tube.


(b) *Limitations.* (1) Brazed socket-type joints must not be used on systems containing flammable or combustible fluids in areas where fire hazards are involved or where the service temperature exceeds 425  °F. Higher temperature service must be approved by the Commandant.


(2) Brazed joints depending solely upon a fillet, rather than primarily upon brazing material between the pipe and socket are not acceptable.
