(b) *Addition of temporary supports.* Piping systems designed for vapor or gas may be provided with additional temporary supports, if necessary.


(c) *Restraint or isolation of expansion joints.* Expansion joints must be provided with temporary restraint, if required for the additional pressure load under test.


(d) *Isolation of equipment not subjected to pressure test.* Equipment that is not to be subjected to the pressure test must be isolated by a blank flange or equivalent means.


(e) *Treatment of flanged joints containing blinds.* Flanged joints at which blinds are inserted to blank off other equipment during the test need not be tested.


(f) *Precautions against test medium expansion.* If a pressure test is to be maintained for a period of time and the test medium in the system is subject to thermal expansion, precautions must be taken to avoid excessive pressure. A small relief valve set to 1 1/3 times the test pressure is recommended during the pressure test.
