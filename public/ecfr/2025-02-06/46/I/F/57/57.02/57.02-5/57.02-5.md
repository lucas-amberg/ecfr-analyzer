(a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, when filler metal is used in a welded fabrication that is required to meet the requirements of this part the filler metal must be one that has been approved by the American Bureau of Shipping.


(b) In instances where a fabricator desires to use a filler metal which has not been approved by the American Bureau of Shipping the approval of the filler metal can be made by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection on the basis of the fabricator passing the weld procedure qualification tests as outlined in this part. This alternate means of approval applies to wire-gas and wire-flux combinations as well as to stick electrodes. Filler metal approvals given in this manner will extend only to the specific fabricator to whom they are granted.
