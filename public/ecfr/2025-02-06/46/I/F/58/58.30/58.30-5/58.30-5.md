(a) The requirements of part 56 of this subchapter are also applicable to piping and fittings in fluid power and control systems listed in ยง 58.30-1, except as modified herein. The designer should consider the additional pressure due to hydraulic shock.


(b) The system must be so designed that proper functioning of any unit must not be affected by the back pressure in the system. The design must be such that malfunctioning of any unit in the system will not render any other connected or emergency system inoperative because of back pressure.


(c) Pneumatic systems with a maximum allowable working pressure in excess of 150 psi must be designed with a surge tank or other acceptable means of pulsation dampening.


(d) Each pneumatic system must minimize the entry of oil into the system and must drain the system of liquids.
