# ยง 59.15-10   Bagged or blistered shell plates.

(a) When the shell plates of cylindrical boilers which are exposed to the radiant heat of the fire become bagged or blistered, it is the duty of the chief engineer to notify the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, for examination before raising steam on the boiler.


(b) Where the shell plate is bagged due to overheating, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may, if in their judgment it is practicable, permit the same to be driven back to its original position.


(c) Where the shell plate has blistered, bagged, or bulged to such an extent that there is an appreciable thinning of the plate, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, must require the defective portion to be cut away and the shell repaired by fitting a patch of steel plate conforming to the requirements of ยง 52.01-90 of this subchapter in place of the defective portion. Care must be taken that the riveting schedule of the patch is so arranged as to give the plate sufficient strength to withstand the stress placed on it in service.
