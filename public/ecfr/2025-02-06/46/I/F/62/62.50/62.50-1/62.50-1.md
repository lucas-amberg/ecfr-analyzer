# § 62.50-1   General.

(a) Where automated systems are provided to replace specific personnel in the control and observation of the engineering plant and spaces, or reduce overall crew requirements, the arrangements must make sure that under all sailing conditions, including maneuvering, the safety of the vessel is equal to that of the same vessel with the entire plant under fully attended direct manual supervision. 


(b) Coast Guard acceptance of automated systems to replace specific personnel or to reduce overall crew requirements is predicated upon— 


(1) The capabilities of the automated systems; 


(2) The combination of the personnel, equipment, and systems necessary to ensure the safety of the vessel, personnel, and environment in all sailing conditions, including maneuvering; 


(3) The ability of the crew to perform all operational evolutions, including emergencies such as fire or control or monitoring system failure; 


(4) A planned maintenance program including routine maintenance, inspection, and testing to ensure the continued safe operation of the vessel; and 


(5) The automated system's demonstrated reliability during an initial trial period, and its continuing reliability.


(c) Equipment provided to replace specific personnel or to reduce overall crew requirements that proves unsafe or unreliable in the judgment of the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, must be replaced or repaired or vessel manning will be modified to compensate for the equipment inadequacy.
