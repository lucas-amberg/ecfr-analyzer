# § 64.5   Definitions.

As used in this part: 


(a) *Marine portable tank* or *MPT* means a liquid-carrying tank that—


(1) Has a capacity of 110 gallons or more;


(2) Is designed to be carried on a vessel;


(3) Can be lifted full or empty onto and off a vessel, and can be filled and discharged while on a vessel;


(4) Is not permanently attached to the vessel; and


(5) Was inspected and stamped by the Coast Guard on or before September 30, 1992.


(b) *Tank* means the pressure vessel and the associated fittings of an MPT that come in contact with the product being carried. 


(c) *Total containment pressure* means the minimum pressure for total product containment under normal operating conditions at a gauge pressure consisting of the absolute vapor pressure of the product at 122 °F added to the dynamic pressure, based on the tank dimensions and the location of the relief devices, of not less than 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) at the top of the tank in the operating position. 


(d) *Maximum allowable working pressure* means the maximum gauge pressure at the top of the tank in the operating position at 122  °F, equal to or greater than the total containment pressure as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. The maximum allowable working pressure is used in the calculation of the minimum thickness of each element of the tank, excluding the allowance for corrosion and the thickness for loadings other than pressure, as provided for in Section VIII of the ASME BPVC (incorporated by reference, see § 64.2).


(e) *Test pressure* means a hydrostatic pressure of at least one and one-half times the maximum allowable working pressure. 


(f) *Dynamic loading conditions* means the following: 


(1) A loading in the vertical down direction equal to 2 times the weight of the tank and the heaviest product carried. 


(2) A loading in the transverse direction equal to the weight of the tank and the heaviest product carried. 


(3) A loading in the longitudinal direction equal to the weight of the tank and the heaviest product carried. 


(g) *Owner* means the person, corporation, company, partnership, or organization in which is vested the ownership, dominion, or title of a portable tank.
