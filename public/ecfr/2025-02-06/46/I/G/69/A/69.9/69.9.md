# § 69.9   Definitions.

As used in this part:


*Authorized measurement organization* means an entity that is authorized to measure vessels under this part.


*Commandant* means Commandant of the Coast Guard at the following address: Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center (MSC-4), U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE., Washington, DC 20593-7430.


*Convention* means the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.


*Convention Measurement System* means the measurement system under subpart B of this part, which is based on the rules of the Convention. This Formal Measurement System uses the vessel's total enclosed volume as the principal input for tonnage calculations along with other characteristics related to the vessel's carrying capacity, including the volume of cargo spaces and number of passengers. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross tonnage ITC (GT ITC) or net tonnage ITC (NT ITC).


*Deck cargo* means freight carried on the weather decks of a vessel for the purpose of its transport between two separate and distinct locations, and which is off-loaded from the vessel in its original container (if applicable) without undergoing any processing or other use while onboard the vessel.


*Dual Regulatory Measurement System* means the measurement system under subpart D of this part, which is one of three sub-systems of the Regulatory Measurement System. This Formal Measurement System is based on the rules of the Standard Regulatory Measurement System, with adjustments that allow for the assignment of two sets of Regulatory Measurement System tonnages whose use depends on the loading condition of the vessel. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).


*Foreign flag vessel* means a vessel that is not a U.S. flag vessel.


*Formal Measurement System* means a measurement system that employs a detailed computational method using measurements of the entire vessel, and which also takes into account the use of vessel spaces. The measurement systems prescribed under subparts B, C, and D of this part are Formal Measurement Systems.


*Great Lakes* means the Great Lakes of North America and the St. Lawrence River west of a rhumb line drawn from Cap des Rosiers to West Point, Anticosti Island, and, on the north side of Anticosti Island, the meridian of longitude 63 degrees west.


*Gross register tonnage (GRT)* means the gross tonnage measurement of the vessel under the Regulatory Measurement System. Refer to § 69.20 for information on applying tonnage thresholds expressed in terms of gross register tons (also referred to as GRT).


*Gross tonnage ITC (GT ITC)* means the gross tonnage measurement of the vessel under the Convention Measurement System. In international conventions, this parameter may be referred to as “gross tonnage (GT).” Refer to § 69.20 for information on applying tonnage thresholds expressed in terms of gross tonnage ITC.


*National Vessel Documentation Center* means the organizational unit designated by the Commandant to process vessel documentation transactions and maintain vessel documentation records.


*Net register tonnage (NRT)* means the net tonnage measurement of the vessel under the Regulatory Measurement System. Refer to § 69.20 for information on applying tonnage thresholds expressed in terms of net register tons.


*Non-self-propelled vessel* means a vessel that is not a self-propelled vessel.


*Overall length* means the horizontal distance of the vessel's hull between the foremost part of a vessel's stem to the aftermost part of its stern, excluding fittings and attachments.


*Portable enclosed space* means an enclosed space that is not deck cargo, and whose method of attachment to the vessel is not permanent in nature. Examples of portable enclosed spaces include modular living quarters, housed portable machinery spaces, and deck tanks used in support of shipboard industrial processes.


*Register ton* means a unit of volume equal to 100 cubic feet.


*Regulatory Measurement System* means the measurement system that comprises subparts C, D, and E of this part (Standard, Dual, and Simplified Regulatory Measurement Systems, respectively), and is sometimes referred to as the national measurement system of the United States. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).


*Remeasurement* means the process by which tonnages or registered dimensions of a vessel that was previously measured are assigned or reassigned to that vessel, or are verified to be correct, as appropriate. This includes assignment of tonnages or registered dimensions under a different measurement system.


*Self-propelled vessel* means a vessel with a means of self-propulsion, including sails.


*Simplified Regulatory Measurement System* means the measurement system under subpart E of this part, which is one of three sub-systems of the Regulatory Measurement System. It is based on the rules of the Standard Regulatory Measurement System but employs a simplified computational method using hull dimensions as the principal inputs. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).


*Standard Regulatory Measurement System* means the measurement system under subpart C of this part, which is one of three sub-systems of the Regulatory Measurement System. This Formal Measurement System is based on the rules of the British Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 and uses volumes of internal spaces as the principal inputs for tonnage calculations, allowing for exemptions or deductions of qualifying spaces according to their location and use. Tonnages assigned under this system are expressed in terms of gross register tons (GRT) or net register tons (NRT).


*Tonnage* means the volume of a vessel's spaces, including portable enclosed spaces, as calculated under a measurement system in this part, and is categorized as either gross or net. Gross tonnage refers to the volumetric measure of the overall size of a vessel. Net tonnage refers to the volumetric measure of the useful capacity of the vessel. Deck cargo is not included in tonnage.


*Tonnage threshold* means a delimitating tonnage value specified in an international convention or a Federal statute or regulation.


*U.S. flag vessel* means a vessel of United States registry or nationality, or one operated under the authority of the United States.


*Vessel of war* means ”vessel of war” as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101.


*Vessel that engages on a foreign voyage* means a vessel:


(1) That arrives at a place under the jurisdiction of the United States from a place in a foreign country;


(2) That makes a voyage between places outside of the United States;


(3) That departs from a place under the jurisdiction of the United States for a place in a foreign country; or


(4) That makes a voyage between a place within a territory or possession of the United States and another place under the jurisdiction of the United States not within that territory or possession.
