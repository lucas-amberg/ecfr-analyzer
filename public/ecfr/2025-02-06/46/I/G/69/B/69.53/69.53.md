# § 69.53   Definitions.

As used in this subpart—


*Amidships* means the midpoint of the registered length, as “registered length” is defined in this section.


*Boundary bulkhead* means the bulkhead or partition that separates an enclosed interior space from the surrounding weather. In general, the exterior bulkhead of a deck structure is the boundary bulkhead.


*Cargo space* means an enclosed space appropriated for the transport of cargo which is to be discharged from the vessel. The term does not include a space which qualifies as an excluded space under § 69.61.


*Enclosed space* is defined in § 69.59.


*Excluded space* is defined in § 69.61.


*Line of the upper deck* means a longitudinal line at the underside of the upper deck or, if that deck is stepped, the longitudinal line of the underside of the lowest portion of that deck parallel with the upper portions of that deck.


*Molded depth* means the vertical distance amidships between the following points:


(a) From the line of the upper deck at the vessel's side or, if the vessel has rounded gunwales, from the intersection of the line of the upper deck extended to the molded line of the shell plating as though the gunwales were of angular design.


(b) To the top of the flat keel, to the lower edge of the keel rabbet if the vessel is of wood or composite structure, or to the point where the line of the flat of the bottom extended inward cuts the side of the keel if the vessel's lower part is hollow or has thick garboards.


*Molded draft* means—


(a) For vessels assigned a load line under parts 42, 44, 45, or 47 of this chapter, the draft corresponding to the Summer Load Line (other than a timber load line);


(b) For passenger vessels assigned a load line under part 46 of this chapter, the draft corresponding to the deepest subdivision load line assigned;


(c) For vessels to which parts 42, 44, 45, 46, or 47 of this chapter do not apply but which otherwise have been assigned a load line, the draft corresponding to the Summer Load Line so assigned;


(d) For vessels to which no load line has been assigned but the draft of which is restricted under any Coast Guard requirement, the maximum draft permitted under the restriction; and


(e) For other vessels, 75 per cent of the molded depth.


*Passenger* means a person on board a vessel other than—


(a) The master, a member of the crew, or other person employed or engaged in any capacity in the business of the vessel; and


(b) A child under one year of age.


*Registered breadth* means the maximum breadth of a vessel measured amidships to the molded line of the frame in a vessel with a metal shell and to the outer surface of the hull in all other vessels.


*Registered length* means either 96 percent of the length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least molded depth measured from the top of the flat keel or the length from the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, whichever is greater. In vessels designed with a rake of keel, this length is measured on a waterline parallel to the design waterline.


*Upper deck* means the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of weathertight closing of all openings in the weather part of the deck, and below which all openings in the sides of the vessel are fitted with permanent means of watertight closing.


*Weathertight* means secure against penetration of water into the vessel in any sea condition.
