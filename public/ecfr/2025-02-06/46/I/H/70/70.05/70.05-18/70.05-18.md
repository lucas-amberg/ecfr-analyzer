# § 70.05-18   Applicability to vessels operating under an exemption afforded in the Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA).

(a) The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA) contained an allowance for the exemption of certain passenger vessels that are— 


(1) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons; or 


(2) Former public vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than 500 gross tons. 


(b) The owner or operator of a vessel must have applied for an exemption under the PVSA by June 21, 1994, and then brought the vessel into compliance with the interim guidance in Navigation and Inspection Circular (NVIC) 7-94 not later than December 21, 1996. The PVSA exemption is valid for the service life of the vessel, as long as the vessel remains certified for passenger service. If the Certificate of Inspection (COI) is surrendered or otherwise becomes invalid (not including a term while the vessel is out of service but undergoing an inspection for recertification), the owner or operator must meet the appropriate inspection regulations to obtain a new COI without the PVSA exemption. See 46 CFR 175.118 for information about applicable regulations for vessels that operate under the PVSA exemption.
