# ยง 72.15-10   Vessels using fuel having a flashpoint of 110 degrees F. or lower.

(a) Where liquid fuel having a flashpoint of 110 degrees F. or lower is used for main or auxiliary machinery or for starting purposes, the spaces containing such machinery or fuel tanks shall have natural supply and mechanical ventilation as required by this section.


(b) The requirements for the mechanical exhaust system shall be such as to assure the air changes as noted in table 72.15-10(b), depending upon the size of the space.


(c) Exhaust blower motors shall be outside of the ducts, and if mounted in any compartment required to be ventilated by this section, shall be of the explosion proof type. Blower blades shall be non-sparking with reference to their housings.


(d) Exhaust blower switches shall be located outside of any space required to be ventilated by this section, and shall be of the type interlocked with the ignition switch so that the blowers are started before the engine ignition is switched on. A red warning sign at the switch shall state that the blowers shall be operated prior to starting the engines for a sufficient time to insure at least one complete change of air in the compartments.


(e) The area of the ducts shall be such as to limit the air velocity to a maximum of 2,000 feet per minute. Ducts may be of any shape, provided that in no case shall 1 dimension exceed twice the other. 


(f) At least 2 inlet ducts shall be located at 1 end of the compartment and they shall extend to the lowest part of the compartment or bilge on each side. Similar exhaust ducts shall be led to the mechanical exhaust system from the lowest part of the compartment or bilge on each side of the compartment at the end opposite from that at which the inlet ducts are fitted.


(g) All ducts shall be constructed of non-ferrous metal or galvanized ferrous metal not less than No. 22 USSG, intact and gastight from end to end and shall be of substantial construction. The ducts shall lead as direct as possible and be properly fastened and supported.


(h) All supply ducts shall be provided with cowls or scoops having a free area not less than twice the required duct area. When the cowls or scoops are screened, the mouth area shall be increased to compensate for the area of the screen wire. Dampers shall not be fitted in the supply ducts. Cowls or scoops shall be kept open at all times except when the stress of weather is such as to endanger the vessel if the openings are not temporarily closed. Supply and exhaust openings shall not be located where the natural flow of air is unduly obstructed, or adjacent to possible sources of vapor ignition, nor shall they be so located that exhaust air may be taken into the supply vents.
