3/4-inch standard pipe size.


(b) All piping, valves, and fittings of ferrous materials must be protected inside and outside against corrosion unless specifically approved otherwise by the Commandant.

When the smoke detection system is combined with a fire extinguishing system, the operation of the valve must not affect the operation of the fire extinguishing system.


(d) All piping, valves, and fittings must be securely supported, and where necessary, protected against injury. The piping must be installed with as easy bends as practicable, and must be installed to grade to low points for drainage.
