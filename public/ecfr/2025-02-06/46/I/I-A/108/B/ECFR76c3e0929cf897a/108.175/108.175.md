# § 108.175   Contiguous locations.

(a) An enclosed space that has direct access to a Division 1 location is not a hazardous location if—


(1) The access has self-closing gas-tight doors that form an air lock;


(2) The ventilation causes greater pressure in the space than in the Division 1 location; and


(3) Loss of ventilation overpressure activates an alarm at a manned station;


(b) An enclosed space that has direct access to a Division 1 location can be considered as a Division 2 location if— 


(1) The access has a self-closing, gas-tight door that opens into the space and that has no hold-back device;


(2) Ventilation causes the air to flow with the door open from the space into the Division 1 location; and


(3) Loss of ventilation activates an alarm at a manned control station; and


(c) An enclosed space that has direct access to a Division 2 location is not a hazardous location if—


(1) The access has a self-closing, gas-tight door that opens into the space and that has no hold-back device;
