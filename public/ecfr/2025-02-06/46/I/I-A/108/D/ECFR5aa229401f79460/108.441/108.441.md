# ยง 108.441   Piping and discharge rates for CO

(a) The size of branch lines to spaces protected by a CO_2_ system must meet Table 108.441.


(b) Distribution piping within a space must be proportioned from the supply line to give proper distribution to the outlets without throttling.


(c) The number, type, and location of discharge outlets must distribute the CO_2_ uniformly throughout the space.


(d) The total area of all discharge outlets must be more than 35 percent and less than 85 percent of the nominal cylinder outlet area or the area of the supply pipe, whichever is smaller. The nominal cylinder outlet area in square centimeters is determined by multiplying the factor 0.0313 by the number of kilograms of CO_2_ required. (The nominal cylinder outlet area in square inches is determined by multiplying the factor 0.0022 by the number of pounds of CO_2_ required). The nominal cylinder outlet area must not be less than 71 square millimeters (0.110 square inches).


(e) A CO_2_ system must discharge at least 85 percent of the required amount within 2 minutes.
