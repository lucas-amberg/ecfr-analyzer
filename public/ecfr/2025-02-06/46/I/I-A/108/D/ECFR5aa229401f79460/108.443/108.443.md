# ยง 108.443   Controls and valves.

(a) At least one control for operating a CO_2_ system must be outside the space or spaces that the system protects and in a location that would be accessible if a fire occurred in any space that the system protects. Control valves must not be located in a protected space unless the CO_2_ cylinders are also in the protected space.


(b) A CO_2_ system that protects more than one space must have a manifold with a stop valve, the normal position of which is closed, that directs the flow of CO_2_ to each protected space.


(c) A CO_2_ system that protects only one space must have a stop valve installed between the cylinders and the discharge outlets in the system, except on a system that has a CO_2_ supply of 136 kilograms (300 pounds) or less.


(d) At least one of the control stations in a CO_2_ system that protects a machinery space must be as near as practicable to one of the main escapes from that space.


(e) All distribution valves and controls must be of an approved type.


(f) Each CO_2_ system that has a stop valve must have a remote control that operates only the stop valve and must have a separate remote control for releasing the required amount of CO_2_ into the space protected by the system. 


(g) Each CO_2_ system that does not have a stop valve must be operated by a remote control that releases the required amount of CO_2_ into the space protected by the system.


(h) Remote controls to each space must be in an enclosure.


(i) Each system must have a manual control at its cylinders for releasing CO_2_ from the cylinders, except that if the system has pilot cylinders, a manual control is not required for other than pilot cylinders.


(j) If gas pressure is used to release CO_2_ from a system having more than 2 cylinders, the system must have at least 2 pilot cylinders to release the CO_2_ from the remaining cylinders.


(k) If the entrance to a space containing the CO_2_ supply or controls of a CO_2_ system has a lock, the space must have a key to the lock in a break-glass type box that is next to and visible from the entrance.
