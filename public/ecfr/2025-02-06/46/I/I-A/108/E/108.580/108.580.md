(1) *Stowage.* Lifebuoys must be stowed as follows:


(i) Each lifebuoy must be capable of being rapidly cast loose.


(ii) Each lifebuoy must not be permanently secured to the unit in anyway. 


(iii) Lifebuoys must be so distributed as to be readily available on each side of the unit and, as far as practicable, on each open deck extending to the side of the unit. The lifebuoys with attached self-igniting lights must be evenly distributed on all sides of the unit.


(iv) At least two lifebuoys, each with attached self-activating smoke signals, must be stowed where they can be quickly released from the navigating bridge or main control station, or a location readily available to personnel on board. These lifebuoys should, when released, fall directly into the water without striking any part of the unit.


(2) *Attachments and fittings.* Lifebuoys must have the following attachments and fittings:


(i) At least one lifebuoy on each side of the unit fitted with a buoyant lifeline that is—


(A) At least as long as twice the height where it is stowed above the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition, or 30 meters (100 feet), whichever is the greater;


(B) Non-kinking;


(C) Not less than 8 millimeters (
5/16 inch) in diameter;


(D) Of a breaking strength which is not less than 5 kiloNewtons (1,124 pounds-force); and


(E) Is, if synthetic, a dark color or certified by the manufacturer to be resistant to deterioration from ultraviolet light.


(ii) At least one-half the total number of lifebuoys on the unit must each be fitted with a self-igniting light approved under approval series 161.010. A self-igniting light must not be attached to the lifebuoys required by this section to be fitted with lifelines.


(iii) At least two lifebuoys on the unit each must be fitted with a self-activating smoke signal approved under approval series 160.157. Lifebuoys fitted with smoke signals must also be fitted with lights.


(b) *Lifejackets.* Each unit must carry lifejackets approved under approval series 160.155 or 160.176. If the unit carries inflatable lifejackets, they must be of the same or similar design and have the same method of operation.




(1) *General.* Each unit must carry a lifejacket for each person on board and in addition, a sufficient number of lifejackets must be carried for persons at each work station and industrial work site.


(2) *Stowage.* Lifejackets must be stowed as follows:


(i) The lifejackets must be readily accessible.


(ii) The additional lifejackets required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be stowed in places readily accessible to the work stations and industrial work sites.


(iii) Where, due to the particular arrangements of the unit, the lifejackets under paragraph (b)(1) of this section could become inaccessible, the OCMI may require an increase in the number of lifejackets to be carried, or suitable alternative arrangements.


(3) *Attachments and fittings.* Lifejackets must have the following attachments and fittings:


(i) Each lifejacket must have a lifejacket light approved under approval series 161.112 securely attached to the front shoulder area of the lifejacket. On a unit not in international service, a light approved under approval series 161.012 may be used. However, lifejacket lights bearing Coast Guard approval number 161.012/2/1 are not permitted unless the unit is certificated to operate only on waters between 32° N and 32° S latitude.


(ii) Each lifejacket must have a whistle firmly secured by a cord to the lifejacket.


(c) *Immersion suits or anti-exposure suits.* Each unit must carry immersion suits approved under approval series 160.171 or anti-exposure suits approved under approval series 160.153.


(1) *General.* Each unit, except units operating between 32 degrees north latitude and 32 degrees south latitude, must carry—


(i) Immersion suits or anti-exposure suits of suitable size for each person assigned to the rescue boat crew;


(ii) Immersion suits approved under approval series 160.171 of the appropriate size for each person on board, which count toward meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section; and


(iii) In addition to the immersion suits required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, each watch station, work station, and industrial work site must have enough immersion suits to equal the number of persons normally on watch in, or assigned to, the station or site at one time. However, an immersion suit is not required at a station or site for a person whose cabin or berthing area (and the immersion suits stowed in that location) is readily accessible to the station or site.


(2) *Attachments and fittings.* Immersion suits or anti-exposure suits must have the following attachments and fittings:


(i) Each immersion suit or anti-exposure suit must have a lifejacket light approved under approval series 161.112 securely attached to the front shoulder area of the immersion suit or anti-exposure suit. On a unit not in international service, a light approved under approval series 161.012 may be used. However, lifejacket lights bearing Coast Guard approval number 161.012/2/1 are not permitted on units certificated to operate on waters where water temperature may drop below 10 °C (50 °F).


(ii) Each immersion suit or anti-exposure suit must have a whistle firmly secured by a cord to the immersion suit or anti-exposure suit.
