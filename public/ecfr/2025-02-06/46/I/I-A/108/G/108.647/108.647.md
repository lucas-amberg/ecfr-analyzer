The number of the liferaft and the number of persons it is permitted to accommodate must be marked or painted in a conspicuous place in the immediate vicinity of each inflatable liferaft in block capital letters and numbers. The word “liferaft” or the appropriate symbol from IMO Resolution A.760(18) shall be used to identify the stowage location. Liferafts stowed on the sides of the unit should be numbered in the same manner as the lifeboats. This marking must not be on the inflatable liferaft container.
