# § 109.211   Testing of emergency lighting and power systems.

(a) The master or person in charge shall insure that—


(1) Each emergency lighting and each emergency power system is tested at least once each week; 


(2) Each emergency generator is tested at least once each month by operating it under load for at least 2 hours; and 


(3) Each storage battery for emergency lighting and power systems is tested every six months under actual connected load for a period of at least 2 hours. 


(b) After the 2 hour test period required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the voltage values under load or specific gravity of electrolyte must be measured. Measured values must be extrapolated to approximate the values that would result following a 12 hour test period. The test must be extended if a trend cannot be determined to allow extrapolation. The capacity of the battery corresponding to the extrapolated values of voltage or specific gravity must be sufficient to supply the actual connected load.
