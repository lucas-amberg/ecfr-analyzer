# ยง 105.10   Vessel examination.

(a) Each examination referred to in this section must be conducted by the Coast Guard to determine whether the examined vessel is in substantial compliance with this part. An examination may include any test or verification that the examiner deems necessary for determining the vessel's safety and seaworthiness.


(1) The owner or operator of each vessel subject to this part must apply, using Form CG-3752, available at *http://www.uscg.mil/forms/cg/cg_3752.pdf,* to the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, for the vessel to be examined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. In applying for a vessel's initial examination under this section, the application must be accompanied by a plan or sketch of each cargo tank and piping system for filling and dispensing bulk flammable or combustible cargoes, and a brief description of those systems, including their dimensions and materials used. If cargo tanks are located in enclosed compartments or below decks, the plans or sketches must show the ventilation system. Plans or sketches need not be submitted if the cargo tanks and piping systems have previously been accepted by the Coast Guard.


(2) Each vessel must be examined before its first use in loading, transporting, or dispensing combustible or flammable liquids in bulk, and at least annually thereafter if the vessel carries such liquids in temporarily installed cargo tanks or containers, or at least biennially thereafter if the vessel carries such liquids in permanently installed cargo tanks.


(3) A vessel that is laid up, dismantled, or out of commission is exempt from the requirements of this section.


(b) After examining a vessel and finding it to be in substantial compliance with this part, the Coast Guard will issue, and the vessel's owner or operator must display on board, a certificate of compliance that describes the amounts of bulk liquid flammable or combustible cargoes that the vessel may carry, the number of crewmembers required to hold merchant mariner credentials and tankerman endorsements in accordance with 46 U.S.C. 8304 and 46 CFR part 13, and any conditions applicable to the carriage or dispensation of those cargoes. Each certificate of compliance is valid for not more than 2 years or until suspended or revoked. A letter of compliance may be issued as an alternative to a certificate of compliance.
