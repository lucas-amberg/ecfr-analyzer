(3) Means provided to isolate smoke accumulators from liquid or refrigerated cargoes must be to the satisfaction of the Commanding Officer of the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Center.


(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in FSS Code chapter 10, periodic testing of sample extraction smoke detection systems must be conducted as part of the annual inspection and include inspection of all piping, valves, controls and alarms, and by introduction of smoke into the accumulators.
