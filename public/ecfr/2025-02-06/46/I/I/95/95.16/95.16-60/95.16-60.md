# § 95.16-60   System piping installation testing.

(a) *Halocarbon systems.* A pressure test using the extinguishing agent, air or inert gas, must be conducted on halocarbon system discharge piping on completion of piping installation and before extinguishing agent cylinders are connected.


(1) Except as otherwise specified in this section:


(i) Piping from the cylinders to the stop valves or selector valves must be subjected to a pressure of 1
1/2 times the cylinder charging pressure at 70 °Fahrenheit; and


(ii) The leakage during a 2-minute period must not exceed a pressure drop of 10 percent of the test pressure.


(2) Individual branch lines to a protected space must be tested as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that:


(i) The pressure must be 150 pounds per square inch; and


(ii) Distribution piping must be capped within the protected space at the first joint upstream of the nozzles.


(3) Pneumatic actuation piping must be tested as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) *Inert gas systems.* A pressure test using air or inert gas must be conducted on each inert gas system's piping on completion of piping installation and before extinguishing agent cylinders are connected.


(1) Except as otherwise specified in this section:


(i) Piping from the cylinders to the stop valves or selector valves must be subjected to a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi) at 70 °Fahrenheit; and


(ii) The leakage during a 2-minute period must not exceed a pressure drop of 100 psi.


(2) Individual branch lines to a protected space must be tested as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that:


(i) The pressure must be 600 psi; and


(ii) Distribution piping must be capped within the protected space at the first joint upstream of the nozzles.


(3) Pneumatic actuation piping must be tested as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(c) *Small independent systems.* In lieu of test requirements in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, a small independent halocarbon or inert gas system, like those found in emergency generator rooms and paint lockers, may be tested by blowing out the piping with air pressure of at least 100 psi, if:


(1) There are no valves in the system discharge piping; and


(2) There is not more than one change in direction between the agent container and the discharge nozzle.
