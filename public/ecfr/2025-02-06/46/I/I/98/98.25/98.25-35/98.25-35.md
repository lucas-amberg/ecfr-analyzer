# ยง 98.25-35   Refrigerated systems.

(a) Where refrigerated systems are installed to maintain the temperature of the liquid below atmospheric, at least two complete refrigeration plants automatically regulated by pressure variations within the tanks shall be provided, each to be complete with the necessary auxiliaries for proper operation. The capacity of each refrigeration compressor shall be sufficient to maintain the vapor pressure in the tanks during the peak atmospheric temperature conditions below the pressure for which the tanks are designed. 


(b) An alternate arrangement may consist of three compressors, any two of which shall be capable of maintaining the vapor pressure in the tanks during peak atmospheric temperature conditions below the pressure for which the tanks are designed, the third compressor acting as a stand-by unit. 


(c) Refrigerated tanks shall be insulated in conformance with the requirements of ยง 98.25-30.
