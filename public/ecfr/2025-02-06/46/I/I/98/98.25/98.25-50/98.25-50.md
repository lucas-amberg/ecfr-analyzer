# ยง 98.25-50   Filling and discharge pipes.

(a) Filling connections shall be provided with one of the following: 


(1) Combination back pressure check valve and excess flow valve; 


(2) One double or two single back pressure check valves; or 


(3) A positive shut-off valve in conjunction with either an internal back pressure check valve or an internal excess flow valve. 


(b) All other liquid and vapor connections to tanks, except filling connections, safety relief valves, and liquid level gaging devices and pressure gages described in ยง 98.25-40(e) and (f) shall be equipped with automatic excess flow valves; or in lieu thereof, may be fitted with quick closing internal stop valves, which, except during filling and discharge operations, shall remain closed. The control mechanism for such valves shall be provided with a secondary remote control of a type acceptable to the Commandant. 


(c) The excess flow, internal stop or back pressure check valves shall be located on the inside of the tank or outside where the piping enters the tank. In the latter case, installation shall be made in such a manner that any undue strain will not cause breakage between the tank and the excess flow or internal stop valve. 


(d) Where the filling and discharge are made through a common nozzle at the tank, and the connection is fitted with a quick-closing internal stop valve as permitted in paragraph (b) of this section, the back pressure check valve or excess flow valve is not required, provided, however, a positive shut-off valve is installed in conjunction with the internal stop valve.
