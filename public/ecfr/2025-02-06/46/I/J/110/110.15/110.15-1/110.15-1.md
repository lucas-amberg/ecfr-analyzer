(b) In addition to the definitions in paragraph (a) of this section—


*Coastwise Vessel* means a vessel that normally navigates the waters of any ocean or the Gulf of Mexico 20 nautical miles or less offshore and is certificated for coastwise navigation by the Coast Guard.


*Commandant* means the Commandant of the Coast Guard.


*Constructed* means the date—


(i) The vessel's keel was laid; or


(ii) Construction identifiable with the vessel or facility began and assembly of that vessel or facility commenced comprising of 50 metric tons or at least 1 percent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.


*Corrosion resistant material* or *finish* means any material or finish that meets the testing requirements of ASTM B117 (incorporated by reference; see § 110.10-1) or test Kb in IEC 60068-2-52:2017.








*Dead ship condition* is where the entire machinery installation, including the power supply, is out of operation and that auxiliary services such as compressed air, starting current from batteries etc., for bringing the main propulsion into operation and for the restoration of the main power supply are not available.




*Drilling loads* means all loads associated exclusively with the drilling operation including power to the drill table, mud system, and positioning equipment.




*Embarkation station* means a location from which persons embark into survival craft or are assembled before embarking into survival craft.


*Emergency squad* means the crew designated on the station bill as the nucleus of a damage control party.


*Flashpoint* means the minimum temperature at which a liquid gives off a vapor in sufficient concentration to form an ignitable mixture with air near the surface of the liquid, as specified by the appropriate test procedure and apparatus.


*Great Lakes vessel* means a vessel that navigates exclusively on the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters.


*IECEx System* means an international certification system covering equipment that meets the provisions of the IEC 60079 series of standards (as incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1). The IECEx System is comprised of an Ex Certification Body and an Ex Testing Laboratory that has been accepted into the IECEx System after satisfactory assessment of their competence to ISO/IEC Standard 17025, ISO/IEC Guide 65, IECEx rules of procedures, IECEx operational documents, and IECEx technical guidance documents as part of the IECEx assessment process.




*Independent laboratory* means a laboratory that is accepted by the Commandant under part 159 of this subchapter for the testing and listing or certification of electrical equipment.




*Integral tank* means a tank that is a structural part of the vessel's hull and is influenced in the same manner and by the same loads that stress the adjacent hull structure.




*Location not requiring an exceptional degree of protection* means a location which is not exposed to the environmental conditions outlined in the definition for locations requiring exceptional degrees of protection. This location requires the degree of protection of § 111.01-9(c) or (d) of this subchapter. These locations include—


(i) An accommodation space;


(ii) A dry store room;


(iii) A passageway adjacent to quarters;


(iv) A water closet without a shower or bath;


(v) A radio, gyro and chart room; and


(vi) A location with similar environmental conditions.






*Location requiring an exceptional degree of protection* means a location exposed to weather, seas, splashing, pressure-directed liquids, or similar moisture conditions. These locations include—


(i) On deck;


(ii) A machinery space;


(iii) A cargo space;


(iv) A location within a galley or pantry area, laundry, or water closet which contains a shower or bath; and


(v) Other spaces with similar environmental conditions.








*Non-hazardous location* means an area in which an explosive gas or dust atmosphere is not expected to be present in quantities that require special precautions for the construction, installation, and use of electrical equipment.






*Nonsparking fan* means nonsparking fan as defined in ABS Marine Vessel Rules (incorporated by reference; see § 110.10-1), section 4-8-3/11.






*OCS activity* has the same meaning as it does in 33 CFR 140.10.


*Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)* has the same meaning as it does in 33 CFR 140.10.




*Ship's service loads* means the electrical equipment for all auxiliary services necessary for maintaining the vessel in a normal, operational and habitable condition. Ship's service loads include, but are not limited to, all safety, lighting, ventilation, navigational, communications, habitability, and propulsion auxiliary loads. Electrical propulsion motor, bow thruster motor, cargo transfer, drilling, cargo refrigeration for other than Class 5.2 organic peroxides and Class 4.1 self-reactive substances, and other industrial type loads are not included.




*Shut-off valve* is a valve that closes a pipeline and provides nominal metal-to-metal contact between the valve operating parts, including the disc and gate, and the valve body.


*Special Division 1* is a Class I, Zone 0 hazardous location in Article 505 of NFPA 70 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1) that may require special considerations for electrical equipment installed in such locations.


*Waterproof* means watertight; except that, moisture within or leakage into the enclosure is allowed if it does not interfere with the operation of the equipment enclosed. In the case of a generator or motor enclosure, *waterproof* means watertight; except that, leakage around the shaft may occur if the leakage is prevented from entering the oil reservoir and the enclosure provides for automatic drainage.




*Watertight* means enclosed so that equipment meets at least a NEMA 250 Type 4 or 4X or an IEC 60529:2013 IP 56 rating.




*Zone 0* is a hazardous location in which an explosive gas or vapor in mixture with air is continuously present or present for long periods.


*Zone 1* is a hazardous location in which an explosive gas or vapor in mixture with air is likely to occur in normal operating conditions.


*Zone 2* is a hazardous location in which an explosive gas or vapor in mixture with air is not likely to occur in normal operating conditions, or in which such a mixture, if it does occur, will only exist for a short time.
