# ยง 111.05-27   Grounded neutral alternating current systems.

Grounded neutral and high-impedance grounded neutral alternating current systems must have a suitably sensitive ground detection system which indicates current in the ground connection, is able to withstand the maximum available fault current without damage, and provides continuous indication of circuit status to ground. A provision must be included to compare indications under fault conditions with those under normal conditions.
