# § 111.105-11   Intrinsically safe systems.

(a) As part of plan approval, the manufacturer must provide appropriate installation instructions and restrictions on approved system components or the control drawing in Section 504.10(A) of NFPA 70 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter). Typical instructions and restrictions include information addressing—


(1) Voltage limitations;


(2) Allowable cable parameters;


(3) Maximum length of cable permitted;


(4) Ability of system to accept passive devices;


(5) Acceptability of interconnections with conductors or other equipment for other intrinsically safe circuits; and


(6) Information regarding any instructions or restrictions which were a condition of approval of the system or its components.


(b) Each intrinsically safe system must meet ANSI/ISA-RP12.06.01-2003 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter).


(c) For intrinsically safe systems under the standards cited in § 111.105-3(a)(1) and (2) the wiring methods must meet Sections 504.30, 504.50 and 504.60 of NFPA 70 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter). For intrinsically safe systems under the standards cited in § 111.105-3(b)(3) of this subpart, the installation and wiring must meet Clause 7, except for Clause 7.3.1, of IEC 60092-502:1999 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter).
