# § 111.105-3   Approved equipment.

(a) Electrical equipment should not be installed in hazardous locations unless essential for operational purposes. When installed in these locations, special precautions should be taken to ensure that the electrical equipment is not a source of ignition.


(b) Electrical installations in hazardous locations must comply with paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.


(1) NFPA 70 Articles 500 through 504 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter). Equipment required to be identified for Class I locations must meet the provisions of Sections 500.7 and 500.8 of NFPA 70 and must be tested and listed by an independent laboratory to any of the following standards:


(i) ANSI/UL 674, ANSI/UL 823, ANSI/UL 844, ANSI/UL 913, ANSI/UL 1203, ANSI/ISA 12.12.01, or ANSI/UL 2225 (all incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter).


(ii) FM Approvals Class Number 3600 (1998), Class Number 3610, Class Number 3611, Class Number 3615, or Class Number 3620 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter).


(iii) CSA C22.2 Nos. 0-10, 30-M1986, 157-92, or 213-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter).


(2) NFPA 70 Article 505 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter). Equipment required to be identified for Class I locations must meet the provisions of Sections 505.7 and 505.9 of NFPA 70 and must be tested and listed by an independent laboratory to one or more of the types of protection in ANSI/ISA or ANSI/UL series of standards incorporated in NFPA 70.


(3) Clause 8 of IEC 61892-7:2019 or clause 6 of IEC 60092-502:1999 (both incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter). Electrical apparatus in hazardous locations must be tested to IEC 60079-1:2014, IEC 60079-2:2014, IEC 60079-5:2015, IEC 60079-6:2015, IEC 60079-7:2015, IEC 60079-11:2011, IEC 60079-13:2017, IEC 60079-15:2017, IEC 60079-18:2017, IEC 60079-25:2010 or IEC 60079-30-1:2007 (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1) and certified by an independent laboratory under the IECEx System.


(c) System components that are listed or certified under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section must not be combined in a manner that would compromise system integrity or safety.


(d) As an alternative to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, electrical equipment that complies with the provisions of NFPA 496 (2017) (incorporated by reference, see § 110.10-1 of this subchapter) is acceptable for installation in Class I, Divisions 1 and 2. When equipment meeting this standard is used, it does not need to be identified and marked by an independent laboratory. The Commanding Officer, MSC, will evaluate equipment complying with this standard during plan review. The Commanding Officer, MSC, will generally consider it acceptable if a manufacturer's certification of compliance is indicated on a material list or plan.


(e) Equipment listed or certified to ANSI/UL 60079-18 or IEC 60079-18:2017, respectively, is not permitted in Class I Special Division 1 or Zone 0 hazardous location, unless the encapsulating compound of Ex “ma” protected equipment is not exposed to, or has been determined to be compatible with, the liquid or cargo in the storage tank.
