(6) Armored or MI type cable for a submerged cargo pump motor.


(g) Electrical equipment must not be installed in a space that is separated by a gastight steel boundary from a hold space that has a tank that must have a secondary barrier under the requirements of § 154.459 of this chapter, except:


(1) Through runs of marine shipboard cable;


(2) Explosionproof lighting fixtures;
