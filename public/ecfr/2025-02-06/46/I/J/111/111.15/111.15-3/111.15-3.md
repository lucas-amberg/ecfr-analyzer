# ยง 111.15-3   Battery categories.

(a) A battery installation is classified as one of three types, based upon power output of the battery charger, as follows: 


(1) *Large.* A large battery installation is one connected to a battery charger that has an output of more than 2 kW computed from the highest possible charging current and the rated voltage of the battery installation. 


(2) *Moderate.* A moderate battery installation is one connected to a battery charger that has an output of between 0.2 kW and 2 kW computed from the highest possible charging current and the rated voltage of the battery installation. 


(3) *Small.* A small battery installation is one connected to a battery charger that has an output of less than 0.2 kW computed from the highest possible charging current and the rated voltage of the battery installation. 


(b) Batteries that generate less hydrogen under normal charging and discharging conditions than an equivalent category of lead-acid batteries (e.g., sealed batteries) may have their battery category reduced to an equivalent category of lead-acid batteries.
