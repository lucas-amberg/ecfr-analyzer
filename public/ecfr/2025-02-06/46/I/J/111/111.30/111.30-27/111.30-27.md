# § 111.30-27   Direct current ship's service switchboards.

(a) Each direct current ship's service switchboard must have the equipment required by paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.


(b) For each connected generator, each switchboard must have the following:


(1) A circuit breaker that meets § 111.12-11 and § 111.50-5.


(2) A disconnect switch or link for each generator conductor, except a switchboard having a draw-out or plug-in type generator circuit breaker that disconnects—

(ii) If there is a switch in the generator neutral, each ungrounded conductor.


(3) A field rheostat.


(4) An indicator light connected between the generator and circuit breaker.


(c) For each two-wire generator, each switchboard must have:

(2) A voltmeter with a selector switch that connects the voltmeter to show:


(i) Generator voltage; and


(ii) Bus voltage.


(d) For each three-wire generator, each switchboard must have the following:


(1) An ammeter for:


(i) The positive lead; and


(ii) The negative lead.


(2) A center zero type ammeter for the neutral ground connection.


(3) A voltmeter with a selector switch that connects the voltmeter to show generator and bus voltage:


(i) Positive to negative;


(ii) Positive to neutral; and


(iii) Neutral to negative.


(e) Each switchboard must have ground detection that meets subpart 111.05 for the:


(1) Main power system;


(2) Main lighting system; and


(3) Emergency lighting system.


(f) For each shore power connection, each switchboard must have:
