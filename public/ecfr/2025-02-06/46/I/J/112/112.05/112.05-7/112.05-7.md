# ยง 112.05-7   Use of emergency generator in port.

The emergency generator may be used during lay time in port for supplying power to the vessels, provided the following:


(a) The fuel oil tank for the emergency generator prime mover must be appropriately sized and provided with a level alarm, which is to be set to alarm at a level where there is sufficient fuel oil capacity for the emergency services for the period of time required by ยง 112.05-5(a).


(b) The emergency generator prime mover is to be rated for continuous service.


(c) The prime mover is to be fitted with alarms, displays and automatic shutdown arrangements that meet ABS Marine Vessel Rules (incorporated by reference, see ยง 110.10-1 of this subchapter), section 4-8-2/5.19 Table 2, except that for fuel oil tank low-level alarm, in paragraph (a) of this section is to apply instead. The displays and alarms are to be provided in the centralized control station. Monitoring at the engineers' quarters must meet ABS Marine Vessel Rules, section 4-9-6/19.


(d) The emergency generator room is to be fitted with fire detectors. Where the emergency generator is located in a space separated from the emergency switchboard, fire detectors are to be located in each space. The fire detection and alarm system must meet the requirements of subpart 113.10 of this subchapter.


(e) The power supply circuits, including control and monitoring circuits, for the use of an emergency generator in port are to be so arranged and protected that any electrical fault, except for the emergency generator and the emergency switchboard, will not affect the operation of the main and emergency services.


(f) Means are to be provided to readily change over to emergency operation.


(g) The generator is to be safeguarded against overload by automatically shedding such other loads so that the supply to the required emergency loads is always available.


(h) Operational instructions such as that on the fuel oil tank level, harbor/seagoing mode changeover arrangements, etc. are to be provided on board. Before the vessel is under way, all valves, switches, etc., are to be in the positions for the intended mode of operation of the emergency generator and the emergency switchboard. Such instructions are to be distinctly posted at the emergency generator room. Planned maintenance is to be carried out only while in port.
