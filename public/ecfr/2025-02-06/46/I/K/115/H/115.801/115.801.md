# ยง 115.801   Notice of inspection deficiencies and requirements.

(a) If during the inspection of a vessel, the vessel or its equipment is found not to conform to the requirements of law or the regulations in this subchapter, the marine inspector will point out deficiencies observed and discuss all requirements with the owner, managing operator, or a representative thereof. Normally, the marine inspector will list all such requirements that have not been completed and present the list to the owner, managing operator, or a representative thereof. However, when a deficiency presents a serious safety hazard to the vessel or its passengers or crew, and exists through negligence or willful noncompliance, the marine inspector may issue a Report of Violation (ROV) to the owner, managing operator, or a representative thereof.


(b) In any case where further clarification of or reconsideration of any requirement placed against the vessel is desired, the owner, managing operator, or a representative thereof, may discuss the matter with the cognizant OCMI.
