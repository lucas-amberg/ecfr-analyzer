# § 117.137   Stowage of life floats and buoyant apparatus.

(a) In addition to meeting § 117.130, each life float and buoyant apparatus must be stowed as required under this section.


(b) The float-free link required by § 117.130(a)(1) must be:


(1) Certified to meet § 160.073 in subchapter Q of this chapter, or other standard specified by the Commandant:


(2) Of proper strength for the size of the life float or buoyant apparatus as indicated on its identification tag; and


(3) Secured to the painter at one end and to the vessel on the other end.


(c) The means used to attach the float-free link to the vessel must:


(1) Have a breaking strength of at least the breaking strength of the painter;


(2) If synthetic, be of a dark color or of a type certified to be resistant to deterioration from ultraviolent light; and


(3) If metal, be corrosion resistant.


(d) If the life float or buoyant apparatus does not have a painter attachment fitting, a means for attaching the painter must be provided by a wire or line which:


(1) Encircles the body of the device;


(2) Will not slip off;


(3) Has a breaking strength that is at least the strength of the painter; and


(4) If synthetic, is of a dark color or is of a type certified to be resistant to deterioration from ultraviolet light.


(e) If the vessel carries more than the one life float or buoyant apparatus in a group with each group secured by a single painter:


(1) The combined weight of each group of life floats and buoyant apparatus must not exceed 181 kilograms (400 pounds);


(2) Each group of life floats and buoyant apparatus is considered a single survival craft for the purposes of § 117.130(c) of this part;


(3) Each life float and buoyant apparatus must be individually attached to the painter by a line meeting § 117.175(e)(3)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this part and long enough that each life float or buoyant apparatus can float without contacting any other life float or buoyant apparatus in the group; and


(4) The strength of the float-free link under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the strength of the painter under § 117.175(e)(3)(ii) of this part must be determined by the combined capacity of the group of life floats and buoyant apparatus.


(f) Life floats and buoyant apparatus must not be stowed in tiers more than 1,220 millimeters (4 feet) high. When stowed in tiers, the separate units must be kept apart by spacers.
