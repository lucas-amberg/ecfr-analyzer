# § 117.208   Survival craft—vessels operating on rivers routes.

(a) Except as allowed by paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, each vessel certificated to operate on a rivers route in cold water must be provided with life floats of an aggregate capacity that will accommodate at least 50% of the total number of persons permitted on board.


(b) Each vessel certificated to operate on a rivers route in warm water is not required to carry survival craft.


(c) Each vessel certificated to operate on a rivers route within one mile of land is not required to carry survival craft.


(d) For a vessel certificated to operate on a rivers route in shallow water where the vessel can not sink deep enough to submerge the topmost passenger deck or where survivors can wade ashore, the cognizant OCMI may waive a requirement for life floats, if the OCMI determines that it is safe to do so, taking into consideration the vessel's scope of operation, hazards of the route, and availability of assistance.


(e) Each vessel operating with a set schedule on a specific route that maintains a 15 minute radio communications schedule with an operations base, or participates in a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS), may be granted a reduction in the survival craft requirements of this section if the cognizant OCMI is satisfied that a sufficient level of safety exists.
