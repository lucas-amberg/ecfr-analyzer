(a) Diesel fuel tanks may not be built integral with the hull of a vessel unless the hull is made of steel or aluminum. 


(b) During the initial inspection for certification of a vessel, integral fuel tanks must withstand a hydrostatic pressure test of 35 kPa (5 psig), or the maximum pressure head to which they may be subjected in service, whichever is greater. A standpipe of 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) in height attached to the tank may be filled with water to accomplish the 35 kPa (5 psig) test.
