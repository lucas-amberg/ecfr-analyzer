(6) Section 4.4.3 may read, “This vessel is prohibited from discharging Noxious Liquid Substance (NLS) residues to the sea.”


(7) Section 4.4.6 should refer the reader to appropriate compatibility guides.


(8) Section 4.4.7 may read, “This vessel is prohibited from discharging Noxious Liquid Substance (NLS) residues to the sea. All NLS residues must be discharged to an appropriate reception facility.”


(9) Section 4.4.8 may read, “This vessel is prohibited from discharging Noxious Liquid Substance (NLS) residues to the sea.”


(10) Section 4.4.9 may read, “All cleaning agents and additives must be treated as substances of their assigned NLS category. This vessel is prohibited from discharging Noxious Liquid Substance (NLS) residues to the sea. All NLS residues must be discharged to an appropriate reception facility.”
