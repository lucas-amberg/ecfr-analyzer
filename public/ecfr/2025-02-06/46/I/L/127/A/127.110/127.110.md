(iii) Cargo-transfer systems for fixed independent or portable tanks. 


(e) *Electrical engineering.* (1) For each vessel of less than 100 gross tons, the following plans must be submitted: 


(i) Arrangement of electrical equipment (plan and profile) with equipment identified as necessary to show compliance with this subchapter. 


(ii) Electrical one-line diagram that includes wire types and sizes, overcurrent-device rating and setting, and type of electrical-equipment enclosure (drip-proof, watertight, or the like). 


(iii) Switchboard plans required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of § 110.25-1 of this chapter. 


(2) For each vessel of 100 or more gross tons, the plans required by § 110.25 of this chapter must be submitted. 


(f) *Automation.* For each vessel of 100 or more gross tons, where automated systems are provided to replace specific personnel in the control and observation of the propulsion systems and machinery spaces, or to reduce the level of crew associated with the engine department, the following plans must be submitted: 


(1) Plans necessary to demonstrate compliance with subpart D of part 130 of this subchapter. 


(2) Automation-test procedure.
