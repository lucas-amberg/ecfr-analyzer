(a) Wherever a battery is charged, there must be natural or induced ventilation to dissipate the gases generated. 


(b) Each battery must be located as high above the bilge as practicable within the space the battery is located in and be secured to protect against shifting due to roll, pitch, and heave motions or vibration of the vessel, and free from exposure to splash or spray of water. 


(c) Each battery must be accessible for maintenance and removal. 


(d) Each connection to a battery terminal must be made with a permanent connector, rather than with spring clips or other temporary clamps.

(f) Each battery charger must have an ammeter connected in the charging circuit. 


(g) Unless the battery is adjacent to its distribution panel or switchboard that distributes power to the lighting, motor, and appliance circuits, the battery leads must have fuses in series with and as close as practicable to the battery. 


(h) Each battery used for starting an engine must be located as close as possible to the engine or engines served.
