# ยง 129.390   Shore power.

Each vessel that has an electrical system operating at more than 50 volts and has provisions for receiving shore power must meet the requirements of this section: 


(a) A shore-power-connection box or receptacle must be permanently installed at a convenient location. 


(b) A cable connecting the shore-power-connection box or receptacle to the switchboard or main distribution panel must be permanently installed. 


(c) A circuit breaker must be provided at the switchboard or main distribution panel for the shore-power connection. 


(d) The circuit breaker, required by paragraph (c) of this section, must be interlocked with the feeder circuit breakers for the vessel's power sources to preclude the vessel's power sources and shore power from energizing the vessel's switchboard simultaneously, except in cases where system devices permit safe momentary paralleling of OSV power with shore power.
