(2) Loss of power to the steering motor or for control of the main steering gear. 


(3) Engine-room fire. 


(4) High bilge-level. 


(5) Low lube-oil pressure for each main propulsion engine and each prime mover of a generator. 


(6) For each main propulsion engine and each prime mover of a generator— 


(i) High lube-oil temperature; and 


(ii) High jacket-water temperature. 


(7) For each reduction gear and each turbocharger with a pressurized oil system— 


(i) Low lube-oil pressure; and 


(ii) High lube-oil temperature. 


(8) Loss of normal power for the alarms listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section. 


(b) Sensors for the high-bilge-level alarm required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section must be installed in—

(2) The compartment that contains the rudder post.
