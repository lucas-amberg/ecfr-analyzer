Spare parts and repair equipment must be provided for each lifesaving appliance and component that either is subject to excessive wear or consumption or needs to be replaced regularly. These parts and equipment must be kept aboard the OSV, except that, if the vessel operates daily out of the same shore base, they may be kept at that base.
