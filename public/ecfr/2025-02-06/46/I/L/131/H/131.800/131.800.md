# ยง 131.800   General.

(a) This section prescribes markings necessary for the guidance of persons aboard in case of an emergency. The markings may be modified or omitted if they are unnecessary, because either the vessel is small or particular circumstances warrant, and if the cognizant OCMI approves. 


(b) Each stateroom notice, directional sign, and the like must be printed in English and in other languages appropriate to the service of the vessel. 


(c) Where this subpart specifies red letters, letters of a contrasting color on a red background are acceptable.
