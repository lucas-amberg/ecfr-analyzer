# § 131.830   Fire-hose stations.

Each fire station must be identified in red letters and figures at least 50 millimeters (2 inches) high that state the following: “FIRE STATION #1,” “* * * 2,” “* * * 3,” and so on. Where the hose is not so stowed in the open or behind glass as to be readily seen, this identification must be so placed as to be readily seen from a distance.
