(1) Each embarkation ladder must be approved under approval series 160.117 or approval series 160.017.


(2) Each embarkation ladder must extend in a single length, from the deck to the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition under unfavorable conditions of trim and with the OSV listed not less than 15 degrees either way.


(3) Each embarkation ladder may be replaced by a device approved to provide safe and rapid access to survival craft in the water, if the OCMI permits the device, provided that there is at least one embarkation ladder on each side of the OSV.


(g) Each davit-launched liferaft must be arranged to be boarded and launched from a position immediately adjacent to the stowed position or from a position to where, under § 133.130, the liferaft is transferred before launching.


(h) If a davit-launched survival craft is embarked over the edge of the deck, the craft must be provide with a means for bringing it against the side of the OSV and holding it alongside the OSV to allow persons to safely embark.


(i) If a davit-launched survival craft or rescue boat is not intended to be moved to the stowed position with persons on board, the craft must be provided with a means for bringing it against the side of the OSV and holding it alongside the OSV to allow persons to safely disembark after a drill.
