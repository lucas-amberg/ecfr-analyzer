# § 134.140   Structural standards.

(a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, each liftboat must comply with the ABS's “Rules for Building and Classing Mobile Offshore Drilling Units”, assuming a steady wind speed of 100 knots for liftboats in unrestricted service, and 70 knots for liftboats in restricted service under normal operating conditions and 100 knots under severe storm conditions, as follows: 


(1) The main hull structure, legs, and supporting structure must comply with Section 3/4.3 of the Rules. 


(2) The calculations required by Section 3/4.3 of the Rules must assume the vessel to be in the most adverse loading conditions described by Sections 3/2.1 and 3/4.1 of the Rules. 


(3) Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Commandant (CG-ENG), the calculations on column-buckling required by Section 3/4.3 of the Rules, must employ an effective-length factor, “K”, of not less than 2.0. 


(4) The calculations on single-rack jacking systems required by Sections 3/2.1 and 3/4.1 of the Rules must include an extra bending moment caused by the most adverse eccentric loading of the legs. 


(b) Standards of classification societies other than the ABS, and other established standards acceptable to the Commandant (CG-ENG), may be used. 


(c) Upon submittal of the plans required by §§ 127.110 and 133.130 of this subchapter, the standard used in the design must be specified. 


(d) If no established standard is used in the design, detailed design calculations must be submitted with the plans required by §§ 127.110 and 133.130 of this subchapter.
