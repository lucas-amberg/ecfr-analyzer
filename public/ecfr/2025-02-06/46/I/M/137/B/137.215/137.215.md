# ยง 137.215   General conduct of survey.

(a) When conducting a survey of a towing vessel as required by this subpart, the surveyor must determine that the item or system functions as designed, is free of defects or modifications that reduce its effectiveness, is suitable for the service intended, and functions safely in a manner consistent for vessel type, service and route.


(b) The survey must address the items in ยง 137.220 as applicable, and must include:


(1) A review of certificates and documentation held on the vessel;


(2) A visual examination and tests of the vessel and its equipment and systems in order to confirm that their condition is properly maintained and that proper quantities are onboard;


(3) A visual examination of the systems used in support of drills or training to determine that the equipment utilized during a drill operates as intended; and


(4) A visual examination to confirm that unapproved modifications were not made to the vessel or its equipment.


(c) Beyond the minimum standards required by this section, the thoroughness and stringency of the survey will depend upon the condition of the vessel and its equipment. If a surveyor finds a vessel to have multiple deficiencies indicative of systematic failures to maintain the installed equipment, he or she will conduct an expanded examination to ensure all deficiencies are identified and corrective action is promptly taken.


(d) The owner or managing operator must notify the cognizant OCMI when the condition of the vessel, its equipment, systems, or operations, create an unsafe condition.


(e) The cognizant OCMI may require that the owner or managing operator provide for the attendance of a surveyor or auditor from a TPO to assist with verifying compliance with this part.
