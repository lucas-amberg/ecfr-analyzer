# ยง 143.450   Pilothouse alerter system.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, a towing vessel with overnight accommodations and alternating watches (shift work), when pulling, pushing or hauling alongside one or more barges, must have a system to detect when its master or mate (pilot) becomes incapacitated. The system must:


(1) Have an alarm in the pilothouse distinct from any other alarm;


(2) Require action from the master or officer in charge of a navigational watch, during an interval not to exceed 10 minutes, in order to reset the alarm timer; and


(3) Immediately (within 30 seconds) notify another crewmember if the pilothouse alarm is not acknowledged.


(b) The time interval for the system alarm must be adjustable. The time may be adjusted by the owner or managing operator but must not be in excess of 10 minutes. This time interval, and information on alerter operation, must be provided on board and specified in the vessel's TSMS if applicable.


(c) The system alarm may be reset physically (*e.g.* a push button), or the reset may be accomplished by a link to other pilothouse action such as rudder or throttle control movement, or motion detection of personnel.


(d) A towing vessel need not comply with this section if a second person is provided in the pilothouse.


(e) Towing vessels 65 feet or less in length are not required to have a pilothouse alerter system.
