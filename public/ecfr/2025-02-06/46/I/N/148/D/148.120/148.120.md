# § 148.120   Stowage and segregation requirements.

(a) Each material listed in Table 148.10 of this part must be segregated from incompatible materials in accordance with—


(1) The requirements of Tables 148.120A and 148.120B of this section that pertain to the primary or subsidiary hazard class to which the materials belong. Whenever a subsidiary hazard may exist, the most stringent segregation requirement applies; and


(2) Any specific requirements in Subpart D of this part.


(b) Materials that are required to be separated during stowage must not be handled at the same time. Any residue from a material must be removed before a material required to be separated from it is loaded.


(c) Definitions and application of segregation terms:


(1) *“Separated from”* means located in different cargo compartments or holds when stowed under deck. If the intervening deck is resistant to fire and liquid, a vertical separation, i.e., in different cargo compartments, is acceptable as equivalent to this segregation.


(2) *“Separated by a complete cargo compartment or hold from”* means either a vertical or horizontal separation, for example, by a complete cargo compartment or hold. If the intervening decks are not resistant to fire and liquid, only horizontal separation is acceptable.


(3) *“Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete cargo compartment or hold from”* means that vertical separation alone does not meet this requirement.
