# § 148.300   Radioactive materials.

(a) Radioactive materials that may be stowed or transported in bulk are limited to those radioactive materials defined in 49 CFR 173.403 as Low Specific Activity Material, LSA-1, or Surface Contaminated Object, SCO-1.


(b) Skin contact, inhalation or ingestion of dusts generated by Class 7 material listed in Table 148.10 of this part must be minimized.


(c) Each hold used for the transportation of Class 7 material (radioactive) listed in Table 148.10 of this part must be surveyed after the completion of off-loading by a qualified person using appropriate radiation detection instruments. Such holds must not be used for the transportation of any other material until the non-fixed contamination on any surface, when averaged over an area of 300 cm
2, does not exceed the following levels:


(1) 4.0 Bq/cm
2 (10_−4_ uCi/cm
2;) for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters, natural uranium, natural thorium, uranium-235, uranium-238, thorium-232, thorium-228 and thorium-230 when contained in ores or physical or chemical concentrates, and radionuclides with a half-life of less than 10 days; and


(2) 0.4 Bq/cm
2 (10_−5_ uCi/cm
2) for all other alpha emitters.
