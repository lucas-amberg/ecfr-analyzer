# ยง 151.10-15   Certificate endorsement.

(a)-(b) [Reserved] 


(c) *Certificate endorsement.* The following information shall be submitted, and upon approval of calculations shall form part of the endorsement on the Certificate of Inspection: 


(1) Limiting draft for each hull type service for which approval is requested. 


(2) Maximum density (lb./gal.) and maximum cargo weight (tons) for each tank for which approval is requested. Their weights will normally reflect uniform loading except that for trim purposes the individual tank cargo weight may exceed the uniform loading tank cargo weight, corresponding to the barge fresh water deadweight at the limiting draft, by 5 percent. Where a greater degree of nonuniform loading is desired, longitudinal strength calculations shall be submitted.
