# ยง 151.50-41   Carbon disulfide (carbon bisulfide).

(a) All openings shall be in the top of the tank. 


(b) Loading lines shall terminate near the bottom of the tank. 


(c) A standard ullage opening shall be provided for secondary and emergency sounding. 


(d) If a cargo discharge pump is used, it shall be inserted through a cylindrical well extending from the tank top to a point near the tank bottom. A blanket of water shall be formed in this well before attempting pump removal. 


(e) Water or inert gas displacement may be used for discharging cargo provided the cargo system is designed for the expected pressure and temperature. This method for discharging may be used with pressure type tanks only. 


(f) Adequate natural ventilation shall be provided for the voids around the cargo tanks while the vessel is under way. During loading and unloading, forced ventilation shall be used. The forced ventilation shall be of sufficient capacity to provide a complete change of air within each void space every 5 minutes. The ventilating fan shall be of nonsparking construction. 


(g) Because of its low ignition temperature and the close clearances required to arrest its flame propagation, carbon disulfide (*carbon bisulfide*) requires safeguards beyond those required for any electrical hazard groups. 


(h) The requirements of ยง 151.50-40 are also applicable to the shipment of carbon disulfide (*carbon bisulfide*).
