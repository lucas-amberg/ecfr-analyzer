# ยง 153.404   Standards for containment systems having required closed gauges.

When Table 1 requires a cargo's containment system to have a closed gauge, the containment system must have the following: 


(a) A permanently installed closed gauging system. 


(b) A vapor return connection. 


(c) The high level alarm described in ยง 153.409. 


(d) Either a closed cargo sampling system or a cargo sampling arrangement allowing the retrieval of a sample through an orifice not exceeding:


(1) 0.635 cm (approx. 0.25 in.) diameter when the cargo's vapor pressure is 28 kPa gauge (approx. 4 psig) or less; or 


(2) 0.140 cm (approx. 0.055 in.) diameter when the cargo's vapor pressure exceeds 28 kPa (approx. 4 psig).
