# ยง 153.361   Arrangements for removal of valves from venting systems having multiple relief valves.

A venting system having multiple relief valves may be arranged to allow the removal of a valve (for repair, as an example) provided the venting system:


(a) Has valves that are interlocked, so that the removal of a valve does not reduce the venting system relieving capacity below the minimum relieving capacity required by ยง 153.358; and 


(b) Is arranged so that cargo vapor will not escape through the opening left after a valve has been removed.
