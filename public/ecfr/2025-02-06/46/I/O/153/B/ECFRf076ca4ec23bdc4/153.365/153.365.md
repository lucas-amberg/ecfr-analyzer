# § 153.365   Liquid overpressurization protection.

(a) Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, a containment system requiring closed or restricted gauging must:

(2) Have an overflow control system that meets § 153.408; or 


(3) Meet the requirements specified by the Commandant (CG-ENG).


(b) A containment system requiring restricted gauging, except for those cargoes that reference §§ 153.525 or 153.527, may be equipped with a spill valve that:
