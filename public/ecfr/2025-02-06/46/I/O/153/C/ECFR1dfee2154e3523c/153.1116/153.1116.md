# § 153.1116   Prewash for tanks unloaded without following the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual: Categories B and C.

If for any reason more Category B or C NLS residue remains in a cargo tank and transfer piping of a ship after unloading than would remain after a normal discharge of the cargo when the unloading procedures in the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual are followed, the tank must be prewashed following the procedures in § 153.1120 unless— 


(a) Section 153.1114 allows the prewash to be omitted; or 


(b) The residue is reduced using another procedure, and a Surveyor estimates and states in the Cargo Record Book that the cargo tank and transfer piping contain no more NLS residue than they would if discharged following the procedures in the approved Procedures and Arrangements Manual, and no other prewash is required by this part.
