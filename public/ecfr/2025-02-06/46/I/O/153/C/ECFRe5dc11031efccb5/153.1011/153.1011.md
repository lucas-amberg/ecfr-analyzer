# § 153.1011   Changing containment systems and hoses to and from alkylene oxide service.

(a) The person in charge of cargo transfer shall make sure that:


(1) No alkylene oxide is loaded into a containment system that last carried a cargo other than an alkylene oxide unless the containment system has been cleaned and inspected to make sure it is in good condition with no heavy rust accumulations or traces of previous cargoes;


(2) No alkylene oxide is loaded into a containment system that within the previous three loadings carried a cargo listed in paragraph (b) of this section unless the containment system has been cleaned to the satisfaction of a Coast Guard Marine Inspector or a person specifically authorized by the Commandant (CG-ENG) to approve alkylene oxide tank cleaning;


(3) No cargo but an alkylene oxide is loaded into a containment system which last carried an alkylene oxide unless the containment system has been cleaned of alkylene oxide to the satisfaction of a Coast Guard Marine Inspector or person specifically authorized by the Commandant (CG-ENG) to approve alkylene oxide tank cleaning; and


(4) No hose marked “For Alkylene Oxide Transfer Only” is used for the transfer of a cargo other than an alkylene oxide.


(b) The following cargoes are particularly reactive with alkylene oxides:


(1) Non-oxidizing mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric, phosphoric);


(2) Sulfuric acid;


(3) Nitric acid;


(4) Organic acids (e.g. acetic, formic);


(5) Halogenated organic acids (e.g. chloroacetic);


(6) Sulfonic acids (e.g. alkyl benzene sulfonic);


(7) Caustic alkalies (e.g. caustic soda, caustic potash; sodium hydrosulfide);


(8) Ammonia and ammonia solutions;


(9) Aliphatic amines;


(10) Alkanolamines; and
