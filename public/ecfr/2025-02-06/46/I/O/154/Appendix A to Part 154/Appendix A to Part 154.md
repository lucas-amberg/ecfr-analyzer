I. Equivalent stress (σ c) is calculated by the following formula or another formula specially approved by the Commandant (CG-522) as equivalent to the following: 


II. When the static and dynamic stresses are calculated separately, the total stresses in paragraph I are calculated from the following formulae or another formulae specially approved by the Commandant (CG-522) as equivalent to the following:


III. Each dynamic and static stress is determined from its acceleration component and its hull strain component from hull deflection and torsion.
