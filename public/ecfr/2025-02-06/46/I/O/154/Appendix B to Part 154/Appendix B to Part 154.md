# Appendix B to Part 154â€”Stress Analyses Definitions


The following are the standard definitions of stresses for the analysis of an independent tank type B: 


*Normal stress* means the component of stress normal to the plane of reference. 


*Membrane stress* means the component of normal stress that is uniformly distributed and equal to the average value of the stress across the thickness of the section under consideration. 


*Bending stress* means the variable stress across the thickness of the section under consideration, after the subtraction of the membrane stress. 


*Shear stress* means the component of the stress acting in the plane of reference. 


*Primary stress* means the stress produced by the imposed loading that is necessary to balance the external forces and moments. (The basic characteristic of a primary stress is that it is not self-limiting. Primary stresses that considerably exceed the yield strength result in failure or at least in gross deformations.) 


*Primary general membrane stress* means the primary membrane stress that is so distributed in the structure that no redistribution of load occurs as a result of yielding. 


*Primary local membrane stress* means the resulting stress from both a membrane stress, caused by pressure or other mechanical loading, and a primary or a discontinuity effect that produces excessive distortion in the transfer of loads to other portions of the structure. (The resulting stress is a primary local membrane stress although it has some characteristics of a secondary stress.) A stress region is local if:


*Secondary stress* means a normal stress or shear stress caused by constraints of adjacent parts or by self-constraint of a structure. The basic characteristic of a secondary stress is that it is self-limiting. Local yielding and minor distortions can satisfy the conditions that cause the stress to occur.
