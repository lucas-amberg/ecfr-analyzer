# ยง 154.448   Calculations.

The following calculations for an independent tank type B must be specially approved by the Commandant (CG-ENG): 


(a) Plastic deformation, fatigue life, buckling, and crack propagation resulting from static and dynamic loads on the tank and its support. 


(b) A three-dimensional analysis of the stress exerted by the hull on the tank, its support, and its keys. 


(c) The response of the tank and its support to the vessel's motion and acceleration in irregular waves or calculations from a similar vessel. 


(d) A tank buckling analysis considering the maximum construction tolerance. 


(e) A finite element analysis using the loads determined under ยง 154.406. 


(f) A fracture mechanics analysis using the loads determined under ยง 154.406. 


(g) The cumulative effects of the fatigue load from the following formula:
