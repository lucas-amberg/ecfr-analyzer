# § 154.460   Design criteria.

At static angles of heel up through 30°, a secondary barrier must


(a) If a complete secondary barrier is required in § 154.459, hold all of the liquid cargo in the cargo tank for at least 15 days under the dynamic loads in § 154.409(e);


(b) If a partial secondary barrier is permitted in § 154.459, hold any leakage of liquid cargo corresponding to the extent of failure under § 154.448(a) after initial detection or primary barrier leak for at least 15 days under the dynamic loads in § 154.409(e);


(c) If the primary barrier fails, prevent the temperature of the vessel's structure from falling below the minimum allowable service temperature of the steel; and


(d) Be designed so that a cargo tank failure does not cause a failure in the secondary barrier.
