# ยง 154.1205   Mechanical ventilation system: Standards.

(a) Each exhaust type mechanical ventilation system required under ยง 154.1200 (a) must have ducts for vapors from the following: 


(1) The deck level. 


(2) Bilges. 


(3) If the vapors are lighter than air, the top of each space that personnel enter during cargo handling operations. 


(b) The discharge end of each duct under paragraph (a) of this section must be at least 10 m (32.8 ft.) from ventilation intakes and openings to accommodations, service, control station, and other gas-safe spaces.

(d) Each ventilation system for a gas-safe cargo control station in the cargo area must change the air in that space at least eight times each hour. 


(e) A ventilation system must not recycle vapor from ventilation discharges. 


(f) Each mechanical ventilation system must have its operational controls outside the ventilated space.

(2) The impeller and housing made of non-ferrous material. 


(3) The impeller and housing made of austenitic stainless steel. 


(4) The impeller and housing made of ferrous material with at least 13mm (0.512 in.) tip clearance. 


(j) No ventilation fan may have any combination of fixed or rotating components made of an aluminum or magnesium alloy and ferrous fixed or rotating components.
