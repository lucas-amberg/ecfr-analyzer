(a) If Table 4 lists a closed gauge for a cargo, the liquid level gauging system under ยง 154.1305 must be closed gauges that do not have any opening through which cargo liquid or vapor could escape, such as an ultrasonic device, float type device, electronic or magnetic probe, or bubble tube indicator. 


(b) If Table 4 lists a restricted gauge for a cargo, the liquid level gauging system under ยง 154.1305 must be closed gauges that meet paragraph (a) of this section or restricted gauges that do not vent the cargo tank's vapor space, such as a fixed tube, slip tube, or rotary tube.
