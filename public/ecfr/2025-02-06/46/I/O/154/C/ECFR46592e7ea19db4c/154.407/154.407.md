# ยง 154.407   Cargo tank internal pressure head.

(a) For the calculation required under ยง 154.406(a)(1) and (b), the internal pressure head (h_eq_), must be determined from the following formula:


(b) The (h_gd_) _max_ is determined for the ฮฒ direction, on the ellipse in Figure 1, which gives the maximum value for h_gd_.


(c) When the longitudinal acceleration is considered in addition to the vertical transverse acceleration, an ellipsoid must be used in the calculations instead of the ellipse contained in Figure 1.
