# § 154.411   Cargo tank thermal loads.

For the calculations required under § 154.406(a)(4), the following determined loads must be specially approved by the Commandant (CG-ENG):


(a) Transient thermal loads for the cooling down periods of cargo tanks for design temperatures lower than −55 °C (−67 °F).


(b) Stationary thermal loads for cargo tanks for design temperatures lower than −55 °C (−67 °F) that cause high thermal stress.
