# ยง 154.345   Air locks.

(a) An air lock may be used for access from a gas-dangerous zone on the weather deck to a gas-safe space. 


(b) Each air lock must: 


(1) Consist of two steel doors, at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft.) but not more than 2.5 m (8.2 ft.) apart, each gasketed and tight when tested with a fire hose at not less 207 kPa gauge (30 psig); 


(2) Have self-closing doors with no latches or other devices for holding them open; 


(3) Have an audible and visual alarm on both sides which are actuated when both door securing devices are in other than the fully closed position at the same time; 


(4) Have mechanical ventilation in the space between the doors from a gas-safe area; 


(5) Have a pressure greater than that of the gas-dangerous area on the weather deck; 


(6) Have the rate of air change in the space between the doors of at least 8 changes per hour; and 


(7) Have the space between the doors monitored for cargo vapor leaks under ยง 154.1350. 


(c) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, no gas-safe space on a liquefied flammable gas carrier may have an air lock unless the space: 


(1) Is mechanically ventilated to make the pressure in the space greater than that in the air lock; and 


(2) Has a means of automatically de-energizing all electrical equipment that is not explosion-proof in the space when the pressure in the space falls to or below the pressure in the air lock.
