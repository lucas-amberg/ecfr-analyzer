(b) Along the length of the cargo area, grades of steel must be as follows:


(1) The deck stringer and sheer strake must be at least Grade E steel or a grade of steel that has equivalent chemical properties, mechanical properties, and heat treatment, and that is specially approved by the Commandant (CG-ENG).


(2) The strake at the turn of the bilge must be Grade D, Grade E, or a grade of steel that has equivalent chemical properties, mechanical properties, and heat treatment, and that is specially approved by the Commandant (CG-ENG).
