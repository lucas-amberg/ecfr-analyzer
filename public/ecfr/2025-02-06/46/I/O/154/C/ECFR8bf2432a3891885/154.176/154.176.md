# § 154.176   Longitudinal contiguous hull structure.

(a) The longitudinal contiguous hull structure of a vessel having cargo containment systems without secondary barriers must meet the standards of the American Bureau of Shipping published in “Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels”, 1981.


(b) The longitudinal contiguous hull structure of a vessel having cargo containment systems with secondary barriers must be designed for a temperature that is:


(1) Colder than the calculated temperature of this hull structure when: 


(i) The temperature of the secondary barrier is the design temperature; and 


(ii) For any waters in the world except Alaskan waters, the ambient cold condition of:


(A) Five knots air at −18 °C (0 °F); and 


(B) Still sea water at 0 °C (32 °F); or 


(iii) For Alaskan waters the ambient cold condition of:


(A) Five knots air at −29 °C (−20 °F); and 


(B) Still sea water at −2 °C (28 °F); or 


(2) Maintained by the heating system under § 154.178, if, without heat, the contiguous hull structure is designed for a temperature that is colder than the calculated temperature of the hull structure assuming the:


(i) Temperature of the secondary barrier is the design temperature; and 


(ii) Ambient cold conditions of still air at 5 °C (41 °F) and still sea water at 0 °C (32 °F).
