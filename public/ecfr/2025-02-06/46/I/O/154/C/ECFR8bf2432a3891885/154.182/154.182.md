If a portion of the contiguous hull structure is designed for a temperature colder than −34 °C (−30 °F) and is not part of the secondary barrier, each 100m (328 ft.) of full penetration butt welded joints in that portion of the contiguous hull structure must pass the following production weld tests in the position that the joint is welded: 


(a) Bend tests under § 57.06-4 of this chapter. 


(b) A Charpy V-notch toughness test under § 57.06-5 of this chapter on one set of 3 specimens alternating the notch location on successive tests between the center of the weld and the most critical location in the heat affected zone.
