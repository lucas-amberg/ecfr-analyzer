# ยง 154.804   Vacuum protection.

(a) Except as allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, each cargo tank must have a vacuum protection system meeting paragraph (a)(1) of this section and either paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section. 


(1) There must be a means of testing the operation of the system. 


(2) There must be a pressure switch that operates an audible and visual alarm in the cargo control station identifying the tank and the alarm condition and a remote group audible and visual alarm in the wheelhouse. Both alarms must be set at or below 80% of the maximum external design pressure differential of the cargo tanks. There must be a second, independent pressure switch that automatically shuts off all suction of cargo liquid or vapor from the cargo tank and secures any refrigeration of that tank at or below the maximum external design pressure differential. 


(3) There must be a vacuum relief valve that:


(i) Has a gas flow capacity at least equal to the maximum cargo discharge rate per tank; 


(ii) Is set to open at or below the maximum external design pressure differential; and 


(iii) Admits inert gas, cargo vapor from a source other than a cargo vapor header, or air except as prohibited under ยง 154.1710. 


(b) A vacuum protection system does not have to be installed if the cargo tank is designed to withstand:


(1) A maximum external pressure differential exceeding 24.5 kPa gauge (3.55 psig); and 


(2) The maximum external pressure differential that can be obtained:


(i) At maximum discharge rates with no vapor return to the cargo tanks; 


(ii) By operation of the cargo refrigeration system; or 


(iii) By drawing off vapor for use in accordance with ยง 154.703(c)
