# ยง 154.427   Membrane tank system design.

A membrane tank system must be designed for:


(a) Any static and dynamic loads with respect to plastic deformation and fatigue;


(b) Combined strains from static, dynamic, and thermal loads;


(c) Preventing collapse of the membrane from:


(1) Over-pressure in the interbarrier space;


(2) Vacuum in the cargo tank;


(3) Sloshing in a partially filled cargo tank; and


(4) Hull vibrations; and


(d) The deflections of the vessel's hull.
