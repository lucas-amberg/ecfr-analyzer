The tank design load calculations for a membrane tank must include the following:


(a) Plastic deformation and fatigue life resulting from static and dynamic loads in the membrane and the supporting insulation. 


(b) The response of the membrane and its supporting insulation to vessel motion and acceleration under the worst weather conditions. Calculations from a similar vessel may be submitted to meet this paragraph. 


(c) The combined strains from static, dynamic, and thermal loads.
