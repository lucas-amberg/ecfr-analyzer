# § 154.532   Valves: Cargo tank MARVS greater than 69 kPa gauge (10 psig).

(a) Except connections for tank safety relief valves and except for liquid level gauging devices other than those under §§ 154.536 and 154.1310, liquid and vapor connections on a cargo tank with a MARVS greater than 69 kPa gauge (10 psig) must have, as close to the tank as practical, a: 


(1) Stop valve capable of local manual operation; and 


(2) A remotely controlled quick-closing shut-off valve. 


(b) If the nominal pipe size of a liquid or vapor connection is less than 50 mm (2 in.), an excess flow valve may be substituted for the quick-closing valve under paragraph (a) of this section. 


(c) One valve may be substituted for the manual controlled stop valve and the remotely controlled quick-closing shut-off valve required under paragraph (a) of this section if that valve: 


(1) Meets §§ 154.540 and 154.544; and 


(2) Is capable of local manual operation.
