# ยง 160.010-6   Capacity of buoyant apparatus.

(a) The number of persons for which a buoyant apparatus is approved must be the lowest number determined by the following methods:


(1) Final buoyancy of the buoyant apparatus in Newtons after the watertight integrity test as described in ยง 160.010-7 (e) and (f), divided by 145 (divided by 32 if buoyancy is measured in pounds). The divisor must be changed to 180 (40 if buoyancy is measured in pounds) if the apparatus is designed so that persons supported are only partially immersed or where facilities are provided for climbing on top of the apparatus.


(2) Number of 300 mm (1 ft.) increments in the outside perimeter of the buoyant apparatus. The inside edge of peripheral-body type buoyant apparatus is not considered in determining the capacity.


(b) [Reserved]
