# ยง 160.031-3   Materials, construction, workmanship, and performance requirements.

(a) All materials used in the construction of shoulder gun type line-throwing appliances and equipment shall be of good quality, suitable for the purpose intended, and shall conform to the requirements of this specification. The choice of materials shall be such that resistance to corrosion by salt water or spray, shock, temperature change, and wear will be obtained. The use of dissimilar metals in combination shall be avoided wherever possible, but when such contacts are necessary, provision shall be made to prevent such deleterious effects as galvanic corrosion, freezing or buckling of moving parts, and loosening or tightening of joints due to difference in coefficients of thermal expansion.


(b) The design and construction shall be proper and substantial for effective and safe operation aboard ship.


(c) The workmanship shall be first class and free from any imperfections of manufacture affecting appearance or serviceability of the gun.


(d) The gun, when loaded and fired in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, shall be capable of propelling through relatively still air, the service projectile with service line attached, for a distance of not less than 75 m (250 ft.) with deviation from the target not to exceed 4.5 m (15 ft.) either side.
