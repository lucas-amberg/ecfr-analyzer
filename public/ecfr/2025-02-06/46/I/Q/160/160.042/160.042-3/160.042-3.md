# § 160.042-3   Construction.

(a) The trackways of the skids shall be constructed of 6″ × 3
1/2″ × 
1/2″ structural angles, or of material of approved shape and equivalent strength, inclined approximately 60 degrees from the horizontal. The trackways shall be spaced 8′-4″ from the inside of the 3
1/2″ vertical leg of one trackway angle to the inside of the 3
1/2″ vertical leg of the other trackway angle. The inside of the 6″ leg of the trackway angles shall form the skid surface for the life raft. The trackways shall be supported by a substantial structure suitable for stowing a Type A life raft at a 60-degree angle without having the raft project over the side of the vessel.


(b) The lower end of the life raft shall be supported by a base plate so arranged as to permit launching of the raft by a quick release assembly.


(c) All bearing surfaces of the quick release mechanism shall be constructed of non-corrosive metal. Alemite fittings shall be provided to insure positive lubrication of all bearing surfaces.
