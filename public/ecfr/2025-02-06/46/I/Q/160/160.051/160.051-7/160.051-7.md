# § 160.051-7   Design and performance of Coastal Service inflatable liferafts.

To obtain Coast Guard approval, each Coastal Service inflatable liferaft must comply with subpart 160.151, with the following exceptions:


(a) *Canopy requirements (IMO LSA Code chapter IV/4.1.1.5, (incorporated by reference, see § 160.051-5 of this subpart)).* The canopy may—


(1) Be of a type that is furled when the liferaft inflates and that can be set in place by the occupants. A furled canopy must be secured to the buoyancy tubes over 50 percent or more of the liferaft's circumference;


(2) Be of an uninsulated, single-ply design; and


(3) Have an interior of any color.


(b) *Viewing port (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.1.5.5).* The liferaft need not have the viewing port.


(c) *Rainwater collection (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.1.5.6).* The liferaft need not have the means of rainwater collection.


(d) *Capacity (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.2.1).* The carrying capacity must be not less than four persons.


(e) *Floor insulation (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.2.2).* The floor may be uninsulated.


(f) *Boarding ramps (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.4.1).* The liferaft need be provided with boarding ramps only if the combined cross-section diameter of the buoyancy chambers is greater than 500 mm (19.5 in).


(g) *Stability (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.5).* Each Coastal Service inflatable liferaft must either meet the stability criteria in § 160.151-17(a) or be fitted with water-containing stability pockets meeting the following requirements:


(1) The total volume of the pockets must be not less than 25 percent of the minimum required volume of the principal buoyancy compartments of the liferaft.


(2) The pockets must be securely attached and evenly distributed around the periphery of the exterior bottom of the liferaft. They may be omitted at the locations of inflation cylinders.


(3) The pockets must be designed to deploy underwater when the liferaft inflates. If weights are used for this purpose, they must be of corrosion-resistant material.


(h) *Lamp (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.3.4).* The liferaft need not have the manually controlled interior lamp. 


(i) *Markings (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.3.6).* The words “COASTAL SERVICE” must appear on the container, and the type of equipment pack must be identified as “Coastal Service”. No “SOLAS” markings may appear on the container.


(j) *Drop test.* The drop test required under paragraph 1/5.1 of IMO Revised recommendation on testing (incorporated by reference, see § 160.051-5 of this subpart) and 160.151-27(a) may be from a lesser height, if that height is the maximum height of stowage marked on the container.


(k) *Loading and seating test.* For the loading and seating test required under paragraph 1/5.7 of IMO Revised recommendation on testing and § 160.151-27(a), the loaded freeboard of the liferaft must be not less than 200 mm (8 in.).


(l) *Cold-inflation test.* The cold-inflation test required under paragraph 1/5.17.3.3.2 of IMO Revised recommendation on testing and § 160.151-27(a) must be conducted at a test temperature of −18 °C (0 °F).
