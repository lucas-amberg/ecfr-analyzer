# ยง 160.073-15   Tests.

(a) The manufacturer shall perform a tensile test on the first three links made from a particular spool of wire. The test must be done by slowly loading the link until it breaks. The link must break between the limits specified in ยง 160.073-10(b). The break must occur in the length of wire at or between the points where the loops are secured (see Figure 160.073-10).


(b) If each of the three links passes the test, each link constructed in the same manner from the same spool of wire may be certified by the manufacturer as meeting the requirements of this subpart.


(c) If one or more of the three links fails the test, no link manufactured in the same manner and from the same spool of wire as the test links may be certified as meeting the requirements of this subpart.
