# § 160.115-15   Production inspections, tests, quality control, and conformance of winches.

(a) Unless the Commandant directs otherwise, an independent laboratory must perform or witness, as appropriate, inspections, tests, and oversight required by this section. Production inspections and tests of a winch must be carried out in accordance with the procedures for independent laboratory inspection in 46 CFR part 159, subpart 159.007 and in this section, unless the Commandant authorizes alternative tests and inspections. The Commandant may prescribe additional production tests and inspections necessary to maintain quality control and to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subpart.


(b) *Manufacturer's responsibility.* The manufacturer must—


(1) Institute a quality control procedure to ensure that all production winches are produced to the same standard, and in the same manner, as the prototype winch approved by the Commandant. The manufacturer's quality control personnel must not work directly under the department or person responsible for either production or sales;


(2) Schedule and coordinate with the independent laboratory (or Coast Guard inspector if required under paragraph (a) of this section) to ensure that all tests are performed as described in this section;


(3) Submit to the Commandant a yearly report that contains the following—


(i) Serial number and date of final assembly of each winch constructed;


(ii) The name of the representative of the independent laboratory (or Coast Guard inspector if required under paragraph (a) of this section); and


(iii) Name of the vessel and company receiving the winch, if known;


(4) Ensure that the arrangement and materials entering into the construction of the winch are in accordance with plans approved under § 160.115-13(h) of this subpart;


(5) Allow an independent laboratory (or Coast Guard inspector if required under paragraph (a) of this section) access to any place where materials are stored for the winch, work or testing is performed on winches or their component parts and materials, or records are retained to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, below, for the purpose of—


(i) Assuring that the quality control program of the manufacturer is satisfactory;


(ii) Witnessing tests; or


(iii) Taking samples of parts or materials for additional inspections or tests; and


(6) Ensure that the independent laboratory (or Coast Guard inspector if required under paragraph (a) of this section) conducts the inspections and witnesses the tests required by paragraph (e) of this section, and further conducts a visual inspection to verify that the winches are being made in accordance with the plans approved under § 160.115-13(h) of this subpart and the requirements of this subpart.


(c) *Recordkeeping.* The manufacturer must maintain records in accordance with 46 CFR 159.007-13. The manufacturer must keep records of all items listed in this section for at least 5 years from the date of termination of approval of each winch. The records must include—


(1) A copy of this subpart, other CFR sections referenced in this subpart, and each document listed in § 160.115-5 of this subpart;


(2) A copy of the approved plans, documentation, and certifications;


(3) A current certificate of approval for each approved winch;


(4) Affidavits, certificates, or invoices from the suppliers identifying all essential materials used in the production of approved winches, together with records identifying the serial numbers of the winches in which such materials were used;


(5) Records of all structural welding and name of operator(s);


(6) Records of welder certificates, training, and qualifications;


(7) Date and results of calibration of test equipment and the name and address of the company or agency that performed the calibration;


(8) The serial number of each production winch, along with records of its inspections and tests carried out under this section; and


(9) The original purchaser of each winch and the vessel on which it was installed, if known.


(d) *Independent laboratory responsibility.* The independent laboratory must perform or witness, as appropriate, the inspections and tests under this section for each Coast Guard-approved winch to be installed on a U.S. flag vessel. If the manufacturer also produces winches for approval by other maritime safety administrations, the inspections may be coordinated with inspection visits for those administrations.


(e) *Production inspections and tests.* (1) Each approved winch must be inspected and tested in accordance with the procedures in 46 CFR part 159, subpart 159.007 and the brake test described in IMO Revised recommendation on testing, part 2, paragraph 6.1.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.115-5 of this subpart).


(2) The lowering tests described in IMO Revised recommendation on testing, Part 2, paragraph 6.1 may be performed if the installation height is known. If these tests are performed, the results must be in accordance with 46 CFR 199.153(h) through (j).
