# § 160.132-7   Design, construction, and performance of davits.

(a) To seek Coast Guard approval of a davit, a manufacturer must comply with, and each davit must meet, the requirements of following—


(1) IMO LSA Code chapter I/1.2.2 and Chapter VI/6.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.132-5 of this subpart) applicable to the design and intended service of the davit;


(2) IMO Revised recommendation on testing, part 1/8.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.132-5 of this subpart) applicable to the design and intended service of the davit;


(3) 46 CFR part 159; and


(4) This subpart.


(b) Each davit must meet the following requirements—


(1) *Materials.* Each major structural component of each davit must be constructed of steel. Other materials may be used if accepted by the Commandant as equivalent or superior—


(i) Structural steel made by the open-hearth or electric furnace process must be in accordance with ASTM A 36 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.132-5 of this subpart);


(ii) Steel castings not intended for fusion welding must be in accordance with ASTM A 36, Grades U-60-30, 60-30, 65-30, 65-35, and 70-36;


(iii) Steel castings intended to be fabricated by fusion welding must be in accordance with ASTM A 216 (incorporated by reference, see § 160.132-5 of this subpart), Grades WCA and WCB;


(iv) Cast iron must not be used in the construction of a davit; and


(v) Metals in contact with each other must be either galvanically compatible or insulated with suitable non-porous materials. Provisions must also be made to prevent loosening or tightening resulting from differences of thermal expansion, freezing, buckling of parts, galvanic corrosion, or other incompatibilities;


(2) *Bearings.* (i) Bearings must be of non-ferrous metal, or must be of the roller or ball-bearing type;


(ii) Positive means of lubrication must be provided; and


(iii) The manufacturer must furnish a lubrication chart for each davit together with a plate attached to the davit indicating the lubricants recommended for extremes in temperature;


(3) *Guards.* All moving parts must have guards;


(4) *Welding.* Welding must be performed by welders certified by the Commandant, a classification society recognized by the Commandant in accordance with 46 CFR 8.220, the U.S. Navy, or the national body where the davit is constructed or the national body's designated recognized organization. Only electrodes intended for use with the material being welded may be used. All welds must be checked using appropriate non-destructive tests; and


(5) *Hydraulic systems,* if installed, must be in accordance with 46 CFR part 58, subpart 58.30.


(c) Determinations of equivalence of design, construction, and materials will be made by the Commandant only.
