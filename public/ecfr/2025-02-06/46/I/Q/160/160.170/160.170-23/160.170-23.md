# § 160.170-23   Procedure for approval of design, material, or construction change.

(a) Each change in design, material, or construction from the plans approved under 46 CFR 159.005-13 and § 160.170-13(h) of this subpart must be approved by the Commandant before being used in any production release mechanism.

(c) Determinations of equivalence of design, construction, and materials will be made by the Commandant only.
