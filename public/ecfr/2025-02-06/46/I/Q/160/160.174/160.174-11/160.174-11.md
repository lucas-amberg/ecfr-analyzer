# § 160.174-11   Performance.

(a) *Thermal protection.* The thermal protective aid must be designed to protect against loss of body heat as follows:


(1) The thermal conductivity of the material from which the thermal protective aid is constructed must be not more than 0.25 W/(m−°K).


(2) The thermal protective aid must prevent evaporative heat loss.


(3) The aid must function properly at an air temperature of −30 °C (−22 °F) to + 20 °C (68 °F).


(b) *Donning Time.* Each thermal protective aid must be designed to enable a person to don the aid correctly within one minute after reading the donning and use instructions described in § 160.174-15(a).


(c) *Storage Temperature.* A thermal protective aid must not be damaged by storage in its storage case at any temperature between −30 °C (−22 °F) and + 65 C (149 °F).


(d) *In water performance.* The thermal protective aid must be designed to permit the wearer to remove it in the water within two minutes, if it impairs ability to swim.


(e) *Water penetration.* The fabric from which the thermal protective aid is constructed must maintain its watertight integrity when supporting a column of water 2 meters high.


(f) *Oil resistance.* Each thermal protective aid must be designed to be useable after 24 hours exposure to diesel oil.
