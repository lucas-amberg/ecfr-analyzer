# § 161.012-17   Instructions.

(a) Each light must have instructions on how to attach it to a PFD in a manner that complies with § 161.012-7(a). However, in the case of lights that are to be attached by a PFD manufacturer, only one set of instructions need be provided for each shipment of lights.


(b) If a light is designed to be attached to a finished PFD, any attachment materials that are not supplied with the light must be clearly identified in the instructions. If a light is to be attached to a finished PFD by a PFD purchaser, any attachment materials not supplied with the light must be generally available for purchase.


(c) Each set of instructions must—(1) Clearly identify the kind of PFD construction (for example fabric covered or vinyl dipped) to which the light can be attached; and


(2) Not require penetration of the buoyant material of the PFD.
