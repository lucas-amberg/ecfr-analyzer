# § 162.050-23   Separator: Approval tests.

(a) *Test Conditions.* (1) Each test described in this section must be performed at a throughput and influent pressure equal to the maximum throughput and pressure at which the separator being tested is designed to operate. The tests and each of the steps in the tests must be carried out in the order described in this section. Each test must be performed without time delay between steps in the test.


(2) A test rig of the type described in § 162.050-17 must be used in performing each test.


(3) If a separator has a supply pump, it must be tested using that pump. If a separator does not have a supply pump, it must be tested using the mixture pump on the test rig.


(4) The influent water used in each test must be clean fresh water or clean fresh water in solution with sodium chloride. In either case, the relative density of the water must be no greater than 1.015 at 20 °C.


(5) Each test must be conducted at an ambient temperature of between 10 °C and 30 °C.


(6) The oil content of each sample must be measured using the method described in § 162.050-39.


(7) Influent oil content must be determined during testing by measuring the flow rates of the oil and water that are mixed to form the influent or by use of an oil content meter on the inlet piping of the test rig. If an oil content meter is used, a sample of influent and a meter reading must be taken at the beginning of each test. If the meter reading is not within ±10 percent of the oil content of the sample, the meter readings subsequently taken during the test are unacceptable test results.


(8) When collecting a sample at a sample point that has a stop cock, the first minute of fluid flow through the stop cock must not be included in the sample collected.


(9) In each test, the separator must be operated in accordance with the procedures described in its instruction manual.


(10) No maintenance, including replacement of parts, may be performed on a separator during or between the tests described in this section.


(11) A 1 liter sample of each oil to be used in testing must be taken and provided for use in the sample analysis required by § 162.050-39 .


(12) The separator may not be operated manually in Test No. 5A.


(13) If a separator has an integral bilge alarm, the separator must be tested with the bilge alarm installed.


(b) The following tests must be conducted using Test Fluid A:


(1) *Test No. 1A.* The separator is filled with water and started. Next, the separator is fed with pure Test Fluid A for at least 5 minutes and then with a mixture of Test Fluid A and water influent containing Test Fluid A content of between 5,000 and 10,000 ppm until a steady flow rate at a steady, constant ppm occurs. After the flow rate is steady, the influent is fed to the separator for 30 minutes. Samples of separated water effluent are taken after the first 10 and 20 minutes. At the end of the 30-minute period, the air cock on the test rig is opened and, if necessary, the oil and water supply valves are closed to stop the flow of influent. A sample is then taken of the separated water effluent as the effluent flow ceases.


(2) *Test No. 2A.* Repeat Test No. 1A in paragraph (b)(1) of this section using an influent containing approximately 25 percent oil and 75 percent water. Percentage is on a by volume basis.


(3) *Test No. 3A.* The separator is fed with 100 percent Test Fluid A until Fluid A is discharged at the oil discharge outlet of the separator at essentially the same rate that oil is being fed to the separator. The separator is then fed with 100 percent Test Fluid A for 5 additional minutes. If any oily mixture is discharged from the separated water outlet on the separator during the test, that observation is recorded.


(4) *Test No. 4A.* The separator is fed with water for 15 minutes. Samples of the separated water effluent are taken at the beginning of the test and after the first 10 minutes.


(5) *Test No. 5A.* The separator is operated automatically for 3 hours. During the test, the separator is continuously fed with an influent varying from water to a mixture of 25 percent Test Fluid A in water and back to water every 15 minutes. The Test Fluid A concentration in the influent is varied in at least five equal increments during each 15-minute period and the time intervals between the incremental changes are equal. During the last hour, the separator must be inclined at an angle of 22.5° with the plane of its normal operating position. During the last time increment in which the unit is fed a 25 percent Fluid A mixture, a sample of the separated water effluent is taken. If the separator stops at any time during this test, that observation is recorded.


(c) The following tests must be conducted using Test Fluid B:


(1) *Test No. 1B.* Repeat Test No. 1A in paragraph (b)(1) of this section using Test Fluid B; and


(2) *Test No. 2B.* Repeat Test No. 2A in paragraph (b)(2) of this section using Test Fluid B.


(d) The following tests must be conducted using Test Fluid C: *Test No. 1C.* The separator is fed with a mixture composed of 6 percent Test Fluid C and 94 percent water by volume such that the emulsified Test Fluid C content is approximately 3,000 ppm in the test water until a steady flow rate occurs. After the flow rate is steady, the influent containing the 6 percent Test Fluid C solution is fed to the separator operating automatically for 3 hours. Samples of separated water effluent are taken at 50 minutes and 100 minutes. At the end of the 3-hour period, the air cock on the test rig is opened and, if necessary, the oil and water supply valves are closed to stop the flow of influent. A sample is then taken of the separated water effluent as the effluent flow ceases.
