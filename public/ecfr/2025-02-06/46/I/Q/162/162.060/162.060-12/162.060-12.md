# § 162.060-12   Use and acceptance of existing test data.

(a) A manufacturer whose ballast water management system (BWMS) has completed approval testing for a foreign administration in accordance with the International Maritime Organization's Guidelines for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems (G8) may use the data and information developed during such approval testing to support the submission of an application pursuant to § 162.060-14 of this subpart. The applicant must submit the data and other information developed during approval testing and evaluation for another administration, and include a concise but thorough explanation of how the submission meets or exceeds the requirements of this subpart in respect to design, material and manufacture, and ability to meet the BWDS requirements.


(b) Applications under paragraph (a) of this section will not need to comply with the requirements for advance notice under § 162.060-10(a) of this subpart for testing that has already occurred; or with the requirements that all evaluation, inspection, and testing of the BWMS is conducted by an independent laboratory, previously accepted by the Coast Guard, under § 162.060-10(b) of this subpart. However—


(1) If the applicant determines, prior to submission of an application, that one or more aspects of the Coast Guard's requirements for approval of a BWMS are not satisfied by the data and information developed for approval by another administration, and that additional testing and evaluation is required, the applicant will notify the Coast Guard of the intent to conduct the new testing in accordance with the requirements of § 162.060-10(a) and (b)(1) of this subpart.


(2) While laboratories and test facilities that conducted the test and evaluation for approval by another administration are not required to have been designated as independent laboratories under the requirements of this subpart at the time of such work, as would otherwise be required under § 162.060-10(b) of this subpart, all laboratories and test facilities must have met the requirements under 46 CFR 159.010-3 and 159.010-5(a) at the time of such work. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the satisfaction of this requirement is adequately documented in the application.
