# § 164.007-9   Procedure for approval.

The following items shall be accomplished in sequential order.


(a) *Test request information.* If a manufacturer desires to have a structural insulation approved, a written request shall be submitted to the Commandant of the Coast Guard together with the following:


(1) If the material has already been approved as an incombustible material under subpart 164.009 of this part, the approval number of the material shall be indicated. If not, the procedure set forth in subpart 164.009 of this part shall be followed; and such approval shall be obtained prior to submittal under this specification.


(2) A description and trade name of the structural insulation.


(3) A statement of the composition of the material and the percentage of each component.


(4) A sample of the material at least 1 foot square in the thickness and density proposed by the manufacturer to be tested. When more than one thickness of a material of the same density is to be tested, only a sample of a single thickness need be submitted.


(5) The range of thicknesses and densities in which it is proposed to manufacture or use the material together with any information or recommendations that the manufacturer may have as to maximum or minimum thickness or density.


(6) The location of the place or places where the material will be manufactured.


(7) Description of attachment to or protection of the bulkhead or deck. If an adhesive is used, a liberal sample shall be supplied.


(8) A sketch showing typical installation methods and indicating limitations if any.


(9) A general statement describing manufacturing procedures indicating the degree of quality control exercised and the degree of inspection performed by outside organizations.


(10) A statement indicating proposed methods for field identification of the products as being approved. Identification shall include the Coast Guard approval numbers.


(b) *Test suitability.* The above information will be examined by the Coast Guard, and if it is indicated that the material is in all respects suitable for testing, the manufacturer will be so advised. Coast Guard comments on the manufacturer's recommended thickness and density of the sample or samples for the fire resistance test will be given at this time, together with the estimated cost of the required test.


(c) *Samples to be submitted.* If the material is indicated as being suitable for testing, the manufacturer shall submit a 100 cm. × 150 cm. (40″ × 60″) sample, a 30 cm. × 30 cm. (12″ × 12″) sample and a 60 cm. × 60cm. (24″ × 24″) sample for each thickness and density proposed to the Fire Research section of the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC 20234, and shall advise the Coast Guard of the shipment. A separate test will be made for each density of the material for which approval is desired.


(d) *Pretest information.* At this time the manufacturer shall submit to the Coast Guard the following:


(1) A statement that the material is offered for testing as described pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section is completely representative of the product which will be manufactured and sold under U.S. Coast Guard approval if such approval is granted and that the shipbuilder will be advised of the proper installation methods and the limitations of the approval.


(2) A commitment that he will reimburse the National Bureau of Standards for the cost or review of the tests when billed by them.


(3) If the manufacturer desires to witness the test, he should so indicate at this time.


(e) *Test authorization.* The National Bureau of Standards will then be authorized to conduct the tests noted in § 164.007-4 and, upon completion of all testing, the manufacturer will be billed directly by the National Bureau of Standards. Four copies of the test report containing the information required by § 164.007-6 will be submitted to the Coast Guard.


(f) *Notification of results.* A copy of the report will be forwarded to the manufacturer and he will be advised if his material is approved under this subpart. If approved, any stipulations of the approval will be specified. This information will be published in the _Federal Register,_ and a certificate of approval will be issued to the manufacturer.


(g) *Other laboratories.* (1) If the manufacturer desires to have the test conducted at some laboratory other than the National Bureau of Standards, this information shall be supplied at the time of initial contact with the Coast Guard. If the proposed laboratory is acceptable to the Coast Guard, the manufacturer will be so advised, and any special testing requirements together with any estimated cost of expenses incurred by the National Bureau of Standards for their review will be specified at this time. The Coast Guard shall be notified in advance of the date of the test so that a representative may be present.


(2) The laboratory shall submit four copies of a detailed test report to the Coast Guard together with representative samples of the material taken before and after testing. The test report and samples will be examined by the National Bureau of Standards for compliance with this subpart. The test report shall include the information required by § 164.007-6 together with any other pertinent data.
