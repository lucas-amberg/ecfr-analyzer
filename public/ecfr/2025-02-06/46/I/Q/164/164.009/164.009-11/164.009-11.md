# ยง 164.009-11   Furnace apparatus.

(a) The test furnace apparatus consists of a furnace tube, stabilizer, draft shield, furnace stand, temperature coil controls with a voltage stabilizer, specimen holder, specimen insertion device, and three thermocouples (a furnace thermocouple to measure furnace temperature, a surface thermocouple to measure temperature at the surface of a specimen, and a specimen thermocouple to measure temperature at the center of a specimen). A detailed plan of the construction and arrangement of the furnace apparatus may be obtained from the Commandant (CG-521).


(b) Temperatures measured by the thermocouples are recorded by an instrument having a measuring range that corresponds to the temperature changes that occur during a furnace calibration or test. The temperature recording equipment is accurate to within at least 0.5 percent of temperatures recorded during a test.
