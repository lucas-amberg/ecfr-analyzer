# ยง 167.01-8   Inspection of school ships using gross tonnage criterion.

(a) One of the criteria used for invocation of safety standards is the descriptions of school ships by relative sizes in gross tonnages. When it is determined in accordance with ยง 70.05-20 of this chapter that a particular school ship has a Bureau of Customs' assigned gross register tonnage which is not indicative of the relative physical size of the vessel, the requirements in this part and the manning shall be that applicable to a vessel of the greater relative size.
