# ยง 169.239   Hull.

At each inspection for certification and periodic inspection, the vessel must be afloat and ready for the following tests and inspections of the hull structure and its appurtenances:


(a) All accessible parts of the exterior and interior of the hull, the watertight bulkheads, and weather deck are examined. Where the internals of the vessel are completely concealed, sections of the lining or ceiling may be removed or the parts otherwise probed or exposed so that the inspector may be satisfied as to the condition of the hull structure.


(b) All watertight closures in the hull, decks and bulkheads are examined and operated.


(c) The condition of the superstructure, masts, and similar arrangements constructed on the hull is checked. All spars, standing rigging, running rigging, blocks, fittings, and sails, including storm sails are inspected.


(d) All railings and bulwarks and their attachment to the hull structure are inspected. Special attention is paid to ensure that guards or rails are provided in all dangerous places.


(e) All weathertight closures above the weather deck are inspected. The provisions for drainage of sea water from the exposed decks are checked.
