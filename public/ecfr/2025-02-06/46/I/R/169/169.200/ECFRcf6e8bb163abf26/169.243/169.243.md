At each inspection for certification and periodic inspection, the marine inspector will examine and test the following items to the extent necessary, to determine that they are in proper operating condition, in safe electrical condition, and fit for the service for which they are intended: 


(a) *Electrical cable.* All cable is examined as far as practicable without undue disturbance of the cable or electrical apparatus.


(b) *Overload or circuit protective devices.* Circuit breakers are tested by manual operation and fuses examined visually. The ratings of fuses are checked to determine suitability for the service intended.


(c) *Rotating machinery.* Rotating electrical machinery essential to the routine operation of the vessel is examined.


(d) *Generators, etc.* All generators, motors, lighting fixtures and circuit interrupting devices located in spaces or areas which may contain flammable vapors are checked.


(e) *Storage batteries.* Batteries are checked for condition and security of stowage.


(f) *Fire detection and alarm system.* Electrical apparatus, which operates as part of or in conjunction with a fire detection or alarm system installed on board the vessel, is operationally tested. The test is applied, in a manner to simulate, as closely as practicable, the actual operation in case of fire.
