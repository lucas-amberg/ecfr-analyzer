# § 169.565   Fixed carbon dioxide system.

(a) The number of pounds of carbon dioxide required for each space protected must be equal to the gross volume of the space divided by the appropriate factor in Table 169.565(a).


(b) A separate supply of carbon dioxide is not required for each space protected. The total available supply must be sufficient for the space requiring the greatest amount. 


(c) *Controls.* (1) Each control and valve for the operation of the system must be outside the spaces protected and accessible at all times. 


(2) Each branch line must be fitted with an approved shutoff valve. Each valve must be kept closed at all times except to operate the particular system. 


(3) The arrangements must be such that the entire charge to any space can be introduced into the space by the operation of one valve selecting the space, and one control for releasing the required amount of fire extinguishing agent. The release control must be of an approved type and located adjacent to the branch line shutoff valve. 


(4) Complete but simple instructions for the operation of the system must be located in a conspicuous place at or near the releasing control device. 


(5) Each control valve to branch lines must be labeled to indicate the space served. 


(d) *Piping.* (1) The pipe and fittings for the extinguishing systems must be in accordance with the system manufacturer's approved design manual. 


(2) Each pipe, valve, and fitting of ferrous materials must be galvanized. 


(3) Each dead-end line must extend at least 2 inches beyond the last orifice and must be closed with cap or plug. 


(4) Each pipe, valve, and fitting must be securely supported and, where necessary, protected against injury. 


(5) Drains and dirt traps must be fitted where necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt or moisture. Each drain and dirt trap must be located in accessible locations but not in accommodation spaces. 


(e) *Discharge outlets.* (1) The area of discharge outlets shall be as specified in the manufacturer's approved design manual. 


(2) The discharge of the required amount of carbon dioxide must be complete within two minutes. 


(f) *Cylinders.* (1) Each cylinder must be securely fastened and supported, and where necessary protected against injury. Cylinders must be located outside the space protected. 


(2) Each cylinder must be mounted in an upright position or inclined not more than 30° from the vertical, except that cylinders which are fitted with flexible or bent siphon tubes may be inclined not more than 80° from the vertical. 


(3) Each cylinder used for storing extinguishing agent must be approved and marked in accordance with Department of Transportation regulations. 


(4) Each cylinder must be mounted so it is readily accessible and capable of easy removal for recharging and inspection. Cylinders must be capable of being weighed in place. 


(5) Where subject to moisture, cylinders must be installed so that a space of at least 2 inches is provided between the flooring and the bottom of the cylinders. 


(6) Each cylinder storage area must be properly ventilated and the temperature inside must not exceed 130 °F. 


(g) Provision must be made by means of plugs, covers, dampers, etc., to prevent the admission of air into the space protected. 


(h) Systems must be fitted with a delayed discharge and an alarm bell arranged so the alarm sounds for at least twenty seconds before the carbon dioxide is released into the space.
