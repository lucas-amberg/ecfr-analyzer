# § 169.735   Fire hose stations.

Each fire hydrant must be identified in red letters and figures at least two inches high “FIRE STATION NO. 1,” “2,” “3,” etc. Where the hose is not stowed in the open or readily seen behind glass, this identification must be placed so as to be readily seen from a distance.
