# ยง 171.015   Location of margin line.

(a) *A vessel with a continuous bulkhead deck and sufficient sheer.* If the average value of the sheer at the forward perpendicular (FP) and the after perpendicular (AP) is at least 12 inches (30.5 cm), the margin line must be located no less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck at side as illustrated in Figure 171.015(a).


(b) *A vessel with a continuous bulkhead deck and insufficient sheer.* If the average value of the sheer at the forward perpendicular (FP) and the after perpendicular (AP) is less than 12 inches (30.5 cm), the margin line must be a parabolic curve with the following characteristics:


(1) The parabolic curve must be at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck at the FP and AP.


(2) The parabolic curve must be at least the distance given in Table 171.015 below the surface of the bulkhead deck amidships.


(3) Intermediate values not shown in Table 171.015 must be interpolated.


(4) Figure 171.015(b) illustrates a margin line drawn in this manner.


(c) *A vessel with a discontinuous bulkhead deck.* A continuous margin line must be drawn that is no more than 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck at side as illustrated in Figure 171.015(c).


(d) *A vessel with a discontinuous bulkhead deck where the side shell is carried watertight to a higher deck.* A continuous margin line must be drawn as illustrated in Figure 171.015(d).
