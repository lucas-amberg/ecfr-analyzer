(a) Each mechanically propelled or non-self propelled vessel other than a pontoon vessel must be shown by design calculations, in each condition of loading and operation, to have a metacentric height (GM) in feet (meters) of not less than the value given by the following equation:


(b) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section are limited in application to the conditions of loading and operation of vessels for which the righting arm (GZ) at the angle (T), calculated after the vessel is permitted to trim free until the trimming moment is zero, is not less than the minimum metacentric height (GM) calculated in paragraph (a) of this section multiplied by sin(T). In conditions not meeting this requirement, the Coast Guard Marine Safety Center requires calculations in addition to those in this section.


(c) A vessel that complies with the requirements for passenger ships contained in the International Code of Intact Stability, 2008 (2008 IS Code) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 171.012) need not comply with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.
