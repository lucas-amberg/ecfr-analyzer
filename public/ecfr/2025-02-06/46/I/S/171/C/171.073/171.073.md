# ยง 171.073   Treatment of stepped and recessed bulkheads in Type II subdivision.

(a) A main transverse watertight bulkhead may not be stepped unless additional watertight bulkheads are located as shown in Figure 171.067(a) so that the distances A, B, C, and D illustrated in Figure 171.067(a) comply with the following:


(1) A and B must not exceed the maximum bulkhead spacing that permits compliance with ยง 171.070; and


(2) C and D must not be less than the minimum spacing specified in ยง 171.070(e).


(b) A main transverse watertight bulkhead may not be recessed unless all parts of the recess are inboard from the shell of the vessel as illustrated in Figure 171.067(c).


(c) If a main transverse watertight bulkhead is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead must be used in the calculations required by ยง 171.070.
