# ยง 171.109   Watertight floors in double bottoms.

If a vessel is required to have a double bottom, a watertight transverse division must be located in the double bottom under each main transverse watertight bulkhead or as near as practicable to the main transverse watertight bulkhead. If a vessel also has duct keels, the transverse divisions need not extend across them.
