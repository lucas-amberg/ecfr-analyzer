# § 172.065   Damage stability.

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this section, *Length* or *L* means load line length (LLL).


(b) *Calculations.* Each tank vessel must be shown by design calculations to meet the survival conditions in paragraph (g) of this section in each condition of loading and operation except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, assuming the damage specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Conditions of loading and operation.* The design calculations required by paragraph (b) of this section need not be done for ballast conditions if the vessel is not carrying oil, other than oily residues, in cargo tanks.


(d) *Character of damage.* (1) If a tank vessel is longer than 738 feet (225 meters) in length, design calculations must show that it can survive damage at any location.


(2) If a tank vessel is longer than 492 feet (150 meters) in length, but not longer than 738 feet (225 meters), design calculations must show that it can survive damage at any location except the transverse bulkheads bounding an aft machinery space. The machinery space is calculated as a single floodable compartment.


(3) If a tank vessel is 492 feet (150 meters) or less in length, design calculations must show that it can survive damage—


(i) At any location between adjacent main transverse watertight bulkheads except to an aft machinery space;


(ii) To a main transverse watertight bulkhead spaced closer than the longitudinal extent of collision penetration specified in Table 172.065(a) from another main transverse watertight bulkhead; and


(iii) To a main transverse watertight bulkhead or a transverse watertight bulkhead bounding a side tank or double bottom tank if there is a step or a recess in the transverse bulkhead that is longer than 10 feet (3.05 meters) and that is located within the extent of penetration of assumed damage. The step formed by the after peak bulkhead and after peak tank top is not a step for the purpose of this regulation.


(e) *Extent of damage.* For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section—


(1) Design calculations must include both side and bottom damage, applied separately; and


(2) Damage must consist of the penetrations having the dimensions given in Table 172.065(a) except that, if the most disabling penetrations would be less than the penetrations described in this paragraph, the smaller penetration must be assumed.


(f) *Permeability of spaces.* When doing the calculations required in paragraph (b) of this section—


(1) The permeability of a floodable space, other than a machinery space, must be as listed in Table 172.065(b);


(2) Calculations in which a machinery space is treated as a floodable space must be based on an assumed machinery space permeability of 85%, unless the use of an assumed permeability of less than 85% is justified in detail; and


(3) If a cargo tank would be penetrated under the assumed damage, the cargo tank must be assumed to lose all cargo and refill with salt water, or fresh water if the vessel operates solely on the Great Lakes, up to the level of the tank vessel's final equilibrium waterline.


(g) *Survival conditions.* A vessel is presumed to survive assumed damage if it meets the following conditions in the final stage of flooding:


(1) *Final waterline.* The final waterline, in the final condition of sinkage, heel, and trim, must be below the lower edge of an opening through which progressive flooding may take place, such as an air pipe, or an opening that is closed by means of a weathertight door or hatch cover. This opening does not include an opening closed by a—


(i) Watertight manhole cover;


(ii) Flush scuttle;


(iii) Small watertight cargo tank hatch cover that maintains the high integrity of the deck;


(iv) Class 1 door in a watertight bulkhead within the superstructure; 


(v) Remotely operated sliding watertight door; or


(vi) Side scuttle of the non-opening type.


(2) *Heel angle.* The maximum angle of heel must not exceed 25 degrees, except that this angle may be increased to 30 degrees if no deck edge immersion occurs.


(3) *Range of stability.* Through an angle of 20 degrees beyond its position of equilibrium after flooding, a tank vessel must meet the following conditions:


(i) The righting arm curve must be positive.


(ii) The maximum righting arm must be at least 3.94 inches (10 cm).


(iii) Each submerged opening must be weathertight.


(4) *Progressive flooding.* Pipes, ducts or tunnels within the assumed extent of damage must be either—


(i) Equipped with arrangements such as stop check valves to prevent progressive flooding to other spaces with which they connect; or 


(ii) Assumed in the design calculations required in paragraph (b) of this section to permit progressive flooding to the spaces with which they connect.


(h) *Buoyancy of superstructure.* For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section, the buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage is to be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage may be taken into consideration if they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place.
