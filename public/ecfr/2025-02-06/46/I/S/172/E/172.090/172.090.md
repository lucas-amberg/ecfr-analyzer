# § 172.090   Intact transverse stability.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each tank barge must be shown by design calculations to have a righting arm curve with the following characteristics:


(1) If the tank barge is in river service, the area under the righting arm curve must be at least 5 foot-degrees (1.52 meter-degrees) up to the smallest of the following angles:


(i) The angle of maximum righting arm.


(ii) The downflooding angle.


(2) If the tank barge is in lakes, bays and sounds or Great Lakes summer service, the area under the righting arm curve must be at least 10 foot-degrees (3.05 meter-degrees) up to the smallest of the following angles:


(i) The angle of maximum righting arm.


(ii) The downflooding angle.


(3) If the tank barge is in ocean or Great Lakes winter service, the area under the righting arm curve must be at least 15 foot-degrees (4.57 meter-degrees) up to the smallest of the following angles:


(i) The angle of maximum righting arm.


(ii) The downflooding angle.


(b) If the vertical center of gravity of the cargo is below the weather deck at the side of the tank barge amidships, it must be shown by design calculations that the barge has at least the following metacentric height (GM) in feet (meters) in each condition of loading and operation:


(c) The effective freeboard is given by—


(d) For the purpose of this section, downflooding angle means the static angle from the intersection of the vessel's centerline and waterline in calm water to the first opening that does not close watertight automatically.
