(b) *Type I barge hull in an integrated tow.* If a Type I barge hull is required and the barge is a box barge designed for operation in an integrated tow, design calculations must show that the barge can survive damage—


(1) At any location on the bottom of the tank barge except on a transverse watertight bulkhead; and


(2) At any location on the side of the tank barge including on a transverse watertight bulkhead.


(c) *Type II barge hull.* If a Type II hull is required, design calculations must show that a barge can survive damage at any location except on a transverse watertight bulkhead.
