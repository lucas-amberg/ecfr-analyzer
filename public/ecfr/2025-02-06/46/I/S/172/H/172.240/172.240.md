# ยง 172.240   Permeability of spaces.

When doing the calculations required in ยง 172.225,


(a) The permeability of a floodable space, other than a machinery or cargo space, must be assumed as listed in Table 172.240;


(b) Calculations in which a machinery space is treated as a floodable space must be based on an assumed machinery space permeability of 85% unless the use of an assumed permeability of less than 85% is justified in detail; and


(c) Calculations in which a cargo space that is completely filled is considered flooded must be based on an assumed cargo space permeability of 60% unless the use of an assumed permeability of less than 60% is justified in detail. If the cargo space is not completely filled, a cargo space permeability of 95% must be assumed unless the use of an assumed permeability of less than 95% is justified in detail.
