(a) Except as provided in this section, each sailing school vessel must meet the intact stability requirements in §§ 170.170, 171.050, and 171.055 of this chapter.


(b) In applying the requirements in §§ 170.170 and 171.050 of this subchapter, the value of “T” is equal to the angle of heel at which the deck edge is immersed or 
1/3 of the downflooding angle, whichever is less.

(1) The value “X” is equal to 0.6 long tons/square foot (9.8 metric tons/square meter).


(2) For a vessel in service on protected or partially protected waters, values “Y” and “Z” are determined from graphs 173.063 (a) and (b) and multiplied by the multiplier in graph 173.063(e).


(3) For a vessel in service on exposed waters, “Y” and “Z” are determined from graphs 173.063 (c) and (d) and multiplied by the multiplier from graph 173.063(e).


(4) To convert required numerals to units of “metric tons/square meter,” multiply by 10.94.


(d) Each vessel of the open boat type that is required to comply with the requirements in §§ 178.300 and 178.310 of this chapter, may instead comply with the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.
