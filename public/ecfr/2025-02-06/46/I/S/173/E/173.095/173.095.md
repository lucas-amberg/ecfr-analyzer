# § 173.095   Towline pull criterion.

(a) In each towing condition, each vessel must be shown by design calculations to meet the requirements of either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.


(b) The vessel's metacentric height (GM) must be equal to or greater than the following:


(c) When a heeling arm curve, calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, is plotted against the vessel's righting arm curve—


(1) Equilibrium must be reached before the downflooding angle; and 


(2) The residual righting energy must be at least 2 foot-degrees (.61 meter-degrees) up to the smallest of the following angles:


(i) The angle of maximum righting arm.


(ii) The downflooding angle.


(iii) 40 degrees.


(d) The heeling arm curve specified in paragraph (c) of this section must be calculated by the following equation:


(e) For the purpose of this section, downflooding angle means the static angle from the intersection of the vessel's centerline and waterline in calm water to the first opening that does not close watertight automatically.


(f) For the purpose of this section, at each angle of heel, a vessel's righting arm may be calculated considering either—


(1) The vessel is permitted to trim free until the trimming moment is zero; or


(2) The vessel does not trim as it heels.
