# § 174.015   Intact stability.

(a) Except as provided in § 174.020, in each condition of loading and operation, each barge must be shown by design calculations to have an area under the righting arm curve up to the angle of maximum righting arm, the downflooding angle, or 40 degrees, whichever angle is smallest, equal to or greater than—


(1) 15 foot-degrees (4.57 meter-degrees) for ocean and Great Lakes winter service; and 


(2) 10 foot-degrees (3.05 meter-degrees) for lakes, bays, sounds, and Great Lakes summer service.


(b) For the purpose of this section, downflooding angle means the static angle from the intersection of the vessel's centerline and waterline in calm water to the first opening that does not close watertight automatically.
