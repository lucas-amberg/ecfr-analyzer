# § 174.055   Calculation of wind heeling moment (Hm).

(a) The wind heeling moment (Hm) of a unit in a given normal operating condition or severe storm condition is the sum of the individual wind heeling moments (H) calculated for each of the exposed surfaces on the unit; *i.e.*, Hm=Σ H.


(b) Each wind heeling moment (H) must be calculated using the equation:


(c) When calculating “A” in the equation described in paragraph (b) of this section—


(1) The projected area of each column or leg; if the unit has columns or legs, must not include shielding allowances;


(2) Each area exposed as a result of heel must be included;


(3) The projected area of a cluster of deck houses may be used instead of the projected area of each individual deck house in the cluster; and


(4) The projected area of open truss work may be calculated by taking 30% of the projected areas of both the front and back sides of the open truss work rather than by determining the projected area of each structural member of the truss work.
