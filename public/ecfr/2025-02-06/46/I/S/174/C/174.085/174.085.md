# ยง 174.085   Flooding on column stabilized units.

(a) Watertight compartments that are outboard of, or traversed by, a plane which connects the vertical centerlines of the columns on the periphery of the unit, and within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of an outer surface of a column or footing on the periphery of the unit, must be assumed to be subject to flooding as follows:


(1) When a column is subdivided into watertight compartments by horizontal watertight flats, all compartments in the column within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the unit's waterline before damage causing flooding must be assumed to be subject to simultaneous flooding.


(2) When a column is subdivided into watertight compartments by vertical watertight bulkheads, each two adjacent compartments must be assumed subject to simultaneous flooding if the distance between the vertical watertight bulkheads, measured at the column periphery, is equal to or less than one-eighth of the column perimeter at the draft under consideration.


(3) When a column is subdivided into watertight compartments by horizontal watertight flats and vertical watertight bulkheads, those compartments that are within the bounds described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the unit's waterline before damage causing flooding must be assumed to be subject to simultaneous flooding.


(b) Each compartment in a footing must be assumed to be subject to individual flooding when any part of the compartment is within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the unit's waterline before damage causing flooding.
