# § 174.090   Permeability of spaces.

When doing the calculations required in § 174.065—


(a) The permeability of a floodable space, other than a machinery space, must be as listed in Table 174.090; and


(b) Calculations in which a machinery space is treated as a floodable space must be based on an assumed machinery space permeability of 85%, unless the use of an assumed permeability of less than 85% is justified in detail.
