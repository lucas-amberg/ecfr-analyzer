# § 174.145   Intact stability requirements.

(a) In each condition of loading and operation, each vessel must be shown by design calculations to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.


(b) The area under each righting arm curve must be at least 16.9 foot-degrees (5.15 meter-degrees) up to the smallest of the following angles:


(1) The angle of maximum righting arm.


(2) The downflooding angle.


(3) 40 degrees.


(c) The area under each righting arm curve must be at least 5.6 foot-degrees (1.72 meter-degrees) between the angles of 30 degrees and 40 degrees, or between 30 degrees and the downflooding angle if this angle is less than 40 degrees.


(d) The maximum righting arm shall occur at a heel of at least 25 degrees.


(e) The righting arm curve must be positive to at least 60 degrees.


(f) For the purpose of this section, at each angle of heel, a vessel's righting arm may be calculated considering either—


(1) The vessel is permitted to trim free until the trimming moment is zero; or


(2) The vessel does not trim as it heels.
