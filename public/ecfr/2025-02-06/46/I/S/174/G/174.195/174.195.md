# § 174.195   Bulkheads in machinery spaces.

(a) The bulkhead in each machinery space of each OSV must be watertight to the bulkhead deck.


(b) Each penetration of, and each opening in, a bulkhead in a machinery space must—


(1) Be kept as high and as far inboard as practicable; and


(2) Except as provided by § 174.210 of this subpart and by paragraph (c) of this section, have means to make it watertight.


(c) No penetration of a bulkhead in a machinery space by a ventilation duct need have means to make the bulkhead watertight if—


(1) Every part of the duct is at least 760 millimeter (30 inches) from the side of the OSV; and


(2) The duct is continuously watertight from the penetration to the main deck.
