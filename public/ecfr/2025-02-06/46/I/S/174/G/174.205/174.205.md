# § 174.205   Additional damaged stability for OSVs carrying more than 16 offshore workers.

(a) *Calculations.* Each OSV carrying more than 16 offshore workers must be shown by design calculations to comply, under each afloat condition of loading and operation, with § 174.207 of this subpart in case of the damage specified by paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Character of damage.* For paragraph (a) of this section, design calculations must show that the OSV can survive damage at any place other than either the collision bulkhead or a transverse watertight bulkhead unless—


(1) The transverse watertight bulkhead is closer than the longitudinal extent of damage, specified by Table 174.207(a), to the adjacent transverse watertight bulkhead; or


(2) The transverse watertight bulkhead has a step or a recess, which must be assumed damaged, if it is both more than 3 meters (10 feet) in length and located within the transverse extent of damage specified by Table 174.207(a) of this section.
