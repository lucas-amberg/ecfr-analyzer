# ยง 174.320   Damage survival.

A hopper dredge survives assumed damage if it meets the following conditions: 


(a) The maximum angle of heel in each stage of flooding must not exceed 30 degrees or the angle of downflooding whichever is less. 


(b) The final waterline, taking into account sinkage, heel, and trim, must be below the lowest edge of each opening through which progressive flooding may take place. 


(c) The righting arm curve calculated after damage must: 


(1) Have a minimum positive range of 20 degrees beyond the angle of equilibrium; and 


(2) Reach a height of at least 4 inches (l00mm) within the 20 degree positive range. 


(d) Each opening within, or partially within, the 20 degree range beyond the angle of equilibrium must be weathertight. 


(e) After flooding or equalization as allowed by ยง 174.325, the hopper dredge's metacentric height must be at least 2 inches (50mm) when the dredge is in an upright position.
