(a) When a vessel is not in compliance with its Certificate of Inspection or fails to comply with a regulation of this subchapter, the cognizant OCMI may permit the vessel to proceed to another port for repair, if in the judgment of the OCMI, the trip can be completed safely, even if the Certificate of Inspection of the vessel has expired or is about to expire.


(b) Form CG-948, “Permit to Proceed to another Port for Repairs,” may be issued by the cognizant OCMI to the owner, managing operator, or the master of the vessel stating the conditions under which the vessel may proceed to another port. The permit may be issued only upon the written application of the owner, managing operator, or master, and after the vessel's Certificate of Inspection is turned over to the OCMI.


(c) A vessel may not carry passengers when operating in accordance with a permit to proceed, unless the cognizant OCMI determines that it is safe to do so.
