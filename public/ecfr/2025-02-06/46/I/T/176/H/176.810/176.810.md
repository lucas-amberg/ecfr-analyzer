(2) Inspection of piping, controls, and valves, and the inspection and testing of alarms and ventilation shutdowns, for each fixed gas fire extinguishing system and detection system to determine that the system is in operating condition;


(3) Operation of the fire main system and checking of the pressure at the most remote and highest outlets;


(4) Testing of each firehose to a test pressure equivalent to its maximum service pressure;


(5) Checking of each cylinder containing compressed gas to ensure it has been tested and marked in accordance with 46 CFR 147.60;


(6) Testing or renewal of flexible connections and discharge hoses on semi-portable extinguishers and fixed gas extinguishing systems in accordance with 46 CFR 147.65; and

(iv) The owner or managing operator must provide satisfactory evidence of the required servicing to the marine inspector. If any of the equipment or records have not been properly maintained, a qualified servicing facility must perform the required inspections, maintenance procedures, and hydrostatic pressure tests. A tag issued by a qualified servicing organization, and attached to each extinguisher, may be accepted as evidence that the necessary maintenance procedures have been conducted.
