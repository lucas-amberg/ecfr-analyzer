# § 180.207   Survival craft—vessels operating on lakes, bays, and sounds routes.

(a) Except as allowed by paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, each vessel constructed of wood certificated to operate on a lakes, bays, and sounds route in cold water must either:


(1) Be provided with life floats of an aggregate capacity that will accommodate at least 100% of the total number of persons permitted on board; or


(2) Meet either the standards for collision bulkheads in § 179.310 of this chapter or § 171.085 in subchapter S of this chapter, and the standards for subdivision in §§ 179.220 and 179.320 of this chapter, or the standards for subdivision and damaged stability in §§ 171.070 through 171.073 and 171.080 in subchapter S of this chapter, as appropriate, and be provided with life floats of an aggregate capacity that will accommodate at least 50% of the total number of persons permitted on board.


(b) Except as allowed by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, each vessel constructed of a material other than wood certificated to operate on a lakes, bays, and sounds route in cold water must be provided with life floats of an aggregate capacity that will accommodate at least 50% of the total number of persons permitted on board.


(c) A vessel certificated to operate on a lakes, bays, and sounds route in warm water is not required to carry survival craft.


(d) A vessel certificated to operate on lakes, bays, and sounds route within one mile of land is not required to carry survival craft.


(e) For a vessel certificated to operate on a lakes, bays, and sounds route in shallow water where the vessel cannot sink deep enough to submerge the topmost passenger deck or where survivors can wade ashore, the cognizant OCMI may waive a requirement for life floats, if the OCMI determines that it is safe to do so, taking into consideration the vessel's scope of operation, hazards of the route, and availability of assistance.


(f) Each vessel operating with a set schedule on a specific route that does not take it more than 20 nautical miles from a harbor of safe refuge, and that maintains a 15 minute radio communications schedule with an operations base, or participates in a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS), may be granted a reduction in the survival craft requirements of this section if the cognizant OCMI is satisfied that a sufficient level of safety exists.
