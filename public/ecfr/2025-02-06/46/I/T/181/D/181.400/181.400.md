# § 181.400   Spaces required to have fixed fire extinguishing systems.

(a) The following spaces must be equipped with a fixed gas fire extinguishing system, in compliance with § 181.410, or other fixed fire extinguishing system specifically approved by the Commandant, except as otherwise allowed by paragraph (b) of this section:


(1) A space containing propulsion machinery;


(2) A space containing an internal combustion engine of more than 37.3 kW (50 hp);


(3) A space containing an oil fired boiler;


(4) A space containing machinery powered by gasoline or other fuels having a flash point of 43.3 °C (110 °F) or lower;


(5) A space containing a fuel tank for gasoline or any other fuel having a flash point of 43.3 °C (110 °F) or lower;


(6) A space containing combustible cargo or ship's stores inaccessible during the voyage (in these types of spaces only carbon dioxide, and not Halon, systems will be allowed);


(7) A paint locker; and


(8) A storeroom containing flammable liquids (including liquors of 80 proof or higher where liquor is packaged in individual containers of 9.5 liters (2.5 gallons) capacity or greater).


(b) Alternative system types and exceptions to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are:


(1) A fixed gas fire extinguishing system, which is capable of automatic discharge upon heat detection, may only be installed in a normally unoccupied space with a gross volume of not more than 170 cubic meters (6,000 cubic feet);


(2) A pre-engineered fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be in compliance with § 181.420 of this part and may only be installed in a normally unoccupied machinery space, a paint locker, or a storeroom containing flammable liquids (including liquors of 80 proof or higher where liquor is packaged in individual containers of 9.5 liters (2.5 gallons) capacity or greater), with a gross volume of not more than 57 cubic meters (2,000 cubic feet);


(3) A 40-B portable fire extinguisher installed outside the space may be substituted for a fixed gas fire extinguishing system in a storeroom containing flammable liquids (including liquors of 80 proof or higher where liquor is packaged in individual containers of 9.5 liters (2.5 gallons) capacity or greater) or a paint locker, with a volume of not more that 5.7 cubic meters (200 cubic feet);


(4) A space which is so open to the atmosphere that a fixed gas fire extinguishing system would be ineffective, as determined by the cognizant OCMI, is not required to have a fixed gas fire extinguishing system; and


(5) Where the amount of carbon dioxide gas required in a fixed fire extinguishing system can be supplied by one portable extinguisher or a semi-portable extinguisher, such an extinguisher may be used subject to the following:


(i) The cylinder must be installed in a fixed position outside the space protected;


(ii) The applicator must be installed in a fixed position so as to discharge into the space protected; and


(iii) Controls must be installed in an accessible location outside the space protected.
