(a) The frame or support of each semi-portable fire extinguisher required by Table 193.50-10(a) of this subpart must be welded or otherwise permanently attached to a bulkhead or deck. 


(b) If an approved semi-portable fire extinguisher has wheels and is not required by Table 193.50-10(a) of this subpart, it must be securely stowed when not in use to prevent it from rolling out of control under heavy sea conditions. 


(c) Semi-portable extinguishers must be fitted with suitable hose and nozzle, or other practicable means, so that all areas of the space can be protected.
