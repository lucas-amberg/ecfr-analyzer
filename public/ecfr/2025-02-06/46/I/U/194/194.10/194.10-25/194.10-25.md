(a) *Integral magazines.* (1) All integral magazines shall be provided with natural or mechanical ventilation. Design calculations shall be submitted demonstrating that the system has sufficient capacity to maintain the magazine temperature below 100 °F. with 88 °F. weather air. Mechanical cooling may be used where ventilation requirements exceed 1,500 cubic feet per minute. 


(2) Ventilation systems shall be of watertight construction and shall serve no other space. Weather cowls shall be provided with a double layer of wire screen of not less than 
1/8-inch mesh. Metal watertight closures shall be provided for use when the ventilation system is not in operation. A 2-inch IPS bypass with check valve shall be provided in parallel with at least one of the ventilation closures to prevent pressure buildup. 


(b) *Magazine vans.* (1) All magazine vans shall be provided with natural ventilation sufficient to maintain the inside air temperature below 130 °F. with an assumed outside temperature of 115 °F. 


(2) Ventilation supply weather openings shall be located at least 6 feet above the deck. Exhaust terminals shall be located in the van overhead. Louvers or weather cowls with a double layer of wire screen of not less than
