(2) This ventilation system shall be independent of any other ventilation system. It shall serve no other space in the vessel. It shall be of watertight construction. 


(3) Inlets to exhaust ducts shall be provided and located at points where concentration of vapors may be expected. Ventilation exhaust outlets shall terminate more than 6 feet from any opening to the interior part of the vessel and from any possible source of vapor ignition. Terminals shall be fitted with acceptable flame screens. 


(4) The control for the power ventilation system shall be conveniently located and marked in a manner to clearly identify the purpose of the control.
