# § 197.346   Diver's equipment.

(a) Each diver using SCUBA must have—


(1) Self-contained underwater breathing equipment including—


(i) A primary breathing gas supply with a cylinder pressure gage readable by the diver during the dive; and 


(ii) A diver-carried reserve breathing gas supply provided by—


(A) A manual reserve (J valve); or


(B) An independent reserve cylinder connected and ready for use;


(2) A face mask;


(3) An inflatable floatation device;


(4) A weight belt capable of quick release;


(5) A knife;


(6) Swim fins or shoes;


(7) A diving wristwatch; and


(8) A depth gage.


(b) Each diver using a heavyweight diving outfit must—


(1) Have a helmet group consisting of helmet, breastplate, and associated valves and connections;


(2) Have a diving dress group consisting of a basic dress that encloses the body (except for head and hands) in a tough, waterproof cover, gloves, shoes, weight assembly, and knife;


(3) Have a hose group consisting of the breathing gas hose and fittings, the control valve, the lifeline, communications cable, and a pneumofathometer; and


(4) Be provided with a helmet cushion and weighted shoes.


(c) Each surface-supplied dive operation using a heavyweight diving outfit must have an extra breathing gas hose with attaching tools available to the standby diver.


(d) Each diver using a lightweight diving outfit must have—

(e) Each surface-supplied air dive operation within the no-decompression limits and to depths of 130 fsw or less must have a primary breathing gas supply at the dive location.


(f) Each surface-supplied dive operation outside the no-compression limits, deeper than 130 fsw, or using mixed-gas as a breathing mixture must have at the dive location—


(1) A primary breathing gas supply; and


(2) A secondary breathing gas supply.


(g) Each diver diving outside the no-decompression limits, deeper than 130 fsw, or using mixed-gas must have a diver-carried reserve breathing gas supply except when using a heavy-weight diving outfit or when diving in a physically confining area.
