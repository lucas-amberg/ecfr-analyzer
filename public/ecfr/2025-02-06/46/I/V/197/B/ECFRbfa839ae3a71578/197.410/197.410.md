(ii) Any unusual hazards or environmental conditions likely to affect the safety of the diving operation; and 


(iii) Any modifications to the operations manual or procedures including safety procedures necessitated by the specific diving operation;


(2) The breathing gas supply systems, masks, helmets, thermal protection, when provided, and bell lifting equipment, when a bell is provided or required, are inspected prior to each diving operation;


(3) Each diver is instructed to report any physical problems or physiological effects including aches, pains, current illnesses, or symptoms of decompression sickness prior to each dive;


(4) A depth, bottom time profile, including any breathing mixture changes, is maintained at the dive location for each diver during the dive, except that SCUBA divers shall maintain their own profiles;


(5) A two-way voice communication system is used between— 


(i) Each surface-supplied diver and a dive team member at the dive location or bell (when provided); and


(ii) The bell (when provided) and the dive location;


(6) A two-way communication system is available at the dive location to obtain emergency assistance;


(7) After the completion of each dive—


(i) The physical condition of the diver is checked by—


(A) Visual observation; and


(B) Questioning the diver about his physical well-being; 


(ii) The diver is instructed to report any physical problems or adverse physiological effects including aches, pains, current illnesses, or symptoms of decompression sickness or gas embolism;


(iii) The diver is advised of the location of an operational decompression chamber; and


(iv) The diver is alerted to the potential hazards of flying after diving;


(8) For any dive outside the no-decompression limits, deeper than 130 fsw, or using mixed-gas as a breathing mixture—


(i) A depth, time, decompression profile including breathing mixture changes is maintained for each diver at the dive location;


(ii) The diver is instructed to remain awake and in the vicinity of the dive location decompression chamber for at least one hour after the completion of a dive, decompression, or treatment; and


(iii) A dive team member, other than the diver, is trained and available to operate the decompression chamber; and


(9) When decompression sickness or gas embolism is suspected or symptoms are evident, a report is completed containing—


(i) The investigation for each incident including—


(A) The dive and decompression profiles;


(B) The composition, depth, and time of breathing mixture changes;


(C) A description of the symptoms including depth and time of onset; and


(D) A description and results of the treatment;


(ii) The evaluation for each incident based on—


(A) The investigation;


(B) Consideration of the past performance of the decompression table used; and


(C) Individual susceptibility; and


(iii) The corrective action taken, if necessary, to reduce the probability of recurrence.


(b) The diving supervisor shall ensure that the working interval of a dive is terminated when he so directs or when—

(2) A diver fails to respond correctly to communications or signals from a dive team member;


(3) Communications are lost and cannot be quickly reestablished between—
