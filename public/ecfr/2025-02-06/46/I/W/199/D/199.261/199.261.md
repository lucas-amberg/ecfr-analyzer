(2) Each inflatable liferaft must be approved under approval series 160.151 and be equipped with a SOLAS A pack.

(4) Each liferaft must have a capacity of six persons or more.


(5) Each marine evacuation system must be approved under approval series 160.175.


(b) Each cargo vessel must carry—


(1) On each side of the vessel, lifeboats with an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board; and


(2) Liferafts—


(i) With an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board and that are stowed in a position providing for easy side-to-side transfer at a single open deck level; or


(ii) With an aggregate capacity on each side sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board.


(c) A cargo vessel is not required to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section if it carries—


(1) Lifeboats capable of being free-fall launched over the stern of the vessel that have an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board; and


(2) On each side of the vessel, liferafts with an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board with the liferafts on at least one side of the vessel being served by launching appliances or marine evacuation systems.


(d) Cargo vessels less than 85 meters (278 feet) in length, with the exception of tank vessels, are not required to meet paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section if they meet the following:


(1) On each side of the vessel—


(i) Liferafts are carried with an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board and are stowed in a position providing for easy side-to-side transfer at a single open deck level; or 


(ii) Liferafts are carried with an aggregate capacity sufficient to accommodate 150 percent of the total number of persons on board. If the rescue boat required under § 199.262 is also a lifeboat, its capacity may be included to meet the aggregate capacity requirement.


(2) In the event the largest survival craft on either side of the vessel is lost or rendered unserviceable, there must be survival craft available for use on each side of the vessel, including those which are stowed in a position providing for side-to-side transfer at a single open deck level, with a capacity sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board.

The requirement for the liferaft to float free under § 199.130(c)(7) does not apply to a liferaft under this paragraph, provided it is arranged for quick manual release.
