# ยง 201.62   Notice of proposed rule making.

After receipt of petitions and any answers thereto described in ยง 201.61, or upon its own initiative, the Administration may, in its discretion, direct that notice thereof be published in the _Federal Register_ unless all persons subject thereto are named and either are personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law. Except where publication of notice of proposed rule making and public hearing is required by statute, this section shall not apply to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, organization rules, rules of procedure, or practice of the Administration, or amendments thereto, or any situation in which the Administration for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.
