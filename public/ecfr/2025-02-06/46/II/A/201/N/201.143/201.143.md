# ยง 201.143   Exceptions to rulings of presiding officer unnecessary.

Formal exceptions to rulings of the presiding officer are unnecessary. It is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the presiding officer is made or sought, makes known the action which he desires the presiding officer to take or his objection to an action taken, and his grounds therefor.
