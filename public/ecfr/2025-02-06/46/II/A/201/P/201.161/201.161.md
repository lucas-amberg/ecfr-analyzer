# ยง 201.161   Exceptions to, and review by the Administration of initial or recommended decisions.

Within twenty (20) days after the service date of the initial or recommended decision, whether oral or in writing, unless a shorter period is fixed under ยง 201.54, any party may file exceptions to any conclusions, findings, or statements contained in such decision, and a brief in support of such exceptions. Such exceptions and brief shall constitute one document, shall indicate with particularity alleged errors, shall indicate pages of transcript and exhibit numbers when referring to the record, and shall be served on all parties pursuant to subpart D of this part. Whenever the presiding officer renders an initial decision, in the absence of the filing of exceptions thereto, or notice of review thereof by the Administration, such decision, shall upon the issuance of an appropriate order by the Administration, become the decision of the Administration. Upon the filing of exceptions to, or notice of review of, an initial or recommended decision, such decision shall become inoperative until the Administration determines the matter. Where exceptions are filed to, or the Administration reviews, an initial or recommended decision, the Administration, except as it may limit the issues upon notice or by rule, will have all the powers which it would have in making the initial decision. Whenever the Administration shall determine to review an initial or recommended decision on its own initiative, notice of such intention shall be served upon the parties within thirty (30) days after the date when the initial or recommended decision is orally rendered and, if in writing, served.
