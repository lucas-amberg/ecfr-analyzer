(b) *Foreign Underwriters.* (1) Underwriters at Lloyds are eligible to participate without further consideration.


(2) Underwriters which are members of the Institute of London Underwriters (ILU) (i.e., *member* companies, not parents or affiliates of the member companies) are eligible to participate without further consideration, provided that the ILU member company actually underwriting the risk maintains a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of its U.S. policyholders in an amount at least equal to the minimum provided in § 249.7(d), and the amount insured does not exceed the limitation on risk prescribed in § 249.8.
