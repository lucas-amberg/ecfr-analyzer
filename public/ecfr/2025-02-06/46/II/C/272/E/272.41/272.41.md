# § 272.41   Requirements for examination and allocation of M&R expenses.

(a) *Examination requirement.* Pursuant to the specific limitations on M&R subsidy in section 603 of the Act, the Region Office shall examine the expenses submitted by an operator on Form MA-140 in order to determine eligibility to receive M&R subsidy and the reasonableness of such expenses.


(b) *Operator's responsibility.* During the examination, the operator shall provide, at the request of the Director or other official of the Region Office, any further documentation or information necessary to support an M&R expense. If such documentation or information, including information required under paragraph (e) of this section, is not received at the Region Office on a timely basis, the Director or other official of the Region Office may disallow the M&R expense.


(c) *Notification of examination results.* At the completion of the examination the Director or other appropriate official of the applicable Region Office shall notify the Operator by letter of the results of the examination, and shall state the reason for each disallowance of an item claimed for subsidy and/or each nonapproval of a marine loss item.


(d) *Record retention requirements.* To facilitate an audit examination of M&R made pursuant to § 272.42 of this part, the Operator shall maintain files arranged by vessel and voyage, which shall include, at a minimum, a copy of the Region Office notice letter, a copy of the Form MA-140 with all supporting documents submitted therewith, and the condition survey report. The Operator shall retain all the required materials in files for not less than 3 years after completion of the audit.


(1) *Limitation on approval.* Any approval for payment of M&R subsidy for a marine loss item shall be subject to rescission or modification if the Operator subsequently receives insurance or other compensation for the item. The Region Finance Officer may at any time request verification that the Operator has not received such compensation.


(2) *Status report on approved marine loss items.* The Operator shall advise the Region Finance Office by letter as to whether insurance or other compensation will be recovered for the marine loss item. The Operator is responsible for ensuring that the letter reaches the applicable Region Office within 120 days after:


(i) The date on which all repairs for damage attributed to the “Policy Voyage” (as defined in the Operator's insurance policy) are completed, when the amount for such repairs does not exceed the franchise or deductible of the policy, or


(ii) The date of the underwriter's rejection of the Operator's marine loss insurance claim or claims.
