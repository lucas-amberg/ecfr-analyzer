L. 104-239, MARAD shall accept applications for Enrollment of vessels in the MSP Fleet. Within 90 days after receipt of a completed application, MARAD shall enter into a MSP Operating Agreement with the applicant or provide in writing the reason for denial of that application.

(3) *Reflagging for Eligible vessels.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, an applicant may remove a vessel from U.S. registry without MARAD approval if an application for a MSP Operating Agreement has been filed for that vessel, the applicant is qualified, and it has been determined by MARAD to be eligible under MSA section 651(b)(1) under a priority for which sufficient funds are available and the Administrator has not awarded an Operating Agreement for the vessel within 90 days of that application.
