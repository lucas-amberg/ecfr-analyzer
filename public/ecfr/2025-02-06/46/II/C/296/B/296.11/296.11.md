(1) The vessel is:


(i) Determined by the SecDef to be suitable for use by the United States for national defense or military purposes in time of war or national emergency; and


(ii) Determined by the Secretary to be commercially viable;


(2) The vessel is operated or, in the case of a vessel to be purchased or constructed, will be operated to provide transportation in the foreign commerce;

(4) The vessel is:


(i) A United States documented vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121; or


(ii) Not a United States-documented vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121, but the owner of the vessel has demonstrated an intent to have the vessel documented under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121 at the time the vessel is to be included in the MSP fleet; and


(A) The vessel is eligible for a certificate of inspection if the Secretary of the Department in which the United States Coast Guard is operating determines that:


(*1*) The vessel is classed and designed in accordance with the rules of the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) or another classification society accepted by such Secretary;

(B) [Reserved]


(b) *Waiver of age restriction of vessels.* The SecDef, in conjunction with the Secretary, may waive the age restriction in paragraph (a) of this section if the Secretaries jointly determine that the waiver:
