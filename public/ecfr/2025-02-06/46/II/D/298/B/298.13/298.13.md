(e) *Applicability.* The financial resources must be adequate to meet the financial terms MARAD requires pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.


(1) The various financial requirements shall be met by the owner of the Vessel or Vessels or Shipyard Project to be security to us for the Guarantees, except that if the owner is not the operator, the overall financial requirements will be allocated among the owner, the operator and other parties as determined by us. 


(2) The Company must satisfy the applicable financial requirements, in addition to any other financial requirements already imposed or which may be imposed upon it in connection with other Vessels financed under the Title XI program or in connection with other Shipyard Project financed under the Title XI program.

Repayment of subordinated debt may be made only from funds available for payment of dividends or for other distributions, in accordance with requirements of the Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement (described in section 298.35). Such subordinated debt must not be secured by any interest in property that is security for Guarantees under Title XI, unless the obligor and the lender enter into a written agreement approved by MARAD. The written agreement must provide, among other things, that if any Title XI financing or advance by us to the obligor occurs in the future, such security interest of the lender must become subordinated to any indebtedness to MARAD incurred by the obligor and to any security interest obtained by MARAD in that property or other property, with respect to the subsequent indebtedness.


(i) *Modified requirements.* MARAD may waive or modify the financial terms or requirements otherwise applicable under sections 298.35 and 298.42, upon determining that there is adequate security for the guarantees or that such waiver or modification is in the best interests of the United States. MARAD may impose similar financial requirements on any person providing other security for the guarantees.
