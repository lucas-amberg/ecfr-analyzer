# ยง 298.18   Financing Shipyard Projects.

(a) *Initial criteria.* We may issue Guarantees to finance a Shipyard Project at a General Shipyard Facility. We may approve such Guarantees after we consider whether the Guarantees will result in shipyard modernization and support increased productivity. 


(b) *Detailed statement.* You must provide a detailed statement, with the Guarantee application, which will provide the basis for our consideration.

(3) Your application will not prevent us from guaranteeing debt for a Shipyard Project that, in our sole opinion, will serve a more desirable use of appropriated funds. In making this determination, we will consider: 


(i) The types of vessels which will be built by the shipyard,


(ii) The productivity increases which will be achieved,


(iii) The geographic location of the shipyard,


(iv) The long-term viability of the shipyard,
