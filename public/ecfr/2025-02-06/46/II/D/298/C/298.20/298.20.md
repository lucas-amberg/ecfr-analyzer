(a) *In general.* The maturity date of the Obligations must be satisfactory to us and must not exceed the anticipated physical and economic life of the Vessel or Vessels or Shipyard Project, and may be less than but no more than: 


(1) Twenty-five years from the date of delivery from the shipbuilder of a single new Vessel which is to be security for Guarantees; 


(2) Twenty-five years from the date of delivery from the shipyard of the last of multiple Vessels which are to be security for the Guarantees but that the amount of the Guarantees will relate to the amount of the depreciated actual cost of the multiple Vessels as of the Closing; 


(3) The later of twenty-five years from the date of original delivery of a reconstructed, or reconditioned Vessel which is to be security for the Guarantees, or at the expiration of the remaining useful life of the Vessel, as we determine; or


(4) The technological life of the Shipyard Project. 


(b) *Required redemptions.* Where multiple Vessels or multiple Shipyard Project assets are to be used as security for the Guarantees, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, we may require payments of principal prior to maturity (redemptions) regarding all related Obligations, as we may deem necessary to maintain adequate security for the Guarantees. 


(c) *Interest rate.* We will make a determination as to the reasonableness of the interest rate of each Obligation, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks that we assume.
