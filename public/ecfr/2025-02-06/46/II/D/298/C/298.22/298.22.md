# ยง 298.22   Amortization of Obligations.

(a) Generally, after delivery or completion of Shipyard Project, and until maturity of the Obligations, provisions of the Trust Indenture or other part of the Documentation require you to make periodic payment of principal and interest on the Obligations. 




(b) Usually, the payment of principal (amortization) must be made semi-annually, but in no event less frequently than on an annual basis, and in either case the amortization must be in equal payments of principal (level principal), unless MARAD approves the periodic payment of a constant aggregate amount, comprised of both interest and principal components that are variable in amount (level payment). No other method of amortization will be allowed that would reduce the amount of periodic amortization below that determined under the level principal or level payment basis at any time prior to maturity of the obligations, except where a third-party expert approved or engaged by MARAD conducts an independent analysis and review of a project and structure of an obligation and demonstrates that such other method is in the best interests of the United States.
