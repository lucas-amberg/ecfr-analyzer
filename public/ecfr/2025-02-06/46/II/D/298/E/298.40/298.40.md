(a) *In General.* Provisions concerning the existence and declaration of a default and demand for payment of the Obligations (described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) shall be included in the Security Agreement and in other parts of the Documentation. 


(b) *Principal and interest Payment Default.* Unless we have assumed the Obligor's rights and duties under the Obligation and agreements and have made any payments in default under terms in the Obligation or related agreements, the following procedures regarding principal and interest payment default shall apply: 


(1) No demand shall be made for payment under the Guarantees unless the default shall have continued for 30 days (Payment Default). 


(2) After the expiration of said 30-day period, demand for payment of all amounts due under the Guarantees must be made no later than 60 days afterward.


(3) After demand for payment is made by or on behalf of the Obligees, we shall make payment under the Guarantees, except if we determine that a Payment Default has not occurred or that such Payment Default has been remedied prior to demand being made. 


(c) *Security Default.* If a default occurs under the Security Agreement which is other than a Payment Default (Security Default), section 1105(b) of the Act allows us, in our sole discretion, to declare such default a Security Default, and we may notify the Obligee or agent of the Obligee of such Security Default, stating that demand for payment under the Guarantees must be made no later than 60 days after the date of such notification. 


(d) *Payment of Guarantees.* If we receive notice of demand for payment of the Guarantees, we shall, no later than 30 days after the date of such demand (provided that we shall not have, upon such terms as may be provided in the Obligations or related agreements, prior to that demand, assumed the Obligor's rights and duties under the Obligation and agreements and shall have made any payments in default), make payment to the Obligees, Indenture Trustee or any other agent of the unpaid principal amount of Obligations and unpaid interest accrued and accruing thereon up to, but not including, the date of payment.
