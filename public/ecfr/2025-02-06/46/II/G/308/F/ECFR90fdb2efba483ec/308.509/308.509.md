# § 308.509   Collateral deposit fund.

(a) *Requirements.* An assured electing to use a cash collateral deposit fund pursuant to § 308.507 shall comply with the provisions of this section and Clause 21 of the Open Cargo Policy, Form MA-300, prescribed in § 308.517.


(b) *Cash or Government bonds.* To establish a collateral deposit fund the applicant shall deposit with the underwriting agent a check payable to the order of the “Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation” for the amount of the fund, or United States Government bonds having a par value at the time of deposit of the amount of the fund, which shall be a multiple of $500 but not less than $1,000, together with a letter of transmittal executed by the applicant on Form MA-302, prescribed in § 308.522. Upon receipt of the deposit, the underwriting agent shall assign it a serial number and transmit it to “Maritime Administration, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, Maritime Administration”. It is the responsibility of the assured to make sure that this deposit fund is sufficient at all times to cover the premiums payable on all risks which have attached under the policy, so as to prevent the termination of the insurance under the provisions of Clause 21.


(c) *Overdue premiums.* Pursuant to Clause 20, if the assured fails to pay any premium when it becomes due and payable, he thereby breaches the policy and it automatically ceases to insure any shipments which would otherwise have attached after the expiration of fifteen (15) days following the due date of the premium, unless within the fifteen (15) day period the premium has been paid and the assured has otherwise complied with the requirements of the policy, including the filing of the closing report required by Clause 19 and the payment of the reinstatement fee of $25 required by Clause 20. If the assured fails to pay the premium within the fifteen (15) day period, the Maritime Administrator may deduct from the assured's collateral deposit fund all amounts due.


(d) *Increase in amount of collateral as required by Clause 21.* If the assured fails to deposit additional collateral in the fund within seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured that the amount of collateral is insufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, the policy shall be void except as to risks which have attached prior to the expiration of the seven (7) day period.


(e) *Changes in amount of collateral.* The assured may increase or decrease the amount of the collateral deposit fund by amounts of not less than $500 or multiples thereof, provided that the amount of the fund shall not be less than the amount required by Clause 21, or the required minimum of $1,000, whichever is greater. The effect of any change in the amount of the collateral deposit shall be the sole responsibility of the assured, and the permission granted by this paragraph to change the amount of collateral in the fund shall in no manner relieve the assured of the responsibility imposed by Clause 21.


(f) *Increase of collateral.* To increase the amount of the collateral on deposit in the fund, the assured shall transmit to the underwriting agent on Form MA-302, prescribed in § 308.522, a check payable to the order of “Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation” or United States Government bonds having a par value at the time of deposit of not less than the amount of the requested increase. The increase shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the application and check or bonds by the underwriting agent, as shown on Form MA-302.


(g) *Decrease of collateral.* To decrease the collateral deposit fund, the assured shall file with the underwriting agent an application on Form MA-305, prescribed in § 308.525. The decrease shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the application by the underwriting agent as shown on Form MA-305.


(h) *Refund of collateral.* Whenever the assured becomes entitled to a refund of the collateral deposit, in whole or in part, by reason of a request for a partial return of such collateral, or the cancellation of the policy and the payment in full of all premiums then or thereafter due, or the waiver by the Maritime Administrator of the requirements of maintaining the collateral deposit fund because the assured is a department or agency of the United States or is acting on behalf of such a department or agency, or the substitution of a surety bond in the place and stead of the collateral deposit fund, as provided in § 308.510(j), the Maritime Administrator will refund to the assured the amount of the collateral deposit to which the assured is entitled; provided, however, that the repayment of such collateral shall not be made by the Maritime Administrator until the assured has filed a closing report and paid in full all premiums with respect to all shipments which had attached at the time of the receipt by the underwriting agent of the application for the refund, Form MA-305, and a certificate executed in duplicate on Form MA-306, prescribed in § 308.526, and, in the event of the substitution of a surety bond for the collateral deposit fund, the receipt by the underwriting agent of the surety bond properly executed, in accordance with § 308.510.
