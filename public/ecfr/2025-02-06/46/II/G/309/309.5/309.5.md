# ยง 309.5   Condition of vessel.

If the true condition of a vessel is not known, the Ship Valuation Committee, in determining the stated valuation of the vessel, may assume that it is in a condition that would entitle it to the highest classification of the American Bureau of Shipping, or the equivalent if the vessel is a foreign-flag vessel, with all required certificates, including but not limited to, marine inspection certificates of the United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service, and the Federal Communications Commission, with all outstanding requirements and recommendations necessary for retention of class accomplished, without regard to any grace period; and, so far as due diligence can make her so, the vessel is tight, staunch, strong, and well and sufficiently tacked, appareled, furnished, and equipped, and in every respect seaworthy and in good running condition and repair, with clean swept holds and in all respects fit for service. The stated valuation of a vessel in substandard condition is subject to downward adjustment as provided in ยง 309.6(a).
