# ยง 309.204   Proof of loss.

Claims for reimbursement for total loss of stores and supplies may be submitted by the owner to the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590, based on one of two alternative methods of proof, as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Owners may use either method for each category of stores and supplies.


(a) *Formula.* In cases where the owner and the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime Administration, have agreed, in advance of the loss, upon amounts representing, or the method for determining, the average daily consumption costs of stores and supplies for the owner's vessel, claims for total loss of such stores and supplies may be submitted by the owner on Affidavit in Proof of Claim for the loss of stores and supplies, Exhibit A. In such cases, the value of the consumable stores at time of loss is determined as follows:


(1) The value of consumable stores on board at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the number of days for which the vessel is stored by the average daily consumption cost in dollars, plus


(2) The cost of consumable stores, if any, purchased in foreign ports for the homeward voyage, less


(3) The average daily consumption cost times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus the actual amount of consumable stores transferred or sold. The values of slop chest stores, bar stock and fuel, at the time of loss are determined in the same manner by using the applicable daily consumption costs for such stores. The value of subsistence stores at the time of loss is determined as follows:


(i) The value of subsistence stores on board at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the agreed cost for one man per day by the number of crew signed on and the number of passengers, if any, and multiplying that product by the number of days for which the vessel is stored, plus


(ii) The cost of subsistence stores, if any, purchased in foreign ports for the homeward voyage, less


(iii) The number of crew signed on and the average number of passengers, if any, times the agreed cost of one man per day times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus the actual amount of subsistence stores transferred or sold.


(b) *Verified costs.* In cases where the owner and the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime Administration, have not agreed in advance of the loss upon amounts representing, or the method for determining, the average daily consumption costs of Stores and Supplies for the owner's vessel, claims for total loss of such Stores and Supplies must be submitted by the owner on Affidavit in Proof of Claims for the Loss of Stores and Supplies, Exhibit B. In such cases, the value of the consumable stores will be determined as follows:


(1) The value of consumable stores on board the vessel at the time the vessel was ready to sail, determined by certified inventories of the owner of amounts on board the vessel at the termination of the preceding voyage or date of last inventory, less actual consumption to date of sailing, plus a certified statement by the owner of actual additional purchases made from date of termination of the preceding voyage or date or last inventory to date vessel was lost, subject to audit by the Maritime Administration, less


(2) The average daily consumption cost determined by dividing the amount determined as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the number of days for which the vessel was stored, times the number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of loss, plus actual amount of consumable stores transferred or sold.


The values of subsistence stores, slop chest, bar stock, and fuel, at the time of loss are determined in the same manner, supported by certified inventories of the owner and invoices.
