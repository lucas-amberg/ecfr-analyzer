# ยง 356.31   Maintenance of Mortgage Trustee approval.

(a) A Mortgage Trustee that holds a Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel must submit the following information to the Citizenship Approval Officer during each calendar year that it is acting as a Mortgage Trustee: 


(1) The appropriate certification and documentation required under ยง 356.19(b)(1) through (b)(5) to demonstrate that it is qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage on Fishing Industry Vessels; 


(2) A copy of the most recent published report of condition of the Mortgage Trustee; 


(3) A list of the Fishing Industry Vessels for which it is acting as Mortgage Trustee; and 


(4) The identity and address of all beneficiaries for which it is acting as a Mortgage Trustee. 


(b) The Mortgage Trustee must file the documents required in paragraph (a) of this section within 30 calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the original approval from the Citizenship Approval Officer. 


(c) If at any time the Mortgage Trustee fails to meet the statutory requirements set forth in the AFA, the Mortgage Trustee must notify the Citizenship Approval Officer of such failure to qualify as a Mortgage Trustee not later than 20 calendar days after the event causing such failure. Upon learning that a Mortgage Trustee fails to meet the statutory or regulatory requirements to qualify as a Mortgage Trustee, we will publish a disapproval notice in the _Federal Register_ and will notify the U.S. Coast Guard, the Mortgage Trustee, and the beneficiary of each Preferred Mortgage of such disapproval by providing them a copy of the disapproval notice. The notice to beneficiaries will be provided by standard U.S. mail to the address supplied to the Citizenship Approval Officer by the Mortgage Trustee. Within 30 calendar days of publication in the _Federal Register_ of the disapproval notice, the disapproved Mortgage Trustee must either transfer its fiduciary responsibilities to a successor Mortgage Trustee that has been approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer or cure the defect in its approval. The preferred status of the mortgage will be maintained during the 30 day period following publication of the notice in the _Federal Register_ and pending transfer of the Mortgage Trustee's fiduciary responsibilities to a successor Mortgage Trustee or cure of the defect.
