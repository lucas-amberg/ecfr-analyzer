Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification the Records Officer shall grant approval for disposal, or advise the necessity for continued retention of all or any specified portion thereof.

MARAD will accept written or electronic options (such as facsimile and Internet) for transmission of required information to MARAD, if practicable.
