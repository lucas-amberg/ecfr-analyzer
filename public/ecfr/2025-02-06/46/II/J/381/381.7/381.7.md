# § 381.7   Federal Grant, Guaranty, Loan and Advance of Funds Agreements.

In order to insure a fair and reasonable participation by privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels in transporting cargoes which are subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 and which are generated by U.S. Government Grant, Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of Funds Programs, the head of each affected department or agency shall require appropriate clauses to be inserted in those Grant, Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of Funds Agreements and all third party contracts executed between the borrower/grantee and other parties, where the possibility exists for ocean transportation of items procurred, contracted for or otherwise obtained by or on behalf of the grantee, borrower, or any of their contractors or subcontractors. The clauses required by this part shall provide that at least 50 percent of the freight revenue and tonnage of cargo generated by the U.S. Government Grant, Guaranty, Loan or Advance of Funds be transported on privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels. These clauses shall also require that all parties provide to the Maritime Administration the necessary shipment information as set forth in § 381.3. A copy of the appropriate clauses required by this part shall be submitted by each affected agency or department to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, for approval no later than 30 days after the effective date of this part. The following are suggested acceptable clauses with respect to the use of United States-flag vessels to be incorporated in the Grant, Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of Funds Agreements as well as contracts and subcontracts resulting therefrom:
