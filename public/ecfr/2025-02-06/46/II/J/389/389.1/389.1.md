# ยง 389.1   Purpose.

This part prescribes regulations implementing the provisions of section 417 of Public Law 108-293, which grants the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Maritime Administrator, the authority to review and approve applications for determination of availability of coastwise-qualified vessels. Owners or operators of proposed platform jackets may submit information regarding a specific platform jacket transport, placement and/or launch project, following the procedures set forth in this regulation, in order for the Maritime Administration to determine whether a suitable coastwise-qualified vessel is available for the project. If the agency determines that a project owner has registered as required herein and sought in good faith to meet its transportation needs using U.S. flag vessels in compliance with the Jones Act, and that a suitable coastwise qualified vessel is not available, then a foreign launch barge may be used.
