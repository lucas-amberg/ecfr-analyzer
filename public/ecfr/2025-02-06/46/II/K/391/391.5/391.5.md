# § 391.5   Qualified withdrawals.

(a) *In general.* (1) A qualified withdrawal is one made from the fund during the taxable year which is in accordance with section 670(f)(1) of the Act, the agreement, and with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation and which is for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel (as defined in § 391.11(a)(2)) or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel (or shares in such vessels, barges, and containers), or for the payment of the principal of indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition construction, or reconstruction of such qualified vessel (or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified vessel).


(2) For purposes of this section the term *share* is used to reflect an interest in a vessel and means a proprietary interest in a vessel such as, for example, that which results from joint ownership. Accordingly, a share within the meaning of § 391.2(f) (relating to the definition of “agreement vessel” for the purpose of making deposits) will not necessarily be sufficient to be treated as a share within the meaning of this section.


(3) For purposes of this section, the term *acquisition* means any of the following: 


(i) Any acquisition, but only to the extent the basis of the property acquired in the hands of the transferee is its cost. Thus, for example, if a party transfers a vessel and $1 million in an exchange for another vessel which qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031(a) of the Code (relating to like-kind exchange), there is an acquisition to the extent of $1 million.


(ii) With respect to a lessee's interest in a vessel, expenditures which result in increasing the amounts with respect to which a deduction for depreciation (or amortization in lieu thereof) is allowable.


(b) *Payments on indebtedness.* Payments on indebtedness may constitute qualified withdrawals only if the party shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation a direct connection between incurring the indebtedness and the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or its complement of barges and containers whether or not the indebtedness is secured by the vessel or its complement of barges and containers. The fact that an indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified vessel, barge, or container is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the necessary connection.


(c) *Payments to related persons.* Not- withstanding paragraph (a) of this section, payments from a fund to a person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the party within the meaning of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder are not to be treated as qualified withdrawals unless the party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation that no part of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital, or a contribution to capital under the Code.


(d) *Treatment of fund upon failure to fulfill obligations.* Section 607(f)(2) of the Act provides that if the Secretary of Transportation determines that any substantial obligation under the agreement is not being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the party, treat the entire fund, or any portion thereof, as having been withdrawn as a nonqualified withdrawal. In determining whether a party has breached a substantial obligation under the agreement, the Secretary will consider among other things, (1) the effect of the party's action or omission upon his ability to carry out the purposes of the fund and for which qualified withdrawals are permitted under section 607(f)(1) of the Act, and (2) whether the party has made material misrepresentations in connection with the agreement or has failed to disclose material information. For the income tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, see § 391.7.
