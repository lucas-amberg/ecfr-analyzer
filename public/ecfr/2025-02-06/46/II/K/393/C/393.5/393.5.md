# ยง 393.5   DOT Support for Marine Highway-related research.

(a) *How does DOT support research?* (1) The Program Office works in consultation with public and private entities as appropriate, within the limits of available resources, to identify impediments, develop incentives, and conduct innovative research, in support of the America's Marine Highway Program or in direct support of specific designated Marine Highway Routes and Projects. The primary objectives of selected research projects are to:


(i) Identify markets, cargoes, and service parameters that could facilitate the development of new or expanded Marine Highway Services.


(ii) Identify existing or emerging technology, vessel design, infrastructure designs, and other improvements that would reduce emissions, increase fuel economy, and lower costs of Marine Highway transportation and increase the efficiency of intermodal transfers.


(iii) Identify impediments to the establishment of Marine Highway services.


(iv) Identify incentives to increase the use and efficiency of Marine Highway services.


(b) The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, may conduct research on short sea transportation regarding:


(1) The environmental and transportation benefits to be derived from short sea transportation alternatives for other forms of transportation;


(2) Technology, vessel design, and other improvements that would reduce emissions, increase fuel economy, and lower costs of short sea transportation and increase the efficiency of intermodal transfers; and


(3) Solutions to impediments to short sea transportation projects designated.
