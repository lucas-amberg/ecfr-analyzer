# § 401.425   Provision for additional Pilot.

The Director may require the assignment of two Pilots to a ship upon request of the ship or when the Director deems it necessary for the safe navigation of the ship, because of anticipated long transit, uncommon ship size, adverse weather or sea conditions or other abnormal circumstances. The charge to the ship will be twice the appropriate charge provided for in §§ 401.405, 401.407, 401.410, and 401.420. Each situation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. This authorization may occur at the opening and closing of the year, after the locks have opened or closed for a defined time period based upon the availability of the aids to navigation, ice conditions, weather forecasts, and other relevant information.
