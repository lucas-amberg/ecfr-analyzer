(b) Whenever a person acting in a representative capacity appears in person or signs a paper in practice before the Administrative Law Judge, Director, Commandant, the Administrator, or other official of the U.S. Coast Guard, their personal appearance or signature constitutes a representation that under the provisions of this subpart and applicable law they are authorized and qualified to represent the particular person in whose behalf they act.
