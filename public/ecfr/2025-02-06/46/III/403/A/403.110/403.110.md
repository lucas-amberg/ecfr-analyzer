# § 403.110   Accounting entities.

(a) Each Association shall be a separate accounting entity. However, the records shall be maintained with sufficient particularity to allocate items to each pilotage pool operation or nonpool operation and to support the equitable proration of items that are common to two or more pilotage pools.




(b) Each Association will maintain a separate account called the “Working Capital Fund.” Each Association will deposit into the working capital fund an amount each year at least equal to the amount calculated in Step 5, 46 CFR 404.105. Working capital funds may only be used for infrastructure improvements and infrastructure maintenance necessary to provide safe, efficient, and reliable pilot service such as pilot boat replacements, major repairs to pilot boats, non-recurring technology purchases necessary for providing pilot services, or for the acquisition of real property for use as a dispatch center, office space, or pilot lodging. The Director may grant exceptions to the requirements of this paragraph (403.110(b)) upon request by an Association.
