Not more than three Commissioners may be appointed from the same political party. The President designates one of the Commissioners to serve as the Chairman of the Commission (“Chairman”).

(2) *Removal.* The President may remove a Commissioner for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.


(3) *Vacancies.* A vacancy in the office of any Commissioner is filled in the same manner as the original appointment. An individual appointed to fill a vacancy is appointed only for the unexpired term of the individual being succeeded.

Proxy votes of absent members shall be permitted.


(e) *Meetings; records; rules and regulations.* The Commission shall, through its Secretary, keep a true record of all its meetings and the yea-and-nay votes taken therein on every action and order approved or disapproved by the Commission.
