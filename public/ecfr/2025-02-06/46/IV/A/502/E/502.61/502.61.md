# ยง 502.61   Proceedings.

(a) Any person may commence a proceeding by filing a complaint (Rule 62) for a formal adjudication or by filing a claim for the informal adjudication of small claims (subpart S). A person may also file a petition for a rulemaking (Rule 51), for an exemption (Rule 74), for a declaratory order (Rule 75), or for other appropriate relief (Rule 76), which becomes a proceeding when the Commission assigns a formal docket number to the petition. 


(b) The Commission may commence a proceeding for a rulemaking, for an adjudication (including Commission enforcement action under ยง 502.63), or a non-adjudicatory investigation upon petition or on its own initiative by issuing an appropriate order.


(c) Persons entitled to notice of hearings, except those notified by complaint service under ยง 502.113, will be duly and timely informed of the nature of the proceeding, the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the proceeding is conducted, and the terms, substance, and issues involved, or the matters of fact and law asserted, as the case may be. Such notice will be published in the _Federal Register_ unless all persons subject thereto are named and either are served or otherwise have notice thereof in accordance with law.


(d) In the order instituting a proceeding or in the notice of filing of complaint and assignment, the Commission must establish dates by which the initial decision and the final Commission decision will be issued. These dates may be extended by order of the Commission for good cause shown. [Rule 61.]
