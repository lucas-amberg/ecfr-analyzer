(a) A party to a proceeding may be deemed to be in default if that party fails:


(1) To appear, in person or through a representative, at a hearing or conference of which that party has been notified;


(2) To answer, to respond to a dispositive motion within the time provided, or otherwise to defend the proceeding; or


(3) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the Commission or the presiding officer.


(b) When a party is found to be in default, the Commission or the presiding officer may issue a decision on default upon consideration of the record, including the complaint or Order of Investigation and Hearing.


(c) The presiding officer may require additional information or clarification when needed to issue a decision on default, including a determination of the amount of reparations or civil penalties where applicable.


(d) A respondent who has defaulted may file with the Commission a petition to set aside a decision on default. Such a petition must be made within 22 days of the service date of the decision, state in detail the reasons for failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense. In order to prevent injustice, the Commission may for good cause shown set aside a decision on default. [Rule 65.]
