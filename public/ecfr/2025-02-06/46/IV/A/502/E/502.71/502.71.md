# ยง 502.71   Procedure for non-dispositive motions.

(a) *Duty to confer.* Before filing a non-dispositive motion as defined in ยง 502.69(g) of this subpart, the parties must attempt to discuss the anticipated motion with each other in a good faith effort to determine whether there is any opposition to the relief sought and, if there is opposition, to narrow the areas of disagreement. The moving party must state within the body of the motion what attempt was made or that the discussion occurred and whether the motion is opposed.


(b) *Response to a non-dispositive motion.* A response to a non-dispositive motion must be served and filed within 7 days after the date of service of the motion.


(c) *Response replies.* The moving party may not file a reply to a response to a non-dispositive motion unless requested by the Commission or presiding officer, or upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.


(d) *Page limits.* Neither the motion nor the response may exceed 10 pages, excluding exhibits or appendices, without leave of the presiding officer. [Rule 71.]
