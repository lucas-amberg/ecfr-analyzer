# § 502.102   Enlargement or reduction of time to file documents.

(a) Motions for enlargement or reduction of time for the filing of any pleading or other document, or in connection with the procedures of subpart L of this part, may be granted upon a showing of good cause. Motions must set forth the reasons for the request and be received at least seven (7) days before the scheduled filing date. Motions filed less than seven (7) days before the scheduled filing date may be considered where reasonable grounds are found for the failure to meet this requirement.


(b) Motions submitted after the scheduled filing date will be considered a request to accept late filing and must be accompanied by the document. These motions will only be considered when exceptional circumstances are shown or as justice may require.


(c) Motions and responses to motions filed under this section are subject to the requirements of §§ 502.69 and 502.71, except that responses to motions must be served and filed within five (5) days after the date of service of the motion. [Rule 102.]
