# ยง 502.131   Requests; issuance.

Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the production of evidence shall be issued upon request of any party, without notice to any other party. Requests for subpoenas must be submitted in writing to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The party requesting the subpoena shall tender an original and one copy of such subpoena. Where it appears that the subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, the administrative law judge may in his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. [Rule 131.]
