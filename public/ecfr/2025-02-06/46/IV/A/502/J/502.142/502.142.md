# § 502.142   Persons before whom depositions may be taken.

(a) *Within the United States.* (1) *In general.* Within the United States or a territory or insular possession subject to United States jurisdiction, a deposition must be taken before:


(i) An officer authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or


(ii) A person appointed by the Commission or the presiding officer to administer oaths and take testimony.


(b) *In a foreign country.* (1) *In general.* A deposition may be taken in a foreign country:


(i) Under an applicable treaty or convention;


(ii) under a letter of request, whether or not captioned a “letter rogatory”;


(iii) On notice, before a person authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or


(iv) Before a person authorized by the Commission or the presiding officer to administer any necessary oath and take testimony.


(2) *Issuing a letter of request or an authorization.* A letter of request, an authorization, or both may be issued:


(i) On appropriate terms after an application and notice of it; and


(ii) Without a showing that taking the deposition in another manner is impracticable or inconvenient.


(3) *Form of a request, notice, or authorization.* When a letter of request or any other device is used according to a treaty or convention, it must be captioned in the form prescribed by that treaty or convention. A letter of request may be addressed “To the Appropriate Authority in [name of country].” A deposition notice or an authorization must designate by name or descriptive title the person before whom the deposition is to be taken.


(4) *Letter of request—admitting evidence.* Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States.


(c) *Disqualification.* A deposition must not be taken before a person who is any party's relative, employee, or attorney; who is related to or employed by any party's attorney; or who is financially interested in the action. [Rule 202.]
