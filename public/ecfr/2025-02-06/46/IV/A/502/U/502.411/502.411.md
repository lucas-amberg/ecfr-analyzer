# ยง 502.411   Mediation and other alternative means of dispute resolution.

(a) Parties are encouraged to utilize mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution in all formal proceedings. The Commission also encourages those with disputes to pursue mediation in lieu of, or prior to, the initiation of a Commission proceeding.


(b) Any party may request, at any time, that a mediator or other neutral be appointed to assist the parties in reaching a settlement. If such a request is made in a proceeding assigned to an Administrative Law Judge, the provisions of ยง 502.91 apply. For all other matters, alternative dispute resolution services may be requested directly from the Federal Maritime Commission Alternative Dispute Resolution Specialist, who may serve as the neutral if the parties agree or who will arrange for the appointment of a neutral acceptable to all parties.


(c) The neutral shall convene and conduct mediation or other appropriate dispute resolution proceedings with the parties.


(d) *Ex parte Communications.* Except with respect to arbitration, the provisions of ยง 502.11 do not apply to dispute resolution proceedings, and mediators are expressly authorized to conduct private sessions with parties.
