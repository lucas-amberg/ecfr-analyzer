# ยง 503.56   General declassification and downgrading policy.

(a) The Commission exercises declassification and downgrading authority in accordance with section 3.1 of Executive Order 13526, only over that information originally classified by the Commission under previous Executive Orders. Declassification and downgrading authority may be exercised by the Commission Chairman and the Senior Agency Official, and such others as the Chairman may designate. Commission personnel may not declassify information originally classified by other agencies.


(b) The Commission does not now have original classification authority nor does it have in its possession any documents that it originally classified when it had such authority. The Commission has authorized the Archivist of the United States to automatically declassify information originally classified by the Commission and under its exclusive and final declassification jurisdiction at the end of 20 years from the date of original classification.
