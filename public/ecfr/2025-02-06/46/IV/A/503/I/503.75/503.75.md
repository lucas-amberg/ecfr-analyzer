# ยง 503.75   Procedures for closing a portion of a meeting on request initiated by an interested person.

(a) Any person as defined in ยง 503.71, whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting of the agency, may request that the agency close that portion of a meeting for the reason that matters in deliberation at that portion of the meeting are such that public disclosure of that portion of a meeting is likely to:


(1) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;


(2) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; or


(3) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:


(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;


(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;


(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;


(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or


(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.


(b) Any person described in paragraph (a) of this section who submits a request that a portion of a meeting be closed shall submit an original and 15 copies of that request to the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573, and shall state with particularity that portion of a meeting sought to be closed and the reasons therefor as described in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) Upon receipt of any request made under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary of the agency shall:


(1) Furnish a copy of the request to each member of the agency; and


(2) Furnish a copy of the request to the General Counsel of the agency.


(d) Upon receipt of a request made under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, any member of the agency may request agency action upon the request to close a portion of a meeting by notifying the Secretary of the agency of that request for agency action.


(e) Upon receipt of a request for agency action under paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary of the agency shall schedule a time for an agency vote upon the request of the person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting, which vote shall take place prior to the scheduled meeting of the agency.


(f) At the time the Secretary receives a request for agency action and schedules a time for an agency vote as described in paragraph (e) of this section, the request of the person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting shall be forwarded to the General Counsel of the agency who shall act upon such request as provided in ยง 503.77. 


(g) At the time scheduled by the Secretary, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the members of the agency, upon consideration of the request of the person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting submitted under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and consideration of the certified opinion of the General Counsel of the agency provided to the members under ยง 503.77, shall vote upon that request. That vote shall determine whether or not any portion or portions of a meeting or portion or portions of a series of meetings may be closed to public observation for any of the reasons provided in paragraph (a) of this section, and whether or not the public interest requires that the portion or portions of the meeting or meetings remain open, notwithstanding the applicability of any of the reasons provided in paragraph (a) of this section permitting the closing of any portion of any meeting to public observation.


(h) In the case of a vote on a request under this section to close to public observation a portion of a meeting, no such portion of a meeting may be closed unless, by a vote on the issues described in paragraph (g) of this section, a majority of the entire membership of the agency shall vote to close such portion of a meeting by a recorded vote.
