(1) An NVOCC that does not have a published tariff as required by 46 U.S.C. 40501 and part 520 of this chapter, and a bond, insurance, or other surety as required by 46 U.S.C. 40902 and this part; or

(1) Consulting the Commission's website *www.fmc.gov* as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, to verify that the NVOCC or OFF has complied with the applicable licensing, registration, tariff, and financial responsibility requirements; or


(2) Any other appropriate procedure, provided that such procedure is set forth in the carrier's tariff.


(c) A common carrier that has employed the procedure prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be deemed to have met its obligations under 46 U.S.C. 41104(a)(11), unless the common carrier knew that such NVOCC or OFF was not in compliance with the applicable tariff or financial responsibility requirements.


(d) The Commission will publish at its Web site, *www.fmc.gov,* a list of the locations of all carrier and conference tariffs, and a list of ocean transportation intermediaries (including a separate list for NVOCCs) who have met all of their applicable licensing, registration, tariff and financial responsibility requirements, current as of the last date on which the list is updated.
