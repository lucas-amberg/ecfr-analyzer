# ยง 520.11   Non-vessel-operating common carriers.

(a) *Financial responsibility.* An ocean transportation intermediary that operates as a non-vessel-operating common carrier must state in its tariff publication:


(1) That it has furnished the Commission proof of its financial responsibility in the manner and amount required by part 515 of this chapter;


(2) The manner of its financial responsibility;


(3) Whether it is relying on coverage provided by a group or association to which it is a member;


(4) The name and address of the surety company, insurance company, or guarantor issuing the bond, insurance policy, or guaranty;


(5) The number of its bond, insurance policy, or guaranty; and


(6) Where applicable, the name and address of the group or association providing coverage.


(b) *Agent for service.* Every NVOCC not in the United States must state the name and address of the person in the United States designated under part 515 of this chapter as its legal agent for service of process, including subpoenas. The NVOCC must also state that in any instance in which the designated legal agent cannot be served because of death, disability, or unavailability, the Commission's Secretary will be deemed to be its legal agent for service of process.


(c) *Co-loading.* NVOCCs must address the following situations in their tariffs:


(1) If two or more NVOCCs enter into an agreement which establishes a carrier-to-carrier relationship for the co-loading of cargo, then the existence of such agreement must be noted in the tariff. Carrier-to-carrier relationships apply to the co-loading of less than container loads of cargo only.


(2) If two NVOCCs enter into a co-loading arrangement which results in a shipper-to-carrier relationship, the tendering NVOCC must describe its co-loading practices and specify its responsibility to pay any charges for the transportation of the cargo. A shipper-to-carrier relationship is presumed to exist where the receiving NVOCC issues a bill of lading to the tendering NVOCC for carriage of the co-loaded cargo. Shipper-to-carrier relationships may apply to the co-loading of full container loads or less than container loads of cargo.


(3) An NVOCC which tenders cargo to another NVOCC for co-loading, whether under a shipper-to-carrier or carrier-to-carrier relationship, shall annotate each applicable bill of lading with the identity of any other NVOCC to which the shipment has been tendered for co-loading. Such annotation shall be shown on the face of the bill of lading in a clear and legible manner.
