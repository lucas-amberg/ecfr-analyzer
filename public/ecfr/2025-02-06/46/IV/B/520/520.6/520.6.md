# § 520.6   Retrieval of information.

(a) *General.* Tariffs systems must present retrievers with the ability to:


(1) Search for commonly understood tariff objects (*e.g.,* commodities, origins, destinations, etc.) without restricting such search to a specific tariff;


(2) Search a tariff for a rate on the basis of origin, destination and commodity;


(3) Employ a tariff selection option; or


(4) Select an object group (*e.g.,* rules, locations, groups, etc.) within a particular tariff.


(b) *Search capability.* Publisher must provide the capability to search for tariff matter by non-case sensitive text search. Text search matches for commodity descriptions must result in a commodity or retrievable commodity index list.


(c) *Commodities and TRIs.* Retriever selection of a specific commodity from a commodity index list must display the commodity description and provide an option for searching for a rate (*e.g.,* on the basis of origin/destination) or a TRI list, if multiple TRIs are in effect for the commodity.


(d) *Object groups.* Retriever selection of a specific object group must result in a list of the objects within the group or present a text search mechanism to allow location of an object within the group. For example, selection of the rules object group would present a list of the rules or a text search mechanism for locating specific terms or phrases within the rules.


(e) *Basic ocean freight.* The minimum rate display for tariffs must consist of the basic ocean freight rate and a list of all assessorial charges and surcharges that apply for the retriever-entered shipment parameters. The tariff must indicate when other rules or charges apply to a shipment under certain circumstances.


(f) *Displays.* All displays of individual tariff matter must include the publication date, effective date, amendment code (use codes in appendix A to this part), and object name or number. When applicable, a through date or expiration date must also be displayed. Use of “S” as an amendment code must be accompanied by a Commission issued special permission number.
