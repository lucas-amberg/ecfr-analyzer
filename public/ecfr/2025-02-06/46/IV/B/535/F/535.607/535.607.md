# ยง 535.607   Failure to comply with requests for additional information.

(a) A failure to comply with a request for additional information results when a person filing an agreement, or an officer, director, partner, agent, or employee thereof fails to substantially respond to the request or does not file a satisfactory statement of reasons for noncompliance. An adequate response is one which directly addresses the Commission's request. When a response is not received by the Commission within a specified time, failure to comply will have occurred.


(b) The Commission may, pursuant to section 6(i) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 41307(c)), request relief from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia when it considers that there has been a failure to substantially comply with a request for additional information. The Commission may request that the court:


(1) Order compliance with the request;


(2) Extend the review period until there has been substantial compliance; or


(3) Grant other equitable relief that under the circumstances seems necessary or appropriate.


(c) Where there has been a failure to substantially comply, section 6(i)(2) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 41307(c)(2)) provides that the court shall extend the review period until there has been substantial compliance.
