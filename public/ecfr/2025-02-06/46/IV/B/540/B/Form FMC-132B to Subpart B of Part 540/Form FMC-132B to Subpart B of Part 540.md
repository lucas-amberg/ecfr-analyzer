Know all men by these presents, that We ____________ (Name of applicant), of __________ (City), ____________ (State and country), as Principal (hereinafter called Principal), and ____________ (Name of surety), a company created and existing under the laws of ____________ (State and country) and authorized to do business in the United States, as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the penal sum of ____________, for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.


Whereas, the Principal intends to become a holder of a Certificate (Casualty) pursuant to the provisions of subpart B of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, and has elected to file with the Federal Maritime Commission such a bond to insure financial responsibility to meet any liability it may incur for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports, and


Whereas, this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal as an authorized holder of a Certificate (Casualty) pursuant to subpart B of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, and shall inure to the benefit of any and all passengers or other persons to whom the Principal may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.


Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to passengers or other persons any sum or sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the Principal's failure faithfully to meet any liability the Principal may incur for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports, while this bond is in effect pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of subpart B of part 540 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise, to remain in full force and effect.


The liability of the Surety with respect to any passenger or other persons shall in no event exceed the amount of the Principal's legal liability under any final judgment or settlement agreement, except that, if the aggregate amount of such judgments and settlements exceeds an amount computed in accordance with the formula contained in section 2(a) of Pub. L. 89-777 (46 U.S.C. 44103(b)), then the Surety's total liability under this surety bond shall be limited to an amount computed in accordance with such formula.


The Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Federal Maritime Commission forthwith of all suits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made by said Surety under this bond.


This bond is effective the ______________ day of __________________, 19____, 12:01 a.m., standard time, at the address of the Principal as stated herein and shall continue in force until terminated as hereinafter provided. The Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice sent by certified mail to the other and to the Federal Maritime Commission at its Office in Washington, D.C., such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after actual receipt of said notice by the Commission, except that no such termination shall become effective while a voyage is in progress. The Surety shall not be liable hereunder for any liability incurred for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports after the termination of this bond as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for such liability incurred for death or injury to passengers or other persons on voyages to or from U.S. ports prior to the date such termination becomes effective.


In witness whereof, the said Principal and Surety have executed this instrument on the ____________ day of ________________, 19____.
