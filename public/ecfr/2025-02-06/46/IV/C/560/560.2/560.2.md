# ยง 560.2   Factors indicating conditions unduly impairing access.

For the purpose of this part, factors which would indicate the existence of conditions created by foreign government action or action of a common carrier acting alone or in concert with any person, which unduly impair access of a U.S. flag vessel engaged in or seeking access to ocean trade between foreign ports, include, but are not limited to:


(a) Imposition upon U.S. flag vessels or upon shippers or consignees using such vessels, of fees, charges, requirements, or restrictions different from those imposed on national-flag or other vessels, or which preclude or tend to preclude U.S. flag vessels from competing in the trade on the same basis as any other vessel.


(b) Reservation of a substantial portion of the total cargo in the trade to national-flag or other vessels which results in failure to provide reasonable competitive access to cargoes by U.S. flag vessels.


(c) Use of predatory practices, possibly including but not limited to the use of a vessel or vessels in a particular trade for the purpose of excluding, preventing, or reducing competition by driving another ocean common carrier out of that trade, and closed conferences employing deferred rebates, which unduly impair access of a U.S. flag vessel to the trade.


(d) Any government or commercial practice that results in, or may result in, unequal and unfair opportunity for U.S. flag vessel access to port or intermodal facilities or services related to the carriage of cargo inland to or from ports in the trade.


(e) Any other practice which unduly impairs access of a U.S. flag vessel to trade between foreign ports.
