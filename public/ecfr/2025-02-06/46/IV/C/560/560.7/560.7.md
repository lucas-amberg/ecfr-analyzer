# ยง 560.7   Decision; sanctions; effective date.

(a) Upon completion of any proceeding conducted under this part, the Commission will issue and serve a decision on all parties. 


(b) If the Commission finds that conditions unduly impairing access of a U.S. flag vessel to ocean trade between foreign ports exist, any of the following actions may be taken: 


(1) Imposition of equalizing fees or charges applied in the foreign trade of the United States; 


(2) Limitations on sailings to and from United States ports or on the amount or type of cargo carried;


(3)(i) Suspension, in whole or in part, of any or all tariffs or service contracts for carriage to or from United States ports for any period the Commission specifies, or until such time as unimpaired access is secured for U.S. flag carriers in the affected trade.


(ii) Acceptance or handling of cargo for carriage under a tariff that has been suspended, or after a common carrier's right to utilize that tariff has been suspended pursuant to this part, will subject a carrier to the imposition of a civil penalty as provided under the Act (46 U.S.C. 41108(b)) of not more than $50,000 per shipment; and 


(4) Suspension, in whole or in part, of the right of an ocean common carrier to operate under any agreement filed with the Commission, including agreements authorizing preferential treatment at terminals, preferential terminal leases, space chartering, or pooling of cargo or revenues with other ocean common carriers; 


(5) Imposition of a charge not to exceed $1,000,000 per inbound or outbound movement between a foreign country and the United States by a vessel engaged in the United States oceanborne trade; 


(6) A request to the collector of customs at any port or place of destination in the United States to refuse the clearance required by section 4197 of the Revised Statutes (46 U.S.C. 60105), to any vessel of a foreign carrier which is or whose government is identified as contributing to the conditions described in ยง 560.2 of this part;


(7) A request to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to deny entry, for purposes of oceanborne trade, of any vessel of a foreign carrier which is or whose government is identified as contributing to the conditions described in ยง 587.2 of this part to any port or place in the United States or the navigable waters of the United States, or to detain any such vessel at the port or place in the United States from which it is about to depart for any other port or place in the United States; and


(8) Any other action the Commission finds necessary and appropriate to address conditions unduly impairing access of a U.S.-flag vessel to trade between foreign ports. 


(c) If the Commission finds that conditions impairing access of a U.S. flag vessel to ocean trade between foreign ports has not yet occurred, and punitive sanctions are warranted, such sanctions will be imposed to become effective simultaneously with the implementation of the action that would unduly impair the access of a U.S. flag vessel.


(d)(1) All decisions will be published in the _Federal Register._

(2) Decisions imposing sanctions, except where conditions warrant and for good cause, will become effective 30 days after the date of publication. 


(e) Any party may file a petition to reconsider any decision under this part. Such a petition shall be served on all other parties to the proceeding and shall not, in and of itself, stay the effective date of the Commission action.
