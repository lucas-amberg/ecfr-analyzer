# § 1.47   Service of documents and proof of service.

(a) Where the Commission or any person is required by statute or by the provisions of this chapter to serve any document upon any person, service shall (in the absence of specific provisions in this chapter to the contrary) be made in accordance with the provisions of this section. Documents that are required to be served by the Commission in agency proceedings (*i.e.,* not in the context of judicial proceedings, Congressional investigations, or other proceedings outside the Commission) may be served in electronic form. Documents associated with licenses, applications, waivers, and other requests in the Wireless Radio Services that are required to be served by the Commission in agency proceedings must be served in electronic form. In proceedings involving a large number of parties, and unless otherwise provided by statute, the Commission may satisfy its service obligation by issuing a public notice that identifies the documents required to be served and that explains how parties can obtain copies of the documents.


(b) Where any person is required to serve any document filed with the Commission, service shall be made by that person or by his representative on or before the day on which the document is filed.


(c) Commission counsel who formally participate in any proceeding shall be served in the same manner as other persons who participate in that proceeding. The filing of a document with the Commission does not constitute service upon Commission counsel.


(d) Except in formal complaint proceedings against common carriers under §§ 1.720 through 1.740 and proceedings related to the Wireless Radio Services under subpart F of this part, documents may be served upon a party, his attorney, or other duly constituted agent by delivering a copy or by mailing a copy to the last known address. Documents that are required to be served must be served in paper form, even if documents are filed in electronic form with the Commission, unless the party to be served agrees to accept service in some other form. Petitions, pleadings, and other documents associated with licensing matters in the Wireless Radio Services must be served electronically upon a party, his attorney, or other duly constituted agent by delivering a copy by email to the email address listed in the Universal Licensing System (ULS). If a filer is not an applicant or licensee, the document must include an email address for receiving electronic service.


(e) Delivery of a copy pursuant to this section means handing it to the party, his attorney, or other duly constituted agent; or leaving it with the clerk or other person in charge of the office of the person being served; or, if there is no one in charge of such office, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or, if such office is closed or the person to be served has no office, leaving it at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein. For pleadings, petitions, and other documents associated with licensing matters in the Wireless Radio Services, delivery of a copy pursuant to this section is complete by sending it by email to the email addresses listed in the ULS, or to the email address of the applicant's or licensee's attorney provided in a pleading or other document served on the filer.


(f) Service by mail is complete upon mailing. Service by email is complete upon sending to the email address listed in the ULS for a particular license, application, or filing.


(g) Proof of service, as provided in this section, shall be filed before action is taken. The proof of service shall show the time and manner of service, and may be by written acknowledgement of service, by certificate of the person effecting the service, or by other proof satisfactory to the Commission. Failure to make proof of service will not affect the validity of the service. The Commission may allow the proof to be amended or supplied at any time, unless to do so would result in material prejudice to a party. Proof of electronic service shall show the email address of the person making the service, in addition to that person's residence or business address; the date and time of the electronic service; the name and email address of the person served; and that the document was served electronically.


(h) Every common carrier and interconnected VoIP provider, as defined in § 54.5 of this chapter, and non-interconnected VoIP provider, as defined in § 64.601(a)(15) of this chapter and with interstate end-user revenues that are subject to contribution to the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund, that is subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall designate an agent in the District of Columbia, and may designate additional agents if it so chooses, upon whom service of all notices, process, orders, decisions, and requirements of the Commission may be made for and on behalf of such carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider in any proceeding before the Commission. Every international section 214 authorization holder must also designate an agent in the District of Columbia who is a U.S. citizen or lawful U.S. permanent resident pursuant to § 63.18(q)(1)(iii) of this chapter. Such designation shall include, for the carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider and its designated agents, a name, business address, telephone or voicemail number, facsimile number, and, if available, internet email address. Such carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider shall additionally list any other names by which it is known or under which it does business, and, if the carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider is an affiliated company, the parent, holding, or management company. Within thirty (30) days of the commencement of provision of service, such carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider shall file such information with the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes Resolution Division. Such carriers, interconnected VoIP providers, and non-interconnected VoIP providers may file a hard copy of the relevant portion of the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet, as delineated by the Commission in the _Federal Register_, to satisfy the requirement in the preceding sentence. Each Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet filed annually by a common carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider must contain a name, business address, telephone or voicemail number, facsimile number, and, if available, internet email address for its designated agents, regardless of whether such information has been revised since the previous filing. Carriers, interconnected VoIP providers, and non-interconnected VoIP providers must notify the Commission within one week of any changes in their designation information by filing revised portions of the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet with the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes Resolution Division. A paper copy of this designation list shall be maintained in the Office of the Secretary of the Commission. Service of any notice, process, orders, decisions or requirements of the Commission may be made upon such carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider by leaving a copy thereof with such designated agent at his office or usual place of residence. If such carrier, interconnected VoIP provider, or non-interconnected VoIP provider fails to designate such an agent, service of any notice or other process in any proceeding before the Commission, or of any order, decision, or requirement of the Commission, may be made by posting such notice, process, order, requirement, or decision in the Office of the Secretary of the Commission.
