# § 1.87   Modification of license or construction permit on motion of the Commission.

(a) Whenever it appears that a station license or construction permit should be modified, the Commission shall notify the licensee or permittee in writing of the proposed action and reasons therefor, and afford the licensee or permittee at least thirty days to protest such proposed order of modification, except that, where safety of life or property is involved, the Commission may by order provide a shorter period of time.


(b) The notification required in paragraph (a) of this section may be effectuated by a notice of proposed rulemaking in regard to a modification or addition of an FM or television channel to the Table of Allotments (§§ 73.202 and 73.504 of this chapter) or Table of Assignments (§ 73.606 of this chapter). The Commission shall send a copy of any such notice of proposed rulemaking to the affected licensee or permittee by email. For modifications involving Wireless Radio Services, the Commission shall notify the licensee or permittee by email of the proposed action and reasons therefor, and afford the licensee or permittee at least thirty days to protest such proposed order of modification, except that:


(1) Where safety of life or property is involved, the Commission may by order provide a shorter period of time; and


(2) Where the notification required in paragraph (a) of this section is effectuated by publication in the _Federal Register,_ the Commission shall afford the licensee or permittee at least thirty days after publication in the _Federal Register_ to protest such proposed order of modification.


(c) Any other licensee or permittee who believes that its license or permit would be modified by the proposed action may also protest the proposed action before its effective date.


(d) Any protest filed pursuant to this section shall be subject to the requirements of section 309 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, for petitions to deny.


(e) In any case where a hearing proceeding is conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section, both the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the Commission except that, with respect to any issue that pertains to the question of whether the proposed action would modify the license or permit of a person filing a protest pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, such burdens shall be as described by the Commission.


(f) In order to use the right to a hearing and the opportunity to give evidence upon the issues specified in any order designating a matter for hearing, any licensee, or permittee, itself or by counsel, shall, within the period of time as may be specified in that order, file with the Commission a written appearance stating that it will present evidence on the matters specified in the order and, if required, appear before the presiding officer at a date and time to be determined.


(g) The right to file a protest or the right to a hearing proceeding shall, unless good cause is shown in a petition to be filed not later than 5 days before the lapse of time specified in paragraph (a) or (f) of this section, be deemed waived:


(1) In case of failure to timely file the protest as required by paragraph (a) of this section or a written statement as required by paragraph (f) of this section.


(2) In case of filing a written statement provided for in paragraph (f) of this section but failing to appear at the hearing, either in person or by counsel.


(h) Where the right to file a protest or have a hearing is waived, the licensee or permittee will be deemed to have consented to the modification as proposed and a final decision may be issued by the Commission accordingly. Irrespective of any waiver as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section or failure by the licensee or permittee to raise a substantial and material question of fact concerning the proposed modification in his protest, the Commission may, on its own motion, designate the proposed modification for hearing in accordance with this section.


(i) Any order of modification issued pursuant to this section shall include a statement of the findings and the grounds and reasons therefor, shall specify the effective date of the modification, and shall be served on the licensee or permittee.
