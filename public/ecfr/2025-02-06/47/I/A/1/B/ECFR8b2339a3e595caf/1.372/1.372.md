# § 1.372   The affirmative case.

(a) Within 30 days after the completion of the discovery period as determined by the presiding officer, unless otherwise directed by the presiding officer, any party to the proceeding with the burden of proof shall file a pleading entitled “affirmative case” that fully addresses each of the issues designated for hearing. The affirmative case submission shall include:


(1) A statement of relevant material facts, supported by sworn statements based on personal knowledge, documentation, or by other materials subject to consideration by the presiding officer, and a full legal analysis of each of the issues designated for hearing;


(2) Citation to relevant sections of the Communications Act or Commission regulations or orders; and


(3) The relief sought.


(b) The affirmative case submission shall address all factual and legal questions designated for hearing, and state in detail the basis for the response to each such question. Responses based on information and belief are prohibited unless made in good faith and accompanied by a declaration or affidavit explaining the basis for the party's belief and why the party could not reasonably ascertain the facts. When a party intends in good faith to deny only part of a designated question in the affirmative case, that party shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder.


(c) Failure to address in an affirmative case submission all factual and legal questions designated for hearing may result in inferences adverse to the filing party.
