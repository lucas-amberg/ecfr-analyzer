(a) The Commission will refer any applications, petitions, or other filings for which it determines to seek executive branch review by placing the application, petition, or other filing on an accepted for filing public notice that will provide a comment period for the executive branch to seek deferral for review for national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, and/or trade policy concerns.


(b)(1) The executive branch agency(ies) must electronically file in all applicable Commission file numbers and dockets associated with the application(s), petition(s), or other filing(s) a request that the Commission defer action until the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector (Committee) completes its review. In the request for deferral the executive branch agency must notify the Commission on or before the comment date and must state whether the executive branch:


(i) Sent tailored questions to the applicant(s), petitioner(s), and/or other filer(s);


(ii) Will send tailored questions to the applicant(s), petitioner(s), and/or other filer(s) by a specific date not to be later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the Commission referred the application to the executive branch in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or


(iii) Will not transmit tailored questions to the applicant(s), petitioner(s), and/or other filer(s).


(2) The executive branch agency(ies) must electronically file in all applicable Commission file numbers and dockets associated with the application(s), petition(s), or other filing(s) a request by the comment date if it needs additional time beyond the comment period set out in the accepted for filing public notice to determine whether it will seek deferral.


(c) If an executive branch agency(ies) does not notify the Commission that it seeks deferral of referred application(s), petition(s), and/or other filing(s) within the comment period established by an accepted for filing public notice, the Commission will deem that the executive branch does not have any national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, and/or trade policy concerns with the application(s), petition(s), and/or other filing(s) and may act on the application(s), petition(s), and/or other filing(s) as appropriate based on its determination of the public interest.
