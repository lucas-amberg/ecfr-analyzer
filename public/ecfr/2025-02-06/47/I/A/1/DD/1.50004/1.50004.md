Eligible providers may rely upon the predetermined estimated costs identified in the Catalog of Expenses Eligible for Reimbursement made available by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Eligible providers that submit their own cost estimates must submit supporting documentation and certify that the estimate is made in good faith.


(ii) Detailed information on the covered communications equipment or service being removed, replaced and disposed of;

The Wireline Competition Bureau may extend the deadline for granting or denying applications for up to an additional 45 days if it determines that an excessive number of applications have been filed during the window and additional time is needed to review the applications.


(1) If the Wireline Competition Bureau determines that an application is materially deficient (including by lacking an adequate cost estimate or adequate supporting materials), the Wireline Competition Bureau shall provide the applicant a 15-day period to cure the defect before denying the application.

(f) *Prioritization of Support.* The Wireline Competition Bureau shall issue funding allocations in accordance with this section after the close of a filing window. After a filing window closes, the Wireline Competition Bureau shall calculate the total demand for Reimbursement Program support submitted by all eligible providers during the filing window period.

(1) *Application of prioritization schedule.* The Wireline Competition Bureau shall issue full funding allocations for all eligible providers in the Priority 1 prioritization category before issuing funding allocations in any subsequent prioritization categories. The Wireline Competition Bureau shall continue to review all funding requests and issue funding allocations by prioritization category until there are no available funds remaining. If there is insufficient funding to fully fund all requests in a particular prioritization category, then the Wireline Competition Bureau will pro-rate the available funding among all eligible providers in that prioritization category. Requests for funds in subsequent prioritization categories will be denied for lack of available funding.


(2) *Pro-rata reductions.* When pro-rata reductions are required per paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Wireline Competition Bureau shall:


(i) Divide the total remaining funds available by the demand within the specific prioritization category to produce a pro-rata factor;


(ii) Multiply the pro-rata factor by the total dollar amount requested by each recipient in the prioritization category; and


(iii) Allocate funds to each recipient consistent with this calculation.


(g) *Funding disbursements.* Following the approval and issuance by the Wireline Competition Bureau of a funding allocation, a Reimbursement Program recipient may file a reimbursement claim request for the draw down disbursement of funds from the recipient's funding allocation.

The Wireline Competition Bureau will review and grant or deny reimbursement claims for actual costs reasonably incurred.
