# ยง 1.776   Pricing flexibility limited grandfathering.

Special access contract-based tariffs that were in effect on or before August 1, 2017 are grandfathered. Such contract-based tariffs may not be extended, renewed or revised, except that any extension or renewal expressly provided for by the contract-based tariff may be exercised pursuant to the terms thereof. During the period between August 1, 2017 and the deadline to institute mandatory detariffing under ยง 61.201(b), upon mutual agreement, parties to a grandfathered contract-based tariff may replace it at any time with a new contract-based tariff or with a new or amended contract that is not filed as a contract-based tariff.
