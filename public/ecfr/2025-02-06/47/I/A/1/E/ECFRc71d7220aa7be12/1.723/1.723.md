# § 1.723   Damages.

(a) If a complainant in a formal complaint proceeding wishes to recover damages, the complaint must contain a clear and unequivocal request for damages.


(b) In all cases in which recovery of damages is sought, the complaint must include either:


(1) A computation of each and every category of damages for which recovery is sought, along with an identification of all relevant documents and materials or such other evidence to be used by the complainant to prove the amount of such damages; or


(2) If any information not in the possession of the complainant is necessary to develop a detailed computation of damages, an explanation of:


(i) Why such information is unavailable to the complaining party;


(ii) The factual basis the complainant has for believing that such evidence of damages exists; and


(iii) A detailed outline of the methodology that would be used to create a computation of damages with such evidence.


(c) If a complainant wishes a determination of damages to be made in a proceeding that is separate from and subsequent to the proceeding in which the determinations of liability and prospective relief are made, the complainant must:


(1) Comply with paragraph (a) of this section, and


(2) State clearly and unequivocally that the complainant wishes a determination of damages to be made in a proceeding that is separate from and subsequent to the proceeding in which the determinations of liability and prospective relief will be made.


(d) If the Commission decides that a determination of damages would best be made in a proceeding that is separate from and subsequent to the proceeding in which the determinations of liability and prospective relief are made, the Commission may at any time bifurcate the case and order that the initial proceeding will determine only liability and prospective relief, and that a separate, subsequent proceeding initiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section will determine damages.


(e) If a complainant exercises its right under paragraph (c) of this section, or the Commission invokes its authority under paragraph (d) of this section, the complainant may initiate a separate proceeding to obtain a determination of damages by filing a supplemental complaint within sixty days after public notice (as defined in § 1.4(b)) of a decision that contains a finding of liability on the merits of the original complaint. Supplemental complaints filed pursuant to this section need not comply with the requirements in §§ 1.721(c) or 1.722(d), (g), (h), (j), and (k). The supplemental complaint shall be deemed, for statutory limitations purposes, to relate back to the date of the original complaint.


(f) The Commission may, in its discretion, order the defendant either to post a bond for, or deposit into an interest bearing escrow account, a sum equal to the amount of damages which the Commission finds, upon preliminary investigation, is likely to be ordered after the issue of damages is fully litigated, or some lesser sum which may be appropriate, provided the Commission finds that the grant of this relief is favored on balance upon consideration of the following factors:


(1) The complainant's potential irreparable injury in the absence of such deposit;


(2) The extent to which damages can be accurately calculated;


(3) The balance of the hardships between the complainant and the defendant; and


(4) Whether public interest considerations favor the posting of the bond or ordering of the deposit.


(g) The Commission may, in its discretion, end adjudication of damages by adopting a damages computation method or formula. In such cases, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the exact amount of damages pursuant to the Commission-mandated method or formula. Within 30 days of the release date of the damages order, parties shall submit jointly to the Commission either:


(1) A statement detailing the parties' agreement as to the amount of damages;


(2) A statement that the parties are continuing to negotiate in good faith and a request that the parties be given an extension of time to continue negotiations; or


(3) A statement detailing the bases for the continuing dispute and the reasons why no agreement can be reached.


(h) In any proceeding to which no statutory deadline applies, the Commission may, in its discretion, suspend ongoing damages proceedings to provide the parties with time to pursue settlement negotiations or mediation under § 1.737.
