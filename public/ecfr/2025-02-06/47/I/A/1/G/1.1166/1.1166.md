# § 1.1166   Waivers, reductions and deferrals of regulatory fees.

The fees established by §§ 1.1152 through 1.1156 and associated interest charges and penalties may be waived, reduced or deferred in specific instances, on a case-by-case basis, where good cause is shown and where waiver, reduction or deferral of such fees, interest charges and penalties would promote the public interest. Requests to pay fees established by §§ 1.1152 through 1.1156 and associated interest charges and penalties in installments may be granted in accordance with § 1.1914. Requests for waiver, reduction or deferral of regulatory fees for entire categories of payors will not be considered.


(a) Requests for waiver, reduction or deferral of regulatory fees shall be filed electronically, by submission to the following email address: *regfeerelief@fcc.gov.* All requests for waiver, reduction and deferral shall be acted upon by the Managing Director with the concurrence of the General Counsel. All such requests made pursuant to § 1.1166 may be combined in a single pleading.


(b) Deferrals of fees, interest, or penalties if granted, will be for a designated period of time not to exceed six months.


(c) Petitions for waiver of a regulatory fee, interest, or penalties must be accompanied by the required fee, interest, or penalties and FCC Form 159. Submitted fees, interest, or penalties will be returned if a waiver is granted. Waiver requests that do not include the required fees, interest, or penalties or forms will be dismissed unless a request to defer payment due to financial hardship, supported by documentation of the financial hardship, is included in the filing.


(d) Petitions for reduction of a fee, interest, or penalty must be accompanied by the full fee, interest, or penalty payment and FCC Form 159. Petitions for reduction that do not include the required fees, interest, or penalties or forms will be dismissed unless a request to defer payment due to financial hardship, supported by documentation of the financial hardship, is included in the filing.


(e) Petitions for waiver of a fee, interest, or penalty based on financial hardship, including bankruptcy, will not be granted, even if otherwise consistent with Commission policy, to the extent that the total regulatory and application fees, interest, or penalties for which waiver is sought exceeds $500,000 in any fiscal year, including regulatory fees due in any fiscal year, but paid prior to the due date. In computing this amount, the amounts owed by an entity and its subsidiaries and other affiliated entities will be aggregated. In cases where the claim of financial hardship is not based on bankruptcy, waiver, partial waiver, or deferral of fees, interest, or penalties above the $500,000 cap may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
