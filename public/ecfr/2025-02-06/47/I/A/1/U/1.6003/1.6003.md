# § 1.6003   Reasonable periods of time to act on siting applications.

(a) *Timely action required.* A siting authority that fails to act on a siting application on or before the shot clock date for the application, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, is presumed not to have acted within a reasonable period of time.


(b) *Shot clock period.* The shot clock period for a siting application is the sum of—


(1) The number of days of the presumptively reasonable period of time for the pertinent type of application, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section; plus


(2) The number of days of the tolling period, if any, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Presumptively reasonable periods of time*—(1) *Review periods for individual applications.* The following are the presumptively reasonable periods of time for action on applications seeking authorization for deployments in the categories set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section:


(i) Review of an application to collocate a Small Wireless Facility using an existing structure: 60 days.


(ii) Review of an application to collocate a facility other than a Small Wireless Facility using an existing structure: 90 days.


(iii) Review of an application to deploy a Small Wireless Facility using a new structure: 90 days.


(iv) Review of an application to deploy a facility other than a Small Wireless Facility using a new structure: 150 days.


(2) *Batching.* (i) If a single application seeks authorization for multiple deployments, all of which fall within a category set forth in either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section, then the presumptively reasonable period of time for the application as a whole is equal to that for a single deployment within that category.


(ii) If a single application seeks authorization for multiple deployments, the components of which are a mix of deployments that fall within paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and deployments that fall within paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, then the presumptively reasonable period of time for the application as a whole is 90 days.


(iii) Siting authorities may not refuse to accept applications under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(d) *Tolling period.* Unless a written agreement between the applicant and the siting authority provides otherwise, the tolling period for an application (if any) is as set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.


(1) For an initial application to deploy Small Wireless Facilities, if the siting authority notifies the applicant on or before the 10th day after submission that the application is materially incomplete, and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information and the specific rule or regulation creating the obligation to submit such documents or information, the shot clock date calculation shall restart at zero on the date on which the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the siting authority to render the application complete.


(2) For all other initial applications, the tolling period shall be the number of days from—


(i) The day after the date when the siting authority notifies the applicant in writing that the application is materially incomplete and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information that the applicant must submit to render the application complete and the specific rule or regulation creating this obligation; until


(ii) The date when the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the siting authority to render the application complete;


(iii) But only if the notice pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is effectuated on or before the 30th day after the date when the application was submitted; or


(3) For resubmitted applications following a notice of deficiency, the tolling period shall be the number of days from—


(i) The day after the date when the siting authority notifies the applicant in writing that the applicant's supplemental submission was not sufficient to render the application complete and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information that need to be submitted based on the siting authority's original request under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section; until


(ii) The date when the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the siting authority to render the application complete;


(iii) But only if the notice pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section is effectuated on or before the 10th day after the date when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the siting authority's request under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.


(e) *Shot clock date.* The shot clock date for a siting application is determined by counting forward, beginning on the day after the date when the application was submitted, by the number of calendar days of the shot clock period identified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and including any pre-application period asserted by the siting authority; *provided,* that if the date calculated in this manner is a “holiday” as defined in § 1.4(e)(1) or a legal holiday within the relevant State or local jurisdiction, the shot clock date is the next business day after such date. The term “business day” means any day as defined in § 1.4(e)(2) and any day that is not a legal holiday as defined by the State or local jurisdiction.
