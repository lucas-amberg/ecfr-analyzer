# ยง 1.7008   Creation of broadband internet access service coverage maps.

(a) After consultation with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, the Commission shall use the availability and quality of service data submitted by providers in the Broadband Data Collection to create:


(1) The Broadband Map, which shall depict areas of the country that remain unserved by providers and depict the extent of availability of broadband internet access service;


(2) A map that depicts the availability of fixed broadband internet access service; and


(3) A map that depicts the availability of mobile broadband internet access service.


(b) The Commission shall use the maps created in paragraph (a) of this section to determine areas where broadband internet access service is and is not available and when making any funding award for broadband internet access service deployment for residential and mobile customers.


(c) Based on the most recent Broadband Data Collection information collected from providers, the Commission shall update the maps created in paragraph (a) of this section at least biannually using the data collected from providers.


(d)(1) The Commission shall collect verified data for use in the coverage maps from:


(i) State, local, and Tribal entities primarily responsible for mapping or tracking broadband internet access service coverage in their areas;


(ii) Third parties, if the Commission determines it is in the public interest to use their data in the development of the coverage maps or the verification of data submitted by providers; and


(iii) Other Federal agencies.


(2) To the extent government entities or third parties choose to file verified data, they must follow the same filing process as providers submitting their broadband internet access service data in the data portal. Government entities and third parties that file on-the-ground test data must submit such data using the same metrics and testing parameters the Commission requires of mobile service providers when responding to a Commission request to verify mobile providers' broadband network coverage with on-the-ground data (*see* ยง 1.7006(c)(1)).

(3) Providers shall review the verified data submitted by governments and third parties in the online portal, work with the submitter to resolve any coverage discrepancies, make any corrections they deem necessary based on such review, and submit any updated data to the Commission within 60 days of the date that the provider is notified that the data has been submitted in the online portal by the government entity or third party.
