# § 1.10001   Definitions.

*All other applications.* We consider all other applications officially filed once you file the application in the International Communications Filing System (ICFS) and applicable filing fees are received and approved by the FCC, unless the application is determined to be fee-exempt. We determine your official filing date based on one of the following situations:


(1)(i) You file your Satellite Space Station Application or your Application for Earth Stations to Access a Non-U.S. Satellite Not Currently Authorized to provide the Proposed Service in the Proposed Frequencies in the United States in ICFS.


(ii) Your official filing date is the date and time (to the millisecond) you file your application and receive a confirmation of filing and submission ID.


(2) You file all other applications in ICFS and then do one of the following:


(i)(A) Pay by online Automatic Clearing House (ACH) payment, online Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover credit card payment, or wire transfer payment denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications Commission (through ICFS)


(B) Your official filing date is the date your online payment is approved. (Note: You will receive a remittance ID and an authorization number if your transaction is successful).


(ii)(A) Determine your application type is fee-exempt or your application qualifies for exemption to charges as provided in this part


(B) Your official filing date is the date you file in ICFS and receive a confirmation of filing and submission ID.


*Application.* A request for an earth or space station radio station license, an international cable landing license, or an international service authorization, or a request to amend a pending application or to modify or renew licenses or authorizations. The term also includes the other requests that may be filed in ICFS such as transfers of control and assignments of license applications, earth station registrations, and foreign carrier affiliation notifications.


*Authorizations.* Generally, a written document or oral statement issued by us giving authority to operate or provide service.


*International Communications Filing System.* The International Communications Filing System (ICFS) is a database, application filing system, and processing system for all International and Satellite services. ICFS supports electronic filing of many applications and related documents in the Space Bureau and Office of International Affairs, and provides public access to this information.


*International services.* All international services authorized under this part and parts 63 and 64 of this chapter.


*Satellite services.* All satellite services authorized under part 25 of this chapter.


*Satellite Space Station Applications (other than DBS and DARS) and Applications for Earth Stations to Access a Non-U.S. Satellite Not Currently Authorized to Provide the Proposed Service in the Proposed Frequencies in the United States.* We consider a Satellite Space Station application (other than DBS and DARS) and an Application for an Earth Station to Access a Non-U.S. Satellite Not Currently Authorized to Provide the Proposed Service in the Proposed Frequencies in the United States officially filed the moment you file them through ICFS. The system tracks the date and time of filing (to the millisecond). For purposes of the queue discussed in § 25.158 of this chapter, we will base the order of the applications in the queue on the date and time the applications are filed, rather than the “Official Filing Date” as defined here.


*Submission ID.* The Submission ID is the confirmation number you receive from ICFS once you have successfully filed your application. It is also the number we use to match your filing to your payment.


*Us.* In this subpart, “us” refers to the Commission.


*We.* In this subpart, “we” refers to the Commission.


*You.* In this subpart, “you” refers to applicants, licensees, your representatives, or other entities authorized to provide services.
