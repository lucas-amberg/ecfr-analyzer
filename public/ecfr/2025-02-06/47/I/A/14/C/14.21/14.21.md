# ยง 14.21   Performance Objectives.

(a) *Generally.* Manufacturers and service providers shall ensure that equipment and services covered by this part are accessible, usable, and compatible as those terms are defined in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.


(b) *Accessible.* The term accessible shall mean that:


(1) Input, control, and mechanical functions shall be locatable, identifiable, and operable in accordance with each of the following, assessed independently:


(i) *Operable without vision.* Provide at least one mode that does not require user vision.


(ii) *Operable with low vision and limited or no hearing.* Provide at least one mode that permits operation by users with visual acuity between 20/70 and 20/200, without relying on audio output.


(iii) *Operable with little or no color perception.* Provide at least one mode that does not require user color perception.


(iv) *Operable without hearing.* Provide at least one mode that does not require user auditory perception.


(v) *Operable with limited manual dexterity.* Provide at least one mode that does not require user fine motor control or simultaneous actions.


(vi) *Operable with limited reach and strength.* Provide at least one mode that is operable with user limited reach and strength.


(vii) *Operable with a Prosthetic Device.* Controls shall be operable without requiring body contact or close body proximity.


(viii) *Operable without time-dependent controls.* Provide at least one mode that does not require a response time or allows response time to be by-passed or adjusted by the user over a wide range.


(ix) *Operable without speech.* Provide at least one mode that does not require user speech.


(x) *Operable with limited cognitive skills.* Provide at least one mode that minimizes the cognitive, memory, language, and learning skills required of the user.


(2) All information necessary to operate and use the product, including but not limited to, text, static or dynamic images, icons, labels, sounds, or incidental operating cues, [shall] comply with each of the following, assessed independently:


(i) *Availability of visual information.* Provide visual information through at least one mode in auditory form.


(ii) *Availability of visual information for low vision users.* Provide visual information through at least one mode to users with visual acuity between 20/70 and 20/200 without relying on audio.


(iii) *Access to moving text.* Provide moving text in at least one static presentation mode at the option of the user.


(iv) *Availability of auditory information.* Provide auditory information through at least one mode in visual form and, where appropriate, in tactile form. For interoperable video conferencing services, beginning January 12, 2027, provide at least one mode with captions that accurately and synchronously display the spoken communications in a video conference, and enable users to connect with third-party captioning services so that captions provided by such services appear on the requesting user's video conference screen. In this paragraph (b)(2)(iv):


(A) *Accurately* means that captioning matches the spoken words of a conversation, in the order spoken, verbatim, without summarizing or paraphrasing, sufficiently to enable a user to understand what is being said.


(B) *Synchronously* means that, to the greatest extent possible, the captions begin to appear at the time that the corresponding speech or sounds begin and end approximately when the speech or sounds end, are delivered fast enough to keep up with the speed of those words and sounds, and remain displayed long enough to be read by the user.






(v) *Availability of auditory information for people who are hard of hearing.* Provide audio or acoustic information, including any auditory feedback tones that are important for the use of the product, through at least one mode in enhanced auditory fashion (*i.e.,* increased amplification, increased signal-to-noise ratio, or combination).


(vi) *Prevention of visually-induced seizures.* Visual displays and indicators shall minimize visual flicker that might induce seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.


(vii) *Availability of audio cutoff.* Where a product delivers audio output through an external speaker, provide an industry standard connector for headphones or personal listening devices (e.g., phone-like handset or earcup) which cuts off the speaker(s) when used.


(viii) *Non-interference with hearing technologies.* Reduce interference to hearing technologies (including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and assistive listening devices) to the lowest possible level that allows a user to utilize the product.


(ix) *Hearing aid coupling.* Where a product delivers output by an audio transducer which is normally held up to the ear, provide a means for effective wireless coupling to hearing aids.


(3) *Real-Time Text.* Wireless interconnected VoIP services subject to this part and text-capable end user devices used with such services that do not themselves provide TTY functionality, may provide TTY connectability and signal compatibility pursuant to paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, or support real-time text communications, in accordance with 47 CFR part 67.


(4) *Interoperable Video Conferencing Service.* In addition to the other requirements of this section, beginning January 12, 2027, interoperable video conferencing services and covered equipment and software used with such services shall:


(i) Enable the use of sign language interpretation provided by third parties, including the transmission of user requests for sign language interpretation to providers of video relay service and other entities and the provision of sufficient video quality to support sign language communication.


(ii) Provide user interface control functions that permit users to activate and adjust the display of captions, speakers, and signers and other features for which user control is necessary for accessibility. In this paragraph (ii):


(A) *Adjust the display of captions* means that a video conference participant can alter the size, font, and on-screen location of captions and adjust the color and opacity of both the captions and the caption background.


(B) *Adjust the display of speakers and signers* means that video conference participants can minimize or hide extraneous windows, expand the windows of their choice, or relocate particular windows; and edit their own display names before or after joining a video conference.














(c) *Usable.* The term usable shall mean that individuals with disabilities have access to the full functionality and documentation for the product, including instructions, product information (including accessible feature information), documentation and technical support functionally equivalent to that provided to individuals without disabilities.


(d) *Compatible.* The term *compatible* shall mean compatible with peripheral devices and specialized customer premises equipment, and in compliance with the following provisions, as applicable:


(1) *External electronic access to all information and control mechanisms.* Information needed for the operation of products (including output, alerts, icons, on-line help, and documentation) shall be available in a standard electronic text format on a cross-industry standard port and all input to and control of a product shall allow for real time operation by electronic text input into a cross-industry standard external port and in cross-industry standard format. The cross-industry standard port shall not require manipulation of a connector by the user.


(2) *Connection point for external audio processing devices.* Products providing auditory output shall provide the auditory signal at a standard signal level through an industry standard connector.


(3) *TTY connectability.* Products that provide a function allowing voice communication and which do not themselves provide a TTY functionality shall provide a standard non-acoustic connection point for TTYs. It shall also be possible for the user to easily turn any microphone on and off to allow the user to intermix speech with TTY use.


(4) *TTY signal compatibility.* Products, including those providing voice communication functionality, shall support use of all cross-manufacturer non-proprietary standard signals used by TTYs.


(5) *TTY Support Exemption.* Interconnected and non-interconnected VoIP services subject to this part that are provided over wireless IP facilities and equipment are not required to provide TTY connectability and TTY signal compatibility if such services and equipment support real-time text, in accordance with 47 CFR part 67.
