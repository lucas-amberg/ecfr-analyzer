# § 15.201   Equipment authorization requirement.

(a) Intentional radiators operated as carrier current systems, devices operated under the provisions of §§ 15.211, 15.213, and 15.221, and devices operating below 490 kHz in which all emissions are at least 40 dB below the limits in § 15.209 are subject to Suppliers Declaration of Conformity pursuant to the procedures in subpart J of part 2 of this chapter prior to marketing.


(b) Except as otherwise exempted in paragraph (c) of this section and in § 15.23, all intentional radiators operating under the provisions of this part shall be certified by the Telecommunication Certification Bodies pursuant to the procedures in subpart J of part 2 of this chapter prior to marketing.


(c) For devices such as perimeter protection systems which, in accordance with § 15.31(d), are required to be measured at the installation site, each application for certification must be accompanied by a statement indicating that the system has been tested at three installations and found to comply at each installation. Until such time as certification is granted, a given installation of a system that was measured for the submission for certification will be considered to be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the marketing regulations in subpart I of part 2 of this chapter, if tests at that installation show the system to be in compliance with the relevant technical requirements. Similarly, where measurements must be performed on site for equipment subject to Supplier's Declaration of Conformity, a given installation that has been found compliant with the applicable standards will be considered to be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the marketing regulations in subpart I of part 2 of this chapter.


(d) For perimeter protection systems operating in the frequency bands allocated to television broadcast stations operating under part 73 of this chapter, the holder of the grant of certification must test each installation prior to initiation of normal operation to verify compliance with the technical standards and must maintain a list of all installations and records of measurements. For perimeter protection systems operating outside of the frequency bands allocated to television broadcast stations, upon receipt of a grant of certification, further testing of the same or similar type of system or installation is not required.
