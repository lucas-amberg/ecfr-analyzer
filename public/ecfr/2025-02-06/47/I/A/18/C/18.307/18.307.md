# § 18.307   Conduction limits.

For the following equipment, when designed to be connected to the public utility (AC) power line the radio frequency voltage that is conducted back onto the AC power line on any frequency or frequencies shall not exceed the limits in the following tables. Compliance with the provisions of this paragraph shall be based on the measurement of the radio frequency voltage between each power line and ground at the power terminal using a 50 μH/50 ohms line impedance stabilization network (LISN). 


(a) All Induction cooking ranges and ultrasonic equipment: 


(b) All other part 18 consumer devices: 


(c) RF lighting devices:


(d) If testing with a quasi-peak detector demonstrates that the equipment complies with the average limits specified in the appropriate table in this section, additional testing to demonstrate compliance using an average detector is not required. 


(e) These conduction limits shall apply only outside of the frequency bands specified in § 18.301. 


(f) For ultrasonic equipment, compliance with the conducted limits shall preclude the need to show compliance with the field strength limits below 30 MHz unless requested by the Commission. 


(g) The tighter limits shall apply at the boundary between two frequency ranges.
