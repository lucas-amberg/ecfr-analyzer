# § 2.106   Table of Frequency Allocations.

(a) *Allocation Table.* The Table of Frequency Allocations (Allocation Table) consists of the International Table of Frequency Allocations (International Table), the United States Table of Frequency Allocations (United States Table), and the FCC rule part(s) cross references as described in §§ 2.104 and 2.105, respectively. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations are described in § 2.100. The definitions of terms and acronyms used in the Allocation Table are specified in § 2.1. The footnotes to the Allocation Table are listed in ascending numerical order in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section; however, in some cases, a letter(s) has/have been appended to the digit(s) of a footnote number in order to preserve the sequential order.


























(b) *International footnotes.* International footnotes, each in the format “5.” followed by one or more digits, denote stipulations applicable in the relationship between the United States and other nations and thus appear at a minimum in the International Table. Where an international footnote is applicable, without modification, to both Federal and non-Federal operations, the footnote is placed in both the Federal Table and the non-Federal Table (columns 4 and 5) and the international footnote is binding on both Federal users and non-Federal licensees. If, however, an international footnote pertains to a service allocated only for Federal or non-Federal use, the international footnote will be placed only in the relevant Table. Annex, Appendix, Article, No., and Resolution are cross references to provisions in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations (see § 2.100 for descriptions of the structure of the ITU Radio Regulations and the terms and abbreviations used in the international footnotes). The ITU-R Recommendations referenced in certain of the international footnotes are available at *https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REC.* The list of international footnotes follows:

(431) US431B The band 3450-3550 MHz is allocated on a primary basis to the Federal radiolocation service and to the non-Federal fixed and mobile, except aeronautical mobile, services on a nationwide basis. Federal operations in the band 3450-3550 MHz shall not cause harmful interference to non-Federal operations, except under the following circumstances.


(i) *Cooperative Planning Areas.* Cooperative Planning Areas (CPAs) are geographic locations in which non-Federal operations shall coordinate with Federal systems in the band to deploy non-Federal operations in a manner that shall not cause harmful interference to Federal systems operating in the band. In addition, operators of non-Federal stations may be required to modify their operations (e.g., reduce power, filtering, adjust antenna pointing angles, shielding, *etc.*) to protect Federal operations against harmful interference and to avoid, where possible, interference and potential damage to the non-Federal operators' systems. In these areas, non-Federal operations may not claim interference protection from Federal systems. Federal and non-Federal operators may reach mutually acceptable operator-to-operator agreements to permit more extensive non-Federal use by identifying and mutually agreeing upon a technical approach that mitigates the interference risk to Federal operations. To the extent possible, Federal use in CPAs will be chosen to minimize operational impact on non-Federal users. Table 22 to this paragraph (c)(431) identifies the locations of CPAs, including, for information, those with high powered Federal operations. CPAs may also be Periodic Use Areas as described below. Coordination between Federal users and non-Federal licensees in CPAs shall be consistent with rules and procedures established by the FCC and NTIA.


(ii) *Periodic Use Areas.* Periodic Use Areas (PUAs) are geographic locations in which non-Federal operations in the band shall not cause harmful interference to Federal systems operating in the band for episodic periods. During these times and in these areas, Federal users will require interference protection from non-Federal operations. Operators of non-Federal stations may be required to temporarily modify their operations (e.g., reduce power, filtering, adjust antenna pointing angles, shielding, *etc.*) to protect Federal operations from harmful interference, which may include restrictions on non-Federal stations' ability to radiate at certain locations during specific periods of time. During such episodic use, non-Federal users in PUAs must alter their operations to avoid harmful interference to Federal systems' temporary use of the band, and during such times, non-Federal operations may not claim interference protection from Federal systems. Federal and non-Federal operators may reach mutually acceptable operator-to-operator agreements such that a Federal operator may not need to activate a PUA if a mutually agreeable technical approach mitigates the interference risk to Federal operations. To the extent possible, Federal use in PUAs will be chosen to minimize operational impact on non-Federal users. Coordination between Federal users and non-Federal licensees in PUAs shall be consistent with rules and procedures established by the FCC and NTIA. While all PUAs are co-located with CPAs, the exact geographic area used during periodic use may differ from the co-located CPA. The geographic locations of PUAs are identified in table 18 to this paragraph (c)(431). Restrictions and authorizations for the CPAs remain in effect during periodic use unless specifically relieved in the coordination process.


(iii) For the CPA at Little Rock, AR, after approximately 12 months from the close of the auction, non-Federal operations shall coordinate with Federal systems in only the 3450-3490 MHz band segment and the 3490-3550 MHz band segment will be available for non-federal use without coordination. At Fort Bragg, NC, non-Federal operations shall coordinate with Federal systems in only the 3450-3490 MHz band segment.


(iv) Table 22 to this paragraph (c)(431) identifies the coordinates for the location of each CPA and PUA. An area may be represented as either a polygon made up of several corresponding coordinates or a circle represented by a center point and a radius. If a CPA has a corresponding PUA, the PUA coordinates are provided. A location marked with an asterisk (*) indicates a high-power federal radiolocation facility. If a location includes a Shipboard Electronic Systems Evaluation Facility (SESEF) attached to a homeport, it specifies the associated SESEF.

Federal operations, other than airborne radiolocation systems, shall be protected consistent with the procedures set forth in §§ 96.15 and 96.67 of this chapter.


(ii) Non-Federal fixed and mobile stations shall not claim protection from Federal airborne radar systems.
