# § 2.805   Operation of radio frequency devices prior to equipment authorization.

(a*) General rule.* A radio frequency device may not be operated prior to equipment authorization unless the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e), of this section are meet. Radio frequency devices operated under these provisions may not be marketed (as defined in § 2.803(a)) except as provided elsewhere in this chapter. In addition, the provisions of subpart K continue to apply to imported radio frequency devices.


(b) Operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted under the authority of an experimental radio service authorization issued under part 5 of this chapter.


(c) Operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted for experimentation or compliance testing of a device that is fully contained within an anechoic chamber or a Faraday cage.


(d) For devices designed to operate solely under parts 15, 18, or 95 of this chapter without a station license, operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted under the following conditions, so long as devices are either rendered inoperable or retrieved at the conclusion of such operation:


(1) The radio frequency device shall be operated in compliance with existing Commission rules, waivers of such rules that are in effect at the time of operation, or rules that have been adopted by the Commission but that have not yet become effective; and


(2) The radio frequency device shall be operated for at least one of these purposes:


(i) Demonstrations at a trade show or an exhibition, provided a notice containing the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iii) is displayed in a conspicuous location on, or immediately adjacent to, the device; or all prospective buyers at the trade show or exhibition are advised in writing that the equipment is subject to the FCC rules and that the equipment will comply with the appropriate rules before delivery to the buyer or to centers of distribution; or


(ii) Evaluation of performance and determination of customer acceptability, during developmental, design, or pre-production states. If the device is not operated at the manufacturer's facilities, it must be labeled with the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iii), and in the case of an evaluation kit, the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iv)(C).


(e) Operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted under either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section so long as devices are either rendered inoperable or retrieved at the conclusion of such operation:


(1) The radio frequency device shall be operated in compliance with existing Commission rules, waivers of such rules that are in effect at the time of operation, or rules that have been adopted by the Commission but that have not yet become effective; and


(i) Under the authority of a service license (only in the bands for which that service licensee holds a license) provided that the licensee grants permission and the licensee continues to remain responsible for complying with all of the operating conditions and requirements associated with its license; or


(ii) Under a grant of special temporary authorization.


(2) The radio frequency device shall be operated at or below the maximum level specified in the table in § 15.209(a) of this chapter for at least one of these purposes:


(i) Demonstrations at a trade show or an exhibition, provided a notice containing the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iii) is displayed in a conspicuous location on, or immediately adjacent to, the device; or all prospective buyers at the trade show or exhibition are advised in writing that the equipment is subject to the FCC rules and that the equipment will comply with the appropriate rules before delivery to the buyer or to centers of distribution; or


(ii) Evaluation of performance and determination of customer acceptability, during developmental, design, or pre-production states. If the device is not operated at the manufacturer's facilities, it must be labeled with the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iii), and in the case of an evaluation kit, the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iv)(C).
