(c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use or make reference to Supplier's Declaration of Conformity in a deceptive or misleading manner or convey the impression that such Supplier's Declaration of Conformity reflects more than a determination by the manufacturer, importer, integrator, or responsible party, as defined in ยง 2.909, that the device or product has been shown to be capable of complying with the applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.
