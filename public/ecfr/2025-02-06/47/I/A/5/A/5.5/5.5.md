*Emergency notification providers.* All participants in the Emergency Alert System, as identified in section 11.1 of this chapter.


*Experimental radio service.* A service in which radio waves are employed for purposes of experimentation in the radio art or for purposes of providing essential communications for research projects that could not be conducted without the benefit of such communications.


*Experimental station.* A station utilizing radio waves in experiments with a view to the development of science or technique.


*Harmful interference.* Any radiation or induction that endangers the functioning of a radionavigation or safety service, or obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio service operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations and other provisions of part 2 of this chapter.

*Market trial.* A program designed to evaluate product performance and customer acceptability prior to the production stage, and typically requires testing a specific product under expected use conditions to evaluate actual performance and effectiveness.


*Open Area Test Site.* A site for electromagnetic measurements that has a reflective ground plane, and is characterized by open, flat terrain at a distance far enough away from buildings, electric lines, fences, trees, underground cables, pipelines, and other potential reflective objects, so that the effects due to such objects are negligible.


*Person.* An individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, corporation, or state or local government.
