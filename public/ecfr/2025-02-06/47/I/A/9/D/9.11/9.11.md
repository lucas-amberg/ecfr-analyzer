# § 9.11   E911 Service.

(a) *Before January 6, 2021, for fixed services and before January 6, 2022, for non-fixed services*—(1) *Scope.* The following requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section are only applicable to providers of interconnected VoIP services, except those interconnected VoIP services that fulfill each paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of the definition of interconnected VoIP service in § 9.3, and also permit users generally to terminate calls to the public switched telephone network. Further, the following requirements apply only to 911 calls placed by users whose Registered Location is in a geographic area served by a Wireline E911 Network (which, as defined in § 9.3, includes a selective router).

(i) Interconnected VoIP service providers must, as a condition of providing service to a consumer, provide that consumer with E911 service as described in this section;


(ii) Interconnected VoIP service providers must transmit all 911 calls, as well as ANI and the caller's Registered Location for each call, to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller's Registered Location and that has been designated for telecommunications carriers pursuant to § 9.4, provided that “all 911 calls” is defined as “any voice communication initiated by an interconnected VoIP user dialing 911;”


(iii) All 911 calls must be routed through the use of ANI and, if necessary, pseudo-ANI, via the dedicated Wireline E911 Network; and


(iv) The Registered Location must be available to the appropriate PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority from or through the appropriate automatic location information (ALI) database.


(3) *Service Level Obligation.* Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if a PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority is not capable of receiving and processing either ANI or location information, an interconnected VoIP service provider need not provide such ANI or location information; however, nothing in this paragraph affects the obligation under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section of an interconnected VoIP service provider to transmit via the Wireline E911 Network all 911 calls to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller's Registered Location and that has been designated for telecommunications carriers pursuant to § 9.4.

Any method used must allow an end user to update the Registered Location at will and in a timely manner.


(5) *Customer notification.* Each interconnected VoIP service provider shall:


(i) Specifically advise every subscriber, both new and existing, prominently and in plain language, of the circumstances under which E911 service may not be available through the interconnected VoIP service or may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional E911 service. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, relocation of the end user's IP-compatible CPE, use by the end user of a non-native telephone number, broadband connection failure, loss of electrical power, and delays that may occur in making a Registered Location available in or through the ALI database;


(ii) Obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgement by every subscriber, both new and existing, of having received and understood the advisory described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section; and


(iii) Either—
