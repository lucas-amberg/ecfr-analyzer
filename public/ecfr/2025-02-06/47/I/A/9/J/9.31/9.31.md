(c) *Originating service providers' petitions challenging 911 Authorities' requests.* Within 60 days of the receipt of a Phase 1 or 2 request from a 911 Authority, an originating service provider may submit a petition to the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau asserting that the 911 Authority's request does not satisfy a condition set forth in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section for a Phase 1 or Phase 2 valid request. The Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau may review the petition and determine whether to pause the implementation deadline for that originating service provider, affirm the request of the 911 Authority as valid, or take other action as necessary.


(1) The petition process shall be subject to the procedural requirements set forth in §§ 1.41, 1.45, and 1.47 of this chapter.


(2) The petition must be in the form of an affidavit signed by a director or officer of the originating service provider, documenting:


(i) The basis for the originating service provider's assertion that the 911 Authority's request does not satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section for a Phase 1 or Phase 2 valid request.


(ii) Each of the specific steps the originating service provider has taken to implement the Phase 1 requirements set forth in § 9.29(a) or the Phase 2 requirements set forth in § 9.29(b).


(iii) The basis for the originating service provider's assertion that it cannot make further implementation efforts until the 911 Authority satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section for a Phase 1 or Phase 2 valid request.


(iv) The specific steps that remain to be completed by the originating service provider and, to the extent known, the 911 Authority or other parties before the originating service provider can implement the Phase 1 requirements set forth in § 9.29(a) or the Phase 2 requirements set forth in § 9.29(b).


(3) All affidavits must be correct. The originating service provider's director or officer who signs the affidavit has the duty to personally determine that the affidavit is correct. If the affidavit is incorrect, he or she, as well as the originating service provider, may be subject to enforcement action.


(4) An originating service provider may not file an inadequate or incomplete petition. If an originating service provider's petition is inadequate and/or incomplete and the originating service provider has not met its obligations as set forth in § 9.29(a) or (b) at the time of the relevant deadline, the originating service provider may be considered noncompliant with the applicable rules as if the petition had not been filed.


(5) An originating service provider that challenges a 911 Authority's valid request must describe all steps taken toward implementing the Phase 1 requirements set forth in § 9.29(a) or the Phase 2 requirements set forth in § 9.29(b) that are not dependent on the readiness of the 911 Authority.


(6) The 911 Authority may file an opposition to the originating service provider's petition and the originating service provider may file a reply to the opposition in accordance with § 1.45 of this chapter. A copy of the document (petition, opposition, or reply) must be served on the other party (911 Authority or originating service provider) at the time of the filing in accordance with § 1.47 of this chapter.


(d) Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section may contain information collection and recordkeeping requirements that require review by the Office of Management and Budget.
