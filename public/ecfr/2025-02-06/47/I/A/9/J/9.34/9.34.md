# § 9.34   Modification of NG911 requirements by mutual agreement.

(a) Nothing in this subpart shall prevent 911 Authorities and originating service providers from establishing, by mutual consent, terms different from the requirements set forth in §§ 9.29 through 9.33.


(b) If a 911 Authority and an originating service provider enter into an agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, within 30 days of the date when any such agreement is executed, the originating service provider must notify the Commission of the agreement. The notification must identify with specificity each requirement in the rules that is impacted by the agreement and must state with specificity how the terms of the agreement differ from each impacted rule. The same notification is required if the 911 Authority and originating service provider amend, modify, or terminate the agreement.


(c) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may contain information collection and recordkeeping requirements that require review by the Office of Management and Budget. Compliance with those paragraphs will not be required until this paragraph (c) is removed or contains a compliance date.
