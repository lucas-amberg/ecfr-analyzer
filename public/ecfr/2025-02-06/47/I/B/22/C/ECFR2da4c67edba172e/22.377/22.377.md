# ยง 22.377   Certification of transmitters.

Transmitters used in the Public Mobile Services, including those used with signal boosters, in-building radiation systems and cellular repeaters, must be certificated for use in the radio services regulated under this part. Transmitters must be certificated when the station is ready for service, not necessarily at the time of filing an application. The FCC may list as certificated only transmitters that are capable of meeting all technical requirements of the rules governing the service in which they will operate. The procedure for obtaining certification is set forth in part 2 of this chapter.
