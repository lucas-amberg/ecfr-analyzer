# § 24.133   Emission limits.

(a) The power of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P), as measured in accordance with § 24.132(f), in accordance with the following schedule:


(1) For transmitters authorized a bandwidth greater than 10 kHz: 


(i) On any frequency outside the authorized bandwidth and removed from the edge of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f_d_ in kHz) of up to and including 40 kHz: at least 116 Log_10_ ((f_d_ + 10)/6.1) decibels or 50 plus 10 Log_10_ (P) decibels or 70 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation; 


(ii) On any frequency outside the authorized bandwidth and removed from the edge of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f_d_ in kHz) of more than 40 kHz: at least 43 + 10 Log_10_ (P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation.


(2) For transmitters authorized a bandwidth of 10 kHz: 


(i) On any frequency outside the authorized bandwidth and removed from the edge of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f_d_ in kHz) of up to and including 20 kHz: at least 116 × Log_10_ ((f_d_ + 5)/3.05) decibels or 50 + 10 × Log_10_ (P) decibels or 70 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation; 


(ii) On any frequency outside the authorized bandwidth and removed from the edge of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (f_d_ in kHz) of more than 20 kHz: at least 43 + 10 Log _10_ (P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation. 


(b) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or average values provided they are expressed in the same parameters as the transmitter power. 


(c) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section. 


(d) The following minimum spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth settings will be used: 300 Hz when showing compliance with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i) of this section; and 30 kHz when showing compliance with paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
