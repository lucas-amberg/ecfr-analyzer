# ยง 25.133   Period of construction; certification of commencement of operation.

(a) An earth station, or network of blanket-licensed earth stations, must be brought into operation within the longest of the time periods below, unless the Commission determines otherwise:


(1) For an earth station authorized to communicate with a GSO FSS space station in the 3600-4200 MHz band (space-to-Earth) operating outside of CONUS, or in the 5850-6725 MHz band (Earth-to-space), within one year from the date of the license grant;


(2) For any other earth station or network of earth stations, within one year from the date of the license grant or six months after the bringing into operation of a GSO space station, or NGSO system under ยง 25.164(b)(1), with which the earth station or earth station network was authorized to communicate when it was licensed, as notified under ยง 25.173(b).


(b)(1) Each initial license for a transmitting earth station or modified license authorizing operation of an additional transmitting antenna, except for blanket licenses, will also specify as a condition therein that upon completion of construction, the licensee must file with the Commission a certification containing the following information:


(i) The name of the licensee;


(ii) File number of the application;


(iii) Call sign of the antenna;


(iv) Date of the license;


(v) A certification that the facility as authorized has been completed and that each antenna has been tested and found to perform within authorized gain patterns or off-axis EIRP density levels; and


(vi) The date when the earth station became operational.


(vii) A statement that the station will remain operational during the license period unless the license is submitted for cancellation.


(2) For FSS earth stations authorized under a blanket license, the licensee must notify the Commission when the earth station network commences operation. The notification should include the information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section and a certification that each hub antenna, and a type of antenna used in remote stations in the network, has been tested and found to perform within authorized gain patterns or off-axis EIRP density levels. For any type of antenna whose performance was not certified when the network commenced operation, the licensee must submit the information and certification stated above for the antenna type when it is first deployed.


(c) [Reserved]


(d) Each receiving earth station licensed or registered pursuant to ยง 25.115(b) must be constructed and placed into service within 6 months after coordination has been completed. Each licensee or registrant must file with the Commission a certification that the facility is completed and operating as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, with the exception of certification of antenna patterns.
