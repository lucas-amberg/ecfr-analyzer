# § 25.146   Licensing and operating provisions for NGSO FSS space stations.

(a) An NGSO FSS applicant proposing to operate in the 10.7-30 GHz frequency range must certify that it will comply with:


(1) Any applicable power flux-density levels in Article 21, Section V, Table 21-4 of the ITU Radio Regulations (incorporated by reference, § 25.108), except:


(i) in the 19.3-19.4 GHz and 19.6-19.7 GHz bands, applicants must certify that they will comply with the ITU power flux-density limits governing NGSO FSS systems in the 17.7-19.3 GHz band; and


(ii) in the 17.3-17.7 GHz band, applicants must certify that they will comply with the ITU power flux-density limits governing NGSO FSS systems in the 17.7-17.8 GHz band; and


(2) Any applicable equivalent power flux-density levels in Article 22, Section II, and Resolution 76 of the ITU Radio Regulations (both incorporated by reference, § 25.108), except that for operations in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band, applicants must certify that they will comply with the ITU equivalent power flux-density limits applicable to NGSO FSS system operations in the 17.8-18.4 GHz band.


(b) [Reserved]

(c) Prior to the initiation of service, an NGSO FSS operator licensed or holding a market access authorization to operate in the 10.7-30 GHz frequency range must receive a “favorable” or “qualified favorable” finding by the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau, in accordance with Resolution 85 of the ITU Radio Regulations (incorporated by reference, § 25.108), regarding its compliance with applicable ITU EPFD limits. In addition, a market access holder in these bands must:


(1) Communicate the ITU finding to the Commission; and


(2) Submit the input data files used for the ITU validation software.


(d) Coordination will be required between NGSO FSS systems and GSO FSS earth stations in the 10.7-12.75 GHz band when:


(1) The GSO satellite network has receive earth stations with earth station antenna maximum isotropic gain greater than or equal to 64 dBi; G/T of 44 dB/K or higher; and emission bandwidth of 250 MHz; and


(2)The EPFD_down_ radiated by the NGSO satellite system into the GSO specific receive earth station, either within the U.S. for domestic service or any points outside the U.S. for international service, as calculated using the ITU software for examining compliance with EPFD limits exceeds—174.5 dB(W/(m
2/40kHz)) for any percentage of time for NGSO systems with all satellites only operating at or below 2500 km altitude, or—202 dB(W/(m
2/40kHz)) for any percentage of time for NGSO systems with any satellites operating above 2500 km altitude.


(e) An NGSO FSS licensee or market access recipient must ensure that ephemeris data for its constellation is available to all operators of authorized, in-orbit, co-frequency satellite systems in a manner that is mutually acceptable.
