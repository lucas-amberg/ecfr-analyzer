(a) Space launch stations are restricted to the following uses:


(1) *2025-2110 MHz band.* The use of Space Launch Services licenses in the 2025-2110 MHz band is restricted to ground-to-launch vehicle telecommand uses necessary to support space launch operations.


(2) *2200-2290 MHz band.* The use of Space Launch Services licenses in the 2200-2290 MHz band is restricted to launch vehicle-to-ground communications associated with telemetry and tracking operations.


(b) Telemetry, tracking, and telecommand functions permissible as space launch operations include, but are not limited to:


(1) Pre-launch testing, such as pre-flight checks, ground testing, and telemetry;


(2) Vehicle tracking, including the transmission of parameter data from a launch vehicle to ground;


(3) Telecommand signals for propulsive maneuvering of a launch vehicle and separation of payload from launch vehicle; and


(4) Telecommand signals for propulsive maneuvering of a reentry vehicle for return and recovery.


(c) The use of Space Launch Services licenses for on-orbit communications after a launch vehicle separates from its payload are not permitted, provided that a space launch station may be used for telemetry, tracking, and telecommand activities for the incidental orbiting of a launch vehicle before or after it has separated from its payload. The use of Space Launch Services licenses for such incidental orbiting are permitted only to the extent necessary for space launch operations.
