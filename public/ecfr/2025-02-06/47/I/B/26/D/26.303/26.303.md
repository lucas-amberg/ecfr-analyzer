# § 26.303   Power limits.

(a) *2025-2110 MHz.* The equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) transmitted in any direction towards the horizon by an earth station in the 2025-2110 MHz band of the Space Launch Services shall not (with limited exceptions) exceed the following limits:


(1) +40 dBW in any 4 kHz band for _u_ ≤0°;


(2) +40+3_u_ dBW in any 4 kHz band for 0°< _u_ ≤5°; and


(3) Where _u_ is the angle of elevation of the horizon viewed from the center of radiation of the antenna of the earth station and measured in degrees as positive above the horizontal plane and negative below it.


(b) *2200-2290 MHz.* During the first stage of a launch, the EIRP of any station in the 2200-2290 MHz band of the Space Launch Services shall not exceed 25 Watts and the transmitter output power shall not exceed 25 Watts. In addition, the power flux-density at the Earth's surface produced by emissions from a transmitter operating after the first stage of a launch for all conditions and for all methods of modulation shall not exceed the following limits:


(1) −154 dB(W/m2) in any 4 kHz for angles of arrival less than 5° above the horizontal plane;


(2) −154 + 0.5 (δ−5) dB(W/m2) in any 4 kHz for angles of arrival δ (degrees) between 5° and 25° above the horizontal plane; and


(3) −144 dB(W/m2) in any 4 kHz for angles of arrival between 25° and 90° above the horizontal plane.
