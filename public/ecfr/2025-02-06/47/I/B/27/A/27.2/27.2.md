# ยง 27.2   Permissible communications.

(a) *Miscellaneous wireless communications services.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (d) of this section and subject to technical and other rules contained in this part, a licensee in the frequency bands specified in ยง 27.5 may provide any services for which its frequency bands are allocated, as set forth in the non-Federal Government column of the Table of Allocations in ยง 2.106 of this chapter (column 5). 


(b) *775-776 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands.* Operators in the 775-776 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands may not employ a cellular system architecture. A cellular system architecture is defined, for purposes of this part, as one that consists of many small areas or cells (segmented from a larger geographic service area), each of which uses its own base station, to enable frequencies to be reused at relatively short distances.


(c) *Satellite DARS.* Satellite digital audio radio service (DARS) may be provided using the 2310-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz bands. Satellite DARS service shall be provided in a manner consistent with part 25 of this chapter.

(e) *716-722 MHz and 722-728 MHz bands.* The 716-722 and 722-728 MHz frequencies may not be used for uplink transmission and must be used only for downlink transmissions.
