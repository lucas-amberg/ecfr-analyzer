*Documented complaint.* A complaint that a party is suffering from non-consensual interference. A documented complaint must contain a certification that the complainant has contacted the operator of the allegedly offending facility and tried to resolve the situation prior to filing. The complaint must then specify the nature of the interference, whether the interference is constant or intermittent, when the interference began and the site(s) most likely to be causing the interference. The complaint should be accompanied by a videotape or other evidence showing the effects of the interference. The complaint must contain a motion for a temporary order to have the interfering station cease transmitting. The complaint must be filed with the Secretary's office and served on the allegedly offending party.


*Educational Broadband Service (EBS).* A radiocommunication service licensed under this part for the frequency bands specified in § 27.5(i).

*National Geodetic Reference System (NGRS).* The name given to all geodetic control data contained in the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) data base. (Source: National Geodetic Survey, U.S. Department of Commerce)


*Point-to-point Broadband station.* A Broadband station that transmits a highly directional signal from a fixed transmitter location to a fixed receive location.


*Portable device.* Transmitters designed to be used within 20 centimeters of the body of the user.


*Post-auction transition period.* The 39-month period commencing upon the public release of the Channel Reassignment Public Notice as defined in § 73.3700(a) of this chapter.


*Public Safety Broadband Licensee.* The licensee of the Public Safety Broadband License in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. 


*Radiodetermination.* The determination of the position, velocity and/or other characteristics of an object, or the obtaining of information relating to these parameters, by means of the propagation properties of radio waves.


*Radiolocation.* Radiodetermination used for purposes other than those of radionavigation.


*Radiolocation land station.* A station in the radiolocation service not intended to be used while in motion.


*Radiolocation mobile station.* A station intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points.


*Radionavigation.* Radiodetermination used for the purpose of navigation, including obstruction warning.


*Remote control.* Operation of a station by a designated person at a control position from which the transmitter is not visible but where suitable control and telemetering circuits are provided which allow the performance of the essential functions that could be performed at the transmitter.


*Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (satellite DARS).* A radiocommunication service in which compact disc quality programming is digitally transmitted by one or more space stations.


*Sectorization.* The use of an antenna system at any broadband station, booster station and/or response station hub that is capable of simultaneously transmitting multiple signals over the same frequencies to different portions of the service area and/or simultaneously receiving multiple signals over the same frequencies from different portions of the service area.

*Temporary fixed broadband station.* A broadband station used for the transmission of material from temporary unspecified points to a broadband station.


*Time division multiple access (TDMA).* A multiple access technique whereby users share a transmission medium by being assigned and using (one-at-a-time) for a limited number of time division mulitplexed channels; implies that several transmitters use one channel for sending several bit streams.


*Time division multiplexing (TDM).* A multiplexing technique whereby two or more channels are derived from a transmission medium by dividing access to the medium into sequential intervals. Each channel has access to the entire bandwidth of the medium during its interval. This implies that one transmitter uses one channel to send several bit streams of information.


*Unattended operation.* Operation of a station by automatic means whereby the transmitter is turned on and off and performs its functions without attention by a designated person.


*Universal Licensing System.* The Universal Licensing System (ULS) is the consolidated database, application filing system, and processing system for all Wireless Radio Services. ULS supports electronic filing of all applications and related documents by applicants and licensees in the Wireless Radio Services, and provides public access to licensing information.
