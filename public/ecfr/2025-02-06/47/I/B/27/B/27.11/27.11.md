(i) Authorizations for Block C1, consisting of two paired channels of 6 megahertz each in the 746-752 MHz and 776-782 MHz bands, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(b)(2)(i).


(ii) Authorizations for Block C2, consisting of two paired channels of 5 megahertz each in the 752-757 MHz and 782-787 MHz bands, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(b)(2)(ii).


(d) *698-746 MHz band.* Initial authorizations for the 698-746 MHz band shall be for 6 or 12 megahertz of spectrum in accordance with § 27.5(c).


(1) Authorizations for Block A, consisting of two paired channels of 6 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(c)(1).


(2) Authorizations for Block B, consisting of two paired channels of 6 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(c)(2).


(3) Authorizations for Block C, consisting of two paired channels of 6 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(c)(2).


(4) Authorizations for Block D, consisting of an unpaired channel block of 6 megahertz, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(c)(3).


(5) Authorizations for Block E, consisting of an unpaired channel block of 6 megahertz, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(c)(1). 


(e) *1390-1392 MHz band.* Initial authorizations for the 1390-1392 MHz band shall be for 2 megahertz of spectrum in accordance with § 27.5(d). Authorizations will be based on Major Economic Areas (MEAs), as specified in § 27.6(d).


(f) *The paired 1392-1395 MHz and 1432-1435 MHz bands.* Initial authorizations for the paired 1392-1395 MHz and 1432-1435 MHz bands shall be for 3 megahertz of paired spectrum in accordance with § 27.5(e). Authorization for Blocks A and B will be based on Economic Areas Groupings (EAGs), as specified in § 27.6(e).


(g) *1670-1675 MHz band.* Initial authorizations for the 1670-1675 MHz band shall be for 5 megahertz of spectrum in accordance with § 27.5(f). Authorizations will be on a nationwide basis.


(h) [Reserved] 


(i) *1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands.* Initial authorizations for the 1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands shall be for 5 or 10 megahertz of spectrum in each band in accordance with § 27.5(h) of this part.


(1) Authorizations for Block A, consisting of two paired channels of 10 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(h)(1).


(2) Authorizations for Block B, consisting of two paired channels of 10 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(h)(2).


(3) Authorizations for Block C, consisting of two paired channels of 5 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(h)(2).


(4) Authorizations for Blocks D, consisting of two paired channels of 5 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(h)(3).


(5) Authorizations for Blocks E, consisting of two paired channels of 5 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(h)(3).


(6) Authorizations for Block F, consisting of two paired channels of 10 megahertz each, will be based on those geographic areas specified in § 27.6(h)(3).


(j) *1695-1710 MHz, 1755-1780 MHz and 2155-2180 MHz bands.* (1) Initial authorizations for the 1695-1710 MHz band shall be based on the frequency blocks specified in § 27.5(h)(3) and the corresponding service area specified in § 27.6(k)(2).


(2) Initial authorizations for the 1755-1780 MHz and 2155-2180 MHz shall be based on the paired frequency blocks specified in § 27.5(h)(1) and (2) and the corresponding service areas specified in § 27.6(k)(1) and (2).


(k) *600 MHz band.* Initial authorizations for the 600 MHz band will be based on Partial Economic Areas (PEAs), as specified in § 27.6(1), and, shall be paired channels that each consist of a 5 megahertz channel block in the 600 MHz downlink band (617-652 MHz), paired with a 5 megahertz channel block in the 600 MHz uplink band (663-698 MHz), based on the frequency blocks specified in § 27.5(l).


(l) *3700-3980 MHz band.* Authorizations for licenses in the 3.7 GHz Service will be based on Partial Economic Areas (PEAs), as specified in § 27.6(m), and the frequency sub-blocks specified in § 27.5(m).
