# § 27.15   Geographic partitioning and spectrum disaggregation.

(a) *Eligibility.* (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and disaggregation shall request from the Commission an authorization for partial assignment of a license pursuant to § 1.948.


(2) AWS and WCS licensees may apply to partition their licensed geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any time following the grant of their licenses. 


(b) *Technical Standards*—(1) *Partitioning.* In the case of partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to section 1.948 and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to the application. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).


(2) *Disaggregation.* Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.


(3) *Combined partitioning and disaggregation.* The Commission will consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.


(4) *Signal levels.* For purposes of partitioning and disaggregation, part 27 systems must be designed so as not to exceed the signal level specified for the particular spectrum block in § 27.55 at the licensee's service area boundary, unless the affected adjacent service area licensees have agreed to a different signal level. 


(c) *License term.* The license term for a partitioned license area and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original licensee's license term as provided for in § 27.13.
