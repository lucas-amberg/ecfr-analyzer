# ยง 27.1417   Reimbursement fund.

The Relocation Payment Clearinghouse will establish and administer an account that will fund the costs for the transition of this band to the 3.7 GHz Service after an auction for the 3.7 GHz Service concludes. Licensees in the 3.7 GHz Service shall pay their *pro rata* share of six months' worth of estimated transition costs into a reimbursement fund, administered by the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse, shortly after the auction and then every six months until the transition is complete. The Relocation Payment Clearinghouse shall draw from the reimbursement fund to pay approved, invoiced claims, consistent with ยง 27.1418. If the reimbursement fund does not have sufficient funds to pay approved claims before a six-month replenishment, the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse shall provide 3.7 GHz Service licensees with 30 days' notice of the additional *pro rata* shares they must contribute. At the end of the transition, the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse shall refund any unused amounts to 3.7 GHz Service licensees according to their *pro rata* shares.
