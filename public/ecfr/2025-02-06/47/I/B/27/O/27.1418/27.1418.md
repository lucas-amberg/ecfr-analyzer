(a) Each eligible space station operator is responsible for the payment of its own satellite transition costs until the auction winners have been announced.


(b) Licensees in the 3.7 GHz Service shall pay their *pro rata* share of:


(1) The reasonable costs of the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse and, in the event the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau selects the Relocation Coordinator, the services of the Relocation Coordinator and its staff;


(2) The actual relocation costs, provided that they are not unreasonable, for eligible space station operators and incumbent fixed service licensees; the actual transition costs, provided they are not unreasonable, associated with the necessary migration and filtering of incumbent earth stations;


(3) Any lump sum payments, if elected by incumbent earth station operators in lieu of actual relocation costs; and


(4) Specified accelerated relocation payments for space station operators that clear on an accelerated timeframe. Licensees in the 3.7 GHz Service shall be responsible for the full costs of space station transition, the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse, and, if selected and established by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, the Relocation Coordinator, based on their *pro rata* share of the total auction bids of each licensee's gross winning bids in the auction overall; they shall be responsible for incumbent earth station and incumbent fixed service transition costs in a Partial Economic Area based on their *pro rata* share of the total gross bids for that Partial Economic Area.


(c) Following the auction, and every six months until the close of the transition, licensees in the 3.7 GHz Service shall submit their portion of estimated transition costs to a reimbursement fund, and the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse will reimburse parties incurring transition costs. If actual costs exceed estimated costs, the Relocation Payment Clearinghouse shall perform a true-up for additional funds from 3.7 GHz Service licensees.


(d) If 3.7 GHz band license is relinquished to the Commission prior to all relocation cost reimbursements and accelerated relocation payments being paid, the remaining payments will be distributed among other similarly situated 3.7 GHz band licensees. If a new license is issued for the previously relinquished rights prior to final payments becoming due, the new 3.7 GHz band licensee will be responsible for the same *pro rata* share of relocation costs and accelerated relocation payments as the initial 3.7 GHz band license. If a 3.7 GHz band licensee sells its rights on the secondary market, the new 3.7 GHz band licensee will be obligated to fulfill all payment obligations associated with the license.
