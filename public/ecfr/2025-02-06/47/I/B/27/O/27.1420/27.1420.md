(a) For space station transition and Relocation Payment Clearinghouse costs, and in the event the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau selects a Relocation Coordinator pursuant to ยง 27.1413(a), Relocation Coordinator costs, the *pro rata* share of each flexible-use licensee will be the sum of the final clock phase prices (*P*) for the set of all license blocks that a bidder wins divided by the total final clock phase prices for all *N* license blocks sold in the auction. To determine a licensee's reimbursement obligation (*RO*), that *pro rata* share would then be multiplied by the total eligible reimbursement costs (*RC*). Mathematically, this is represented as:


(b) For incumbent earth stations and fixed service incumbent licensee transition costs, a flexible-use licensee's *pro rata* share will be determined on a PEA-specific basis, based on the final clock phase prices for the license blocks it won in each PEA. To calculate the *pro rata* share for incumbent earth station transition costs in a given PEA, the same formula identified in ยง 27.1412(a) will be used, except *I* is the set of licenses a bidder won in the PEA, *N* is the total blocks sold in the PEA and *RC* is the PEA-specific earth station and fixed service relocation costs.


(c) For the Phase I accelerated relocation payments, the *pro rata* share of each flexible use licensee of the 3.7 to 3.8 MHz in the 46 PEAs that are cleared by December 5, 2021, will be the sum of the final clock phase prices (*P*) that the licensee won divided by the total final clock phase prices for all *M* license blocks sold in those 46 PEAs. To determine a licensee's *RO* the *pro rata* share would then be multiplied by the total accelerated relocation payment due for Phase I, *A1.* Mathematically, this is represented as:


(d) For Phase II accelerated relocation payments, the *pro rata* share of each flexible use licensee will be the sum of the final clock phase prices (*P*) that the licensee won in the entire auction, divided by the total final clock phase prices for all *N* license blocks sold in the auction. To determine a licensee's *RO* the *pro rata* share would then be multiplied by the total accelerated relocation payment due for Phase II, *A2.* Mathematically, this is represented as:
