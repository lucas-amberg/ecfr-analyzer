# ยง 27.1604   Reimbursement of relocation expenses of non-Federal radiolocation incumbents.

(a) *Relocation reimbursement contribution.* Each entity granted an initial license (not a renewal) in the 3.45 GHz Service (Licensee) must pay a *pro rata* portion to reimburse the costs incurred by authorized non-Federal, secondary radiolocation licensees for relocating from the 3.3-3.55 GHz band. These costs include the cost of a clearinghouse's administration of the reimbursement, which the radiolocation licensees will pay initially and include in their reimbursable costs.


(b) *Pro rata share.* A Licensee's *pro rata* share of relocation costs will be determined by dividing the total actual costs of such relocation, as approved by the clearinghouse selected pursuant to ยง 27.1605, by the total number of 3.45 GHz Service licenses granted, multiplied by the number of such licenses the Licensee will hold.


(c) *Timing of payment.* A Licensee's relocation reimbursement contribution share must be paid to the clearinghouse by the date(s) and subject to procedures specified by public notice.
