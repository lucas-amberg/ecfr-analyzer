# ยง 27.1607   Information sharing for time division duplex synchronization.

(a) 3.45 GHz Service licensees must provide information to requesting Citizens Broadband Radio Service (part 96 of this chapter) operators to enable time division duplex (TDD) synchronization. Negotiations over the information must be conducted in good faith, with the goal of enabling synchronization between the relevant systems.


(1) A Citizens Broadband Radio Service operator, whether a Priority Access Licensee or a General Authorized Access user (ยง 96.1(b) of this chapter), may request information from a 3.45 GHz Service licensee to enable cross-service TDD synchronization if it provides service, or intends to provide service, in the same or adjacent geographic area as a 3.45 GHz Service licensee.


(2) Upon request by an eligible Citizens Broadband Radio Service operator, the 3.45 GHz Service licensee must provide sufficient technical information to allow the Citizens Broadband Radio Service operator to synchronize its system with the 3.45 GHz band system. The 3.45 GHz Service licensee must keep this information current if its network operations change.


(b) 3.45 GHz Service licensees are under no obligation to make any changes to their operations or proposed operations to enable TDD synchronization.
