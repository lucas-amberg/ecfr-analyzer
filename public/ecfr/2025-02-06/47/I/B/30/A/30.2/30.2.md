# ยง 30.2   Definitions.

The following definitions apply to this part:


*Authorized bandwidth.* The maximum width of the band of frequencies permitted to be used by a station. This is normally considered to be the necessary or occupied bandwidth, whichever is greater. (See ยง 2.202 of this chapter).


*Authorized frequency.* The frequency, or frequency range, assigned to a station by the Commission and specified in the instrument of authorization.


*Fixed satellite earth station.* An earth station intended to be used at a specified fixed point.


*Local Area Operations.* Operations confined to physical facility boundaries, such as a factory.


*Maximum Conducted Output Power.* The total transmit power delivered to all antennas and antenna *elements* averaged across all symbols in the signaling alphabet when the transmitter is operating at its maximum power control level. Power must be summed across all antennas and antenna elements. The average must not include any time intervals during which the transmitter is off or is transmitting at a reduced power level. If multiple modes of operation are possible (*e.g.,* alternative modulation methods), the *maximum conducted output power* is the highest total transmit power occurring in any mode.


*Point-to-Multipoint Hub Station.* A fixed point-to-multipoint radio station that provides one-way or two-way communication with fixed Point-to-Multipoint Service User Stations.


*Point-to-Multipoint Service.* A fixed point-to-multipoint radio service consisting of point-to-multipoint hub stations that communicate with fixed point-to-multipoint user stations.


*Point-to-Multipoint User Station.* A fixed radio station located at users' premises, lying within the coverage area of a Point-to-Multipoint Hub station, using a directional antenna to receive one-way communications from or providing two-way communications with a fixed Point-to-Multipoint Hub Station.


*Point-to-point station.* A station that transmits a highly directional signal from a fixed transmitter location to a fixed receive location.


*Portable device.* Transmitters designed to be used within 20 centimeters of the body of the user.


*Prior coordination.* A bilateral process conducted prior to filing applications which includes the distribution of the technical parameters of a proposed radio system to potentially affected parties for their evaluation and timely response.


*Secondary operations.* Radio communications which may not cause interference to operations authorized on a primary basis and which are not protected from interference from these primary operations


*Transportable station.* Transmitting equipment that is not intended to be used while in motion, but rather at stationary locations.


*Universal Licensing System.* The Universal Licensing System (ULS) is the consolidated database, application filing system, and processing system for all Wireless Radio Services. ULS supports electronic filing of all applications and related documents by applicants and licensees in the Wireless Radio Services, and provides public access to licensing information.
