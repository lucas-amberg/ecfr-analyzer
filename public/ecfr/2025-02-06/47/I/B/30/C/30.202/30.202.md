# ยง 30.202   Power limits.

(a) For fixed and base stations operating in connection with mobile systems, the average power of the sum of all antenna elements is limited to an equivalent isotopically radiated power (EIRP) density of +75dBm/100 MHz. For channel bandwidths less than 100 megahertz the EIRP must be reduced proportionally and linearly based on the bandwidth relative to 100 megahertz.


(b) For mobile stations, the average power of the sum of all antenna elements is limited to a maximum EIRP of +43 dBm.


(c) For transportable stations, as defined in ยง 30.2, the average power of the sum of all antenna elements is limited to a maximum EIRP of +55 dBm.


(d) For fixed point-to-point and point-to-multipoint limits see ยง 30.405.
