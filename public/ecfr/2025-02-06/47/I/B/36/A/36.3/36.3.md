The seller's remaining category relationships must then be increased proportionately to total 100 percent. Then, the adjusted seller's category relationships must be combined with those of the acquiring carrier as specified in § 36.3(d)(1) to determine the category relationships for the acquiring carrier's post-transfer study area.
