# § 36.154   Exchange Line Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF)—Category 1—apportionment procedures.

(a) *Exchange Line C&WF—Category 1.* The first step in apportioning the cost of exchange line cable and wire facilities among the operations is the determination of an average cost per working loop. This average cost per working loop is determined by dividing the total cost of exchange line cable and wire Category 1 in the study area by the sum of the working loops described in subcategories listed below. The subcategories are:


Subcategory 1.1—State Private Lines and State WATS Lines. This subcategory shall include all private lines and WATS lines carrying exclusively state traffic as well as private lines and WATS lines carrying both state and interstate traffic if the interstate traffic on the line involved constitutes ten percent or less of the total traffic on the line. 


Subcategory 1.2—Interstate private lines and interstate WATS lines. This subcategory shall include all private lines and WATS lines that carry exclusively interstate traffic as well as private lines and WATS lines carrying both state and interstate traffic if the interstate traffic on the line involved constitutes more than ten percent of the total traffic on the line. 


Subcategory 1.3—Subscriber or common lines that are jointly used for local exchange service and exchange access for state and interstate interexchange services. 


(b) The costs assigned to subcategories 1.1 and 1.2 shall be directly assigned to the appropriate jurisdiction. 


(c) Effective January 1, 1986, 25 percent of the costs assigned to subcategory 1.3 shall be allocated to the interstate jurisdiction.


(d)-(f) [Reserved] 


(g) Effective July 1, 2001, through December 31, 2030, all study areas shall apportion Subcategory 1.3 Exchange Line C&WF among the jurisdictions as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
