(b) Distribute to carriers the “Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet,” described in § 52.17(b).

The Commission shall have access to all data reported to the Administrator. Contributors may make requests for Commission nondisclosure of company-specific revenue information under § 0.459 of this chapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data are submitted. The Commission shall make all decisions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific information.

(e) File annual reports with the appropriate regulatory authorities of the NANP member countries as requested; and


(f) Obtain an audit from an independent auditor after the first year of operations and annually thereafter, which shall evaluate the validity of calculated payments. The B&C Agent shall submit the audit report to the Commission for appropriate review and action.
