The request shall include the appropriate documentation of the reason for the request. The *Toll Free Numbering Administrator (TFNA)* is the only entity that can assign this status to or remove this status from a number.

(2) Seasonal numbers shall be placed in unavailable status. The Responsible Organization for a *Toll Free Subscriber* who does not have a year round need for a toll free number shall follow the procedures outlined in ยง 52.103(f)(1) of these rules if it wants the *Toll Free Numbering Administrator (TFNA)* to place a particular toll free number in unavailable status.
