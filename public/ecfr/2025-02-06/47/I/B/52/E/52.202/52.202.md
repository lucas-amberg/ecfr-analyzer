# ยง 52.202   Georouting of Wireless Calls to the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Hotline.

(a) *Georouting.* All CMRS providers must:


(1) Have the capability to provide georouting data with 988 calls to the Lifeline Administrator in a format that is compatible with the Lifeline's routing platform, to allow routing of the 988 call by the Lifeline Administrator to the appropriate crisis center based on the geographic area where the handset is located at the time the 988 call is initiated.


(2) Provide georouting data, when available, with 988 calls to the Lifeline Administrator sufficient to allow routing of the 988 call by the Lifeline Administrator to the appropriate crisis center based on the geographic area where the handset is located at the time the 988 call is initiated.


(b) *Scope of section.* The requirements of this section are only applicable to CMRS providers, excluding mobile satellite service (MSS) operators, to the extent that they:


(1)(i) Offer real-time, two way switched voice service that is interconnected with the public switched network; and


(ii) Use an in-network switching facility that enables the provider to reuse frequencies and accomplish seamless hand-offs of subscriber calls. These requirements are applicable to entities that offer voice service to consumers by purchasing airtime or capacity at wholesale rates from CMRS licensees.


(2) The requirements of this section do not apply to 988 calls transmitted using roaming capabilities.


(c) *Compliance.* (1) By 30 days after December 12, 2024: Nationwide CMRS providers shall provide georouting data with wireless 988 calls.

(B) An interconnected service; and


(C) Available to the public, or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public; or


(ii) The functional equivalent of such a mobile service described in paragraph (i)(A) of this definition.


(iii) A variety of factors may be evaluated to make a determination whether the mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a commercial mobile radio service, including: Consumer demand for the service to determine whether the service is closely substitutable for a commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio service, would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; and market research information identifying the targeted market for the service under review.


(iv) Unlicensed radio frequency devices under part 15 of this chapter are excluded from this definition of Commercial mobile radio service.


*Georouting data.* Location data generated from cell-based location technology that is aggregated to a level that will not identify the location of the cell site or base station receiving the 988 call or otherwise identify the precise location of the handset.


*Lifeline Administrator.* The Lifeline Administrator controls the 988 call routing platform pursuant to contract with the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration.


*Nationwide CMRS provider.* A CMRS provider whose service extends to a majority of the population and land area of the United States.
