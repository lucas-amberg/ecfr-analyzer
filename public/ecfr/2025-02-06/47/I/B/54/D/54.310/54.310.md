# § 54.310   Connect America Fund for Price Cap Territories—Phase II.

(a) *Geographic areas eligible for support.* Connect America Phase II support may be made available for census blocks or other areas identified as eligible by public notice, including locations identified by the forward-looking cost model as extremely high-cost. The number of supported locations will be identified for each area eligible for support will be identified by public notice.


(b) *Term of support.* Connect America Phase II model-based support shall be provided to price cap carriers that elect to make a state-level commitment for six years. Connect America Phase II support awarded through a competitive bidding process shall be provided for ten years.


(c) *Deployment obligation.* Recipients of Connect America Phase II model-based support must complete deployment to 40 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2017, to 60 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2018, to 80 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2019, and to 100 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2020. Recipients of Connect America Phase II support awarded through a competitive bidding process, including New York's New NY Broadband Program, must complete deployment to 40 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2022, to 60 percent of supported locations December 31, 2023, to 80 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2024, and to 100 percent of supported locations by December 31, 2025. Compliance shall be determined based on the total number of supported locations in a state.






(1) For purposes of meeting the obligation to deploy to the requisite number of supported locations in a state, recipients of Connect America Phase II model-based support may serve unserved locations in census blocks with costs above the extremely high-cost threshold instead of locations in eligible census blocks, provided that they meet the public interest obligations set forth in § 54.309(a) introductory text and (a)(1) for those locations and provided that the total number of locations covered is greater than or equal to the number of supported locations in the state.


(2) Recipients of Connect America Phase II support may elect to deploy to 95 percent of the number of supported locations in a given state with a corresponding reduction in support computed based on the average support per location in the state times 1.89.




(d) *Disbursement of Phase II funding.* An eligible telecommunications carrier will be advised by public notice when it is authorized to receive support. The public notice will detail how disbursements will be made.


(e) *Provider eligibility.* Any eligible telecommunications carrier is eligible to receive Connect America Phase II support in eligible areas.


(1) An entity may obtain eligible telecommunications carrier designation after public notice of winning bidders in a competitive bidding process for the offer of Phase II Connect America support. An applicant in the competitive bidding process shall certify that it is financially and technically qualified to provide the services supported by Connect America Phase II in order to receive such support.


(2) To the extent an applicant in the competitive bidding process seeks eligible telecommunications carrier designation prior to public notice of winning bidders for Phase II Connect America support, its designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier may be conditional subject to the receipt of Phase II Connect America support.


(f) *Transition to model-based support.* Eligible telecommunications carriers electing model-based support in states where that support is less than their Phase I frozen support will transition to model-based support as follows: In addition to model-based support, in the first year of Phase II, they will receive 75% of the difference between Phase I frozen support and model-based support; in the second year of Phase II, they will receive 50% of the difference between Phase I frozen support and model-based support; and in the third year of Phase II, they will receive 25% of the difference between Phase I frozen support and model-based support.


(g) *Extended term of model-based support.* Eligible telecommunications carriers receiving model-based support may elect to receive a seventh year of such support. An eligible telecommunications carrier electing to receive this additional year of support makes a state-level commitment to maintain the required voice and broadband services in the areas for which it receives support during this extended term. The Wireline Competition Bureau will implement a mechanism to enable an eligible telecommunications carrier to elect whether to receive an additional seventh year of support.


(h) *Transition to Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support.* (1) In areas where the eligible telecommunications carrier elects to receive an optional seventh year of model-based support pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, it shall receive such support for a full calendar year, regardless of the disposition of these areas in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction.


(i) If the eligible telecommunications carrier becomes the winning bidder in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction in these areas, it shall continue to receive model-based support through December 31, 2021. Thereafter, it shall receive monthly support in the amount of its Rural Digital Opportunity Fund winning bid.


(ii) If another provider is the winning bidder in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction in these areas, the new provider shall receive monthly support in the amount of its Rural Digital Opportunity Fund winning bid starting the first day of the month following its authorization by the Wireline Competition Bureau. The eligible telecommunications carrier shall continue to receive model-based support for these areas through December 31, 2021.


(iii) If there is no authorized Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction support recipient in these areas or if these areas are deemed ineligible for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction, the eligible telecommunications carrier shall continue to receive model-based support for these areas through December 31, 2021. Thereafter, it shall receive no additional support.


(2) In areas where the eligible telecommunications carrier declines to receive an optional seventh year of model-based support pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, it shall cease receiving model-based support for these areas on December 31, 2020.




(i) *Alaska Connect Fund Transition support.* Beginning January 1, 2025 and ending December 31, 2028, any price cap carrier serving Alaska that elected to receive Connect America Phase II frozen support amounts in lieu of model-based support, and is authorized to receive support as of December 31, 2024, shall be authorized to receive an amount of monthly support during the ACF Transition equal to the amount of monthly support authorized as of December 1, 2024, multiplied by 1.30.
