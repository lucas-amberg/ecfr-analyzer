For purposes of this subsection, state regulated fees shall be limited to state subscriber line charges, state universal service fees and mandatory extended area service charges.


(i) All reports pursuant to this section shall be filed with the Office of the Secretary of the Commission clearly referencing WC Docket No. 14-58, with the Administrator, and with the relevant state commissions or relevant authority in a U.S. Territory, or Tribal governments, as appropriate.


(j) *Filing deadlines.* (1) In order for a recipient of high-cost support to continue to receive support for the following calendar year, or retain its eligible telecommunications carrier designation, it must submit the annual reporting information required by this section annually by July 1 of each year. Eligible telecommunications carriers that file their reports after the July 1 deadline shall receive a reduction in support pursuant to the following schedule:

(ii) An eligible telecommunications carrier that files on or after July 9 will have its support reduced on a pro-rata daily basis equivalent to the period of non-compliance, plus the minimum seven-day reduction.


(2) *Grace period.* An eligible telecommunications carrier that submits the annual reporting information required by this section after July 1 but before July 5 will not receive a reduction in support if the eligible telecommunications carrier and its holding company, operating companies, and affiliates as reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(8) of this section have not missed the July 1 deadline in any prior year.


(k) This section does not apply to recipients that solely receive support from Phase I of the Mobility Fund.




(l) In addition to the information and certifications in paragraph (a) of this section, any competitive eligible telecommunications carrier participating in the Alaska Plan must provide the following:


(1) Funding recipients that have identified in their approved performance plans that they rely exclusively on satellite backhaul for a certain portion of the population in their service area must certify as to whether any terrestrial backhaul or other satellite backhaul became commercially available in the previous calendar year in areas that were previously served exclusively by satellite backhaul. To the extent that new terrestrial backhaul facilities are constructed or other satellite backhaul become commercially available, the funding recipient must:


(i) Provide a description of the backhaul technology;


(ii) Provide the date on which that backhaul was made commercially available to the carrier;

(2) [Reserved]


(m) Any price cap carrier or fixed competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that elects to continue receiving support pursuant to § 54.312(d) or § 54.307(e)(2)(iii) shall provide certifications, starting July 1, 2020 and for each subsequent year they receive such support, that all such support the company received in the previous year was used to provide voice service throughout the high-cost and extremely high-cost census blocks where they continue to have the federal high-cost eligible telecommunications carrier obligation to provide voice service pursuant to § 54.201(d) at rates that are reasonably comparable to comparable offerings in urban areas. Any price cap carrier or fixed competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that solely receives support pursuant to § 54.312(d) or

§ 54.307(e)(2)(iii) in its designated service area shall not be subject to reporting requirements in any other paragraphs in this section for such support.


(n) Recipients of Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund Stage 2 fixed and mobile support and Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 fixed and mobile support shall certify that such support was not used for costs that are (or will be) reimbursed by other sources of support, including Federal or local government aid or insurance reimbursements; and that support was not used for other purposes, such as the retirement of company debt unrelated to eligible expenditures, or other expenses not directly related to network restoration, hardening, and expansion consistent with the framework of the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund or Connect USVI Fund, respectively. Recipients of fixed and mobile support from Stage 2 of the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and the Connect USVI Fund shall certify that they have conducted an annual review of the documentation required by § 54.1515(a) through (c) to determine the need for and to implement changes or revisions to disaster preparation and recovery documentation.


(o) Recipients of Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund or Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 mobile support and recipients of transitional support under § 54.1516 shall certify that they are in compliance with all requirements in this part for receipt of such support to continue.

(q) Recipients of transitional support under § 54.1516, as part of either the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund or Connect USVI Fund shall certify that such support was not used for costs that are (or will be) reimbursed by other sources of support, including Federal or local government aid or insurance reimbursements; and that support was not used for other purposes, such as the retirement of company debt unrelated to eligible expenditures, or other expenses not directly related to network restoration, hardening, and expansion consistent with the framework of the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund or Connect USVI Fund, respectively. Recipients of transitional support under § 54.1516 shall certify that they have conducted an annual review of the documentation required by § 54.1515(a) through (c) or § 54.1524, respectively, to determine the need for and to implement changes or revisions to disaster preparation and recovery documentation.


(r) In addition to the information and certifications in paragraph (a) of this section, any competitive eligible telecommunications carrier participating in the mobile portion of the Alaska Connect Fund must provide the following:


(1) Where WTB, in coordination with OEA, has approved lesser commitments in a mobile provider's performance plan than the minimum deployment goals under the mobile portion of the Alaska Connect Fund, as set forth in § 54.318(f)(5), for all or a certain portion of the provider's service area, the provider must certify, by census tract, that the basis for which it qualified for lesser commitments still applies in the previous calendar year and describe on FCC Form 481 the efforts it has taken to improve conditions that served as the basis for the lesser commitments. When the basis for the lesser commitments has changed in the previous calendar year, allowing the minimum commitments to be achieved in the census tract, the mobile provider must certify to this in FCC Form 481.


(2) Where a provider certifies on FCC Form 481 that conditions have changed such that it no longer qualifies for lesser commitments in a census tract, the provider must submit additional information and updated performance plans into the Alaska Connect Fund docket via the FCC Electronic Comment Filing System. Where conditions have changed, the mobile provider must submit, for the affected census tracts:


(i) A description of the change;


(ii) The date on which the change occurred;


(iii) The resolution 9 hexagons (hex-9s) using the H3 standardized geospatial indexing system as defined in 47 CFR 1.7001(a)(20) within the census tract that could be served as a result of the changed conditions; and


(iv) Revised performance commitments factoring in the change. These filings must be made simultaneously with the submission of the FCC Form 481. A mobile provider may seek confidential treatment of information required in this section if the conditions for confidentiality are met.
