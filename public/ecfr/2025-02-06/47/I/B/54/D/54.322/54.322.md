(c) *Support usage.* A mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that receives monthly support pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5)(ii) through (iv), (e)(6)(ii)(D), or (e)(7)(iii)shall use an increasing percentage of such support for the deployment, maintenance, and operation of mobile networks that provide 5G service as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and that meet the performance requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section as follows:


(1) *Year one support usage.* The carrier shall use at least one-third (
1/3) of the total monthly support received pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5)(ii) through (iv), (e)(6)(ii)(D), or (e)(7)(iii) in calendar year 2021 as specified in paragraph (c) of this section by December 31, 2021.


(2) *Year two support usage.* The carrier shall use at least two-thirds (
2/3) of the total monthly support received pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5)(ii) through (iv), (e)(6)(ii)(D), or (e)(7)(iii) in calendar year 2022 as specified in paragraph (c) of this section by December 31, 2022.


(3) *Year three and subsequent year support usage.* The carrier shall use all monthly support received pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5)(ii) through (iv), (e)(6)(ii)(D), or (e)(7)(iii)as specified in paragraph (c) of this section in 2023 and thereafter.


(4) *Year one support usage flexibility.* If the carrier is unable to meet the support usage requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the carrier shall have the flexibility to instead proportionally increase the support usage requirement in paragraph (c)(2) of this section such that its combined usage of monthly support received pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5)(ii) through (iv), (e)(6)(ii)(D), or (e)(7)(iii) in calendar years 2021 and 2022 is equal to the total amount of such support that the carrier receives annually, provided that the carrier certifies to the Wireline Competition Bureau this amount and that it will make up for any shortfall in a filing due by March 31, 2021 or 30 days after Paperwork Reduction Act approval, whichever is later.


(d) *Performance requirements.* A mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that receives monthly support pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5)(ii) through (iv), (e)(6)(ii)(D), or (e)(7)(iii) shall meet the following minimum baseline performance requirements for data speeds, data latency, and data allowances in areas that it has deployed 5G service as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and for which it receives support for at least one plan that it offers:


(1) Median data transmission rates of 35 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload, and with at least 90 percent of measurements recording data transmission rates of not less than 7 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload;


(2) Transmission latency of 100 milliseconds or less round trip for successfully transmitted measurements (*i.e.,* ignoring lost or timed-out packets); with at least 90 percent of measurements recording latency of 100 milliseconds or less round trip, and


(3) At least one service plan offered must include a data allowance that is equivalent to the average United States subscriber data usage as specified and adopted by the Office of Economics and Analytics and Wireline Competition Bureau after notice and comment.

In addition, during the time that the mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier receives such support, the carrier may not enter into facilities access arrangements that restrict any party to the arrangement from allowing others to collocate on the cell-site infrastructure.


(f) *Voice and data roaming obligations.* A mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that receives monthly support pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5), (e)(6), or (e)(7) shall comply with the Commission's voice and data roaming requirements that are currently in effect on networks that are built with universal service funds.


(g) *Reasonably comparable rates.* A mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that receives monthly support pursuant to § 54.307(e)(5), (e)(6), or (e)(7) shall offer its services in the areas for which it receives such monthly support at rates that are reasonably comparable to those rates offered in urban areas and must advertise the voice and broadband services it offers in its subsidized service areas. A mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier's rates shall be considered reasonably comparable to urban rates, based upon the most recently-available decennial U.S. Census Bureau data identifying areas as urban, if rates for services in rural areas fall within a reasonable range of urban rates for reasonably comparable voice and broadband services.


(1) If the carrier offers service in urban areas, it may demonstrate that it offers reasonably comparable rates if it offers the same rates, terms, and conditions (including usage allowances, if any, for a specific rate) in both urban and rural areas or if one of the carrier's stand-alone voice service plans and one service plan offering data are substantially similar to plans it offers in urban areas.


(2) If the carrier does not offer service in urban areas, it may demonstrate that it offers reasonably comparable rates by identifying a carrier that does offer service in urban areas and the specific rate plans to which its plans are reasonably comparable, along with submission of corroborating evidence that its rates are reasonably comparable, such as marketing materials from the identified carrier.
