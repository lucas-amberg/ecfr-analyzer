# § 54.1508   Letter of credit for stage 2 fixed support recipients.

(a) *Letter of credit.* Before being authorized to receive support from Stage 2 of the fixed Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund or the fixed Connect USVI Fund, a winning applicant shall obtain an irrevocable standby letter of credit which shall be acceptable in all respects to the Commission. No later than the number of days provided by public notice, the applicant shall submit a letter from a bank meeting the eligibility requirements outlined in this section committing to issue an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit, in the required form, to the winning applicant. The letter shall at a minimum provide the dollar amount of the letter of credit and the issuing bank's agreement to follow the terms and conditions of the Commission's model letter of credit. The letter of credit must remain open until the recipient has certified it has deployed broadband and voice service meeting the requirements in this subpart to 100% of the required number of locations, and Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) has verified that the entity has fully deployed.


(b) *Value.* Each recipient authorized to receive the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and the Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 fixed support shall maintain the standby letter of credit or multiple standby letters of credit in an amount equal to at a minimum the amount of fixed support that has been disbursed and that will be disbursed in the coming year, until the USAC has verified that the recipient met the final service milestone.


(1) Once the recipient has met its 60 percent service milestone, it may obtain a new letter of credit or renew its existing letter of credit so that it is valued at a minimum at 90 percent of the total support amount already disbursed plus the amount that will be disbursed in the coming year.


(2) Once the recipient has met its 80 percent service milestone, it may obtain a new letter of credit or renew its existing letter of credit so that it is valued at a minimum at 80 percent of the total support that has been disbursed plus the amount that will be disbursed in the coming year.


(c) *Acceptable bank issuing letter of credit.* The bank issuing the letter of credit shall be acceptable to the Commission. A bank that is acceptable to the Commission is:


(1) Any United States bank:


(i) That is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and


(ii) That has a bank safety rating issued by Weiss of B- or better; or


(2) CoBank, so long as it maintains assets that place it among the 100 largest United States Banks, determined on basis of total assets as of the calendar year immediately preceding the issuance of the letter of credit and it has a long-term unsecured credit rating issued by Standard & Poor's of BBB- or better (or an equivalent rating from another nationally recognized credit rating agency); or


(3) The National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, so long as it maintains assets that place it among the 100 largest United States Banks, determined on basis of total assets as of the calendar year immediately preceding the issuance of the letter of credit and it has a long-term unsecured credit rating issued by Standard & Poor's of BBB- or better (or an equivalent rating from another nationally recognized credit rating agency); or


(4) Any non-United States bank:


(i) That is among the 100 largest non-U.S. banks in the world, determined on the basis of total assets as of the end of the calendar year immediately preceding the issuance of the letter of credit (determined on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis as of such date);


(ii) Has a branch office:


(A) Located in the District of Columbia, or


(B) Located in New York City, New York, or such other branch office agreed to by the Commission, that will accept a letter of credit presentation from the Administrator via overnight courier, in addition to in-person presentations;


(iii) Has a long-term unsecured credit rating issued by a widely-recognized credit rating agency that is equivalent to a BBB- or better rating by Standard & Poor's; and


(iv) Issues the letter of credit payable in United States dollars


(d) *Bankruptcy opinion letter.* A winning applicant of the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and the Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 fixed support shall provide with its letter of credit an opinion letter from its legal counsel clearly stating, subject only to customary assumptions, limitations, and qualifications, that in a proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. 101 *et seq.* (the “Bankruptcy Code”), the bankruptcy court would not treat the letter of credit or proceeds of the letter of credit as property of the winning bidder's bankruptcy estate under section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code.


(e) *Authorization for Stage 2 support.* Authorization to receive the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and the Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 fixed support is conditioned upon full and timely performance of all of the requirements set forth in this section, and any additional terms and conditions upon which the support was granted.


(1) Failure by a Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and the Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 fixed support recipient to meet its service milestones as required by § 54.1506 will trigger reporting obligations and the withholding of support as described in § 54.320(d). 

Failure to come into full compliance within 12 months will trigger a recovery action by the USAC. If the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund or Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 fixed support recipient does not repay the requisite amount of support within six months, the USAC will be entitled to draw the entire amount of the letter of credit and may disqualify the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund or Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 fixed support recipient from the receipt of any or all universal service support.


(2) A default will be evidenced by a letter issued by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau, or the Chief's designee, which letter, attached to a standby letter of credit draw certificate, shall be sufficient for a draw on the standby letter of credit for the entire amount of the standby letter of credit.
