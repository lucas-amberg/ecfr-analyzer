# § 54.1704   Emergency Connectivity Fund gift restrictions.

(a) *Gift restrictions.* (1) Subject to paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library may not directly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value from a service provider participating in or seeking to participate in the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program. No such service provider shall offer or provide any such gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or other thing of value except as otherwise provided in this section. Modest refreshments not offered as part of a meal, items with little intrinsic value intended solely for presentation, and items worth $20 or less, including meals, may be offered or provided, and accepted by any individuals or entities subject to this subpart, if the value of these items received by any individual does not exceed $50 from any one service provider per funding year. The $50 amount for any service provider shall be calculated as the aggregate value of all gifts provided during a funding year by the individuals specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.


(2) For purposes of this paragraph (a):


(i) The terms “school, library, or consortium” include all individuals who are on the governing boards of such entities (such as members of a school committee), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants or independent contractors of such entities involved on behalf of such school, library, or consortium with the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, including individuals who prepare, approve, sign or submit Emergency Connectivity Fund Program applications, or other forms related to the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, or who prepare bids, communicate, or work with Emergency Connectivity Fund Program service providers, Emergency Connectivity Fund Program consultants, or with the Administrator, as well as any staff of such entities responsible for monitoring compliance with the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program; and


(ii) The term “service provider” includes all individuals who are on the governing boards of such an entity (such as members of the board of directors), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, or independent contractors of such entities.


(3) The restrictions set forth in this paragraph (a) shall not be applicable to the provision of any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value, to the extent given to a family member or a friend working for an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library, provided that such transactions:


(i) Are motivated solely by a personal relationship;


(ii) Are not rooted in any service provider business activities or any other business relationship with any such eligible school, library, or consortium; and


(iii) Are provided using only the donor's personal funds that will not be reimbursed through any employment or business relationship.


(4) Any service provider may make charitable donations to an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library in the support of its programs as long as such contributions are not directly or indirectly related to Emergency Connectivity Fund procurement activities or decisions and are not given by service providers to circumvent Emergency Connectivity Fund Program rules in this subpart.


(b) *COVID-19 pandemic exception.* Any service provider may offer and provide, and any applicant may solicit and accept, broadband connections, devices, networking equipment, or other things of value directly related to addressing remote learning needs of students, school staff, and library patrons due to the COVID-19 pandemic through June 30, 2022.
