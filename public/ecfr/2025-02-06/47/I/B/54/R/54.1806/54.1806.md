# § 54.1806   Household eligibility determinations and annual recertification.

(a) *Eligibility verification processes.* To verify whether a household is an eligible household, a participating provider shall—


(1) Use the National Verifier; or


(2) Rely upon an alternative verification process of the participating provider, if—


(i) The participating provider submits information as required by the Commission regarding the alternative verification process prior to seeking reimbursement; and


(ii) Not later than 7 days after receiving the information required under paragraph(a)(2)(i) of this section, the Wireline Competition Bureau—


(A) Determines that the alternative verification process will be sufficient to avoid waste, fraud, and abuse; and


(B) Notifies the participating provider of the determination under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.


(3) Rely on a school to verify the eligibility of a household based on the participation of the household in the free and reduced price lunch program or the school breakfast program as described in § 54.1800(j)(3). The participating provider shall retain documentation demonstrating the school verifying eligibility, the program(s) that the school participates in, the qualifying household, and the program(s) the household participates in.


(4) Check its own electronic systems, whether such systems are maintained by the participating provider or a third party, to confirm that the household is not already receiving another affordable connectivity benefit from that participating provider.


(5) Collect and retain documentation establishing at least one member of the household is enrolled in a school or school district that participates in the National School Lunch Program's Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) (42 U.S.C. 1759a) if enrolling households based on CEP eligibility.


(b) *Participating providers' obligations.* All participating providers shall implement policies and procedures for ensuring that their Affordable Connectivity Program households are eligible to receive the affordable connectivity benefit. A provider may not provide a consumer with service that it represents to be Affordable Connectivity Program-supported service or seek reimbursement for such service, unless and until it has:


(1) Confirmed that the household is an eligible household pursuant to § 54.1805(a) and (b);


(2) Completed any other necessary enrollment steps, and;


(3) Securely retained all information and documentation it receives related to the eligibility determination and enrollment, consistent with § 54.1811.


(c) *One-per-household worksheet.* If the prospective household shares an address with one or more existing Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers according to the National Lifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier, the prospective subscriber shall complete a form certifying compliance with the one-per-household rule set forth in § 54.1805(b) prior to initial enrollment.


(d) *The National Lifeline Accountability Database.* In order to receive Affordable Connectivity Program support, participating providers shall comply with the following requirements:


(1) All participating providers shall query the National Lifeline Accountability Database to determine whether a prospective subscriber is currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program supported service from another participating provider; and whether anyone else living at the prospective subscriber's residential address is currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program-supported service.


(2) If the National Lifeline Accountability Database indicates that a prospective subscriber who is not seeking to transfer his or her affordable connectivity benefit, is currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program-supported service, the participating provider shall not provide and shall not seek or receive Affordable Connectivity Program reimbursement for that subscriber.


(3) Participating providers may query the National Lifeline Accountability Database only for the purposes provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) and (e)(1) and (2) of this section, and to determine whether information with respect to its subscribers already in the National Lifeline Accountability Database is correct and complete.


(4) Participating providers shall transmit to the National Lifeline Accountability Database in a format prescribed by the Administrator each new and existing Affordable Connectivity Program subscriber's full name; full residential address; date of birth; the telephone number associated with the Affordable Connectivity Program service; the date on which the Affordable Connectivity Program discount was initiated; the date on which the Affordable Connectivity Program discount was terminated, if it has been terminated; the amount of support being sought for that subscriber; and the means through which the subscriber qualified for the Affordable Connectivity Program.


(5) All participating providers shall update an existing Affordable Connectivity Program subscriber's information in the National Lifeline Accountability Database within ten business days of receiving any change to that information, except as described in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.


(6) All participating providers shall obtain, from each new and existing subscriber, consent to transmit the subscriber's information. Prior to obtaining consent, the participating provider shall describe to the subscriber, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the Administrator to ensure the proper administration of the Affordable Connectivity Program, and that failure to provide consent will result in subscriber being denied the affordable connectivity benefit.


(7) When a participating provider de-enrolls a subscriber from the Affordable Connectivity Program, it shall transmit to the National Lifeline Accountability Database the date of Affordable Connectivity Program de-enrollment within one business day of de-enrollment.


(8) All participating providers shall securely retain subscriber documentation that the participating provider reviewed to verify subscriber eligibility, for the purposes of production during audits or investigations or to the extent required by National Lifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier processes, which require, inter alia, verification of eligibility, identity, address, and age.


(9) A participating provider shall not enroll or claim for reimbursement a prospective subscriber in the Affordable Connectivity Program if the National Lifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier cannot verify the subscriber's status as alive, unless the subscriber produces documentation to demonstrate his or her identity and status as alive.


(10) A participating provider shall apply the Affordable Connectivity Program benefit no later than the start of the first billing cycle after the household's enrollment or transfer, and pass through the discount to the household prior to claiming reimbursement for the discount in the Affordable Connectivity Program.


(e) *Connected device reimbursement and the National Lifeline Accountability Database.* In order to receive Affordable Connectivity Program reimbursement for a connected device, participating providers shall comply with § 54.1803(b) and the following requirements:


(1) Such participating provider shall query the National Lifeline Accountability Database to determine whether a prospective connected device benefit recipient has previously received a connected device benefit.


(2) If the National Lifeline Accountability Database indicates that a prospective subscriber has received a connected device benefit, the participating provider shall not seek a connected device reimbursement for that subscriber.


(3) Such participating provider shall not seek a connected device reimbursement for a subscriber that is not receiving the affordable connectivity benefit for service provided by the same participating provider, except that a participating provider may seek reimbursement for a connected device provided to a household if the household had been receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program-supported service from that provider at the time the connected device was supplied to the household, but the household subsequently transferred its benefit to another provider before the provider had an opportunity to claim the connected device.


(4) Where two or more participating providers file a claim for a connected device reimbursement for the same subscriber, only the participating provider whose information was received and processed by the National Lifeline Accountability Database or Lifeline Claims System first, as determined by the Administrator, will be entitled to a connected device reimbursement for that subscriber.


(5) All participating providers shall obtain from each subscriber consent to transmit the information required under paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section. Prior to obtaining consent, the participating provider shall describe to the subscriber, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the Administrator to ensure the proper administration of the Affordable Connectivity Program connected device benefit, and that failure to provide consent will result in the subscriber being denied the Affordable Connectivity Program connected device benefit.


(6) In a manner and form consistent with the direction of the Wireline Competition Bureau and the Administrator, a participating provider shall provide to the Administrator information concerning the connected device supplied to the household, including device type, device make, device model, subscriber ID of the household that received the device, date the device was delivered to the household, method used to provide the device (shipped, in store, or installed by provider), market value of the device, and amount paid by the household to the provider for the device. No claim for reimbursement for a connected device supplied by the participating provider to the household shall be submitted prior to payment by the household of the amount described in § 54.1803(b)(1).


(f) *Annual eligibility re-certification.* (1) Participating providers shall re-certify annually all Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers whose initial eligibility was verified through the participating provider's approved alternative verification process or through a school, except where the Administrator using the National Verifier is responsible for the annual recertification of Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers. The Administrator using the National Verifier will re-certify the eligibility of all other Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers. Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers who are also enrolled in Lifeline may rely on a successful recertification for the Lifeline program to satisfy this requirement.


(2) In order to recertify a subscriber's eligibility for the Affordable Connectivity Program, a participating provider shall confirm a subscriber's current eligibility to receive an affordable connectivity benefit by following the eligibility process and requirements under paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section and shall also follow the requirements and processes for either its alternative verification processes approved under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the eligibility verification processes and requirements for school-based eligibility verifications in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, confirming that the subscriber still meets the program or income-based eligibility requirements for the Affordable Connectivity Program, and documenting the results of that review.


(3) Where the Administrator is responsible for re-certification of a subscriber's Affordable Connectivity Program eligibility, the Administrator shall confirm a subscriber's current eligibility to receive Affordable Connectivity Program service by:


(i) Querying the appropriate eligibility databases, confirming that the subscriber still meets the program-based eligibility requirements for the Affordable Connectivity Program, and documenting the results of that review; or


(ii) Querying the appropriate income databases, confirming that the subscriber continues to meet the income-based eligibility requirements for the Affordable Connectivity Program, and documenting the results of that review; or


(iii) If the subscriber's program-based or income-based eligibility for the Affordable Connectivity Program cannot be determined by accessing one or more eligibility or income databases, then the Administrator shall obtain a signed certification from the subscriber confirming the subscriber's continued eligibility. If the subscriber's eligibility was previously confirmed through an eligibility or income database during enrollment or a prior recertification and the subscriber is no longer included in any eligibility or income database the Administrator shall obtain both an approved Annual Recertification Form and acceptable documentation demonstrating eligibility from that subscriber to complete the recertification process.


(4) Where the Administrator is responsible for re-certification of subscribers' Affordable Connectivity Program eligibility, the Administrator shall provide to each provider the results of its annual re-certification efforts with respect to that provider's subscribers.


(5) If a provider is unable to re-certify a subscriber or has been notified by the Administrator that it is unable to re-certify a subscriber, the provider shall comply with the de-enrollment requirements provided for in § 54.1809(d).


(6) One-Per-Household Worksheet—at re-certification, if the subscriber resides at the same address as another Affordable Connectivity Program subscriber and there are changes to the subscriber's household relevant to whether the subscriber is only receiving one affordable connectivity benefit per household, then the subscriber shall complete a new Household Worksheet. Providers must retain the one-per-household worksheet for subscribers subject to this requirement in accordance with § 54.1811.
