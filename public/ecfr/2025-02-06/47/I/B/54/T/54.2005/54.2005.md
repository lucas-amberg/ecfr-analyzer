# § 54.2005   Competitive bidding requirements.

(a) *Fair and open competitive bidding process.* All participants in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program must conduct a fair and open competitive bidding process, consistent with all requirements set forth in this subpart.


Note to Paragraph (a): The following is an illustrative list of activities or behaviors that would not result in a fair and open competitive bidding process: the participant seeking supported services has a relationship with a service provider that would unfairly influence the outcome of a competition or would furnish the service provider with inside information; someone other than the participant or an authorized representative of the participant prepares, signs, and submits the FCC Form 470 and certification; a service provider representative is listed as the FCC Form 470 contact person and the participant allows that service provider to participate in the competitive bidding process; the service provider prepares the participant's FCC Form 470 or participates in the bid evaluation or vendor selection process in any way; the participant turns over to a service provider the responsibility for ensuring a fair and open competitive bidding process; a participant employee with a role in the service provider selection process also has an ownership interest in the service provider seeking to participate in the competitive bidding process; and the participant's FCC Form 470 does not describe the supported services with sufficient specificity to enable interested service providers to submit responsive bids.


(b) *Competitive bid requirements.* All participants in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program shall seek competitive bids, pursuant to the requirements established in this subpart, for all services and equipment eligible for support under § 54.2003, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. These competitive bidding requirements apply in addition to any applicable state, Tribal, and local competitive bidding requirements and are not intended to preempt such state, Tribal, or local requirements.


(c) *Posting of FCC Form 470.* (1) Participants in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program shall submit a completed FCC Form 470 to the Administrator to initiate the competitive bidding process. The FCC Form 470 shall include, at a minimum, the following information:


(i) A list of specified services and/or equipment for which the school, library, or consortium requests bids; and


(ii) Sufficient information to enable bidders to reasonably determine the needs of the applicant.


(2) The FCC Form 470 shall be signed by a person authorized to request bids for eligible services and equipment for the eligible school, library, or consortium, including such entities, and shall include that person's certification under penalty of perjury that:


(i) “I am authorized to submit this application on behalf of the above-named participant in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program and that based on information known to me or provided to me by employees responsible for the data being submitted, I hereby certify that the data set forth in this form has been examined and is true, accurate, and complete. I acknowledge that any false statement on this application or on other documents submitted by this participant can be punished by fine or forfeiture under the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 502, 503(b)), or fine or imprisonment under Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), or can lead to liability under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733).”


(ii) “In addition to the foregoing, this participant is in compliance with the rules and orders governing the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program, and I acknowledge that failure to be in compliance and remain in compliance with those rules and orders may result in the denial of funding, cancellation of funding commitments, and/or recoupment of past disbursements. I acknowledge that failure to comply with the rules and orders governing the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program could result in civil or criminal prosecution by law enforcement authorities.”


(iii) “By signing this application, I certify that the information contained in this form is true, complete, and accurate. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil, or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims, or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, §§ 1001, 286-287, and 1341, and Title 31, §§ 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).”


(iv) The schools meet the definition of “elementary school” or “secondary school”, as defined in § 54.2000, do not operate as for-profit businesses, and do not have endowments exceeding $50,000,000.


(v) Libraries or library consortia eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act of 1996 do not operate as for-profit businesses and, except for the limited case of Tribal college or university libraries, have budgets that are completely separate from any school (including, but not limited to, elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities).


(vi) The services and/or equipment that the school, library, or consortium purchases at discounts will not be sold, resold, or transferred in consideration for money or any other thing of value, except as allowed by § 54.2003(b).


(vii) The school(s) and/or library(ies) listed on this FCC Form 470 will not accept anything of value, other than services and equipment sought by means of this form, from the service provider, or any representatives or agent thereof, or any consultant in connection with this request for services.


(viii) All bids submitted for eligible equipment and services will be carefully considered, with price being the primary factor, and the bid selected will be for the most cost-effective service offering consistent with paragraph (e) of this section.


(ix) The school, library, or consortium acknowledges that support under the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program is conditional upon the school(s) and/or library(ies) securing access, separately or through this program, to all of the resources necessary to effectively use the requested equipment and services. The school, library, or consortium recognizes that some of the aforementioned resources are not eligible for support and certifies that it has considered what financial resources should be available to cover these costs.


(x) “I will retain required documents for a period of at least 10 years (or whatever retention period is required by the rules in effect at the time of this certification) after the later of the last day of the applicable Pilot Program year or the service delivery deadline for the associated funding request. I also certify that I will retain all documents necessary to demonstrate compliance with the statute (47 U.S.C. 254) and Commission rules regarding the form for, receipt of, and delivery of equipment and services receiving Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program discounts. I acknowledge that I may be audited pursuant to participation in the Pilot Program.”


(xi) “I certify that the equipment and services that the participant purchases at discounts will be used primarily for educational purposes and will not be sold, resold, or transferred in consideration for money or any other thing of value, except as permitted by the Commission's rules at 47 CFR 54.2003(b). Additionally, I certify that the entity or entities listed on this form will not accept anything of value or a promise of anything of value, other than services and equipment sought by means of this form, from the service provider, or any representative or agent thereof, or any consultant in connection with this request for services.”


(xii) “I acknowledge that support under this Pilot Program is conditional upon the school(s) and/or library(ies) I represent securing access, separately or through this program, to all of the resources necessary to effectively use the requested equipment and services. I recognize that some of the aforementioned resources are not eligible for support. I certify that I have considered what financial resources should be available to cover these costs.”


(xiii) “I certify that I have reviewed all applicable Commission, state, Tribal, and local procurement/competitive bidding requirements and that the participant will comply with all applicable requirements.”


(3) The Administrator shall post each FCC Form 470 that it receives from a participant in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program on its website designated for this purpose.


(4) After posting on the Administrator's website an FCC Form 470, the Administrator shall send confirmation of the posting to the participant requesting services and/or equipment. The participant shall then wait at least 28 days from the date on which its description of services and/or equipment is posted on the Administrator's website before making any commitments with the selected providers of services and/or equipment. The confirmation from the Administrator shall include the date after which the participant may sign a contract with its chosen provider(s).


(d) *Gift restrictions.* (1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section, a participant in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program may not directly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value from a service provider participating in or seeking to participate in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program. No such service provider shall offer or provide any such gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or other thing of value except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d). Modest refreshments not offered as part of a meal, items with little intrinsic value intended solely for presentation, and items worth $20 or less, including meals, may be offered or provided, and accepted by any individuals or entities subject to this subpart, if the value of these items received by any individual does not exceed $50 from any one service provider per year. The $50 amount for any service provider shall be calculated as the aggregate value of all gifts provided during a year by the individuals specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.


(2) For purposes of this paragraph (d):


(i) The term “participant in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program” includes all individuals who are on the governing boards of such entities (such as members of a school committee), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants, or independent contractors of such entities involved on behalf of such school, library, or consortium with the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program, including individuals who prepare, approve, sign, or submit applications, or other forms related to the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program, or who prepare bids, communicate, or work with Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program service providers, Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program consultants, or with the Administrator, as well as any staff of such entities responsible for monitoring compliance with the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program; and


(ii) The term “service provider” includes all individuals who are on the governing boards of such an entity (such as members of the board of directors), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants, or independent contractors of such entities.


(3) The restrictions set forth in this paragraph (d) shall not be applicable to the provision of any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value, to the extent given to a family member or a friend working for an eligible school, library, or consortium that includes an eligible school or library, provided that such transactions:


(i) Are motivated solely by a personal relationship;


(ii) Are not rooted in any service provider business activities or any other business relationship with any such participant in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program; and


(iii) Are provided using only the donor's personal funds that will not be reimbursed through any employment or business relationship.


(4) Any service provider may make charitable donations to a participant in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program in the support of its programs as long as such contributions are not directly or indirectly related to Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program procurement activities or decisions and are not given by service providers to circumvent competitive bidding and other Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program rules in this subpart.


(e) *Selecting a provider of eligible services and/or equipment.* In selecting a provider of eligible services and equipment, participants in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program shall carefully consider all bids submitted and must select the most cost-effective service and equipment offerings. In determining which service and equipment offering is the most cost-effective, entities may consider relevant factors other than the pre-discount prices submitted by providers, but price must be the primary factor considered.


(f) *Exemption to competitive bidding requirements.* Participants in the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program are not required to file an FCC Form 470 when seeking support for services and equipment purchased from Master Service Agreements negotiated by Federal, state, Tribal, or local governmental entities on behalf of such Pilot participants, if such Master Service Agreements were awarded pursuant to the E-Rate program FCC Form 470 process, as well as applicable Federal, state, Tribal, or local competitive bidding requirements.
