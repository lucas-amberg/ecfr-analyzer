# § 64.1203   —Consortium registration process.

(a) The Enforcement Bureau shall issue a public notice no later than April 28 annually seeking registration of a single consortium that conducts private-led efforts to trace back the origin of suspected unlawful robocalls.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an entity that seeks to register as the single consortium that conducts private-led efforts to trace back the origin of suspected unlawful robocalls must submit a letter and associated documentation in response to the public notice issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. In the letter, the entity must:


(1) Demonstrate that the consortium is a neutral third party competent to manage the private-led effort to trace back the origin of suspected unlawful robocalls;


(2) Include a copy of the consortium's written best practices, with an explanation thereof, regarding the management of its traceback efforts and regarding voice service providers' participation in the consortium's efforts to trace back the origin of suspected unlawful robocalls;


(3) Certify that, consistent with section 222(d)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the consortium's efforts will focus on fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful traffic;


(4) Certify that the consortium has notified the Commission that it intends to conduct traceback efforts of suspected unlawful robocalls in advance of registration as the single consortium; and


(5) Certify that, if selected to be the registered consortium, it will:


(i) Remain in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section;


(ii) Conduct an annual review to ensure compliance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section; and


(iii) Promptly notify the Commission of any changes that reasonably bear on its certification.


(c) The entity selected to be the registered consortium will not be required to file the letter mandated in paragraph (b) of this section in subsequent years after the consortium's initial registration. The registered consortium's initial certifications, required by paragraph (b) of this section, will continue for the duration of each subsequent year unless the registered consortium notifies the Commission otherwise in writing on or before the date for filing letters set forth in the annual public notice issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.


(d) The current registered consortium shall continue its traceback efforts until the effective date of the selection of any new registered consortium.
