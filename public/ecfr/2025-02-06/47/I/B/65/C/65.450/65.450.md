# § 65.450   Net income.

(a) Net income shall consist of all revenues derived from the provision of interstate telecommunications services regulated by this Commission less expenses recognized by the Commission as necessary to the provision of these services. The calculation of expenses entering into the determination of net income shall include the interstate portion of plant specific operations (Accounts 6110-6441), plant nonspecific operations (Accounts 6510-6565), customer operations (Accounts 6610-6623), corporate operations (Accounts 6720-6790), other operating income and expense (Account 7100), and operating taxes (Accounts 7200-7250), except to the extent this Commission specifically provides to the contrary.


(b) Gains and losses related to the disposition of plant in service items, shall be handled as follows:


(1) Gains related to property sold to others and leased back under finance leases for use in telecommunications services shall be recorded in Account 4300, Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits, and credited to Account 6563, Amortization expense—tangible, over the amortization period established for the finance lease;


(2) Gains or losses related to the disposition of land and other nondepreciable items recorded in Account 7100 (Other operating income and expense) shall be included in net income for ratemaking purposes, but adjusted to reflect the relative amount of time such property was used in regulated operations and included in the rate base; and 


(3) Proceeds related to the disposition of property depreciated on a group basis and used jointly in regulated and nonregulated activities, including sale-leaseback arrangements for property depreciated on a group basis, shall be credited to the related reserves and attributed to regulated and nonregulated in proportion to the accumulated regulated and nonregulated depreciation for that group. 


(c) Gains or losses related to the disposition of property that was never included in the rate base shall not be considered for ratemaking purposes. 


(d) Except for the allowance for funds used during construction, reasonable charitable deductions and interest related to customer deposits, the amounts recorded as nonoperating income and expenses and taxes (Accounts 7300 and 7400) and interest and related items (Account 7500) and extraordinary items (Account 7600) shall not be included unless this Commission specifically determines that particular items recorded in those accounts shall be included.
