(a) This section consists of the following Figures: 2, r3, 5, 6a, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Additionally, formulas that are directly related to graphs are included.


(b) Formula 1 is used for calculation of 50% skywave field strength values.


(c) Formula 2 is used for calculation of 10% skywave field strength values.


(d) Figure 6a depicts angles of departure versus transmission range. These angles may also be computed using the following formulas:


(e) In the event of disagreement between computed values using the formulas shown above and values obtained directly from the figures, the computed values will control.
