(a) Each TV broadcast station shall be equipped with indicating instruments which conform with the specifications described in ยง 73.1215 for measuring the operating parameters of the last radio stage of the transmitter, and with such other instruments as are necessary for the proper adjustment, operation, and maintenance of the transmitting system.


(b) The function of each instrument shall be clearly and permanently shown on the instrument itself or on the panel immediately adjacent thereto.

(1) If the defective instrument is the transmission line meter used for determining the output power by the direct method, the operating power shall be determined or maintained by the indirect method whenever possible or by using the operating parameters of the last radio stage of the transmitter during the time the station is operated without the transmission line meter.


(2) If conditions beyond the control of the licensee prevent the restoration of the meter to service within the above allowed period, informal request in accordance with ยง 73.3549 may be filed for such additional time as may be required to complete repairs of the defective instrument.
