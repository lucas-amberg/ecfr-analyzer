(2) The transmission of regular programs during maintenance or modification work on the main transmitter, necessitating discontinuance of its operation for a period not to exceed 5 days. (This includes the equipment changes which may be made without authority as set forth elsewhere in the rules and regulations or as authorized by the Commission by letter or by construction permit. Where such operation is required for periods in excess of 5 days, request therefor shall be made electronically in the International Communications Filing System (ICFS) in accordance with ยง 73.3542).

A record shall be kept of the time and result of each test. Such records shall be retained for a period of two years.


(e) The auxiliary transmitters shall be equipped with satisfactory control equipment which will enable the maintenance of the frequency emitted by the station within the limits prescribed by the regulations in this part.
