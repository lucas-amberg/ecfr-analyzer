(a) *Maximum facilities.* LPFM stations will be authorized to operate with maximum facilities of 100 watts ERP at 30 meters HAAT. An LPFM station with a HAAT that exceeds 30 meters will not be permitted to operate with an ERP greater than that which would result in a 60 dBu contour of 5.6 kilometers. In no event will an ERP less than one watt be authorized. No facility will be authorized in excess of one watt ERP at 450 meters HAAT.


(b) *Minimum facilities.* LPFM stations may not operate with facilities less than 50 watts ERP at 30 meters HAAT or the equivalent necessary to produce a 60 dBu contour that extends at least 4.7 kilometers.
