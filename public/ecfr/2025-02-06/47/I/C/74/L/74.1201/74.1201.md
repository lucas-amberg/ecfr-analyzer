# § 74.1201   Definitions.

(a) *FM translator.* A station in the broadcasting service operated for the purpose of retransmitting the signals of an AM or FM radio broadcast station or another FM broadcast translator station without significantly altering any characteristics of the incoming signal other than its frequency and amplitude, in order to provide radio broadcast service to the general public.


(b) *Commercial FM translator.* An FM broadcast translator station which rebroadcasts the signals of a commercial AM or FM radio broadcast station.


(c) *Noncommercial FM translator.* An FM broadcast translator station which rebroadcasts the signals of a noncommercial educational AM or FM radio broadcast station.


(d) *Primary station.* The AM or FM radio broadcast station radiating the signals which are retransmitted by an FM broadcast translator station or an FM broadcast booster station.


(e) *AM or FM radio broadcast station.* When used in this Subpart L, the term AM broadcast station or AM radio broadcast station or FM broadcast station or FM radio broadcast station refers to commercial and noncommercial educational AM or FM radio broadcast stations as defined in § 2.1 of this chapter, unless the context indicates otherwise.


(f) *FM broadcast booster station*—(1) *In general.* A station in the broadcasting service operated for the sole purpose of retransmitting the signals of an FM radio broadcast station, by amplifying and reradiating such signals, without significantly altering any characteristic of the incoming signal other than its amplitude. Unless specified otherwise, an FM broadcast booster station includes LPFM boosters as defined in paragraph (l) of this section.


(2) *Program originating FM booster station.* An FM broadcast booster station that retransmits the signals of an FM radio broadcast station or a low-power FM broadcast station, and that may replace the content of the incoming signal by originating programming for a period not to exceed three minutes of each broadcast hour. This is a strict hourly limit that may not be exceeded by aggregating unused minutes of program origination. A program originating FM booster station is subject to the same technical and interference protection requirements as are all FM broadcast booster stations, including but not limited to those set forth in §§ 74.1203 through 74.1262.




(g) *Translator coverage contour.* For a fill-in FM translator rebroadcasting an FM radio broadcast station as its primary station, the FM translator's coverage contour must be contained within the primary station's coverage contour. For purposes of this rule section, the coverage contour of the FM translator has the same field strength value as the protected contour of the primary FM station (*i.e.,* for a commercial Class B FM station it is the predicted 0.5 mV/m field strength contour, for a commercial Class B1 FM station it is the predicted 0.7 mV/m field strength contour, and for all other classes of FM stations it is the predicted 1 mV/m field strength contour). The coverage contour of an FM translator rebroadcasting an AM radio broadcast station as its primary station must be contained within the greater of either the 2 mV/m daytime contour of the AM station or a 25-mile (40 km) radius centered at the AM transmitter site. The protected contour for an FM translator station is its predicted 1 mV/m contour.


(h) *Fill-in area.* The area where the coverage contour of an FM translator or booster station is within the protected contour of the associated primary station (*i.e.,* predicted 0.5 mV/m contour for commercial Class B stations, predicted 0.7 mV/m contour for commercial Class B1 stations, and predicted 1 mV/m contour for all other classes of stations).


(i) *Other area.* The area where the coverage contour of an FM translator station extends beyond the protected contour of the primary station (*i.e.,* predicted 0.5 mV/m contour for commercial Class B stations, predicted 0.7 mV/m contour for commercial Class B1 stations, and predicted 1 mV/m contour for all other classes of stations).


(j) *AM Fill-in area.* The area within the greater of the 2 mV/m daytime contour of the AM radio broadcast station being rebroadcast or a 25-mile (40 km) radius centered at the AM transmitter site.


(k) *Listener complaint.* A statement that is signed and dated by the listener and contains the following information:


(1) The complainant's full name, address, and phone number;


(2) A clear, concise, and accurate description of the location where interference is alleged or predicted to occur;


(3) A statement that the complainant listens over-the-air to the desired station at least twice a month; and


(4) A statement that the complainant has no legal, financial, employment, or familial affiliation or relationship with the desired station.




(l) *LPFM booster.* An FM broadcast booster station as defined in paragraph (f) of this section that is commonly-owned by an LPFM station for the purpose of retransmitting the signals of the commonly-owned LPFM station.
