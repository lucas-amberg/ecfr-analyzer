# ยง 76.1608   System technical integration requiring uniform election of must-carry or retransmission consent status.

A cable system that changes its technical configuration in such a way as to integrate two formerly separate cable systems must give 90 days notice of its intention to do so to any television broadcast stations that have elected must-carry status with respect to one system and retransmission consent status with respect to the other. After July 31, 2020, such notice shall be delivered to stations electronically in accordance with ยง 76.1600. If the system and the station do not agree on a uniform election 45 days prior to integration, the cable system may require the station to make such a uniform election 30 days prior to integration.
