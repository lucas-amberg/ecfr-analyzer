(1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or other media; or alternatively 


(2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the FMS operations. 


(b)-(c) [Reserved] 


(d) Relocation of FMS licensees in the 2110-2150 and 2160-2200 MHz band will be subject to mandatory negotiations only. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, mandatory negotiation periods are defined as follows:


(1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year mandatory negotiation period; and


(2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year mandatory negotiation period.


(e) Relocation of FMS licensees by Mobile-Satellite Service (MSS) licensees will be subject to mandatory negotiations only.


(1) The mandatory negotiation period for non-public safety incumbents will end December 8, 2004.


(2) The mandatory negotiation period for public safety incumbents will end December 8, 2005.


(f) AWS licensees operating in the 1910-1920 MHz and 2175-2180 MHz bands will follow the requirements and procedures set forth in ET Docket No. 00-258 and WT Docket No. 04-356.
