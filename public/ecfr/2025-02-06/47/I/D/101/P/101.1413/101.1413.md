# ยง 101.1413   License term and construction requirements.

(a) The MVDDS license term is ten years, beginning on the date of the initial authorization grant.


(b) As a construction requirement, MVDDS licensees must make a showing of substantial service at the end of five years into the license period and ten years into the license period. The substantial service requirement is defined as a service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which might minimally warrant renewal. At the end of five years into the license term and ten years into the license period, the Commission will consider factors such as:


(1) Whether the licensee's operations service niche markets or focus on serving populations outside of areas serviced by other MVDDS licensees;


(2) Whether the licensee's operations serve populations with limited access to telecommunications services; and


(3) A demonstration of service to a significant portion of the population or land area of the licensed area.


(c) The renewal application of an MVDDS licensee is governed by ยง 1.949 of this chapter.
