(4) The applicant has determined that the proposed facility will not significantly affect the environment as defined in § 1.1307.

Conditional authority ceases immediately if the application is dismissed by the Commission. All other categories of applications listed in § 90.175 of this part that do not require evidence of frequency coordination are excluded from the provisions of this section.

Consistent with § 90.175(g) of this part, the applicant assumes all risks associated with operation under conditional authority, the termination or modification of conditional authority, or the subsequent dismissal or denial of its application. Authority reverts back to the original licensee if an assignee or transferee's conditional authority is canceled.
