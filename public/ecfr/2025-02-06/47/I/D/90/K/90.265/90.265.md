After those dates, existing systems with an authorized bandwidth of greater than 11.25 kHz (including those systems that expand existing operations) may continue to operate with a bandwidth greater than 11.25 kHz until January 1, 2013. Such operations are limited by paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section.


(6) After May 27, 2005, if a licensee of a channel in the band 169-172 MHz which uses equipment with an authorized bandwidth greater than 11.25 kHz cannot resolve an interference complaint to the satisfaction of an impacted Federal agency or is advised to do so by the Hydro Committee as approved by the FCC, then the licensee must cease operation on the frequency upon notification by the Commission.


(7) After January 1, 2008, if a licensee of a channel in the band 406.1-420 MHz which uses equipment with an authorized bandwidth greater than 11.25 kHz cannot resolve an interference complaint to the satisfaction of an impacted Federal agency or is advised to do so by the Hydro Committee as approved by the FCC, then the licensee must cease operation on the frequency upon notification by the Commission.


(8) After May 27, 2005, new assignments on the frequencies 406.125 MHz and 406.175 MHz are to be primarily for paired operations with the frequencies 415.125 MHz and 415.175 MHz, respectively and limited to an authorized bandwidth not to exceed 11.25 kHz when paired.


(9) Existing stations may continue to use the center frequencies 169.575 MHz, 409.675 MHz, 409.725 MHz, and 412.625 MHz until January 1, 2013, subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section.

(3) For emissions with a bandwidth not exceeding 54 kHz, the frequency stability of wireless microphones shall limit the total emission to within ±32.5 kHz of the assigned frequency. Emissions with a bandwidth exceeding 54 kHz shall comply with the emission mask in Section 8.3 of ETSI EN 300 422-1 v1.4.2 (2011-08).


(4) Wireless microphone operations are unprotected from interference from other licensed operations in the band. If any interference from wireless microphone operation is received by any Government or non-Government operation, the wireless microphone must cease operation on the frequency involved. Applications are subject to Government coordination.


(c) The following center frequencies are available for assignment to licensees engaged in forest firefighting and conservation activities, subject to the provisions of this section: 


(1) These frequencies will be assigned on a secondary basis to any U.S. Government station.
