All other applicants will be issued a geographic area license for their proposed area of operation based on county(s), state(s) or nationwide.


(b) Applicants who are approved in accordance with FCC Form 601 will be granted non-exclusive licenses for all non-reserved DSRCS frequencies (see ยง 90.377). Such licenses serve as a prerequisite of registering individual RSUs located within the licensed geographic area described in paragraph (a) of this section. Licensees must register each RSU in the Universal Licensing System (ULS) before operating such RSU. RSU registrations are subject, inter alia, to the requirements of ยง 1.923 of this chapter as applicable (antenna structure registration, environmental concerns, international coordination, and quiet zones).
