# ยง 95.579   FRS unwanted emissions limits.

Each FRS transmitter type must be designed to satisfy the applicable unwanted emissions limits in this paragraph.


(a) *Attenuation requirements.* The power of unwanted emissions must be attenuated below the carrier power output in Watts (P) by at least:


(1) 25 dB (decibels) in the frequency band 6.25 kHz to 12.5 kHz removed from the channel center frequency.


(2) 35 dB in the frequency band 12.5 kHz to 31.25 kHz removed from the channel center frequency.


(3) 43 + 10 log (P) dB in any frequency band removed from the channel center frequency by more than 31.25 kHz.


(b) *Measurement bandwidths.* The power of unwanted emissions in the frequency bands specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section is measured with a reference bandwidth of 300 Hz. The power of unwanted emissions in the frequency range specified in paragraph (a)(3) is measured with a reference bandwidth of at least 30 kHz.


(c) *Measurement conditions.* The requirements in this section apply to each FRS transmitter type both with and without the connection of permitted attachments, such as an external speaker, microphone and/or power cord.
