RCRS transmitters may only be used to transmit one-way communications and only for the purposes set forth in this section. (One-way communications are transmissions which are not intended to establish communications with another station.)


(a) *Control of model crafts and devices.* When an RCRS transmitter is used to control a model craft or device, the RCRS channels in specific frequency bands must be used, based on the type of model craft or device being controlled, as follows:


(1) RCRS channels in the 72 MHz frequency band may be used only to control and operate model aircraft.


(2) RCRS channels in the 75 MHz frequency band may be used only to control and operate model surface craft.


(3) RCRS channels in the 26-28 MHz frequency band may be used to control or operate any kind of device.


(b) *Telecommand.* Any RCRS channel may be used by the operator to turn on and/or off a device at a remote location.


(c) *Telemetry.* Any RCRS channel in the 26-28 MHz frequency band may be used to transmit a signal from a sensor at a remote location that turns on and/or off an indicating device for the operator.
