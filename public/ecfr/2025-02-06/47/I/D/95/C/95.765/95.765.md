# § 95.765   RCRS frequency accuracy.

Each RCRS transmitter type must be designed to satisfy the frequency accuracy requirements in this section.


(a) Each RCRS transmitter type capable of transmitting on channels in the 72 or 75 MHz frequency band must be designed such that the carrier frequencies remain within ±20 parts-per-million (ppm) of the channel center frequencies listed in § 95.763(b) and (c) during normal operating conditions.


(b) Except as allowed under paragraph (c) of this section, each RCRS transmitter type capable of transmitting in the 26-28 MHz frequency band must be designed such that the carrier frequencies remain within ±50 ppm of the channel center frequencies listed in § 95.763(a) during normal operating conditions.


(c) Each RCRS transmitter type that transmits in the 26-28 MHz frequency band with a mean transmitter power of 2.5 W or less and is used solely by the operator to turn on and/or off a device at a remote location, other than a device used solely to attract attention, must be designed such that the carrier frequencies remain within ±100 ppm of the channel center frequencies listed in § 95.763(a) during normal operating conditions.
