# ยง 95.779   RCRS unwanted emissions.

Each RCRS transmitter type must be designed to satisfy the applicable unwanted emissions limits in this paragraph.


(a) *26-28 MHz frequency band.* For an RCRS transmitter operating in the 26-28 MHz frequency band, the power of unwanted emissions must be attenuated below the transmitter output power in Watts (P) by at least:


(1) 25 dB (decibels) in the frequency band 4 kHz to 8 kHz removed from the channel center frequency;


(2) 35 dB in the frequency band 8 kHz to 20 kHz removed from the channel center frequency;


(3) 43 + 10 log (P) dB in any frequency band removed from the channel center frequency by more than 20 kHz.


(b) *72 and 75 MHz frequency bands.* For an RCRS transmitter operating in the 72 and/or 75 MHz frequency bands, the power of unwanted emissions must be attenuated below the transmitter output power in Watts (P) by at least:


(1) 25 dB (decibels) in the frequency band 4 kHz to 8 kHz removed from the channel center frequency;


(2) 45 dB in the frequency band 8 kHz to 10 kHz removed from the channel center frequency;


(3) 55 dB in the frequency band 10 kHz to 20 kHz removed from the channel center frequency; and


(4) 56 + 10 log (P) dB in any frequency band removed from the channel center frequency by more than 20 kHz.


(c) *Measurement bandwidths.* The power of unwanted emissions in the frequency bands specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (b)(1) through (3) of this section is measured with a reference bandwidth of 300 Hz. The power of unwanted emissions in the frequency ranges specified in paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(4) of this section is measured with a reference bandwidth of at least 30 kHz.
