# § 95.975   CBRS modulation limits.

Each CBRS transmitter type must be designed such that the modulation characteristics are in compliance with the rules in this section.


(a) When emission type A3E is transmitted with voice modulation, the modulation percentage must be at least 85%, but not more than 100%.


(b) When emission type A3E is transmitted by a CBRS transmitter having a transmitter output power of more than 2.5 W, the transmitter must contain a circuit that automatically prevents the modulation percentage from exceeding 100%.


(c) When emission type F3E is transmitted the peak frequency deviation shall not exceed ±2 kHz.
