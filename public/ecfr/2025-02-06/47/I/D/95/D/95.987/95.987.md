# § 95.987   CBRS additional requirements.

Each CBRS transmitter type must be designed to satisfy all of the additional requirements in this section.


(a) *Transmit frequency capability.* Each CBRS transmitter type must be designed to transmit only on one or more of the channels listed in § 95.963. No CBRS transmitter type will be certified for use in the CBRS service if it is capable of transmitting on any frequency or channel other than those listed in § 95.963, unless such transmitter type is also certified for use in another radio service for which the frequency capability is authorized and for which FCC certification is also required.


(b) *Frequency determining circuitry.* All frequency determining circuitry (including crystals) and programming controls in each CBRS transmitter type must be internal to the transmitter and must not be accessible from the operating panel or from the exterior of the transmitter enclosure.


(c) *Final amplifier component ratings.* The dissipation rating of all the semiconductors or electron tubes which supply RF power to the antenna terminals of each CB transmitter must not exceed 10 Watts. For semiconductors, the dissipation rating is the greater of the collector or device dissipation value established by the manufacturer of the semiconductor. These values may be temperature de-rated by no more than 50 °C. For an electron tube, the dissipation rating is the Intermittent Commercial and Amateur Service plate dissipation value established by the manufacturer of the electron tube.


(d) *External controls.* Only the external transmitter controls, connections or devices listed in this paragraph are allowed to be incorporated in a CBRS transmitter type. The FCC, however, may authorize additional controls, connections or devices after considering the functions to be performed by such additions.


(1) Primary power connection. External power supplies may be used.


(2) Microphone connection.


(3) Antenna connection.


(4) Headphone and speaker output connections and related selector switch.


(5) On-off switch for primary power to the transmitter. This switch may be combined with receiver controls such as the receiver on-off switch and volume control.


(6) Upper/lower sideband selector switch (for a transmitter that is capable of transmitting SSB emissions).


(7) Carrier level selector control (for a transmitter that is capable of transmitting SSB emissions). This control may be combined with the sideband selector switch.


(8) Channel selector switch.


(9) Transmit/receive selector switch.


(10) Meter(s) and selector switch(es) for monitoring transmitter performance.


(11) Pilot lamp(s), meter(s), light emitting diodes, liquid crystal devices or other types of visual display devices to indicate the presence of RF output power or that the transmitter control circuits are activated to transmit.
