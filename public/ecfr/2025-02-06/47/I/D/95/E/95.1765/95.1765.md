# ยง 95.1765   GMRS frequency accuracy.

Each GMRS transmitter type must be designed to comply with the frequency accuracy requirements in this section under normal operating conditions. Operators of GMRS stations must also ensure compliance with these requirements.


(a) The carrier frequency of each GMRS transmitter transmitting an emission with an occupied bandwidth greater than 12.5 kHz must remain within 5 parts-per-million (ppm) of the channel center frequencies listed in ยง 95.1763 under normal operating conditions.


(b) The carrier frequency of each GMRS transmitter transmitting an emission with an occupied bandwidth of 12.5 kHz or less must remain within 2.5 ppm of the channel center frequencies listed in ยง 95.1763 under normal operating conditions.
