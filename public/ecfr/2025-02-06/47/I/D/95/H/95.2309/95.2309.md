# § 95.2309   WMTS frequency coordination.

Operation of WMTS devices is subject to the frequency coordination procedures in this section.


(a) *Frequency coordinators.* The FCC designates one or more frequency coordinators to manage WMTS use of the frequency bands designated for the operation of WMTS devices.


(1) Contact information for the frequency coordinator can be obtained from the FCC's Web site at: *https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/wireless-medical-telemetry-service-wmts* or by calling the FCC at 1-888-CALL-FCC (1-888-225-5322).


(2) The duties of the frequency coordinators are to:


(i) Review and process coordination requests submitted by authorized health care providers as required by this section;


(ii) Maintain a database of WMTS use;


(iii) Notify users of potential conflicts;


(iv) Coordinate WMTS operation with radio astronomy observatories and Federal Government radar systems as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g).


(v) Notify licensees operating pursuant to § 90.259(b) of this chapter of the need to comply with the field strength limit of § 90.259(b)(11) prior to initial activation of WMTS equipment in the 1427-1432 MHz band.


(vi) Notify licensees operating in the 1392-1395 MHz band (pursuant to subpart I of part 27 of this chapter) of the need to comply with the field strength limit of § 27.804 prior to initial activation of WMTS equipment in the 1395-1400 MHz band.


(b) *Initial registration.* Prior to first use of a WMTS device for wireless medical telemetry in a health care facility, the authorized health care provider shall register the device with a designated frequency coordinator. After April 14, 2010, no registrations may be accepted for frequencies where WMTS does not have primary status. Previously registered secondary facilities may continue to operate as registered.


(c) *Maintaining current information.* The authorized health care provider shall maintain the information contained in each registration current in all material respects, and shall notify the frequency coordinator when any material change is made in the location or operating parameters previously reported.


(d) *Discontinuation.* The authorized health care provider shall notify the frequency coordinator whenever a medical telemetry device is permanently taken out of service, unless the device is replaced with another transmitter utilizing the same technical characteristics as those reported on the effective registration.


(e) *Registration information.* Each registration includes the following information:


(1) The specific frequency range(s);


(2) The modulation scheme and/or emission type (including bandwidth);


(3) The effective radiated power;


(4) The number of WMTS devices in use at the health care facility as of the date of registration, including manufacturer name(s) and model numbers;


(5) The legal name of the authorized health care provider;


(6) The location of the WMTS device (e.g., coordinates, street address, building, as appropriate); and,


(7) Contact information for the authorized health care provider (e.g., name, title, office address, telephone number, fax number, email address).


(f) *Specific requirements for WMTS devices in the 608-614 MHz frequency band.* For a wireless medical telemetry device operating within the frequency range 608-614 MHz that will be located near the radio astronomy observatories listed below, operation is not permitted until a WMTS frequency coordinator referenced in § 95.2309 has coordinated with, and obtained the written concurrence of, the director of the affected radio astronomy observatory before the equipment can be installed or operated—


(1) Within 80 kilometers of:


(i) National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, Arecibo, Puerto Rico: 18°-20′-38.28′ North Latitude, 66°-45′-09.42′ West Longitude;


(ii) National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, New Mexico: 34°-04′-43′ North Latitude, 107°-37′-04′ West Longitude; or


(iii) National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank, West Virginia: 38°-26′-08′ North Latitude, 79°-49′-42′ West Longitude.


(2) Within 32 kilometers of any of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) facilities (Very Long Baseline Array Stations) centered on the following geographical coordinates:


(3) The National Science Foundation (NSF) point of contact for coordination is: Division of Astronomical Sciences, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit, 2415 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22314; Email: *esm@nsf.gov.*

(g) *Specific requirements for WMTS devices in the 1395-1400 and 1427-1432 MHz bands.* Due to the critical nature of communications transmitted under this part, the frequency coordinator in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration will determine whether there are any Federal Government systems whose operations could affect, or could be affected by, proposed WMTS operations in the 1395-1400 MHz and 1427-1432 MHz bands. The locations of government systems in these bands are specified in footnotes US351 and US352 of § 2.106 of this chapter.


(h) *Obtaining interference protection.* To receive interference protection, parties operating WMTS networks in the 608-614 MHz frequency band shall notify one of the white space database administrators of their operating location pursuant to §§ 15.713(j)(11) and 15.715(p) of this chapter.
