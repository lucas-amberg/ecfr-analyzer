# ยง 95.2369   WMTS field strength limits.

Each WMTS transmitter type must satisfy the field strength limits in this section.


(a) For WMTS transmitter types operating in the 608-614 MHz band, the field strength of the transmitted signal must not exceed 200 mV/m, measured at a distance of 3 meters, using instrumentation with a CISPR quasi-peak detector.


(b) For WMTS transmitter types operating in the 1395-1400 MHz and 1427-1432 MHz bands, the field strength of the transmitted signal must not exceed 740 mV/m, measured at 3 meters, using instrumentation with an averaging detector and a 1 MHz reference bandwidth.
