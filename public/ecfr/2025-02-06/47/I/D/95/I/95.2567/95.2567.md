# § 95.2567   MedRadio radiated power limits.

Each MedRadio transmitter type must be designed such that the MedRadio equivalent isotropically radiated power (M-EIRP) does not exceed the limits in this section. Compliance with these limits must be determined as set forth in § 95.2569.


(a) *Transmitters subject to frequency monitoring—401-406 MHz.* For MedRadio transmitters that are not excepted under § 95.2559(b) from the frequency monitoring requirements of § 95.2559(a):


(1) The M-EIRP within any 300 kHz bandwidth within the 402-405 MHz band must not exceed 25 microwatts.


(2) The M-EIRP within any 100 kHz bandwidth within the 401-402 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands must not exceed 25 microwatts.


(b) *Transmitters excepted from frequency monitoring—401-402 MHz and 405-406 MHz.* For MedRadio transmitters that are excepted under § 95.2559(b)(2) or (3) from the frequency monitoring requirements of § 95.2559(a):


(1) The M-EIRP of any transmitter operating in the 401-401.85 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands must not exceed 250 nanowatts in any 100 kHz bandwidth.


(2) The M-EIRP of any transmitter operating in the 401.85-402 MHz band must not exceed 25 microwatts in any 150 kHz bandwidth.


(c) *Transmitters excepted from frequency monitoring—403.65 MHz.* For MedRadio transmitters that are excepted under § 95.2559(b)(4) from the frequency monitoring requirements of § 95.2559(a), the M-EIRP must not exceed 100 nanowatts in the 300 kHz bandwidth centered at 403.65 MHz.


(d) *Transmitters—other frequency bands.* For MedRadio transmitters operating in the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, or 451-457 MHz bands:


(1) The peak M-EIRP over the frequency bands of operation must not exceed the lesser of zero dBm (1 mW) or 10 log (B)−7.782 dBm, where B is the MedRadio 20 dB emission bandwidth in megahertz.


(2) The peak power spectral density must not exceed 800 microwatts per megahertz in any one megahertz band.


(e) *Transmitters—2360-2390 MHz band.* For MedRadio transmitters operating in the 2360-2390 MHz band, the M-EIRP over the bands of operation must not exceed the lesser of zero dBm (1 mW) or 10 log (B) dBm, where B is the MedRadio 20 dB emission bandwidth in megahertz.


(f) *Transmitters—2390-2400 MHz band.* For MedRadio transmitters operating in the 2390-2400 MHz band, the M-EIRP over the bands of operation must not exceed the lesser of 13 dBm (20 mW) or 16 + 10 log (B) dBm, where B is the MedRadio 20 dB emission bandwidth in megahertz.
