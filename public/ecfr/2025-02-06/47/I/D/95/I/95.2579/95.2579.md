# ยง 95.2579   MedRadio unwanted emissions limits.

Unwanted emission field strength limits and attenuation requirements apply to each MedRadio transmitter type, as set forth in this section and part 2.


(a) *Field strength limits.* The field strengths of unwanted emissions from each MedRadio transmitter type, measured at a distance of 3 meters, must not exceed the field strength limits shown in the table in this paragraph for the indicated frequency ranges, if the frequencies of these emissions are:


(1) More than 250 kHz outside of the 402-405 MHz band (for devices designed to operate in the 402-405 MHz band);


(2) More than 100 kHz outside of either the 401-402 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands (for devices designed to operate in the 401-402 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands);


(3) In the 406.000-406.100 MHz band (for devices designed to operate in the 401-402 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands); or


(4) More than 2.5 MHz outside of the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz or 451-457 MHz bands (for devices designed to operate in these four bands).


(5) More than 2.5 MHz outside of the 2360-2400 MHz band (for devices designed to operate in the 2360-2400 MHz band).


(b) *Harmonic emissions.* Radiated unwanted emissions from a MedRadio transmitter type must be measured to at least the tenth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency emitted.


(c) *Attenuation requirements, 402-405 MHz.* For MedRadio transmitter types designed to operate in the 402-405 MHz band, unwanted emissions must be attenuated below the maximum permitted transmitter output power by at least:


(1) 20 dB, on any frequency within the 402-405 MHz band that is more than 150 kHz away from the center frequency of the MedRadio channel the transmission is intended to occupy;


(2) 20 dB, on any frequency between 401.750 MHz and 402.000 MHz, and on any frequency between 405 MHz and 405.250 MHz.


(d) *Attenuation requirements, 401-402 MHz, 405-406 MHz.* For MedRadio transmitter types designed to operate in the 401-402 MHz band or 405-406 MHz band, the power of unwanted emissions must be attenuated below the maximum permitted transmitter output power by at least:


(1) 20 dB, on any frequency within the 401-401.85 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands that is:


(i) More than 75 kHz away from the center frequency of the MedRadio channel the transmission is intended to occupy if the MedRadio transmitter type is operating on a frequency between 401.85 and 402 MHz; or,


(ii) More than 50 kHz away from the center frequency of the MedRadio channel the transmission is intended to occupy and 100 kHz or less below 401 MHz or above 406 MHz.


(2) 20 dB, on any frequency between 400.900 MHz and 401.000 MHz, and on any frequency between 406.000 MHz and 406.100 MHz.


(e) *Attenuation requirements, 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, and 451-457 MHz.* For MedRadio transmitter types designed to operate in the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz and 451-457 MHz bands: In the first 2.5 megahertz above or below any of the frequency bands authorized for Medical Micropower Network operation, the EIRP of any unwanted emission must be attenuated within a 1 megahertz bandwidth by at least 20 dB relative to the maximum EIRP within any 1 megahertz bandwidth of the fundamental emission.


(f) *Attenuation requirements, 2360-2400 MHz.* For MedRadio transmitter types designed to operate in the 2360-2400 MHz band: In the first 2.5 megahertz above or below any of the frequency bands authorized for MBAN operation, the EIRP of any unwanted emission must be attenuated within a 1 megahertz bandwidth by at least 20 dB relative to the maximum EIRP within any 1 megahertz bandwidth of the fundamental emission.


(g) *Measurements.* Compliance with the limits in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation using a peak detector function with an instrument resolution bandwidth approximately equal to 1.0 percent of the emission bandwidth of the device under measurement.
