# ยง 95.2987   Additional PLB and MSLD certification requirements.

(a) To be certified for use under this subpart, 406 MHz PLB transmitter types must be designed to satisfy the following additional requirements.


(1) *Certifications.* Beginning January 17, 2018, before submitting an application for FCC certification of a 406 MHz PLB transmitter type, the applicant must obtain:


(i) Certification from a test facility recognized by one of the COSPAS/SARSAT Partners that the PLB transmitter type satisfies the standards in RTCM 11010; and,


(ii) Certification from an independent test facility that the PLB transmitter type complies with the electrical and environmental standards associated with RTCM 11010.


(2) *Identification code.* An identification code, recognized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Program Manager for the 406 MHz COSPAS/SARSAT satellite system, must be programmed into each PLB to establish a unique identification for that PLB.


(b) To be certified for use under this subpart, MSLD transmitter types must be designed to satisfy the following additional requirements.


(1) A test report from a test laboratory which shows that the MSLD complies with the electrical and environmental standards associated with RTCM 11901. The test laboratory must be accredited to ISO-IEC 17025 with a scope covering the applicable requirements and test procedures.


(2) After the MSLD has been certified by a test laboratory, the following information must be submitted in duplicate to the U.S. Coast Guard, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE., Stop 7126, Washington, DC 20593-7126:


(i) The name of the manufacturer or grantee and model number of the MSLD;


(ii) Copies of the test report and test data showing that the MSLD complies with the electrical and environmental standards associated with RTCM 11901; and


(iii) Instruction manuals associated with the MSLD, description of the test characteristics of the MSLD including assembly drawings, electrical schematics, description of parts list, specifications of materials and the manufacturer's quality assurance program.


(3) After reviewing the information described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the U.S. Coast Guard will issue a letter stating whether the MSLD satisfies all RTCM Recommended Standards. In the case of an MSLD that includes a function intended to send a distress message directly to the U.S. Coast Guard or any other search and rescue organization, the letter will also state whether the U.S. Coast Guard endorses that function.


(4) A certification application for an MSLD must contain a copy of the U.S. Coast Guard letter stating that the device satisfies all RTCM Recommended Standards, a copy of the technical test data, and the instruction manual(s).
