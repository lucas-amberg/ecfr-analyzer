# ยง 95.3367   76-81 GHz Band Radar Service radiated power limits.

The fundamental radiated emission limits within the 76-81 GHz band are expressed in terms of Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) and are as follows:


(a) The maximum power (EIRP) within the 76-81 GHz band shall not exceed 50 dBm based on measurements employing a power averaging detector with a 1 MHz Resolution Bandwidth (RBW).


(b) The maximum peak power (EIRP) within the 76-81 GHz band shall not exceed 55 dBm based on measurements employing a peak detector with a 1 MHz RBW.
