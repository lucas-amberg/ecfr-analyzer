# § 301.200   Requests to resolve disputes.

(a) *Non-Federal User requests*—(1) *In general.* A Non-Federal User may submit a written request to NTIA in accordance with this section to establish a Dispute Resolution Board (hereinafter “board”) to resolve an actual, unresolved dispute that has arisen between the Non-Federal User and a Federal Entity regarding the execution, timing, or cost of the Transition Plan submitted by the Federal Entity pursuant to section 113(h)(1) of the NTIA Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(h)(1)).

To the extent that the parties cannot resolve such dispute on an informal basis or through good faith negotiation, they are strongly encouraged to use expedited alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or non-binding arbitration, before submitting a written request in accordance with this section to establish a board.

(4) *Contents of request.* In order to be considered by a board under this subpart, a request must include:

(iii) A detailed description of each of the claims upon which a resolution is sought by and available to the Non-Federal User;
