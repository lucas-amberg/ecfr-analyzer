(a) *Fee review approach.* To execute NTIA's fee review and approval process, NTIA shall utilize FirstNet's submission and FirstNet's standard financial documentation.


(b) *Deference to FirstNet on necessary reserve funds.* In executing NTIA's fee review and approval process, NTIA shall defer to FirstNet with respect to its designated amount, use, and retention of necessary reserve funds. NTIA shall consider any such designated funds to be a part of FirstNet's total expenses in carrying out its powers, duties, and responsibilities under 47 U.S.C. 1401 *et seq.* for the fiscal year involved.


(c) *Determination of fee review.* (1) NTIA shall make one of the following determinations annually upon review of FirstNet's proposed fees:


(i) FirstNet's proposed fees, in aggregate, when combined with any projected non-fee-based income to be received by FirstNet, meet but do not exceed FirstNet's projected total expenses;


(ii) FirstNet's proposed fees, in aggregate, when combined with any projected non-fee-based income to be received by FirstNet, do not meet FirstNet's projected total expenses; or


(iii) FirstNet's proposed fees, in aggregate, when combined with any projected non-fee-based income to be received by FirstNet, exceed FirstNet's projected total expenses.


(2) Upon making any of the determinations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, NTIA will communicate its determination in writing to the Chair of the FirstNet Board and the FirstNet Chief Executive Officer.


(d) *Outcome of determination of fee review.* (1) Should NTIA make the determination listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, FirstNet may assess the proposed fees.

(e) *Revision of proposed fees.* Upon a disapproval of FirstNet's proposed fees as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, or upon FirstNet's determination that it must revise NTIA-approved fees to ensure compliance with 47 U.S.C. 1428(b), FirstNet shall prepare a revised written submission to NTIA, which shall evaluate any proposed fees therein consistent with the requirements in §§ 500.1 through 500.5. Should NTIA disapprove of FirstNet's proposed fees pursuant to this section, fees approved by NTIA for the prior fiscal year may be assessed by FirstNet during the instant fiscal year until such time that NTIA approves FirstNet's proposed fees for the instant fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.
