# 1.303   Publication and codification.

(a) Agency-wide acquisition regulations shall be published in the _Federal Register_ as required by law, shall be codified under an assigned chapter in Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, and shall parallel the FAR in format, arrangement, and numbering system (but see 1.104-1(c)).
