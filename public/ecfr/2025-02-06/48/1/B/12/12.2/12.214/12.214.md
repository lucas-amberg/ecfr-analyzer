# 12.214   Cost Accounting Standards.

Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) do not apply to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services when these contracts and subcontracts are firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment (provided that the price adjustment is not based on actual costs incurred). See 30.201-1 for CAS applicability to fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts and subcontracts for commercial products or commercial services when the price adjustment is based on actual costs incurred. When CAS applies, the contracting officer shall insert the appropriate provisions and clauses as prescribed in in 30.201.
