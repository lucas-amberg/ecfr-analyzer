# 12.501   Applicability.

(a) This subpart applies to any contract or subcontract at any tier for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.

This limitation is intended to preclude establishment of unusual contractual arrangements solely for the purpose of Government sales.


(c) For purposes of this subpart, contractors awarded subcontracts under subpart 19.8, Contracting with the Small Business Administration (the 8(a) Program), shall be considered prime contractors.
