# 9.402   Policy.

(a) Agencies shall solicit offers from, award contracts to, and consent to subcontracts with responsible contractors only. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with this subpart, are appropriate means to effectuate this policy.


(b) The serious nature of debarment and suspension requires that these remedies be imposed only in the public interest for the Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies shall impose debarment or suspension to protect the Government's interest and only for the causes and in accordance with the procedures in this subpart.


(c) Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.


(d) When more than one agency has an interest in the debarment or suspension of a contractor, the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee, established under Executive Order 12549, and authorized by section 873 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417) (31 U.S.C. 6101 note), shall resolve the lead agency issue and coordinate such resolution among all interested agencies prior to the initiation of any suspension, debarment, or related administrative action by any agency.


(e) Agencies shall establish appropriate procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this subpart.
