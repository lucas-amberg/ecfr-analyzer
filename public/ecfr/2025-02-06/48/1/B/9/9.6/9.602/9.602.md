# 9.602   General.

(a) Contractor team arrangements may be desirable from both a Government and industry standpoint in order to enable the companies involved toâ€”


(1) Complement each other's unique capabilities; and


(2) Offer the Government the best combination of performance, cost, and delivery for the system or product being acquired.


(b) Contractor team arrangements may be particularly appropriate in complex research and development acquisitions, but may be used in other appropriate acquisitions, including production.


(c) The companies involved normally form a contractor team arrangement before submitting an offer. However, they may enter into an arrangement later in the acquisition process, including after contract award.
