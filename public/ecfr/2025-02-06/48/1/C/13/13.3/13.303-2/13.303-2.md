(c) BPAs may be established with—


(1) More than one supplier for supplies or services of the same type to provide maximum practicable competition;


(2) A single firm from which numerous individual purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold will likely be made in a given period; or


(3) Federal Supply Schedule contractors, if not inconsistent with the terms of the applicable schedule contract.


(d) BPAs should be prepared without a purchase requisition and only after contacting suppliers to make the necessary arrangements for—

(2) Documenting individual purchase transactions;


(3) Periodic billings; and


(4) Incorporating other necessary details.
