(a) Construction and architect-engineer contracts (see part 36). 


(b) Subsistence contracts. 


(c) Supplies or services contracts requiring special contract formats prescribed elsewhere in this part that are inconsistent with the uniform format.

(e) Contracts exempted by the agency head or designee.
