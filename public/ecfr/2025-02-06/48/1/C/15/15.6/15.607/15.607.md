(2) Closely resembles a pending competitive acquisition requirement; 


(3) Does not relate to the activity's mission; or 


(4) Does not demonstrate an innovative and unique method, approach, or concept, or is otherwise not deemed a meritorious proposal. 


(b) The contracting officer may commence negotiations on a sole source basis only when— 


(1) An unsolicited proposal has received a favorable comprehensive evaluation; 


(2) A justification and approval has been obtained (see 6.302-1(a)(2)(i) for research proposals or other appropriate provisions of subpart 6.3, and 6.303-2(c)); 


(3) The agency technical office sponsoring the contract furnishes the necessary funds; and
