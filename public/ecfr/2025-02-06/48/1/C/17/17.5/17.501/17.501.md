# 17.501   General.

(a) Interagency acquisitions are commonly conducted through indefinite-delivery contracts, such as task- and delivery-order contracts. The indefinite-delivery contracts used most frequently to support interagency acquisitions are Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), and multi-agency contracts (MACs).


(b) An agency shall not use an interagency acquisition to circumvent conditions and limitations imposed on the use of funds.


(c) An interagency acquisition is not exempt from the requirements of subpart 7.3, Contractor Versus Government Performance.


(d) An agency shall not use an interagency acquisition to make acquisitions conflicting with any other agency's authority or responsibility (for example, that of the Administrator of General Services under title 40, United States Code, “Public Buildings, Property and Works” and 41 U.S.C. division C of subtitle I, Procurement).
