(a) *National Response Framework.* The National Response Framework (NRF) is a guide to how the Nation conducts all-hazards response. This key document establishes a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to domestic incident response. The Framework identifies the key response principles, roles and structures that organize national response. It describes how communities, States, the Federal Government, the private-sector, and nongovernmental partners apply these principles for a coordinated, effective national response. It also describes special circumstances where the Federal Government exercises a larger role, including incidents where Federal interests are involved and catastrophic incidents where a State would require significant support. The NRF is available at *https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/117791”*.


(b) *OFPP Guidelines.* The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) “Emergency Acquisitions Guide” is available at *https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/assets/procurement_guides/emergency_acquisitions_guide.pdf*.
