(a) Status as an EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program is determined by the Small Business Administration in accordance with 13 CFR part 127.


(b) For a WOSB that seeks a WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole-source contract, the contracting officer shall verify that the offerorâ€”

(2) Is designated as a certified EDWOSB or WOSB concern in SAM (see 19.1505(d) for set aside procedures). Pending applications for certification are only in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) at *https://web.sba.gov/pro-net/search/dsp_dsbs.cfm.*

Agencies shall not count or include the award toward the small business goals for an EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program and must update FPDS from the date of award to reflect the final SBA decision.


(d) A joint venture may be considered an EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program if the EDWOSB or WOSB participant is certified in SAM (see section 19.1505(d) for set-aside procedures) and the joint venture meets the requirements of 13 CFR 127.506.
