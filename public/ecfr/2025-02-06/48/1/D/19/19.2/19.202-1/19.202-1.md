# 19.202-1   Encouraging small business participation in acquisitions.

Small business concerns shall be afforded an equitable opportunity to compete for all contracts that they can perform to the extent consistent with the Government's interest. When applicable, the contracting officer shall take the following actions:


(a) Divide proposed acquisitions of supplies and services (except construction) into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement.


(b) Plan acquisitions such that, if practicable, more than one small business concern may perform the work, if the work exceeds the amount for which a surety may be guaranteed by SBA against loss under 15 U.S.C. 694b (see definition of “Applicable Statutory Limit” at 13 CFR 115.10).




(c) Ensure that delivery schedules are established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government.


(d) Encourage prime contractors to subcontract with small business concerns (see subpart 19.7).


(e)(1) Provide a copy of the proposed acquisition package and other reasonably obtainable information related to the acquisition to the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see 19.402(a)) at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation if—


(i) The proposed acquisition is for supplies or services currently being provided by a small business and the proposed acquisition is of a quantity or estimated dollar value, the magnitude of which makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract;


(ii) The proposed acquisition is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects and the magnitude of this consolidation makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract;


(iii) The proposed acquisition is for a consolidated or bundled requirement. (See 7.107-5(a) for mandatory 30-day notice requirement to incumbent small business concerns.) The contracting officer shall provide all information relative to the justification for the consolidation or bundling, including the acquisition plan or strategy, and if the acquisition involves substantial bundling, the information identified in 7.107-4. The contracting officer shall also provide the same information to the agency Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization; or


(iv) The acquisition will be reviewed at the PCR's discretion.


(2) For acquisitions described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, provide a statement explaining why the—


(i) Proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;


(ii) Delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government;


(iii) Proposed acquisition cannot be structured so as to make it likely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract; 


(iv) Consolidated construction project cannot be acquired as separate discrete projects; or


(v) Consolidation or bundling is necessary and justified.


(3) Process the 30-day notification concurrently with other processing steps required prior to the issuance of the solicitation.


(4) If the contracting officer rejects the SBA PCR's recommendation made in accordance with 19.402(c)(2), document the basis for the rejection and notify the SBA PCR in accordance with 19.502-8.
