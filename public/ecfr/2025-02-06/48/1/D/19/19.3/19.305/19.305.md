# 19.305   Reviews of SDB status.

This section applies to reviews of a small business concern's SDB status as a prime contractor or subcontractor.


(a) SBA may initiate the review of SDB status on any firm that has represented itself to be an SDB on a prime contract or subcontract to a Federal prime contract whenever it receives credible information calling into question the SDB status of the firm.


(b) Requests for an SBA review of SDB status may be forwarded to the Small Business Administration, Associate Administrator for Business Development (AA/BD), 409 Third Street SW., Washington, DC 20416.




(c) An SBA review of a subcontractor's SDB status differs from a formal protest. Protests of a concern's size as a prime contractor are processed under 19.302. Protests of a concern's size as a subcontractor are processed under 19.703(b).
