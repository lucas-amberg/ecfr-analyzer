# 19.802   Determining eligibility for the 8(a) program.

Determining the eligibility of a small business to be a participant in the 8(a) program is the responsibility of the SBA. SBA's regulations on eligibility requirements for participation in the 8(a) program are found at 13 CFR 124.101 through 124.112.  SBA designates the concern as an 8(a) participant in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) at *https://web.sba.gov/pro-net/search/dsp_dsbs.cfm*. SBA's designation also appears in the System for Award Management (SAM).
