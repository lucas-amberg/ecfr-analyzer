# 19.804-4   Repetitive acquisitions.

In order for repetitive acquisitions to be awarded through the 8(a) program, there must be separate offers and acceptances. This allows the SBA to determineâ€”


(a) Whether the requirement should be a competitive 8(a) award;


(b) A nominated 8(a) participant's eligibility, and whether or not it is the same 8(a) participant that performed the previous contract;


(c) The effect that contract award would have on the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts; and


(d) Whether the requirement should continue under the 8(a) program.
