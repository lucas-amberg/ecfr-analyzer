# 19.806   Pricing the 8(a) contract.

(a) The contracting officer shall price the 8(a) contract in accordance with subpart 15.4. If required by subpart 15.4, the SBA shall obtain certified cost or pricing data from the 8(a) contractor. If the SBA requests audit assistance to determine the proposed price to be fair and reasonable in a sole source acquisition, the contracting activity shall furnish it to the extent it is available. 


(b) An 8(a) contract, sole source or competitive, may not be awarded if the price of the contract results in a cost to the contracting agency which exceeds a fair market price.


(c) If requested by the SBA, the contracting officer shall make available the data used to estimate the fair market price within 10 working days.


(d) The negotiated contract price and the estimated fair market price are subject to the concurrence of the SBA. In the event of a disagreement between the contracting officer and the SBA, the SBA may appeal in accordance with 19.810.
