# 19.808-2   Competitive.

In competitive 8(a) acquisitions, including follow-on 8(a) acquisitions, subject to part 15, the contracting officer conducts negotiations directly with the competing 8(a) participants. Conducting competitive negotiations among eligible 8(a) participants prior to SBA's formal acceptance of the acquisition for the 8(a) program may be grounds for the SBA's not accepting the acquisition for the 8(a) program.
