# 22.103-3   Procedures.

(a) Solicitations normally shall not specify delivery or performance schedules that may require overtime at Government expense.


(b) In negotiating contracts, contracting officers should, consistent with the Government's needs, attempt to (1) ascertain the extent that offers are based on the payment of overtime and shift premiums and (2) negotiate contract prices or estimated costs without these premiums or obtain the requirement from other sources.


(c) When it becomes apparent during negotiations of applicable contracts (see 22.103-5(b)) that overtime will be required in contract performance, the contracting officer shall secure from the contractor a request for all overtime to be used during the life of the contract, to the extent that the overtime can be estimated with reasonable certainty. The contractor's request shall contain the information required by paragraph (b) of the clause at 52.222-2, Payment for Overtime Premiums.
