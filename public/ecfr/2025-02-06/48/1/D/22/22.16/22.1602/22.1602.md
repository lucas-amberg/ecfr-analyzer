# 22.1602   Policy.

(a) Executive Order 13496 requires contractors to post a notice informing employees of their rights under Federal labor laws.


(b) The Secretary has determined that the notice must contain employee rights under the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. 151 *et seq.* The Act encourages collective bargaining, and protects the exercise by employees of their freedom to associate, to self-organize, and to designate representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.
