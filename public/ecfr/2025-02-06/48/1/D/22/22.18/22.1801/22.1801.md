# 22.1801   Definitions.

As used in this subpart—


*Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item*—


(1) Means any item of supply that is—


(i) A commercial product (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial product” at 2.101;


(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and


(iii) Offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and


(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and petroleum products. Per 46 CFR 525.1 (c)(2), “bulk cargo” means cargo that is loaded and carried in bulk onboard ship without mark or count, in a loose unpackaged form, having homogenous characteristics. Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal equipment, except LASH or Seabee barges, is subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.


*Employee assigned to the contract* means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), who is directly performing work, in the United States, under a contract that is required to include the clause prescribed at 22.1803. An employee is not considered to be directly performing work under a contract if the employee—


(1) Normally performs support work, such as indirect or overhead functions; and


(2) Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.


*Subcontract* means any contract, as defined in 2.101, entered into by a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of a prime contract or a subcontract. It includes but is not limited to purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders.


*Subcontractor* means any supplier, distributor, vendor, or firm that furnishes supplies or services to or for a prime contractor or another subcontractor.


*United States,* as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38), means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
