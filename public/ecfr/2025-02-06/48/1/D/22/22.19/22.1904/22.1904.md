If the amount is zero or below, there will be no increase paid for this worker.




(3) The contracting officer shall not adjust the contract price for any costs other than those identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall not provide duplicate price adjustments with any price adjustment under clauses implementing the Service Contract Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute.
