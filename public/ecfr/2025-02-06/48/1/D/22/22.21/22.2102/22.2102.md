(b) *Interaction with other laws.* Nothing in E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR part 13 shall excuse noncompliance with or supersede any applicable Federal or State law, any applicable law or municipal ordinance, or a collective bargaining agreement requiring greater paid sick leave or leave rights than those established under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13.

For additional details regarding paid time off policies, see 29 CFR 13.5(f)(5)(ii) and (iii).
