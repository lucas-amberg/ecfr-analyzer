# 23.107-3   Energy-consuming products and water-consuming products.

(a) *Authorities.* (1) Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6361(a)(1)).


(2) National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253, 8259b, and 8262g).


(3) Executive Order 11912 of April 13, 1976, Delegations of Authority under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.


(4) Executive Order 13221 of July 31, 2001, Energy-Efficient Standby Power Devices.


(b) *Programs*—(1) ENERGY STAR® *Program.* The ENERGY STAR® program is a voluntary product-labeling initiative that identifies and promotes energy and water efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This joint U.S. EPA and Department of Energy program helps buyers save money and protect the environment through energy- and water-efficient products and practices.


(2) *Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP).* FEMP publishes acquisition guidance to help Federal buyers meet requirements for purchasing energy-efficient and water-efficient products. In addition, in product categories not covered by the ENERGY STAR® program, FEMP sets efficiency requirements for product categories that have the potential to generate significant Federal energy savings.


(c) *Procedures.* To the maximum extent practicable in accordance with 23.104(a), unless a justification, exception, or exemption applies (see 23.104(a), 23.105, and 23.106, respectively)—


(1) When acquiring energy- and water-consuming products listed in the ENERGY STAR® Program or FEMP—


(i) Agencies shall purchase ENERGY STAR® certified or FEMP-designated products; and


(ii) For products that consume power in a standby mode and are listed on FEMP's Low Standby Power Devices product listing *at https://www.energy.gov/eere/femp/low-standby-power-product-list,* agencies shall—


(A) Purchase items that meet FEMP's standby power wattage recommendation or document the reason for not purchasing such items; or


(B) If FEMP has listed a product without a corresponding wattage recommendation, purchase items that use no more than one watt in their standby power consuming mode. When it is impracticable to meet the one-watt requirement, agencies shall purchase items with the lowest standby wattage practicable; and


(2) When contracting for services or construction that will include the provision of energy- and water-consuming products, agencies shall specify products that comply with the applicable requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
