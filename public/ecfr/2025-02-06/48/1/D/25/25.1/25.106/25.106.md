# 25.106   Determining reasonableness of cost.

(a) The contracting officer—


(1) Must use the evaluation factors in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section unless the head of the agency makes a written determination that the use of higher factors is more appropriate. If the determination applies to all agency acquisitions, the agency evaluation factors must be published in agency regulations; and


(2) Must not apply evaluation factors to offers of eligible products if the acquisition is subject to a trade agreement under subpart 25.4.




(b) *For end products that are not critical items and do not contain critical components.* (1)(i) If there is a domestic offer that is not the low offer, and the restrictions of the Buy American statute apply to the low offer, the contracting officer must determine the reasonableness of the cost of the domestic offer by adding to the price of the low offer, inclusive of duty—


(A) 20 percent, if the lowest domestic offer is from a large business concern; or


(B) 30 percent, if the lowest domestic offer is from a small business concern. The contracting officer must use this factor, or another factor established in agency regulations, in small business set-asides if the low offer is from a small business concern offering the product of a small business concern that is not a domestic end product (*see* subpart 19.5).


(ii) The price of the domestic offer is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)(1)(i) of this section. See evaluation procedures at subpart 25.5.


(2)(i) For end products that are not COTS items and do not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section result in an unreasonable cost determination for the domestic offer or there is no domestic offer received, and the low offer is for a foreign end product that does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the contracting officer shall—


(A) Treat the lowest offer of a foreign end product that is manufactured in the United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer; and


(B) Determine the reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the evaluation factors listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to the low offer.


(ii) The price of the lowest offer of a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)(1)(i) of this section. See evaluation procedures at subpart 25.5.


(iii) The procedures in this paragraph (b)(2) will no longer apply as of January 1, 2030.








(c) *For end products that are critical items or contain critical components.* (1)(i) If there is a domestic offer that is not the low offer, and the restrictions of the Buy American statute apply to the low offer, the contracting officer shall determine the reasonableness of the cost of the domestic offer by adding to the price of the low offer, inclusive of duty—


(A) 20 percent, plus the additional preference factor identified for the critical item or end product containing critical components listed at section 25.105, if the lowest domestic offer is from a large business concern; or


(B) 30 percent, plus the additional preference factor identified for the critical item or end product containing critical components listed at section 25.105, if the lowest domestic offer is from a small business concern. The contracting officer shall use this factor, or another factor established in agency regulations, in small business set-asides if the low offer is from a small business concern offering the product of a small business concern that is not a domestic end product (see subpart 19.5).


(ii) The price of the domestic offer is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. See evaluation procedures at subpart 25.5.


(2)(i) For end products that are not COTS items and do not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section result in an unreasonable cost determination for the domestic offer or there is no domestic offer received, and the low offer is for a foreign end product that does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the contracting officer shall—


(A) Treat the lowest offer of a foreign end product that is manufactured in the United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer; and


(B) Determine the reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the evaluation factors listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to the low offer.


(ii) The price of the lowest offer of a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. See evaluation procedures at subpart 25.5.


(iii) The procedures in this paragraph (c)(2) will no longer apply as of January 1, 2030.
