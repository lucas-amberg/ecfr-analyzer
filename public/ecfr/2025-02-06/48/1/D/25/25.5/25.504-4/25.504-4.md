# 25.504-4   Group award basis.

(a) *Example 1.*

*Problem:* Offeror C specifies all-or-none award. Assume all offerors are large businesses. The acquisition is not covered by the WTO GPA . 


(c) *Example 3.*

*Problem:* The solicitation specifies award on a group basis. Assume only the Buy American statute applies (*i.e.,* no trade agreements apply) and the acquisition cannot be set aside for small business concerns. All offerors are large businesses.


*Analysis:* (see 25.503(d))


*STEP 1:* Determine which of the offers are domestic (see 25.503(d)(1)):


*STEP 2:* Determine which offer, domestic or foreign, is the low offer. If the low offer is a foreign offer, apply the evaluation factor (see 25.503(d)(2)). The low offer (Offer C) is a foreign offer. Therefore, apply the factor to the low offer. Addition of the 20 percent factor (use 30 percent if Offer A is a small business) to Offer C yields an evaluated price of $46,560 ($38,800 + 20 percent). Offer C remains the low offer.


*STEP 3:* Determine if there is a foreign offer that could be treated as a domestic offer (see 25.106(b)(2) and 25.503(d)(2)).


*STEP 4:* If there is a foreign offer that could be treated as a domestic offer, compare the evaluated price of the low offer to the price of the offer treated as domestic (*see* 25.503(d)(3)). Offer B can be treated as a domestic offer ($45,500). The evaluated price of the low offer (Offer C) is $46,560. Award on Offer B.
