(a) *Prior approval requirement.* Under cost-reimbursement contracts, before buying insurance under a group insurance plan, the contractor must submit the plan for approval, in accordance with agency regulations. Any change in benefits provided under an approved plan that can reasonably be expected to increase significantly the cost to the Government requires similar approval.


(b) *Premium refunds or credits.* The plan shall provide for the Government to share in any premium refunds or credits paid or otherwise allowed to the contractor. In determining the extent of the Government's share in any premium refunds or credits, any special reserves and other refunds to which the contractor may be entitled in the future shall be taken into account.
