# 29.401-3   Federal, State, and local taxes.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, insert the clause at 52.229-3, Federal, State, and Local Taxes, in solicitations and contracts ifâ€” 


(1) The contract is to be performed wholly or partly in the United States or its outlying areas; 


(2) A fixed-price contract is contemplated; and 


(3) The contract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. 


(b) In a noncompetitive contract that meets all the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer may insert the clause at 52.229-4, Federal, State, and Local Taxes (State and Local Adjustments), instead of the clause at 52.229-3, if the price would otherwise include an inappropriate contingency for potential postaward change(s) in State or local taxes.
