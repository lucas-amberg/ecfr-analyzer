(b) If the agency desires to waive the countersignature requirement because of the contractor's financial strength, good performance record, and favorable experience concerning cost disallowances, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate I.*

(c) If a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate II.*

(d) If the agency considers a more rapid liquidation appropriate, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate III.*
