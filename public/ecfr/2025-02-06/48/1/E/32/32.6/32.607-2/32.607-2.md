(iii) Projected cash receipts and requirements.

(g) At a minimum, the deferment agreement shall contain the following:

(7) Protective requirements that are considered by the Government to be prudent and feasible in the specific circumstances. The coverage of protective terms at 32.409 and 32.501-5 may be used as a guide.


(h) If a contractor appeal of the debt determination is pending, the deferment agreement shall also include a requirement that the contractor shallâ€”

(2) Pay the debt in full when the appeal is decided, or when the parties reach agreement on the debt amount.
