# 35.011   Data.

(a) R&D contracts shall specify the technical data to be delivered under the contract, since the data clauses required by part 27 do not require the *delivery* of any such data.


(b) In planning a developmental program when subsequent production contracts are contemplated, consideration should be given to the need and time required to obtain a technical package (plans, drawings, specifications, and other descriptive information) that can be used to achieve competition in production contracts. In some situations, the developmental contractor may be in the best position to produce such a technical package.
