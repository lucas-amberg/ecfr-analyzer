(b) The notices required for publication (see 5.205(b)) are placed as required.


(c) There is sufficient Government expertise available to adequately and objectively evaluate the work to be performed by the FFRDC.

(e) Controls are established to ensure that the costs of the services being provided to the Government are reasonable.

(g) A reasonable continuity in the level of support to the FFRDC is maintained, consistent with the agency's need for the FFRDC and the terms of the sponsoring agreement.


(h) The FFRDC is operated, managed, or administered by an autonomous organization or as an identifiably separate operating unit of a parent organization, and is required to operate in the public interest, free from organizational conflict of interest, and to disclose its affairs (as an FFRDC) to the primary sponsor.


(i) Quantity prodution or manufacturing is not performed unless authorized by legislation.


(j) Approval is received from the head of the sponsoring agency.
