# 42.705-4   State and local governments.

The OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix V, concerning cost principles for state and local governments (see Subpart 31.6) establishes the cognizant agency concept and the procedures for determining a cognizant agency for approving State and local government indirect costs associated with federally-funded programs and activities. The indirect cost rates negotiated and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs will be used by all Federal agencies that also award contracts to these same State and local governments.
