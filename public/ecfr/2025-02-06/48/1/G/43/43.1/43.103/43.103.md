# 43.103   Types of contract modifications.

Contract modifications are of the following types:


(a) *Bilateral.* A bilateral modification (supplemental agreement) is a contract modification that is signed by the contractor and the contracting officer. Bilateral modifications are used to—


(1) Make negotiated equitable adjustments resulting from the issuance of a change order;


(2) Definitize letter contracts; and


(3) Reflect other agreements of the parties modifying the terms of contracts.


(b) *Unilateral.* A unilateral modification is a contract modification that is signed only by the contracting officer. Unilateral modifications are used, for example, to—


(1) Make administrative changes;


(2) Issue change orders;


(3) Make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause (*e.g.,* Property clause, Options clause, or Suspension of Work clause); and 


(4) Issue termination notices.
