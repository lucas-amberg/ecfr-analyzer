Special attention shall be given toâ€”


(a) The results of market research accomplished;


(b) The degree of price competition obtained;


(c) Pricing policies and techniques, including methods of obtaining certified cost or pricing data, and data other than certified cost or pricing data;


(d) Methods of evaluating subcontractor responsibility, including the contractor's use of the System for Award Management Exclusions (see 9.404) and, if the contractor has subcontracts with parties on the Exclusions list, the documentation, systems, and procedures the contractor has established to protect the Government's interests (see 9.405-2);


(e) Treatment accorded affiliates and other concerns having close working arrangements with the contractor;


(f) Policies and procedures pertaining to small business concerns, including small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns;
