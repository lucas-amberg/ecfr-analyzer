# 45.102   Policy.

(a) Contractors are ordinarily required to furnish all property necessary to perform Government contracts.


(b) Contracting officers shall provide property to contractors only when it is clearly demonstratedâ€”


(1) To be in the Government's best interest;


(2) That the overall benefit to the acquisition significantly outweighs the increased cost of administration, including ultimate property disposal;


(3) That providing the property does not substantially increase the Government's assumption of risk; and


(4) That Government requirements cannot otherwise be met.


(c) The contractor's inability or unwillingness to supply its own resources is not sufficient reason for the furnishing or acquisition of property.


(d) *Exception.* Property provided under contracts for repair, maintenance, overhaul, or modification is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.


(e) Government property, other than foundations and similar improvements necessary for installing special tooling, special test equipment, or equipment, shall not be installed or constructed on contractor-owned real property in such fashion as to become nonseverable, unless the head of the contracting activity determines that such installation or construction is necessary and in the Government's interest.
