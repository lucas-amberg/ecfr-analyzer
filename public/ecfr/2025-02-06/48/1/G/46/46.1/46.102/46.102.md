# 46.102   Policy.

Agencies shall ensure thatâ€”


(a) Contracts include inspection and other quality requirements, including warranty clauses when appropriate, that are determined necessary to protect the Government's interest.


(b) Supplies or services (including commercial services) tendered by contractors meet contract requirements;


(c) Government contract quality assurance is conducted before acceptance (except as otherwise provided in this part), by or under the direction of Government personnel;


(d) No contract precludes the Government from performing inspection;


(e) Nonconforming supplies or services are rejected, except as otherwise provided in 46.407;


(f) Contracts for commercial products rely on a contractor's existing quality assurance system as a substitute for compliance with Government inspection and testing before tender for acceptance unless customary market practices for the commercial product being acquired permit in-process inspection (41 U.S.C. 3307). Any in-process inspection by the Government shall be conducted in a manner consistent with commercial practice; and


(g) The quality assurance and acceptance services of other agencies are used when this will be effective, economical, or otherwise in the Government's interest (see 42.002 and subpart 42.2).
