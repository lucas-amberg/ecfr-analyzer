The contracting officer may insert the clause in such solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to be at or below the simplified acquisition threshold and inclusion of the clause is in the Government's interest. If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate I.* If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate II.*
