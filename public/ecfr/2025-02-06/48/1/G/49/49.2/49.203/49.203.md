(c) If the settlement is on a total cost basis (see 49.206-2(b)), the contractor shall not be paid more than the total of the amounts in subparagraphs (1) and (2) below, less all disposal and other credits, all advance and progress payments, and all other amounts previously paid under the contract:


(1) The amount negotiated or determined for settlement expenses.


(2) The remainder of the total settlement amount otherwise agreed upon or determined (lines 7 and 14 of SF 1436, Settlement Proposal (Total Cost Basis)) reduced by multiplying the remainder by the ratio of (i) the total contract price to (ii) the remainder plus the estimated cost to complete the entire contract.
