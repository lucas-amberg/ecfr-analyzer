# 49.402-7   Other damages.

(a) If the contracting officer terminates a contract for default or follows a course of action instead of termination for default (see 49.402-4), the contracting officer promptly must assess and demand any liquidated damages to which the Government is entitled under the contract. Under the contract clause at 52.211-11, these damages are in addition to any excess repurchase costs. 


(b) If the Government has suffered any other ascertainable damages, including administrative costs, as a result of the contractor's default, the contracting officer must, on the basis of legal advice, take appropriate action as prescribed in subpart 32.6 to assert the Government's demand for the damages.
