(2) *Construction.* If the contract is for construction, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate I.*

(3) *Partial payments.* If the contract is with an agency of the U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign governments or their agencies, and if the contracting officer determines that the requirement to pay interest on excess partial payments is inappropriate, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate II.* In such contracts for construction, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate III.*

(4) *Time-and-material and labor-hour contracts.* If the contract is a time-and-material or labor-hour contract, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate IV.* If the contract is with an agency of the U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign governments or their agencies, and if the contracting officer determines that the requirement to pay interest on excess partial payments is inappropriate, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its *Alternate V.*

Inapplicable conditions (e.g., paragraphs (e), (j) and (n)) should be deleted and the period for submitting the subcontractor's termination settlement proposal should be reduced (e.g., 6 months).
