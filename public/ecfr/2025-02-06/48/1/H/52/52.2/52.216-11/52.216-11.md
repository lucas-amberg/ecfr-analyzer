# 52.216-11   Cost Contractâ€”No Fee.

As prescribed in 16.307(e), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts when a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated that provides no fee and is not a cost-sharing contract. This clause may be modified by substituting *$10,000* in lieu of *$100,000* as the maximum reserve in paragraph (b) if the Contractor is a nonprofit organization.


*Alternate I* (APR 1984). In a contract for research and development with an educational institution or a nonprofit organization, for which the contracting officer has determined that withholding of a portion of allowable costs is not required, delete paragraph (b) of the basic clause.
