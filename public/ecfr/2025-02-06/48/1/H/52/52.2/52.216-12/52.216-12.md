# 52.216-12   Cost-Sharing Contractâ€”No Fee.

As prescribed in 16.307(f), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts when a cost-sharing contract is contemplated. This clause may be modified by substituting *$10,000* in lieu of *$100,000* as the maximum reserve in paragraph (b) if the contract is with a nonprofit organization.


*Alternate I* (APR 1984). In a contract for research and development with an educational institution, for which the contracting officer has determined that withholding of a portion of allowable cost is not required, delete paragraph (b) of the basic clause.
