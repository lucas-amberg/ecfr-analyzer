# 52.246-18   Warranty of Supplies of a Complex Nature.

As prescribed in 46.710(b)(1), insert a clause substantially as follows:


*Alternate I* [Reserved]


*Alternate II* (APR 1984). If it is desirable to specify that necessary transportation incident to correction or replacement will be at the Government's expense (as might be the case if, for example, the cost of a warranty would otherwise be prohibitive), substitute a paragraph substantially the same as the following paragraph (b)(5) for paragraph (b)(5) of the basic clause:


*Alternate III* (APR 1984). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, add a paragraph substantially the same as the following paragraph (c)(6) to the basic clause:


*Alternate IV* (APR 1984). If it is anticipated that recovery of the warranted item will involve considerable Government expense for disassembly and/or reassembly of larger items, add a paragraph substantially the same as the following paragraph (c)(6) to the basic clause. Redesignate the additional paragraph as (*c*)(*7*) if *Alternate III* is also used:
