# 52.246-8   Inspection of Research and Developmentâ€”Cost-Reimbursement.

As prescribed in 46.308, insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for research and development when (a) the primary objective is the delivery of end items other than designs, drawings, or reports, and (b) a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated; unless use of the clause is impractical and the clause prescribed in 46.309 is considered to be more appropriate:


*Alternate I* (APR 1984). If it is contemplated that the contract will be on a no-fee basis, substitute paragraphs (f) and (g) below for paragraphs (f) and (g) of the basic clause.
