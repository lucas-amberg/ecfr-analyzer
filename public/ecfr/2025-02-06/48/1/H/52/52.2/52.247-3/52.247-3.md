# 52.247-3   Capability To Perform a Contract for the Relocation of a Federal Office.

As prescribed in 47.207-1(b), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for transportation or for transportation-related services when a Federal office is relocated, to ensure that offerors are capable to perform interstate or intrastate moving contracts involving the relocation of Federal offices:


*Alternate I* (APR 1984). If a Federal office move is intrastate and the contracting officer determines that it is in the Government's interest not to apply the requirements for holding or obtaining State authority to operate within the State, and to maintain a facility within the State or Commercial zone, delete paragraph (b) of the basic clause and redesignate the remaining paragraphs (b) and (c). In the 6th line of the new paragraph (b), delete the words *paragraphs (a) and (b) above* and replace them with *paragraph (a) above.*
