(1) Purchases paid for with a Government-wide commercial purchase card;


(2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise classified information or national security;

(2) The contractor has demonstrated that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome; or


(3) The contractor is in the process of transitioning to electronic submission of payment requests, but needs additional time to complete such transition. Authorizations granted on this basis must specify a date by which the contractor will transition to electronic submission.
