(2) In actions not based upon an indictment, where the contractor's submission raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed suspension and if no determination has been made, on the basis of Department of Justice advice, that substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced, the following procedures will be followed:


(i) Provide the contractor an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any person the agency presents;


(ii) A transcribed record of the proceeding will be made, unless the agency and contractor mutually agree to waive the requirement for a transcript. This transcribed record is available to the contractor at cost.

(2)(i) When necessary, written findings of fact shall be prepared as to the disputed material facts. The suspending official will utilize the information in the written findings of fact, the data submitted by the contractor plus any other information in the administrative record to develop the decision.

(iii) After the conclusion of proceedings with respect to disputed facts, the suspending official will make a decision.
