# 1480.802   Representation provision.

(a) Contracting offices must provide copies of the IEE representation to any interested parties upon written request.


(b) The submission of a Solicitation Mailing List Application by an enterprise does not remove the requirement for it to provide representation as an IEE, as required by this part, if it wishes to be considered as an offeror for a specific solicitation. COs may determine the validity of the contents of the applicant's representation.


(c) Any false or misleading information submitted by an enterprise when submitting an offer in consideration for an award set aside under the Buy Indian Act is a violation of the law punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. False claims submitted as part of contract performance are subject to the penalties enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3729 to 3731 and 18 U.S.C. 287.


(d) The CO will review and refer to the appropriate officials all IEE misrepresentation by an offeror or failure to provide written notification of a change in IEE eligibility.
