# 1516.307   Contract clauses.

(a) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause in 1552.216-71, Date of Incurrence of Cost, in cost-reimbursement contracts when an anticipatory cost letter has been issued on the project.


(b) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.216-74, Payment of Fee, in solicitations and contracts where a cost-reimbursement term form contract is contemplated, unless the Contracting Officer determines that such a provision would be detrimental to ensuring proper contract performance.


(c) The Contracting Officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as 48 CFR 1552.216-76, Estimated Cost and Cost-Sharing, in solicitations and contracts where the total incurred costs are shared by the contractor on a straight percentage basis. The Contracting Officer may develop other clauses, as appropriate, following the same approach, but reflecting different cost-sharing arrangements negotiated on specific contract actions.
