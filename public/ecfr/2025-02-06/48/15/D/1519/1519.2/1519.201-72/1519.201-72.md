# 1519.201-72   Small business specialists.

(a) Small Business Specialists (SBSs) shall be appointed in writing. Regional SBSs will normally be appointed from members of staffs of the appointing authority. The appointing authorities for regional SBSs are the RAMs. The SBSs for EPA headquarters, Research Triangle Park (RTP), and Cincinnati shall be appointed by the OSDBU Director. The SBS is administratively responsible directly to the appointing authority and, on matters relating to small business programs activities, receives technical guidance from the OSDBU Director.


(b) A copy of each appointment and termination of all SBSs shall be forwarded to the OSDBU Director. In addition to performing the duties outlined in paragraph (c) of this section that are normally performed in the activity to which assigned, the SBS shall perform such additional functions as may be prescribed from time to time in furtherance of overall small business programs goals. The SBS may be appointed on either a full- or part-time basis; however, when appointed on a part-time basis, small business duties shall take precedence over collateral responsibilities.

(1) Maintain a program designed to locate capable small business sources for current and future acquisitions;


(2) Coordinate inquiries and requests for advice from small business concerns on acquisition matters;

(4) Take action to assure the availability of adequate specifications and drawings, when necessary, to obtain small business participation in an acquisition.
