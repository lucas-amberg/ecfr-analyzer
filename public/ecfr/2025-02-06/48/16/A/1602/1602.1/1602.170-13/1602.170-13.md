# 1602.170-13   Similarly sized subscriber groups.

(a) A *Similarly sized subscriber group* (SSSG) is a non-FEHB employer group that:


(1) As of the date specified by OPM in the rate instructions, has a subscriber enrollment closest to the FEHBP subscriber enrollment;


(2) Uses traditional community rating; and,


(3) Meets the criteria specified in the rate instructions issued by OPM.


(b) Any group with which an entity enters into an agreement to provide health care services is a potential SSSG (including groups that are traditional community rated and covered by separate lines of business, government entities, groups that have multi-year contracts, and groups having point-of-service products) except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(1) An entity's subscriber groups may be included as an SSSG if the entity is any of the following:


(i) The carrier;


(ii) A division or subsidiary of the carrier;


(iii) A separate line of business or qualified separate line of business of the carrier; or


(iv) An entity that maintains a contractual arrangement with the carrier to provide healthcare benefits.


(2) A subscriber group covered by an entity meeting any of the criteria under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be included for comparison as a SSSG if the entity meets any of the following criteria:


(i) It reports financial statements on a consolidated basis with the carrier; or


(ii) Shares, delegates, or otherwise contracts with the carrier, any portion of its workforce that involves the management, design, pricing, or marketing of the healthcare product.


(c) The following groups must be excluded from SSSG consideration:


(1) Groups the carrier rates by the method of retrospective experience rating;


(2) Groups consisting of the carrier's own employees;


(3) Medicaid groups, Medicare-only groups, and groups that receive only excepted benefits as defined at 26 U.S.C. 9832(c);


(4) A purchasing alliance whose rate-setting is mandated by the State or local government;


(5) Administrative Service Organizations (ASOs);


(6) Any other group excluded from consideration as specified in the rate instructions issued by OPM.


(d) OPM shall determine the FEHBP rate by selecting the lowest rate derived by using rating methods consistent with those used to derive the SSSG rate.


(e) In the event that a State-mandated TCR carrier has no SSSG, then it will be subject to the FEHB specific MLR requirement.
