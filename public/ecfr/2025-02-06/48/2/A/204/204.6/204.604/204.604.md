# 204.604   Responsibilities.

(1) The process for reporting contract actions to FPDS should, where possible, be automated by incorporating it into contract writing systems.


(2) Data in FPDS is stored indefinitely and is electronically retrievable. Therefore, the contracting officer may reference the contract action report (CAR) approval date in the associated Government contract file instead of including a paper copy of the electronically submitted CAR in the file. Such reference satisfies contract file documentation requirements of FAR 4.803(a).


(3) By December 15th of each year, the chief acquisition officer of each DoD component required to report its contract actions shall submit to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy, its annual certification and data validation results for the preceding fiscal year in accordance with the DoD Data Improvement Plan requirements at *https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/cap/index.html.* The Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy, will submit a consolidated DoD annual certification to the Office of Management and Budget by January 5th of each year.
