*Attachment* means any documentation, appended to a contract or incorporated by reference, which does not establish a requirement for deliverables.


*Definitized item,* as used in this subpart, means an item for which a firm price has been established in the basic contract or by modification.

*Undefinitized item,* as used in this subpart, means an item for which a price has not been established in the basic contract or by modification.
