(2) Effective January 1, 2027, do not acquire any covered material mined, refined, separated, melted, or produced in any covered country, or any end item, manufactured in any covered country, that contains a covered material. (Section 854, Pub. L. 118-31; 10 U.S.C. 4872.)


(b) *Samarium-cobalt magnets and neodymium-iron-boron magnets.* (1) Effective through December 31, 2026, for samarium-cobalt magnets and neodymium-iron-boron magnets, this restriction includes—


(i) Melting samarium with cobalt to produce the samarium-cobalt alloy or melting neodymium with iron and boron to produce the neodymium-iron-boron alloy; and


(ii) All subsequent phases of production of the magnets, such as powder formation, pressing, sintering or bonding, and magnetization.


(2) Effective January 1, 2027, for samarium-cobalt magnets this restriction includes the entire supply chain from mining or production of a cobalt and samarium ore or feedstock, including recycled material, through production of finished magnets, except as provided at 225.7018-3.


(3) The restriction on melting and producing of samarium-cobalt magnets is in addition to any applicable restrictions on melting of specialty metals at 225.7003 and the clause at 252.225-7009, Restriction on Acquisition of Certain Articles Containing Specialty Metals.

(c) *Tantalum metals and alloys.* (1) Effective through December 31, 2026, for production of tantalum metals of any kind and alloys, this restriction includes the reduction or melting of any form of tantalum to create tantalum metal including unwrought, powder, mill products, and alloys. The restriction also covers all subsequent phases of production of tantalum metals and alloys.


(2) Effective January 1, 2027, for production of tantalum metals of any kind and alloys, this restriction includes mining or production of a tantalum ore or feedstock, including recycled material, through production of metals of any kind and alloys, except as provided at 225.7018-3.


(d) *Tungsten metal powder and tungsten heavy alloy.* (1) Effective through December 31, 2026, for production of tungsten metal powder and tungsten heavy alloy, this restriction includes—
