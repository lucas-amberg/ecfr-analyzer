# 225.7705-3   Procedures.

(a) The contracting officer shall not obligate or expend funds for contracts for a construction or other infrastructure program or project in Afghanistan, awarded after December 23, 2016, unless the requiring activity provides the following documentation:


(1) Written affirmation that military or civilian personnel of the United States Government or their representatives, with authority to conduct oversight of such program or project, can safely access such program or project; or


(2)(i) For programs or projects valued at less than $1 million, sufficient information upon which to base the determination described in 225.7705-2(a); or


(ii)(A) For programs or projects valued at $1 million or more, a copy of the approved determination described in 225.7705-2(a) and (b); and


(B) For programs or projects valued at $40 million or more, a copy of the Congressional notification described in 225.7705-2(c).


(b) After contract award, the contracting officer shall review the requiring activity's progress reports (*e.g.,* contracting officer's representative reports) that addresses whether access continues to be safe or security conditions continue to permit effective implementation and oversight of the contract. If the requiring activity does not affirm continued safe access or, if a determination to waive the prohibition has been approved, that security conditions continue to permit effective implementation and oversight of the contract, then the contracting officer shall consult with the requiring activity to take any appropriate actions.
