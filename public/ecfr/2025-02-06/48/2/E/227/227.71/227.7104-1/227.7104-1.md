# 227.7104-1   Policy.

(a) Do not require an offeror, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data related to items, components, or processes developed under a SBIR/STTR contract or any rights in computer software generated under a SBIR/STTR contract except for the standard rights identified at 227.7104-2.


(b) Do not prohibit contractors and offerors from furnishing or offering to furnish items, components, or processes developed under a SBIR/STTR contract or computer software generated under a SBIR/STTR contract solely because the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose such computer software or technical data pertaining to those items, components, or processes may be restricted.


(c) Consistent with the guidance in this section, 227.7103-10(a)(5), 227.7203-10(a)(5), and other acquisition guidance applicable to SBIR/STTR solicitations, the Government may use information provided by offerors in response to a solicitation in the source selection process to evaluate the impact of proposed restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose technical data or computer software.
