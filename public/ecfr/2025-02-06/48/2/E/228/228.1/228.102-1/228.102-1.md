(1) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $40,000, but not exceeding $150,000, payment protection sufficient to pay labor and material costs, using any of the alternatives listed at FAR 28.102-1(b)(1). 


(2) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $150,000â€”


(i) A payment bond sufficient to pay labor and material costs; and 


(ii) A performance bond in an equal amount if available at no additional cost.
