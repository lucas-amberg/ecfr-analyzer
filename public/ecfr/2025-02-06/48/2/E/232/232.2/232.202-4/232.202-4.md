# 232.202-4   Security for Government financing.

(a)(2) When determining whether an offeror's financial condition is adequate security, see 232.072-2 and 232.072-3 for guidance. It should be noted that an offeror's financial condition may be sufficient to make the contractor responsible for award purposes, but may not be adequate security for commercial contract financing.
