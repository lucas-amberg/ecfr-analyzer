(b) The 10 percent limit also applies to contract modifications, including modifications involving—


(1) Work not initially included in the contract; apply the 10 percent limit to the revised total estimated construction cost; and


(2) Redesign work; apply the 10 percent limit by—


(i) Adding the estimated construction cost of the redesign features to the original estimated construction cost;


(ii) Adding the contract cost for the original design to the contract cost for redesign; and
