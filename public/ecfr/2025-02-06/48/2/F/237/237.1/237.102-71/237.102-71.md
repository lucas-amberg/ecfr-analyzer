(C) A discussion of the benefits to be realized from the alternative.


(D) A best value determination of each alternative and a detailed explanation of the life-cycle cost calculations used in the determination.

If the program officials decide to request a waiver from the Secretary of Defense under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures at PGI 237.102-71.
