# 239.7408-2   Applicability of construction labor standards for special construction.

(a) The construction labor standards in FAR Subpart 22.4 ordinarily do not apply to special construction. However, if the special construction includes construction, alteration, or repair (as defined in FAR 22.401) of a public building or public work, the construction labor standards may apply. Determine applicability under FAR 22.402.


(b) Each CSA or other type contract which is subject to construction labor standards under FAR 22.402 shall cite that fact.
