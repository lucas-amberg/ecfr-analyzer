# 247.570   Scope.

This subpart—


(a) Implements—


(1) The Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (“the 1904 Act”), 10 U.S.C. 2631, which applies to the ocean transportation of cargo owned by, destined for use by, or otherwise transported by DoD;






(2) Section 1017 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364) (10 U.S.C. 2631 note), which requires consideration, in solicitations requiring a covered vessel, of the extent to which offerors have had overhaul, repair, and maintenance work performed in shipyards located in the United States or Guam; 


(3) Section 3504 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417) (10 U.S.C. chapter 257 note), which addresses requirements that apply to riding gang members and DoD-exempted individuals (see 252.247-7027(c)) who perform work on U.S.-flag vessels under DoD contracts for transportation services documented under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121; and




(4) Section 1024 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Pub. L. 116-283), which updates the listed circumstances where DoD may waive the requirement that DoD supplies be transported by sea in vessels belonging to the United States or vessels of the United States, and it modifies the requirement for reflagging or repair work in the United States for vessels used under time-charter contracts.












(b) Does not specifically implement the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (“the 1954 Act”), 46 U.S.C. chapter 553. The 1954 Act is applicable to DoD, but DFARS coverage is not required because compliance with the 1904 Act historically has resulted in DoD exceeding the 1954 Act's requirements; and




(c) Does not implement—


(1) Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 U.S.C. chapters 121 and 552), commonly known as the “Jones Act,” for the application of coastwise trade; or


(2) Waivers thereof pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 501.
