The Contractor shall follow the marking procedures in paragraph (g)(1) of this clause.




(h) *Contractor procedures and records.* Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, shall—

(k) *Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or computer software documentation.* (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under this contract when—

(ii) The Contractor shall use the clause at DFARS 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, to govern computer software or computer software documentation that is SBIR/STTR data.


(iii) No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's computer software or computer software documentation.
