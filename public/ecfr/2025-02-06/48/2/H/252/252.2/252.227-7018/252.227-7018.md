The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (c)(4) of the DFARS 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such software must promptly notify the above named Contractor.


(6) *SBIR/STTR data rights markings.* Except for technical data or computer software in which the Government has acquired unlimited rights under paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or negotiated special license rights as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this clause, technical data or computer software generated under this contract shall be marked as follows. The Contractor shall enter the expiration date for the SBIR/STTR data protection period on the legend:


The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software marked with this legend are restricted during the period shown as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of the DFARS 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, clause contained in the above identified contract.

(ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (c)(7) of this clause).


(8) *Preexisting data markings.* If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the prior contract or license. The Contractor shall follow the marking procedures in paragraph (g)(1) of this clause.








(h) *Contractor procedures and records.* Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data or computer software with other than unlimited rights, shall—


(1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and


(2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered under this contract.








(i) *Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings.* (1) *Unjustified markings.* The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the DFARS 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, and the DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.


(2) *Nonconforming markings.* A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the DFARS 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, or the DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within 60 days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.




(j) *Relation to patents.* Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.


(k) *Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software.* (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when—


(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or


(ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.


(2) The limitation in paragraph (k)(1) of this clause—


(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and


(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will be delivered.








(l) *Subcontractors or suppliers.* (1) The Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 3771-3775, 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786, 15 U.S.C. 638(j)(1)(B)(iii) and (v), and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (f) of this clause are recognized and protected.


(2) Whenever any other than commercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use the following clause(s) in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties:


(i) Except as provided in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this clause, use this clause to govern SBIR/STTR data.


(ii) For data that are not SBIR/STTR data—


(A) Use the clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, to govern the technical data pertaining to other than commercial products or commercial services or to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, and use the clause at DFARS 252.227-7015, Technical Data—Commercial Products and Commercial Services, to govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed exclusively at private expense;


(B) Use the DFARS clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, to govern other than commercial computer software and computer software documentation; and


(C) Use the license under which the data are customarily provided to the public, in accordance with DFARS 227.7202, for commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation.


(iii) No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.


(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.


(4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.


(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.
