# 252.227-7037   Validation of Asserted Restrictions on Technical Data.

As prescribed in 227.7102-4(c), 227.7103-6(e)(3), 227.7104-4(b)(7), or 227.7203-6(f), use the following clause:


(j) *Decision not to challenge.* A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”


(k) *Privity of contract.* The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictions. However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractor.


(l) *Flowdown.* The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial products or commercial services, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.
