# 2129.401-70   FEGLI Program contract clauses.

The fixed-price contract clauses in FAR subpart 29.4 are inappropriate for the FEGLI Program because of the limited cost-redetermination of FEGLI Program contracts. The clauses at FAR 52.229-1, 52.229-2, 52.229-3, and 52.229-4 shall not be inserted into FEGLI Program contracts.
