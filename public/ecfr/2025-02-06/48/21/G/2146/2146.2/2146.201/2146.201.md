# 2146.201   General.

(a) This part prescribes policies and procedures to ensure that services acquired under the FEGLI Program contract conform to the contract's quality requirements.


(b) OPM will make an initial evaluation of the Contractor's system of internal controls under the quality assurance program required by 2146.270 of this chapter and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system is consistent with the requirements set forth in this subpart. After the initial review, subsequent periodic reviews may be limited to changes in the Contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does not diminish the Contractor's obligation to apply the full internal control system.
