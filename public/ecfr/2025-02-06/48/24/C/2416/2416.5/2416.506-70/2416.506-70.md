(a) *Unpriced task orders.* The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 2452.216-75, Unpriced Task Orders, in contracts in which task orders are individually negotiated and when there may be a need to issue unpriced task orders. The Contracting Officer shall ensure that the cost of the work authorized by any unpriced task order is not in excess of the funds available for the order.
