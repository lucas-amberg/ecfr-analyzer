# 323.7101   Applicability.

It is HHS policy to include a solicitation provision and to include an evaluation factor for an offeror's Sustainable Action Plan when acquiring sustainable products and services. This applies only to new contracts and orders above the micro-purchase threshold. Such contracts and orders include, but are not limited to: Office supplies; construction, renovation or repair; building operations and maintenance; landscaping services; pest management; electronic equipment, including leasing; fleet maintenance; janitorial services; laundry services; cafeteria operations; and meetings and conference services. If using a product or service code designated for supplies or services having sustainable acquisition attributes but a review of the requirement determines that no opportunity exists to acquire sustainable acquisition supplies or services, document the determination in the contract file and make note in the solicitation.
