# 370.302   Federal-wide Assurance (FWA).

(a) OHRP-Approved FWAs are found at the following Web site: *http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/search.aspx?styp=bsc*.


(b) Normally a contractor, subcontractor, or institution must provide approval of a FWA before a contract is awarded. If a contractor, subcontractor, or institution does not currently hold an approved FWA, it shall submit an explanation with its proposal and an FWA application prior to submitting a proposal. The contracting officer, on a case by case basis, may make award without an approved assurance in consultation with OHRP.


(c) A contractor, subcontractor, or institution must submit all FWAs, including new FWAs, using the electronic submission system available through the OHRP Web site at *http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/*, unless an institution lacks the ability to do so electronically. If an institution believes it lacks the ability to submit its FWA electronically, it must contact OHRP by telephone or email (see *http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html*) and explain why it is unable to submit its FWA electronically.
