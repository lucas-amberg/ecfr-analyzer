# 3401.303   Publication and codification.

(a) The EDAR is issued as chapter 34 of title 48 of the CFR.


(1) The FAR numbering illustrations at FAR 1.105-2 apply to the EDAR.


(2) The EDAR numbering system corresponds with the FAR numbering system. An EDAR citation will include the prefix “34” prior to its corresponding FAR part citation; *e.g.,* FAR 25.108-2 would have corresponding EDAR text numbered as EDAR 3425.108-2.


(3) Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR will be codified with a suffix beginning with “70” or, in cases of successive sections and subsections, will be numbered in the 70 series (*i.e.,* 71-79). These supplementing sections and subsections will appear to the closest corresponding FAR citation; *e.g.,* FAR subpart 16.4 may be augmented in the EDAR by citing EDAR 3416.470 and FAR 16.403 may be augmented in the EDAR by citing EDAR 3416.403-70. (*Note:* These citations are for illustrative purposes only and may not actually appear in the published EDAR). For example:


(c) Guidance that is unique to an organization with Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) authority contains that activity's acronym directly preceding the cite. The following activity acronyms apply: FSA—Federal Student Aid.
