# 3417.207   Exercise of options.

(f)(2) The Federal Government may accept price reductions offered by contractors at any time during contract performance. Acceptance of price reductions offered by contractors will not be considered renegotiations as identified in this subpart if they were not initiated or requested by the Federal Government.


(h) If a contract provision allows an option to be exercised within a specified time frame after funds become available, it must also specify that the date on which funds “become available” is the actual date funds become available to the contracting officer for obligation.
