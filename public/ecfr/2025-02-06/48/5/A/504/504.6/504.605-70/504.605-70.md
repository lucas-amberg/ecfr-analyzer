# 504.605-70   Federal Procurement Data Systemâ€”Public access to data.

(a) *The FPDS database.* The General Services Administration awarded a contract for creation and operation of the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) database. That database includes information reported by departments and agencies as required by FAR subpart 4.6. One of the primary purposes of the FPDS database is to provide information on Government procurement to the public.


(b) *Fee for direct hook-up.* To the extent that a member of the public requests establishment of real-time integration of reporting services to run reports from another application, a one-time charge of $2,500 for the original integration must be paid by the requestor. This one-time charge covers the setup and certification required for an integrator to access the FPDS database and for technical assistance to help integrators use the web services. The fee will be paid to the FPDS contractor and credited to invoices submitted to GSA by the FPDS contractor.
