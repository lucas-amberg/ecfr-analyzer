(1) Funds are available.


(2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing Government need.


(3) Exercising the option is the most advantageous method of satisfying the Government's need, price and other factors considered.


(4) The contractor is not listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions (see FAR 9.405-1).


(5) The contractor's performance under the contract met or exceeded the Government's expectation for quality performance, unless another circumstance justifies an extended contractual relationship.
