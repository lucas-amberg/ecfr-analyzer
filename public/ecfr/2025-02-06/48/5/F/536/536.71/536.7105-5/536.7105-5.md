# 536.7105-5   Shared savings incentive.

(a) *General.* The incentive is a shared portion of the difference between the final GMP and the final cost of performance. Cost reductions may be realized by the construction contractor as a result of innovations and efficiencies during the construction phase, such as increased labor productivity or strong material subcontract negotiations.


(b) *Share Ratio.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this section, the share ratio for the construction contractor shall range from 30 percent to 50 percent. The share ratio for the construction contractor shall not exceed 50 percent. The complexity of the project and the amount of risk to the construction contractor should be considered when determining the ratio. A project with greater risk to the construction contractor should reflect a greater share ratio for the construction contractor.


(2) Subject to the approval of the HCA, the share ratio may be different than that required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Any such written approval shall be documented in the contract file.


(c) *Incentive calculation.* The incentive amount is calculated in accordance with the clause at 552.236-79 Construction-Manager-As-Constructor.
