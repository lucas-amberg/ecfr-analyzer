# 552.104   Procedures for modifying and completing provisions and clauses.

(a) The procedures in FAR 52.104 apply when you modify or complete a GSAR provision or clause. Provisions and clauses shall not be modified unless the GSAR authorizes their modification. 


(b) You do not need to identify modifications of clauses which result from negotiations unless you issue an amendment to the solicitation. 


(c) In general, you should modify FAR or GSAR clauses only for individual cases. If a contracting activity develops a modification for repeated use, furnish a copy to the Office of GSA Acquisition Policy (MV) for potential inclusion in the GSAR.
