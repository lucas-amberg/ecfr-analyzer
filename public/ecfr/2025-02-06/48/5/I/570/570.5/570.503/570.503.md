# 570.503   Alterations by the Government or through a separate contract.

If the Government chooses to exercise its right to make the alterations rather than contracting directly with the lessor, the Government may either:


(a) Have Federal employees perform the work.


(b) Contract out the work using standard contracting procedures that apply to a construction contract performed on Federal property. If the Government decides to contract for the work, invite the lessor, as well as all other prospective contractors, to submit offers for the project.
