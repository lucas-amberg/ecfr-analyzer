# 6101.21   Hearing procedures [Rule 21].

(a) *Generally.* The Board generally holds hearings in public hearing rooms. Except as necessary under a protective order or *in camera* procedures, hearings are open to the public. The Board entrusts the conduct of hearings to the discretion of the presiding judge.


(b) *Witnesses, evidence, other exhibits.* A party that intends to offer testimony, other evidence, or other material for the record at a hearing shall arrange for the witness, evidence, or other material to be present in the hearing room. The Board may in its discretion allow testimony by telephone or video.


(c) *Exclusion of witnesses.* The Board may exclude witnesses from a hearing, other than one designated representative for each party or a person authorized by statute to be present, so that witnesses are not influenced by the testimony of other witnesses.


(d) *Sworn testimony.* Hearing witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation. If a person called as a witness refuses to so swear or affirm, the Board may receive the person's testimony under penalty of making a materially false statement in a Federal proceeding under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Alternatively, the Board may disallow the testimony and may draw inferences from the person's refusal to swear or affirm.
