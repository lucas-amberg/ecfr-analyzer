# 6101.25   Decisions and settlements[Rule 25].

(a) *Decisions.* The Board issues decisions in writing, except as allowed by Rule 52 (48 CFR 6101.52). The Board will send a copy of a decision to each party, requesting confirmation of receipt (see Rule 1 (48 CFR 6101.1)), and will post the decision on its website. If a decision reserves any part of a case for later proceedings, it is conclusive as to the matters it resolves, except as provided in Rules 26 and 28 (48 CFR 6101.26 and 6101.28).


(b) *Settlements.* Parties may settle a case by stipulating to an award. The Board may issue a decision making the stipulated award if:


(1) The Board is satisfied that it has jurisdiction; and


(2) The stipulation states that no party will seek reconsideration of, seek relief from, or appeal the Board's decision.
