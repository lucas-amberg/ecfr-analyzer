# 6104.401   Scope [Rule 401].

(a) *Authority.* These procedures govern the Board's resolution of claims by Federal civilian employees for certain travel or relocation expenses. 31 U.S.C. 3702 vests the authority to settle these claims in the Administrator of General Services, who has redelegated that function to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals. The requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3702, including limitations on the time within which claims may be filed, apply to the Board's review of these claims.


(b) *Types of claims.* These procedures are applicable to the review of two types of claims made against the United States by federal civilian employees:


(1) Claims for reimbursement of expenses incurred while on official temporary duty travel; and


(2) Claims for reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with relocation to a new duty station.


(c) *Review of claims.* Any claim for entitlement to travel or relocation expenses must first be filed with the claimant's own department or agency (the agency). The agency shall initially adjudicate the claim. A claimant disagreeing with the agency's determination may request review of the claim by the Board. The burden is on the claimant to establish the timeliness of the claim, the liability of the agency, and the claimant's right to payment. The Board will issue the final decision on a claim based on the information submitted by the claimant and the agency.
