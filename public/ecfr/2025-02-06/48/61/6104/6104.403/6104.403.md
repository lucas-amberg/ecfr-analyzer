# 6104.403   Response to claim [Rule 403].

(a) *Content of response.* When a claim has been filed with the Board by a claimant, within 30 calendar days after docketing by the Board (or within 60 calendar days after docketing, if the agency office involved is located outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia), the agency shall submit to the Board:


(1) A simple, concise, and direct statement of its response to the claim;


(2) Citations to applicable statutes, regulations, and cases; and


(3) Any additional information the agency considers necessary to the Board's review of the claim.


(b) *Service of copy.* A copy of these submissions shall also be sent to the claimant. To expedite proceedings, if the agency believes its reasons for denying the claim were sufficiently explained in the material filed by the claimant, it should notify the Board and the claimant that it does not intend to file a response.
