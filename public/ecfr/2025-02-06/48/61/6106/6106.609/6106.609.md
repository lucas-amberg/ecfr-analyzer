# 6106.609   Other materials considered; ex parte communications [Rule 609].

Written or oral arguments or statements of experts as to how a panel should understand evidence or apply the law are not evidence but may be presented as scheduled by the panel and may be subject to page, word, or time limits. By the close of arbitration under Rule 613, parties should provide the panel with everything it needs to make a decision. Documents written by a party for the panel during arbitration shall comply with Board Rules 1(b) (“Efiles; efiling”), 7, and 23 (48 CFR 6101.1(b), 6101.7, and 6101.23). No member of a panel or of the Board's staff will communicate with a party about any material issue in arbitration outside of the presence of the other party or parties, and no one shall attempt such communications on behalf of a party.
