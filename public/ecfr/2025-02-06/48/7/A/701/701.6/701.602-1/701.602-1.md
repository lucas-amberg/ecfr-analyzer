# 701.602-1   Authority of contracting officers in resolving audit recommendations.

With the exception of termination settlements subject to part 749, contracting officers have the authority to negotiate and enter into settlements with contractors for costs questioned under audit reports, or to issue a contracting officer's final decision pursuant to applicable dispute resolution procedures (in the event that questioned costs are not settled by negotiated agreement) in accordance with USAID's internal policy. The negotiated settlement or final decision will be final, subject only to a contractor's appeal under the provisions of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613), or other procedures, as applicable. Internal policy and procedures for resolving audit recommendations are found in ADS series 500 chapters for audits.
