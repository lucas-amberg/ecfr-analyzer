# 704.502   Policy.

USAID encourages the use of electronic commerce through USAID's eSign Portal located at DocuSign. The agency head has determined that the eSign Portal is capable of ensuring authentication and confidentiality commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information. USAID uses Login.gov for secure sign in. USAID will accept electronic signatures in connection with contracts, modifications and any other documentation where digital signatures are authorized under the FAR.
