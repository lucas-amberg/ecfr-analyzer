# 715.602   Policy.

(a) USAID encourages the submission of unsolicited proposals that contribute new and innovative ideas that are consistent with and contribute to the accomplishment of the Agency's objectives. Potential offerors should consider the guidance in FAR 15.6 and in AIDAR 715.6 prior to preparing and submitting a formal unsolicited proposal.


(b) Unsolicited proposals will only be considered when they support USAID strategy. USAID Mission programs must be responsive to the needs of the cooperating country; projects are often designed in collaboration with the cooperating country. These factors can limit both the need for, and USAID's ability to use, unsolicited proposals.


(c) The *USAID.gov* website contains information on working with USAID and on individual Mission and Agency-wide strategies and objectives. Prospective offerors are also encouraged to review USAID's Business Forecast web page and consider responding to USAID competitive announcements published on *sam.gov* and *grants.gov*.
