# 719.271-5   Contracting officer's representatives.

Since the procurement process starts with the establishment of a requirement, the actions of the Contracting officer's representatives can affect the opportunity of small business to participate equitably; therefore, each contracting officer's representative shall, during the formulation of activities which will require contractual implementation: 


(a) Consult with OSDBU on the availability and capabilities of small business firms to permit making a tentative set-aside determination where appropriate; and


(b) Provide sufficient procurement lead time in the activity implementation schedule to allow potential small business participation.
