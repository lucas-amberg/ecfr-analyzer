# 725.170   Exceptions for Foreign Assistance Act functions.

(a) In addition to the exception stated in FAR 25.103 for purchases of foreign end products for use outside the United States, Executive Order 11223, dated May 12, 1965, provides an exception for assistance functions performed under the authority of the Foreign Assistance Act.


(b) USAID regulation at 22 CFR part 228 contains generally more prescriptive geographic procurement requirements under the Foreign Assistance Act than those under the Buy American Act. As a general rule, the requirements in 22 CFR part 228 will be used in USAID program-funded awards. For operating expense-funded procurements for supplies for use in the United States, USAID applies the Buy American Act requirements.
