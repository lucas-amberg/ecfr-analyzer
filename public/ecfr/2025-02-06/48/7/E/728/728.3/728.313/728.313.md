# 728.313   Contract clauses for insurance of transportation or transportation-related services.

(a) USAID is required by law to include language in all its direct contracts and subcontracts ensuring that all U.S. marine insurance companies have a fair opportunity to bid for marine insurance when such insurance is necessary or appropriate under the contract. USAID has therefore established a supplementary preface to the clause at (48 CFR) FAR 52.228-9. This supplementary preface is set forth in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-9, and is required for use in any USAID-direct contract where marine insurance is necessary or appropriate.
