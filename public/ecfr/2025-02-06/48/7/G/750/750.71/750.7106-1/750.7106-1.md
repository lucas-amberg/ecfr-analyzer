# 750.7106-1   General.

The mere fact that losses occur under a contract is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for the exercise of the authority conferred by Executive Order 11223. Whether, in a particular case, an action will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States is fact specific. Examples of the types of cases where action may be proper are set forth in 750.7106-2 through 750.7106-4.



 Even if all of the factors contained in any of the examples are present, other factors or considerations in a particular case may warrant denial of the request. These examples are not intended to exclude other cases where the approving authority determines that the circumstances warrant action.
