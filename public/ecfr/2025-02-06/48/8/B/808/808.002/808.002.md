(a) *Priorities.* Contracting activities shall satisfy requirements for supplies and services from or through the mandatory sources listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section in descending order of priority:


(1) *Supplies.* (i) VA inventories including the VA supply stock program (41 CFR 101-26.704) and VA excess.


(ii) Excess from other agencies (see FAR subpart 8.1).


(iii) Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (see 808.603). Prior to considering award of a contract to Federal Prison Industries, Inc., contracting officers shall apply the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101) to determine whether a requirement should be awarded to veteran-owned small businesses under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127-28, by using the preferences and priorities in subpart 819.70. If an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB)/veteran-owned small business (VOSB) as provided in subpart 819.70, FPI remains a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002.


(iv) Supplies that are on the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, through the AbilityOne Program (FAR subpart 8.7). Supplies that are on the Procurement List but which do not meet the definition of a covered product in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section are only required to be procured from a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002 if an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified SDVOSB/VOSB after following the procedures set forth in subpart 819.70.


(A) *Definition.* As used in this paragraph (a)(1)(iv), *covered product* means a product that—

(C) *Exception for certain contracts awarded in accordance with the Veterans First Contracting Program in subpart 819.70.* If a contract for a covered product awarded under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127(d)(1) to a VIP-listed SDVOSB or VOSB was in effect as of August 7, 2020, the requirement shall continue as an SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside in accordance with 819.7006 and 819.7007.


(D) *Termination or expiration of excepted contracts.* When a contract previously awarded as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(C) of this section is terminated or expires, contracting officers shall procure such covered product through the AbilityOne Program as a priority mandatory Government source (see paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(B) of this section), provided the head of the contracting activity or designee determines there is no reasonable expectation that—
