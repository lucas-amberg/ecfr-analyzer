# 915.404-4700   DOE structured profit and fee system.

(a) This section implements FAR 15.404-4(b) and (d).


(b) DOE's structured profit and fee system for non-management and operating contracts comprises two approaches: a weighted guidelines system for all but construction contracts, construction management contracts, and special equipment purchases; and a fee schedules-based system for construction contracts, construction management contracts, and special equipment purchases. The former is covered at 915.404-4720 through 915.404-4780; the latter is covered at 915.404-4800 through 915.404-4860. Both approaches use the procedures at 915.404-4900 for cost-plus-award-fee contracts.
