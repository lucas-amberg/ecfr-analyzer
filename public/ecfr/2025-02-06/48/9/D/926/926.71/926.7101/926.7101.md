# 926.7101   Policy.

Consistent with the requirements of section 3161(c)(2), 50 U.S.C. 2704(c)(2), in instances where DOE has determined that a change in workforce at a DOE Defense Nuclear Facility is necessary, the Department, to the extent practicable, is required to provide employees under Department of Energy contracts whose employment in positions at such a facility is terminated with a preference in any hiring of the Department. Consistent with published DOE guidance regarding section 3161, such preference in hiring extends to hiring by DOE contractors and subcontractors.
