# 950.7003   Nuclear hazards indemnity.

(a) Section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, requires DOE “to enter into agreements of indemnification with any person who may conduct activities under a contract with DOE that involve the risk of public liability * * *.” However, DOE contractors whose activities are already subject to indemnification by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are not eligible for such statutory indemnity. See 950.7006 below.


(b) The Heads of Contracting Activities shall assure that contracts subject to this requirement contain the appropriate nuclear hazards indemnity provisions.
