# 952.227-13   Patent rights—acquisition by the Government.

As prescribed at 927.303(d), insert the following clause:


*Alternate I* [December 2024]. As prescribed in 927.303(d)(5), insert Alternate I under special circumstances to provide for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions:


(m) *Background patents.* (1) *Background patent* means a domestic patent covering an invention or discovery which is not a subject invention, and which is owned or controlled by the Contractor at any time through the completion of this contract:


(i) Which the contractor, but not the Government, has the right to license to others without obligation to pay royalties thereon, and


(ii) Infringement of which cannot reasonably be avoided upon the practice of any specific process, method, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter (including relatively minor modifications thereof) which is a subject of the research, development, or demonstration work performed under this contract.


(2) The Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government a royalty-free, nonexclusive license under any background patent for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract by or for the Government in research, development, and demonstration work only.


(3) The Contractor also agrees that upon written application by DOE, it will grant to responsible parties, for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract, nonexclusive licenses under any background patent on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If, however, the Contractor believes that exclusive rights are necessary to achieve expeditious commercial development or utilization, then a request may be made to DOE for DOE approval of such licensing by the Contractor.


(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (m)(3) of this clause, the contractor shall not be obligated to license any background patent if the Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that:


(i) A competitive alternative to the subject matter covered by said background patent is commercially available or readily introducible from one or more other sources; or


(ii) The Contractor or its licensees are supplying the subject matter covered by said background patent in sufficient quantity and at reasonable prices to satisfy market needs or have taken effective steps or within a reasonable time are expected to take effective steps to so supply the subject matter.


*Alternate II* [December 2024]. As prescribed in 927.303(d), the following modifications must be made when the “Department of Energy Determination of Exceptional Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies” applies:


The Contracting Officer shall insert the phrase “or upon a breach of paragraph (n) of this clause” after “fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause” in the first sentence of paragraph (d)(1).


The Contracting Officer shall insert the following paragraph (n):


(n) *U.S. Competitiveness.* With regard to the license granted in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner, *e.g.,* alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. Should the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights in the invention(s):


(1) Undergo a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, or


(2) Sell, assign, or otherwise transfer title or exclusive rights in the invention(s), then the assignment, license, or other transfer of rights in the subject invention(s) is/are suspended until approved in writing by DOE. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph. The Contractor will include this paragraph in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.
