# 970.0970-1   Determination of responsibility.

(a) In the award of a management and operating contract, the contracting officer shall determine that the prospective contractor is a responsible contractor and is capable of providing all necessary financial, personnel, and other resources in performance of the contract. 


(b) Department of Energy (DOE) contracts with entities that have been created solely for the purpose of performing a specific management and operating contract. Generally, such newly created entities will have very limited financial and other resources. In such instances, when making the determination of responsibility required under this section, the contracting officer may evaluate the financial resources of other entities only to the extent that those entities are legally bound, jointly and severally if more than one, by means of a performance guarantee or other equivalent enforceable commitment to supply the necessary resources to the prospective contractor and to assume all contractual obligations of the prospective contractor. A performance guarantee should be the means used unless an equivalent degree of commitment can be obtained by an alternative means. 


(c) The guaranteeing corporate entity(ies) must be found to have sufficient resources in order to satisfy its guarantee.
