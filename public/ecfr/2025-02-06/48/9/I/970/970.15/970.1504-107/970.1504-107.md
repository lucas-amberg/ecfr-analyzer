# 970.1504-107   Classification factors.

(a) There are five classification factors. They are tied to facility/task categories. Step 4 in calculating the maximum total available fee amount for the one-year period (see 970.1504-104(b)(4)) is to multiply the fee subtotal in step 3 for each type of effort by the appropriate classification factor. The classification factors and their corresponding facility/task categories are:


(b) The Contracting Officer shall select the Facility/Task Category after considering the following:


(1) *Facility/Task Category A.* The main focus of effort performed is related to—


(i) The manufacture, assembly, retrieval, disassembly, or disposal of nuclear weapons with explosive potential;


(ii) The physical cleanup, processing, handling, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals with consideration given to the degree the nature of the work advances state-of-the-art technologies in cleanup, processing or storage operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is significantly demanding when compared to similar industrial/DOE settings (*i.e.,* nuclear energy processing, industrial environmental cleanup);


(iii) Construction of facilities such as nuclear reactors, atomic particle accelerators, or complex laboratories or industrial units especially designed for handling radioactive materials;


(iv) R&D directly supporting paragraph (b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection and not conducted in a DOE laboratory; or


(v) As designated by the SPE, or designee. (Classification factor 3.0)


(2) *Facility/Task Category B.* The main focus of effort performed is related to—


(i) The safeguarding and maintenance of nuclear weapons or nuclear material;


(ii) The manufacture or assembly of nuclear components;


(iii) The physical cleanup, processing, handling, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals or other substances that pose a significant threat to the environment or the health and safety of workers or the public, if the nature of the work uses state-of-the-art technologies or applications in such operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is more demanding than that found in similar industrial/DOE settings (*i.e.,* nuclear energy, chemical or petroleum processing, industrial environmental cleanup);


(iv) The detailed planning necessary for the assembly/disassembly of nuclear weapons/components;


(v) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring a high degree of design layout or process control;


(vi) R&D directly supporting paragraph (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subsection and not conducted in a DOE laboratory; or


(vii) As designated by the SPE or designee. (Classification factor 2.5)


(3) *Facility/Task Category C.* The main focus of effort performed is related to—


(i) The physical cleanup, processing, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals if the nature of the work uses routine technologies in cleanup, processing or storage operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is similar to that found in similar industrial/DOE settings (*i.e.,* nuclear energy, chemical processing, industrial environmental cleanup);


(ii) Plant and facility maintenance;


(iii) Plant and facility security (other than the safeguarding of nuclear weapons and material);


(iv) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring normal processes and operations; general or administrative service buildings; or routine infrastructure requirements;


(v) R&D directly supporting paragraph (b)(3)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subsection and not conducted in a DOE laboratory; or


(vi) As designated by the SPE or designee. (Classification factor 2.0)


(4) *Facility/Task Category D.* The main focus of the effort performed is R&D conducted at a DOE laboratory. (Classification factor 1.5)


(5) *Facility/Task Category E.* Efforts performed using a fixed fee. (Classification factor 1.0)


(c) Where the SPE or designee has approved a base fee, the Classification Factors shall be reduced, as approved by the SPE or designee.


(d) Any risks that are indemnified by the Government (for example, risks under the Price-Anderson Act) will not be considered as risks to the contractor.
