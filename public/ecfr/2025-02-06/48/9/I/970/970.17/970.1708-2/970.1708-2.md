# 970.1708-2   General.

M&O contractors may elect to enter into agreements directly with non-Federal sponsors to conduct research at the facility the M&O contractor is responsible for managing and operating so long as the work does not present, or minimizes, any apparent COI, as well as avoiding or neutralizing any actual COI as a result of the agreement. This research is conducted at the M&O contractor's risk and the M&O contractor may obtain compensation beyond full-cost recovery for accepting the risk of performance.
