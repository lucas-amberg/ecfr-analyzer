(3) *Confidentiality.* Any examination of records under this paragraph is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.


(4) *Power of inspection.* With respect to a subject invention for which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the Contractor shall furnish the Government, upon request by DOE, an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of a prosecution file for any patent application claiming the subject invention.


(q) *Patent functions.* Upon the written request of the Contracting Officer or Patent Counsel, the Contractor agrees to make reasonable efforts to support DOE in accomplishing patent-related functions for work arising out of the contract, including, but not limited to, the prosecution of patent applications, and the determination of questions of novelty, patentability, and inventorship.


(r) *Educational awards subject to 35 U.S.C. 212.* The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer prior to the placement of any person subject to 35 U.S.C. 212 in an area of technology or task:


(1) Related to exceptional circumstance technology; or


(2) Any person who is subject to treaties or international agreements as set forth in paragraph (b)(6) of this clause or to agreements other than funding agreements. The Contracting Officer may disapprove of any such placement.


(s) *Annual appraisal by Patent Counsel.* Patent Counsel may conduct an annual appraisal to evaluate the Contractor's effectiveness in identifying and protecting subject inventions in accordance with DOE policy.


(t) *U.S. Competitiveness.* (1) Consistent with 48 CFR 970.5227-3(f) U.S. Industrial Competitiveness, for all subject inventions under the S&E DEC, the Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner, *e.g.,* alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Contactor or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Invention undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (t)(1) and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within six months of the change. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph (t)(1). The Contractor will include this paragraph (t) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.


(2) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause are further clarified as follows:


(i) *Waivers.* The Contractor (or any entity subject to this paragraph) may request a waiver or modification of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause. Such waivers or modifications may be granted when DOE determines that (A) the Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible and (B) a waiver or modification would best serve the interests of the United States and the general public.


(ii) *Final determination of breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause.* If DOE determines the Contractor is in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determination includes a demand for title to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions subject to the breach to the United States Government, including all pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject invention, without compensation. Any such final determination shall be signed by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer & Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Contractor before any final written determination by DOE is issued.


(iii) *License, Assignment, or Transfer.* Pursuant to Contractor's agreement in paragraph (t)(1) of this clause to not license, assign or otherwise transfer rights to subject inventions at any tier unless the entity agrees to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause: any such license, assignment, or other transfer of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (t)(1) of this clause suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, assignee, or other transferee of rights to any subject invention is finally determined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the applicable license, assignment or other transfer shall be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made.


(iv) *Compensation.* For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject invention is due to a breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation, or to a license to the subject invention including the reserved license in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause, unless DOE grants a license through a separately agreed upon licensing agreement.


(u) *Publication.* The Contractor shall receive approval from Patent Counsel prior to releasing or publishing information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, to ensure such release or publication does not adversely affect the patent rights of DOE or the Contractor. At the discretion of the Patent Counsel, authority to review publications prior to release may be delegated to the Contractor.


(v) *Termination of contractor's advance class waiver.* If a request by the Contractor for an advance class waiver pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause contains false material statements or fails to disclose material facts, and DOE relies on the false statements or omissions in granting the Contractor's request, the waiver or grant of any Government rights (in whole or in part) to the subject invention(s) may be terminated at the discretion of the Secretary of Energy or designee. Prior to termination, DOE shall provide the Contractor with written notification of the termination, including a statement of facts in support of the termination, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days, or a longer period authorized by the Secretary of Energy or designee for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor, to show cause for not terminating the waiver or grant. Any termination of an advance class waiver or a determination of greater rights is subject to the Contractor's license as provided for in paragraph (f) of this clause.


(w) *Unauthorized Access.* The contractor will protect all invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information from unauthorized access and disclosure using at least commonly available techniques and practices. In the event that the Contractor becomes aware of unauthorized access to invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information, the Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel within 7 days.


*Alternate 1 Weapons Related Subject Inventions.* As prescribed at 970.2703-2(g), insert the following definition in paragraph (a) and add paragraph (b)(10) respectively:


(a) *Definitions*—*Weapons Related Subject Invention* means any subject invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under work funded by or through defense programs, including Department of Defense and intelligence reimbursable work, or the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program of the Department of Energy or the National Nuclear Security Administration.


(b) *Allocation of Principal Rights.* (10) *Weapons related subject inventions.* Except to the extent that DOE is solely satisfied that the Contractor meets certain procedural requirements and DOE grants rights to the Contractor in weapons related subject inventions, the Contractor does not have a right to retain title to any weapons related subject inventions.
