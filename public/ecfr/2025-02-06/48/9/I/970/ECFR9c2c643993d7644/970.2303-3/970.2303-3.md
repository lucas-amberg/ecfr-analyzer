# 970.2303-3   Contract clauses.

(a) When work under management and operating contracts and subcontracts thereunder is to be performed at a facility where DOE will exercise its statutory authority to enforce occupational safety and health standards applicable to the working conditions of the contractor and subcontractor employees at such facility, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5223-1, Integration of Environment, Safety and Health into Work Planning and Execution, shall be used in such contract or subcontract and made applicable to the work if conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, are satisfiedâ€” 


(1) DOE work is segregated from the contractor's or subcontractor's other work; 


(2) The operation is of sufficient size to support its own safety and health services; and 


(3) The facility is government-owned, or leased by or for the account of the government. 


(b) The clause set forth in 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be included in those contracts or subcontracts for, and be made applicable to, work to be performed at a facility where DOE does not elect to assert its statutory authority to enforce occupational safety and health standards applicable to the working conditions of contractor and subcontractor employees, but does need to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to provisions of the contract or subcontract rather than by reliance upon Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing requirements (including agreements with States under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act).
