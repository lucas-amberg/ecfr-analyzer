# Appendix A to Part 10â€”Exemptions


Those portions of the following systems of records that consist of (a) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and probation status; (b) information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or (c) reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision, are exempt from all parts of 5 U.S.C. 552a except subsections (b) (Conditions of disclosure); (c) (1) and (2) (Accounting of certain disclosures); (e)(4) (A) through (F) (Publication of existence and character of system); (e)(6) (Ensure records are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete before disclosure to person other than an agency and other than pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request), (7) (Restrict recordkeeping on First Amendment rights), (9) (Rules of conduct), (10) (Safeguards), and (11) (Routine use publication); and (i) (Criminal penalties): 


A. The Investigative Records System maintained by the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, Office of the Inspector General, Office of the Secretary (DOT/OST 100). 


B. Police Warrant Files and Central Files maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration (DOT/FAA 807). 


C. The Investigative Records System maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration regarding criminal investigations conducted by offices of Investigations and Security at headquarters and FAA Regional and Center Security Divisions (DOT/FAA 815).


D. General Investigations Record System, maintained by the Office of Investigations and Security, Office of the Secretary (DOT/OST 016).


These exemptions are justified for the following reasons: 


1. From subsection (c)(3), because making available to a record subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her would reveal investigative interest by not only DOT but also the recipient agency, thereby permitting the record subject to take appropriate measures to impede the investigation, as by destroying evidence, intimidating potential witnesses, fleeing the area to avoid the thrust of the investigation, etc. 


2. From subsections (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (f), and (g), because granting an individual access to investigative records, and granting him/her rights to amend/contest that information, interfere with the overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source, disclose information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel. 


3. From subsection (e)(1), because it is often impossible to determine relevancy or necessity of information in the early stages of an investigation. The value of such information is a question of judgement and timing: what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, DOT may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, DOT should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an investigation, information may be provided to DOT that relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but that may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified. 


4. From subsection (e)(2), because in a law enforcement investigation it is usually counterproductive to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject of the information. It is not always feasible to rely upon the subject of an investigation as a source for information that may implicate him/her in illegal activities. In addition, collecting information directly from the subject could seriously compromise an investigation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could provide the subject with an opportunity to conceal criminal activities, or intimidate potential sources, in order to avoid apprehension. 


5. From subsection (e)(3), because providing such notice to the subject of an investigation, or to other individual sources, could seriously compromise the investigation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could inhibit cooperation, permit the subject to evade apprehension, or cause interference with undercover activities. 


A. The following systems of records are exempt from subsection (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), (d) (Access to Records), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules) of 5 U.S.C. 552a, to the extent that they contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, in accordance 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2):

1. From subsection (c)(3), because making available to a record subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her would reveal investigative interest by not only DOT but also the recipient agency, thereby permitting the record subject to take appropriate measures to impede the investigation, as by destroying evidence, intimidating potential witnesses, fleeing the area to avoid the thrust of the investigation, etc.


2. From subsections (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), because granting an individual access to investigative records, and granting him/her access to investigative records with that information, could interfere with the overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source, disclose information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel.

2. From subsection (d), because granting an individual access to investigative records could interfere with the overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source, disclose information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel.
