# ยง 17.12   How may a state simplify, consolidate, or substitute federally required state plans?

(a) As used in this section:


(1) *Simplify* means that a state may develop its own format, choose its own submission date, and select the planning period for a state plan.


(2) *Consolidate* means that a state may meet statutory and regulatory requirements by combining two or more plans into one document and that the state can select the format, submission date, and planning period for the consolidated plan.


(3) *Substitute* means that a state may use a plan or other document that it has developed for its own purposes to meet Federal requirements.


(b) If not inconsistent with law, a state may decide to try to simplify, consolidate, or substitute federally required state plans without prior approval by the Secretary.


(c) The Secretary reviews each state plan that a state has simplified, consolidated, or substituted and accepts the plan only if its contents meet federal requirements.
