(1) The recipient must submit this program plan on the same schedule as provided for in 23.45(a) of this part.


(2) Timely submission and FAA approval of a recipient's ACDBE program plan is a condition of eligibility for FAA financial assistance.


(b) If you are a primary airport that does not have an ACDBE program, and you apply for a grant of FAA funds for airport planning and development under 49 U.S.C. 47107 *et seq.,* you must submit an ACDBE program plan to the FAA at the time of your application. Timely submission and FAA approval of your ACDBE program are conditions of eligibility for FAA financial assistance.


(c) If you are the owner of more than one airport that is required to have an ACDBE program, you may implement one plan for all your locations. However, you must establish a separate ACDBE goal for each airport.

(e) If a recipient is a non-primary airport, non-commercial service airport, a general aviation airport, reliever airport, or any other airport that does not have scheduled commercial service, it is not required to have an ACDBE program. However, the recipient must take appropriate outreach steps to encourage available ACDBEs to participate as concessionaires whenever there is a concession opportunity.
