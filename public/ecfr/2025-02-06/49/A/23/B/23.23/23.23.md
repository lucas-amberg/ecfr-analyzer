# § 23.23   What administrative provisions must be in a recipient's ACDBE program?

(a) If, as a recipient that must have an ACDBE program, the program must include provisions for a policy statement, liaison officer, and directory, as provided in part 26, §§ 26.23, 26.25, and 26.31, as well as certification of ACDBEs as provided by Subpart C of this part. You must include a statement in your program committing you to operating your ACDBE program in a nondiscriminatory manner.


(b) You may combine your provisions for implementing these requirements under this part and part 26 (*e.g.*, a single policy statement can cover both Federally-assisted airport contracts and concessions; the same individual can act as the liaison officer for both part 23 and part 26 matters).


(c) You must thoroughly investigate the full extent of services offered by financial institutions owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in their community and make reasonable efforts to use these institutions. You must also encourage prime concessionaires to use such institutions.
