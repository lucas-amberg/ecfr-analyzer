(a) As a recipient, you must retain sufficient basic information about your program implementation, your certification of ACDBEs, and the award and performance of agreements and contracts to enable the FAA to determine your compliance with this part. You must retain this data for a minimum of three years following the end of the concession agreement or other covered contract.


(b) You must submit an annual report on ACDBE participation to the FAA by March 1 following the end of each fiscal year. This report must be submitted in the format acceptable to the FAA and contain all of the information described in the Uniform Report of ACDBE Participation.


(c) You must create and maintain active participants list information as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and enter it into a system designated by the FAA.


(1) The purpose of this active participants list is to ensure that you have the most accurate data possible about the universe of ACDBE and non-ACDBEs who seek work in your airport concessions program as a tool to help you set your overall goals, and to provide the Department with data for evaluating the extent to which the objectives of ยง 23.1 are being achieved.

(i) Firm name;

(iv) Race and gender information for the firm's majority owner;


(v) NAICS code applicable to the concession contract in which the firm is seeking to perform;


(vi) Age of the firm; and


(vii) The annual gross receipts of the firm. You may obtain this information by asking each firm to indicate into what gross receipts bracket they fit (*e.g.,* less than $1 million; $1-3 million; $3-6 million; $6-10 million, etc.) rather than requesting an exact figure from the firm.


(3) You must collect the data from all active participants for your concession opportunities by requiring the information in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to be submitted with their proposals or initial responses to negotiated procurements. You must enter this data in FAA's designated system no later than March 1 following the fiscal year in which the relevant concession opportunity was awarded.

(3) The number of decertified firms:
