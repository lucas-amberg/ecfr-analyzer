# ยง 23.33   What size standards do recipients use to determine the eligibility of applicants and ACDBEs?

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, recipients must treat a firm as a small business eligible to be certified as an ACDBE if the gross receipts of the applicant firm and its affiliates, calculated in accordance with 13 CFR 121.104 averaged over the firm's previous five fiscal years, do not exceed $56.42 million.


(b) The following types of businesses have size standards that differ from the standard set forth in paragraph (a) of this section:


(1) *Banks and financial institutions.* $1 billion in assets;


(2) *Passenger car rental companies.* $75.23 million average annual gross receipts over the firm's previous five fiscal years;


(3) *Pay telephones.* 1,500 employees; and


(4) *New car dealers.* 350 employees.


(c) For size purposes, gross receipts (as defined in 13 CFR 121.104(a)), of affiliates should be included in a manner consistent with 13 CFR 121.104(d), except in the context of joint ventures. For gross receipts attributable to joint venture partners, a firm must include in its gross receipts its proportionate share of joint venture receipts, unless the proportionate share already is accounted for in receipts reflecting transactions between the firm and its joint ventures (*e.g.,* subcontracts from a joint venture entity to joint venture partners).
