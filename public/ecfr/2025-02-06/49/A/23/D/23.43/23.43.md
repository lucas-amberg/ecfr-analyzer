(a) As a recipient, you must consult with stakeholders before submitting your overall goals to FAA.


(b) Stakeholders with whom you must consult include, but are not limited to, minority and women's business groups, community organizations, trade associations representing concessionaires currently located at the airport, as well as existing concessionaires themselves, and other officials or organizations which could be expected to have information concerning the availability of disadvantaged businesses, the effects of discrimination on opportunities for ACDBEs, and the recipient's efforts to increase participation of ACDBEs.


(c) The requirements of this section do not apply if no new concession opportunities will become available during the goal period. However, recipients must take appropriate outreach steps to encourage available ACDBEs to participate as concessionaires whenever there is a concession opportunity.
