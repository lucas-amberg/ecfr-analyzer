# ยง 23.57   What happens if a recipient falls short of meeting its overall goals?

(a) You cannot be penalized, or treated by the Department as being in noncompliance with this part, simply because your ACDBE participation falls short of your overall goals. You can be penalized or treated as being in noncompliance only if you have failed to administer your ACDBE program in good faith.


(b) If the awards and commitments shown on your Uniform Report of ACDBE Participation (found in Appendix A to this Part) at the end of any fiscal year are less than the overall goal applicable to that fiscal year, you must do the following in order to be regarded by the Department as implementing your ACDBE program in good faith:


(1) Analyze in detail the reasons for the difference between the overall goal and your awards and commitments in that fiscal year;


(2) Establish specific steps and milestones to correct the problems you have identified in your analysis and to enable you to meet fully your goal for the new fiscal year;


(3)(i) If you are a CORE 30 airport or other airport designated by the FAA, you must submit, by April 1, the analysis and corrective actions developed under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section to the FAA for approval.


(ii) As an airport not meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, you must retain analysis and corrective actions in your records for three years and make it available to the FAA, on request, for their review.


(4) The FAA may impose conditions on the recipient as part of its approval of the recipient's analysis and corrective actions including, but not limited to, modifications to your overall goal methodology, changes in your race-conscious/race-neutral split, or the introduction of additional race-neutral or race-conscious measures.


(5) You may be regarded as being in noncompliance with this part, and therefore subject to the remedies in ยง 23.11 of this part and other applicable regulations, for failing to implement your ACDBE program in good faith if any of the following things occur:


(i) You do not submit your analysis and corrective actions to FAA in a timely manner as required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;


(ii) FAA disapproves your analysis or corrective actions; or


(iii) You do not fully implement:


(A) The corrective actions to which you have committed, or


(B) Conditions that FAA has imposed following review of your analysis and corrective actions.


(c) If information coming to the attention of FAA demonstrates that current trends make it unlikely that you, as an airport, will achieve ACDBE awards and commitments that would be necessary to allow you to meet your overall goal at the end of the fiscal year, FAA may require you to make further good faith efforts, such as modifying your race-conscious/race-neutral split or introducing additional race-neutral or race-conscious measures for the remainder of the fiscal year.
