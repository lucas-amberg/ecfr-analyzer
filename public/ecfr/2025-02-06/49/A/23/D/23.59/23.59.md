# ยง 23.59   What is the role of the statutory 10 percent goal in the ACDBE program?

(a) The statute authorizing the ACDBE program provides that, except to the extent the Secretary determines otherwise, not less than 10 percent of concession businesses are to be ACDBEs.


(b) This 10 percent goal is an aspirational goal at the national level, which the Department uses as a tool in evaluating and monitoring ACDBEs' opportunities to participate in airport concessions.


(c) The national 10 percent aspirational goal does not authorize or require recipients to set overall or concession-specific goals at the 10 percent level, or any other particular level, or to take any special administrative steps if their goals are above or below 10 percent.
