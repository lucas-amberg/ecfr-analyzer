# § 24.11   Adjustments of limits and payments.

(a) The Lead Agency may adjust the following valuation limits and maximum relocation benefits payments:


(1) The waiver valuation limits at § 24.102(c)(2)(ii) introductory text and (c)(2)(ii)(C);


(2) The conflict of interest valuation limits at § 24.102(n)(3); and


(3) The maximum amounts of relocation payments provided at §§ 24.301, 24.304, 24.305, 24.401, 24.402, 24.502, and 24.503.


(b) The head of the Lead Agency will evaluate whether the cost of living, inflation, or other factors indicate that limits, and payments provided in paragraph (a) of this section, should be adjusted to meet the policy objectives of the Uniform Act. The Lead Agency will divide the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) index for the year of the assessment (current year), by the CPI-U index for the year of the previous assessment (base year index/year of last adjustment) to determine the effect of inflation over the assessment period. If adjustments are determined to be necessary, the head of the Lead Agency will publish the new maximum benefit limits eligible for Federal participation in the _Federal Register._ (*See* appendix A to this part, section 24.11.)
