# ยง 24.106   Expenses incidental to transfer of title to the agency.

(a) The owner of the real property shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses the owner necessarily incurred for:


(1) Recording fees, transfer taxes, documentary stamps, evidence of title, boundary surveys, legal descriptions of the real property, and similar expenses incidental to conveying the real property to the agency. However, the agency is not required to pay costs solely required to perfect the owner's title to the real property;


(2) Penalty costs and other charges for prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage entered into in good faith encumbering the real property; and


(3) The pro rata portion of any prepaid real property taxes which are allocable to the period after the agency obtains title to the property or effective possession of it, whichever is earlier.


(b) Whenever feasible, the agency shall pay these costs directly to the billing agent so that the owner will not have to pay such costs and then seek reimbursement from the agency.
