# § 24.202   Applicability.

The requirements in this subpart apply to the relocation of any permanently or temporarily displaced person, as defined at § 24.2(a). Any person who qualifies as a permanently or temporarily displaced person must be fully informed of his or her rights and entitlements to relocation assistance and payments provided by the Uniform Act and this part. (*See* appendix A to this part, section 24.202.)


(a) *Persons required to move temporarily.* (1) Appropriate notices must be provided in accordance with § 24.203 and appropriate advisory services must be provided in accordance with § 24.205;


(2) For persons occupying a dwelling, at least one comparable dwelling, is made available prior to requiring a person to move, except in the case of an emergency move as described in § 24.204(b)(1), (2), or (3) (see appendix A, to this part, section 24.202);


(3) Similarly, if a person's business will be shut down due to a project which either requires the occupant to vacate the property or which denies physical access to the property, it may be temporarily relocated and reimbursed for all reasonable out of pocket expenses or must be determined to be permanently displaced at the agency's option;


(4) Payment is provided for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation as the agency determines to be reasonable and necessary, associated with comparable replacement dwelling, and incidental to selecting a temporary comparable replacement dwelling. Such payments may include the reasonable and necessary costs of temporarily moving personal property from the real property and returning to the real property. Storage of the personal property may be allowed when approved by the displacing agency;


(5) A person's temporary move from their dwelling or business for the project may not exceed 12 months. The agency must contact any person who has temporarily moved from their dwelling or business when that temporary move has lasted for a period beyond 12 months because that person is considered permanently displaced and eligible as a displaced person. The agency shall offer such eligible persons all required relocation assistance benefits and services for permanently displaced persons. An agency may not deduct any temporary relocation assistance benefits previously provided when determining permanent relocation benefits eligibility; and


(6) A person who is not lawfully present in the United States and who has been determined to be ineligible for relocation assistance in accordance with § 24.208 is not eligible for temporary relocation assistance unless such denial of benefits would create an extremely unusual hardship to a designated family member in accordance with § 24.208(h).
