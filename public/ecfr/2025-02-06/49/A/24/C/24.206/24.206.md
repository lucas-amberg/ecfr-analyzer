# ยง 24.206   Eviction for cause.

(a) Eviction for cause must conform to applicable Federal, State, and local law. Any person who occupies the real property and is in lawful occupancy on the date of the initiation of negotiations is presumed to be entitled to relocation payments and other assistance set forth in this part unless the agency determines that:


(1) The person received an eviction notice prior to the initiation of negotiations and as a result of that notice is later evicted; or


(2) The person is evicted after the initiation of negotiations for serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement; and


(3) In either case the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to make available the payments and other assistance set forth in this part.


(b) For purposes of determining eligibility for relocation payments, the date of displacement is the date the person moves, or if later, the date a comparable replacement dwelling is made available. This section applies only to persons who would otherwise have been displaced by the project. (*See* appendix A to this part, section 24.206.)
