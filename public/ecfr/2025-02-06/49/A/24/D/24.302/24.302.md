# § 24.302   Fixed payment for moving expenses—residential moves.

Any person displaced from a dwelling or a seasonal residence or a dormitory style room is entitled to receive a fixed moving cost payment as an alternative to a payment for actual moving and related expenses under § 24.301. This payment shall be determined according to the Fixed Residential Moving Cost Schedule approved by FHWA and published in the _Federal Register_ on a periodic basis. The payment to a person with minimal personal possessions who is in occupancy of a dormitory style room or a person whose residential move is performed by an agency at no cost to the person shall be limited to the amount stated in the most recent edition of the Fixed Residential Moving Cost Schedule. In addition, an agency may approve storage for a displaced person's personal property for a period of up 12 months as a reasonable, actual and necessary moving expense under § 24.301(g)(4).


(a) An agency may determine that the storage of personal property is a reasonable and necessary moving expense for a displaced person under this part. The determination shall be based on the needs of the displaced person; the nature of the move; the plans for permanent relocation; the amount of time available for the relocation process; and, whether storage will facilitate relocation. If the agency determines that storage is reasonable and necessary in conjunction with a fixed cost moving payment made under this section, the agency shall pay the actual, reasonable, and necessary storage expenses in accordance with § 24.301(g)(4). However, regardless of whether storage is approved, the Fixed Residential Move Cost Schedule provides a one-time payment for one move from the displacement dwelling to the replacement dwelling, or storage facility. Consequently, displaced persons must be fully informed that reimbursement of costs to move the personal property to storage and the cost of approved storage, if applicable, represent a full reimbursement of their eligibility for moving costs under this part.
