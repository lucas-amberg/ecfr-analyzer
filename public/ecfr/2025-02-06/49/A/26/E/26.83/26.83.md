# § 26.83   What procedures do certifiers follow in making certification decisions?

(a) You must ensure that only firms certified as eligible DBEs under this section participate as DBEs in your program.


(b) You must determine the eligibility of firms as DBEs consistent with the standards of subpart D of this part. When a UCP is formed, the UCP must meet all the requirements of subpart D of this part and this subpart that recipients are required to meet.


(c)(1) You must take all the following steps in determining whether a DBE firm meets the standards of subpart D of this part:


(i) A certifier must visit the firm's principal place of business, virtually or in person, and interview the SEDO, officers, and key personnel. The certifier must review those persons' résumés and/or work histories. The certifier must maintain a complete audio recording of the interview. The certifier must also visit one or more active job sites (if there is one). These activities comprise the “on-site review” (OSR), a written report of which the certifier must keep in its files.


(ii) Analyze documentation related to the legal structure, ownership, and control of the applicant firm. This includes, but is not limited to, Articles of Incorporation/Organization; corporate by-laws or operating agreements; organizational, annual and board/member meeting records; stock ledgers and certificates; and State-issued Certificates of Good Standing


(iii) Analyze the bonding and financial capacity of the firm; lease and loan agreements; bank account signature cards;


(iv) Determine the work history of the firm, including contracts it has received, work it has completed; and payroll records;


(v) Obtain a statement from the firm of the type of work it prefers to perform as part of the DBE program and its preferred locations for performing the work, if any.


(vi) Obtain or compile a list of the equipment owned by or available to the firm and the licenses the firm and its key personnel possess to perform the work it seeks to do as part of the DBE program;


(vii) Obtain complete Federal income tax returns (or requests for extensions) filed by the firm, its affiliates, and the socially and economically disadvantaged owners for the last 3 years. A complete return includes all forms, schedules, and statements filed with the Internal Revenue Service.


(viii) Require potential DBEs to complete and submit an appropriate application form, except as otherwise provided in § 26.85 of this part.


(2) You must use the application form available at *https://transportation.gov/DBEFORMS* without change or revision. However, you may provide in your DBE program, with the written approval of the concerned operating administration, for supplementing the form by requesting specified additional information not inconsistent with this part.


(3) The certifier must ensure that the SEDO signs the Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) at the end of the Uniform Certification Application (UCA), subscribed to as true under penalty of perjury that all information provided is current, accurate, and complete.


(4) You must review all information on the form prior to making a decision about the eligibility of the firm. You may request clarification of information contained in the application at any time in the application process.


(d) When another certifier, in connection with its consideration of the eligibility of a firm, makes a written request for certification information you have obtained about that firm (e.g., including application materials or the report of a site visit, if you have made one to the firm), you must promptly make the information available to the other certifier.


(e) [Reserved]


(f) Subject to the approval of the concerned operating administration as part of your DBE program, you may impose a reasonable application fee for certification. Fee waivers shall be made in appropriate cases.


(g) You must safeguard from disclosure to unauthorized persons information gathered as part of the certification process that may reasonably be regarded as proprietary or other confidential business information, consistent with applicable Federal, state, and local law.


(h)(1) Once a certifier has certified a firm, the firm remains certified unless and/or until the certifier removes certification, in whole or in part (*i.e.,* NAICS code removal), through the procedures of § 26.87.


(2) The certifier may not require a DBE to reapply for certification, renew its certification, undergo a recertification, or impose any functionally equivalent requirement. The certifier may, however, conduct a certification review at any reasonable time and/or at regular intervals of at least two years. The certification review may, at the certifier's discretion, include a new OSR. The certifier may also make an unannounced visit to the DBE's offices and/or job site. The certifier may also rely on another certifier's report of its OSR of the DBE.


(i) If you are a DBE, you must inform the certifier or UCP in writing of any change in circumstances affecting your ability to meet size, disadvantaged status, ownership, or control requirements of this part or any material change in the information provided in your application form.


(1) Changes in management responsibility among members of a limited liability company are covered by this requirement.


(2) You must attach supporting documentation describing in detail the nature of such changes.


(3) The DBE must notify the certifier of a material change in its circumstances that affects its continued eligibility within 30 days of its occurrence, explain the change fully, and include a duly executed DOE with the notice. The DBE's non-compliance is a § 26.109(c) failure to cooperate.


(j) A DBE must provide its certifier(s), every year on the anniversary of its original certification, a new DOE along with the specified documentation in § 26.65(a), including gross receipts for its most recently completed fiscal year, calculated on a cash basis regardless of the DBE's overall accounting method. The sufficiency of documentation (and its probative value) may vary by business type, size, history, resources, and overall circumstances. However, the following documents may generally be considered “safe harbors,” provided that they include all reportable receipts, properly calculated, for the full reporting period: audited financial statements, a CPA's signed attestation of correctness and completeness, or all income-related portions of one or more (when there are affiliates) signed Federal income tax returns as filed. Non-compliance, whether full or partial, is a § 26.109(c) failure to cooperate.


(k) The certifier must advise each applicant within 30 days of filing whether the application is complete and suitable for evaluation and, if not, what additional information or action is required.


(l)(1) The certifier must render a final eligibility decision within 90 days of receiving all information required from the applicant under this part. The certifier may extend this time period once, for no more than an additional 30 days, upon written notice to the firm, explaining fully and specifically the reasons for the extension. On a case-by-case basis, the concerned OA may give the certifier one deadline extension if it approves a written request explaining why the certifier needs more time. The certifier's failure to issue a compliant decision by the applicable deadline is a constructive denial of the application, appealable to DOT under § 26.89. In this case, the certifier may be subject to enforcement actions described in §§ 26.103 and 26.105.


(2) [Reserved]


(m)(1) A certifier may notify the applicant about ineligibility concerns and allow the firm to rectify deficiencies within the period in paragraph (l) of this section.


(2) If a firm takes curative measures before the certifier renders a decision, the certifier must consider any evidence it submits of having taken such measures. The certifier must not automatically construe curative measures as successful or abusive.


(i) *Example 1 to paragraph (m)(2).* The firm may obtain proof of an investment, transaction, or other fact on which its eligibility depends.


(ii) *Example 2 to paragraph (m)(2).* An owner or related party may create a legally enforceable document of irrevocable transfer to the SEDO.


(iii) *Example 3 to paragraph (m)(2).* The firm may amend an operating agreement, bylaw provision, or other governance document, provided that the amendment accurately reflects the parties' relationships, powers, responsibilities, and other pertinent circumstances.


(n) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (n), if an applicant for DBE certification withdraws its application before the certifier issues a decision, the applicant can resubmit the application at any time. However, the certifier may place the reapplication at the “end of the line,” behind other applications that have been made since the firm's previous application was withdrawn. The certifier may apply the § 26.86(c) waiting period to a firm that has established a pattern of withdrawing applications before its decision.
