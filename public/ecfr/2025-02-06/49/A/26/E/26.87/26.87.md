# ยง 26.87   Decertification.

(a) *Burden of proof.* To decertify a DBE, the certifier bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the DBE does not meet the certification standards of this part.


(b) *Initiation of decertification proceedings.* (1) A certifier may determine on its own that it has reasonable cause to decertify a DBE.


(2) If an OA determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a DBE does not meet the eligibility criteria of this part, the OA may direct the certifier to initiate a proceeding to remove the DBE's certification.


(i) The OA must provide the certifier and the DBE written notice describing the reasons for the directive, including any relevant documentation or other information.


(ii) The certifier must immediately commence a proceeding to decertify as provided by paragraph (e) of this section.


(3) Any person may file a complaint explaining, with specificity, why the certifier should decertify a DBE. The certifier need not act on a general allegation or an anonymous complaint. The certifier must keep complainants' identities confidential as provided in ยง 26.109(b).


(i) The certifier must review its records concerning the DBE, any material the DBE and/or complainant provides, and any other available information. The certifier may request additional information from the DBE or conduct any other investigation that it deems necessary.


(ii) If the certifier determines that there is reasonable cause to decertify the DBE, it initiates a decertification proceeding. If it determines that there is not such reasonable cause, it notifies the complainant and the DBE in writing of its decisions and the reasons for it.


(c) *Notice of intent (NOI).* A certifier's first step in any decertification proceeding must be to email a notice of intent (NOI) to the DBE.


(1) The NOI must clearly and succinctly state each reason for the proposed action, and specifically identify the supporting evidence for each reason.


(2) The NOI must notify the DBE of its right to respond in writing, at an informal hearing, or both.


(3) The NOI must inform the DBE of the hearing scheduled on a date no fewer than 30 days and no more than 45 days from the date of the NOI.


(4) If the ground for decertification is that the DBE has been suspended or debarred for conduct related to the DBE program, the certifier issues a NOD decertifying the DBE. In this case, there is no NOI or opportunity for a hearing or written response.


(d) *Response to NOI.* (1) If the DBE wants a hearing, it must email the certifier saying so within 10 days of the NOI. If the DBE does not do so, it loses its opportunity for a hearing.


(2) The certifier and DBE may negotiate a different hearing date from that stated in the NOI. Parties must not engage in dilatory tactics.


(3) If the DBE does not want a hearing, or does not give timely notice to the certifier that it wants one, the DBE may still provide written information and arguments to the certifier rebutting the reasons for decertification stated in the NOI.


(e) *Hearings.* (1) The purpose of the hearing is for the certifier to present its case and for the DBE to rebut the certifier's allegations.


(2) The hearing is an informal proceeding with rules set by the hearing officer. The SEDO's attorney, a non-SEDO, or other individuals involved with the DBE may attend the hearing and answer questions related to their own experience or more generally about the DBE's ownership, structure and operations.


(3) The certifier must maintain a complete record of the hearing, either in writing, video or audio. If the DBE appeals to DOT under ยง 26.89, the certifier must provide that record to DOT and to the DBE.


(f) *Separation of functions.* The certifier must ensure that the decision in a decertification case is made by an individual who did not take part in actions leading to or seeking to implement the proposal to decertify the DBE and is not subject, with respect to the matter, to direction from the office or personnel who did take part in these actions.


(1) The certifier's method of implementing this requirement must be made part of its DBE program and approved by the appropriate OA.


(2) The decisionmaker must be an individual who is knowledgeable about the certification requirements of this part.


(g) *Notice of decision.* The certifier must send the firm a NOD no later than 30 days of the informal hearing and/or receiving written arguments/evidence from the firm in response to the NOI.


(1) The NOD must describe with particularity the reason(s) for the certifier's decision, including specific references to the evidence in the record that supports each reason. The NOD must also inform the firm of the consequences of the decision under paragraph (i) of this section and of its appeal rights under ยง 26.89.


(2) The certifier must send copies of the NOD to the complainant in an ineligibility complaint or to the OA that directed the certifier to initiate the proceeding.


(3) When sending a copy of an NOD to a complainant other than an OA, the certifier must not include information reasonably construed as confidential business information, unless the certifier has the written consent of the firm that submitted the information.


(4) The certifier must make an entry in DOCR's Online Portal within 5 days of the action. The certifier must enter the name of the firm, names(s) of the firm's owner(s), date of decision, and the reason(s) for its decision.


(h) *Status of firm during proceeding.* A DBE remains certified until the certifier issues a NOD.


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Consequences.* Decertification has the following effects on contract and overall goals and DBE participation:


(1) When a prime contractor has made a commitment to use a DBE, but a subcontract has not been executed before the certifier issues the NOD as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, the committed firm does not count toward the contract goal. The recipient must direct the prime contractor to meet the contract goal with an eligible DBE or demonstrate to the recipient that it has made good faith efforts to do so.


(2) When the recipient has made a commitment to using a DBE prime contractor, but a contract has not been executed before the certifier issues the NOD, the decertified firm does not count toward the recipient's overall DBE goal.


(3) If a prime contractor has executed a subcontract with a DBE before the certifier issues the NOD, the prime contractor may continue to receive credit toward the contract goal for the firm's work. In this case, however, the prime contractor may not extend or add work to the contract without prior written consent from the recipient.


(4) If a prime contractor has executed a subcontract with a DBE before the certifier issues the NOD, the prime contractor may continue to receive credit toward the contract goal as set forth in paragraph (j)(3) of this section; however, the portion of the decertified firm's continued performance of the contract must not count toward the recipient's overall goal.


(5) If the recipient executed a prime contract with a DBE that was later decertified, the portion of the decertified firm's performance of the contract remaining after the certifier issued the NOD must not count toward an overall goal, but the DBE's performance of the contract may continue to count toward satisfying any contract goal.


(6) The following exceptions apply to this paragraph (j):


(i) If a certifier decertifies a firm solely because it exceeds the business size standard during the performance of the contract, the recipient may continue to count the portion of the decertified firm's performance of the contract remaining after the certifier issued the NOD toward the recipient's overall goal as well as toward the contract goal.


(ii) If the certifier decertifies the DBE because it was acquired by or merged with a non-DBE, the recipient may not continue to count the portion of the decertified firm's performance on the contract remaining, after the certifier issued a NOD, toward either the contract goal or the overall goal, even if a prime contractor has executed a subcontract with the firm or the recipient has executed a prime contract with the DBE that was later decertified. In this case, if eliminating the credit of the decertified firm will affect the prime contractor's ability to meet the contract goal, the recipient must direct the prime contractor to subcontract to an eligible DBE to the extent needed to meet the contract goal or demonstrate to the recipient that it has made good faith efforts to do so.
