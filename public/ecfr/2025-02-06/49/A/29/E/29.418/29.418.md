# ยง 29.418   May a funding agreement include transfers of State funds?

(a) A State may elect to provide a portion of Federal-aid funds apportioned to the State under chapter 1 of title 23 of the U.S. Code to an eligible Tribe for a project eligible under 23 U.S.C. 202(a).


(b) If a State provides such funds, the transfer may occur in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 202(a)(9), 23 U.S.C. 207(d)(2)(A)(ii), or the State may transfer the funds to the Department, and the Department will transfer the funds to the participating Tribe through the Tribe's funding agreement.


(c) If a State provides such funds, the Tribe (and not the State) will be responsible for:


(1) Constructing and maintaining any projects carried out using the funds;


(2) Administering and supervising the projects and funds in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 207;


(3) Complying with applicable post-construction requirements.


(d) The receipt of any State funds transferred at the election of a State to the Tribe pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 202(a)(9), 23 U.S.C. 207(d)(2)(A)(ii), or funds awarded to a State pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 5311 that are transferred at the election of a State to the Federal Transit Administration for the benefit of a Tribe does not entitle the Tribe to receive contract support costs under 25 U.S.C. 5325(a). While a Tribe is not entitled to additional funds for contract supports costs, a Tribe may use a portion of such State funds for overhead and administrative expenses if such costs are reasonable, allowable, and allocable in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 and the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the funding source.
