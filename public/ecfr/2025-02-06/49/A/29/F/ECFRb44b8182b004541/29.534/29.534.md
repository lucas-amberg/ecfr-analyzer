# § 29.534   What is the process for regulation waivers under this part?

(a) A Tribe may request a waiver of a regulation in this part with respect to a compact or funding agreement. The Tribe must submit the request in writing to the Self-Governance Official to *ttsgp@dot.gov* or use any other method that provides receipt, at the following address: Self-Governance Official, U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary [INSERT MAIL CODE], 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590. The request must be marked with the words “REQUEST TO WAIVE REGULATIONS” on the first page of the request and on the envelope enclosing the request (or in the subject line if by electronic mail). The request must identify the regulation subject to the waiver request, the language the Tribe seeks to waive, and the basis for the request.


(b) Within 10 days of receipt of the waiver request, the Self-Governance Official will send the Tribe an acknowledgement of the waiver request, together with a date-stamped cover sheet that indicates the date on which the Department received the waiver request.


(c) No later than 90 days after the date of receipt of a written request under paragraph (a) of this section, the Department must approve or deny the request in writing. If the application for a waiver is denied, the Department must provide the Tribe with the reasons for the denial as part of the written response.


(d) The Department will consider the following factors in making its decision on a waiver request:


(1) Whether the waiver is contrary to Federal law;


(2) The extent to which the waiver provides flexibility to facilitate the implementation of the Program at the Tribal level consistent with the principles of self-governance;


(3) The extent to which the Tribe will benefit from the waiver; and


(4) Whether the waiver is consistent with Federal transportation policy.


(e) If the Department does not approve or deny a request submitted under paragraph (a) of this section on or before the last day of the 90-day period, the request will be deemed approved by operation of law.


(f) A decision by the Department on a waiver request is a final agency action subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.
