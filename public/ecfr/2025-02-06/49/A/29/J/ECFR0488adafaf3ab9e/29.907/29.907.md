# ยง 29.907   When and how must a Tribe appeal a pre-award decision?

(a) Unless a Tribe appeals, a pre-award decision becomes final 30 days after receipt by the Tribe. To appeal the pre-award decision, a Tribe must submit a written request to the Office of the General Counsel and the Self-Governance Official within 30 days of receiving the pre-award decision. The request must include a statement describing the reasons for appeal and any supporting documentation.


(b) The Tribe may request to resolve the dispute using an alternative dispute resolution process before the hearing official issues a decision.
