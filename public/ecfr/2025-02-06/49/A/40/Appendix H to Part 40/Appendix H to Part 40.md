# Appendix H to Part 40—Drug and Alcohol Testing Information that C/TPAs May Transmit to Employers


1. If you are a C/TPA, you may, acting as an intermediary, transmit the information in the following sections of this part to the DER for an employer, if the employer chooses to have you do so. These are the only items that you are permitted to transmit to the employer as an intermediary. The use of C/TPA intermediaries is prohibited in all other cases, such as transmission of laboratory drug test results to MROs, the transmission of medical information from MROs to employers, the transmission of SAP reports to employers, the transmission of positive alcohol test results, and the transmission of medical information from MROs to employers. 


2. In every case, you must ensure that, in transmitting the information, you meet all requirements (*e.g.,* concerning confidentiality and timing) that would apply if the party originating the information (*e.g.,* an MRO or collector) sent the information directly to the employer. For example, if you transmit MROs' drug testing results to DERs, you must transmit each drug test result to the DER in compliance with the requirements for MROs set forth in § 40.167.
