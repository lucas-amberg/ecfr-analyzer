# § 40.61   What are the preliminary steps in the drug testing collection process?

As the collector, you must take the following steps before actually beginning a collection: 


(a) When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's work site, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing, the DER must determine whether the employee has refused to test (*see* §§ 40.191(a)(1) and 40.355(i)). In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing (other than for a pre-employment test) and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must determine whether the employee has refused to test (*see* §§ 40.191(a)(1) and 40.355(j)). 


(b) Ensure that, when the employee enters the collection site, you begin the testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or is unable to urinate or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. 


(1) If the employee is also going to take a DOT alcohol test, you must ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the alcohol test is completed before the drug testing collection process begins. 


(2) If the employee needs medical attention (*e.g.,* an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to collect a specimen. 


(3) You must not collect a specimen from an unconscious employee to conduct a drug test under this part.


(4) You must not catheterize a conscious employee for purposes of a urine test. However, you must inform an employee who normally voids through self-catheterization that the employee is required to provide a specimen in that manner. If an employee normally voids through self-catheterization, but declines to do so for the urine test, the collector should notify the DER of the circumstances, so that the actual employer can determine whether the situation constitutes a refusal to test by the employee. 


(c) Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employed individual) or a Federal, state, or local government (*e.g.,* a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact a DER to verify the identity of the employee. 


(d) If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name, but does not have to include your picture, address, or telephone number. 


(e) Explain the basic collection procedure to the employee, and notify the employee that instructions for completing the CCF can be found at the HHS (*https://www.samhsa.gov/workplace*) and DOT (*https://www.transportation.gov/odapc*) websites. 


(f) Direct the employee to remove outer clothing (*e.g.,* coveralls, jacket, coat, hat) that could be used to conceal items or substances that could be used to tamper with a specimen. You must also direct the employee to leave these garments and any briefcase, purse, or other personal belongings with you or in a mutually agreeable location. You must advise the employee that failure to comply with your directions constitutes a refusal to test. 


(1) If the employee asks for a receipt for any belongings left with you, you must provide one. 


(2) You must allow the employee to keep his or her wallet. 


(3) You must not ask the employee to remove other clothing (*e.g.,* shirts, pants, dresses, underwear), to remove all clothing, or to change into a hospital or examination gown (unless the urine collection is being accomplished simultaneously with a DOT agency-authorized medical examination). 


(4) You must direct the employee to empty his or her pockets and display the items in them to ensure that no items are present which could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen, the employee can place the items back into his or her pockets. As the employee, you must allow the collector to make this observation. 


(5) If, in your duties under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, you find any material that could be used to tamper with a specimen, you must: 


(i) Determine if the material appears to be brought to the collection site with the intent to alter the specimen, and, if it is, either conduct a directly observed urine collection using direct observation procedures (*see* § 40.67) or an oral fluid specimen collection, make a note on the CCF and continue with collection process; or 


(ii) Determine if the material appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site (*e.g.,* eye drops), secure and maintain it until the collection process is completed and conduct a normal (*i.e.,* unobserved) collection. 


(g) You must instruct the employee not to list medications that he or she is currently taking on the CCF. (The employee may make notes of medications on the back of the employee copy of the form for his or her own convenience, but these notes must not be transmitted to anyone else.)
