# § 40.69   How is a monitored urine collection conducted?

(a) As stated in § 40.42(f)(2), if you are conducting a urine collection in a multi-stall restroom and you cannot secure all sources of water and other substances that could be used for adulteration and substitution, you must conduct a monitored collection. This is the only circumstance in which you must conduct a monitored collection.


(b) As the collector, you must secure the room being used for the monitored collection so that no one except the employee and the monitor can enter it until after the collection has been completed. 


(c) As the collector, you must ensure that the monitor is the same gender as the employee, unless the monitor is a medical professional (e.g., nurse, doctor, physician's assistant, technologist, or technician licensed or certified to practice in the jurisdiction in which the collection takes place). The monitor can be a different person from the collector and need not be a qualified collector.


(d) As the collector, if someone else is to monitor the collection (e.g., in order to ensure a same-gender monitor), you must verbally instruct that person to follow the procedures of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. If you, the collector, are the monitor, you must follow these procedures.


(e) As the monitor, you must not watch the employee urinate into the collection container. If you hear sounds or make other observations indicating an attempt to tamper with a specimen, there must be an additional collection under direct observation. *See* §§ 40.63(e), 40.65(c), and 40.67(c)(2)(3)). 


(f) As the monitor, you must ensure that the employee takes the collection container directly to the collector as soon as the employee has exited the enclosure. 


(g) As the collector, when someone else has acted as the monitor, you must note that person's name in the “Remarks” line of the CCF (Step 2). 


(h) As the employee being tested, if you decline to permit a collection authorized under this section to be monitored, it is a refusal to test.
