# § 40.74   How does the collector prepare the oral fluid specimens?

(a) The collector follows the manufacturer's instructions to package the split specimen collections.


(b) A volume of at least 1 mL of undiluted (neat) oral fluid is collected for the specimen designated as “Bottle A”, and a volume of at least 1 mL of undiluted (neat) oral fluid is collected for the specimen designated as “Bottle B”, or an otherwise sufficient amount of oral fluid is collected to permit an HHS-certified laboratory to analyze the specimen(s).


(c) In the presence of the employee, the collector places a tamper-evident seal from the CCF over the cap of each specimen container, taking care not to obstruct the expiration date on the collection containers. The collector must record the date of the collection on the tamper-evident seals, after they are affixed to the specimen containers.


(d) The collector instructs the employee to initial the tamper-evident seals on each specimen container. If the employee declines to do so, the collector must note this in the “Remarks” line of the CCF (Step 2) and complete the collection process.
