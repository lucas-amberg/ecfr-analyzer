# § 40.127   What are the MRO's functions in reviewing negative test results?

As the MRO, you must do the following with respect to negative drug test results you receive from a laboratory, prior to verifying the result and releasing it to the DER: 


(a) Review Copy 2 of the CCF to determine if there are any fatal or correctable errors that may require you to initiate corrective action or to cancel the test (see §§ 40.199 and 40.203). 


(b) Review the negative laboratory test result and ensure that it is consistent with the information contained on the CCF. 


(c) Before you report a negative test result, you must have in your possession the following documents: 


(1) Copy 2 of the CCF, a legible copy of it, or any other CCF copy containing the employee's signature; and 


(2) A legible copy (fax, photocopy, image) of Copy 1 of the CCF or the electronic laboratory results report that conveys the negative laboratory test result. 


(d) If the copy of the documentation provided to you by the collector or laboratory appears unclear, you must request that the collector or laboratory send you a legible copy. 


(e) On Copy 2 of the CCF, place a check mark in the “Negative” box (Step 6), provide your name, and sign, initial, or stamp and date the verification statement. 


(f) Report the result in a confidential manner (see §§ 40.163-40.167). 


(g) Staff under your direct, personal supervision may perform the administrative functions of this section for you, but only you can cancel a test. If you cancel a laboratory-confirmed negative result, check the “Test Cancelled” box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, make appropriate annotation in the “Remarks” line, provide your name, and sign, initial or stamp and date the verification statement.


(1) On specimen results that are reviewed by your staff, you are responsible for assuring the quality of their work. 


(2) You are required to personally review at least 5 percent of all CCFs reviewed by your staff on a quarterly basis, including all results that required a corrective action. However, you need not review more than 500 negative results of all specimen types combined in any quarter. 


(3) Your review must, as a minimum, include the CCF, negative laboratory test result, any accompanying corrective documents, and the report sent to the employer. You must correct any errors that you discover. You must take action as necessary to ensure compliance by your staff with this part and document your corrective action. You must attest to the quality assurance review by initialing the CCFs that you review. 


(4) You must make these CCFs easily identifiable and retrievable by you for review by DOT agencies.
