# § 40.153   How does the MRO notify employees of their right to a test of the split specimen?

(a) As the MRO, when you have verified a drug test as positive for a drug or drug metabolite, or as a refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, you must notify the employee of his or her right to have the split specimen tested. You must also notify the employee of the procedures for requesting a test of the split specimen. 


(b) You must inform the employee that he or she has 72 hours from the time you provide this notification to him or her to request a test of the split specimen. 


(c) You must tell the employee how to contact you to make this request. You must provide telephone numbers or other information that will allow the employee to make this request. As the MRO, you must have the ability to receive the employee's calls at all times during the 72 hour period (*e.g.,* by use of an answering machine with a “time stamp” feature when there is no one in your office to answer the phone). 


(d) You must tell the employee that if he or she makes this request within 72 hours, the employer must ensure that the test takes place, and that the employee is not required to pay for the test from his or her own funds before the test takes place. You must also tell the employee that the employer may seek reimbursement for the cost of the test (see § 40.173). 


(e) You must tell the employee that additional tests of the specimen *e.g.,* DNA tests) are not authorized.
