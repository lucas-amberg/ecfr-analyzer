(b) You must fax, courier, mail, or electronically transmit a legible image or copy of the fully-completed Copy 1 of the CCF, which has been signed by the certifying scientist.


(c) You must transmit the laboratory result to the MRO immediately, preferably on the same day or next business day as the result is signed and released.
