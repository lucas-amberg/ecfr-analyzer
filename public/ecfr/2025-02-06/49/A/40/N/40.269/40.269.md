# § 40.269   What problems cause an alcohol test to be cancelled unless they are corrected?

As a BAT or STT, or employer, you must cancel an alcohol test if any of the following problems occur, unless they are corrected. These are “correctable flaws.” These problems are: 


(a) The BAT or STT does not sign the ATF (see §§ 40.247(a)(1) and 40.255(a)(1)). 


(b) The BAT or STT fails to note on the “Remarks” line of the ATF that the employee has not signed the ATF after the result is obtained (see § 40.255(a)(3)). 


(c) The BAT or STT uses a non-DOT form for the test (see § 40.225(a)).
