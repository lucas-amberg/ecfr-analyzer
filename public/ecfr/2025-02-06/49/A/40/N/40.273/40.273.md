# ยง 40.273   What is the effect of a cancelled alcohol test?

(a) A cancelled alcohol test is neither positive nor negative. 


(1) As an employer, you must not attach to a cancelled test the consequences of a test result that is 0.02 or greater (*e.g.,* removal from a safety-sensitive position). 


(2) As an employer, you must not use a cancelled test in a situation where an employee needs a test result that is below 0.02 (*e.g.,* in the case of a return-to-duty or follow-up test to authorize the employee to perform safety-sensitive functions). 


(3) As an employer, you must not direct a recollection for an employee because a test has been cancelled, except in the situations cited in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or other provisions of this part. 


(b) A cancelled test does not count toward compliance with DOT requirements, such as a minimum random testing rate. 


(c) When a test must be cancelled, if you are the BAT, STT, or other person who determines that the cancellation is necessary, you must inform the affected DER within 48 hours of the cancellation. 


(d) A cancelled DOT test does not provide a valid basis for an employer to conduct a non-DOT test (*i.e.,* a test under company authority).
