# ยง 40.309   What are the employer's responsibilities with respect to the SAP's directions for follow-up tests?

(a) As the employer, you must carry out the SAP's follow-up testing requirements. You may not allow the employee to continue to perform safety-sensitive functions unless follow-up testing is conducted as directed by the SAP. 


(b) You should schedule follow-up tests on dates of your own choosing, but you must ensure that the tests are unannounced with no discernable pattern as to their timing, and that the employee is given no advance notice. 


(c) You cannot substitute any other tests (*e.g.,* those carried out under the random testing program) conducted on the employee for this follow-up testing requirement.


(d) You cannot count a follow-up test that has been cancelled as a completed test. A cancelled follow-up test must be recollected.
