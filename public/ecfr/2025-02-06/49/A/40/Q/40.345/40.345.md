# ยง 40.345   In what circumstances may a C/TPA act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug and alcohol testing information to employers?

(a) As a C/TPA or other service agent, you may act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug and alcohol testing information in the circumstances specified in this section only if the employer chooses to have you do so. Each employer makes the decision about whether to receive some or all of this information from you, acting as an intermediary, rather than directly from the service agent who originates the information (*e.g.,* an MRO or BAT). 


(b) The specific provisions of this part concerning which you may act as an intermediary are listed in appendix H to this part. These are the only situations in which you may act as an intermediary. You are prohibited from doing so in all other situations. 


(c) In every case, you must ensure that, in transmitting information to employers, you meet all requirements (*e.g.,* concerning confidentiality and timing) that would apply if the service agent originating the information (*e.g.,* an MRO or collector) sent the information directly to the employer. For example, if you transmit drug testing results from MROs to DERs, you must transmit each drug test result to the DER in compliance with the MRO requirements set forth in ยง 40.167.
