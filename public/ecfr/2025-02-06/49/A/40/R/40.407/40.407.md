# ยง 40.407   May a service agent ask to have a PIE reduced or terminated?

(a) Yes, as a service agent concerning whom the Department has issued a PIE, you may request that the Director terminate a PIE or reduce its duration and/or scope. This process is limited to the issues of duration and scope. It is not an appeal or reconsideration of the decision to issue the PIE. 


(b) Your request must be in writing and supported with documentation. 


(c) You must wait at least nine months from the date on which the Director issued the PIE to make this request. 


(d) The initiating official who was the proponent of the PIE may provide information and arguments concerning your request to the Director. 


(e) If the Director verifies that the sources of your noncompliance have been eliminated and that all drug or alcohol testing-related services you would provide to DOT-regulated employers will be consistent with the requirements of this part, the Director may issue a notice terminating or reducing the PIE.
