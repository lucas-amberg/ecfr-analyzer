# ยง 7.1   General.

(a) This part implements the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and prescribes rules governing the public availability of Department of Transportation (DOT) records.


(b) Subpart B of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning the public availability of:


(1) Records and indices that DOT is required to publish in the _Federal Register_ pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) (described in ยง 7.11(a)); and


(2) Records and indices that DOT is required to make available to the public in a reading room without need for a specific request, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) (described in ยง 7.12(a)).


(c) Subpart C of this Part contains the DOT regulations concerning records that may be requested from DOT under the FOIA, namely, records that DOT is not required to publish in the _Federal Register_ or make publicly available in a reading room under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (E) and frequently requested records even if DOT has made them publicly available as required under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D). Because DOT and its components make many of these records available on their Web pages (*http://www.dot.gov* or *http://www.dot.gov/foia*), requesters may find it preferable to obtain such records directly from the Web pages instead of submitting a FOIA request, if the Web pages contain records that meet their needs.


(d) Subpart D of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning time limits applicable to processing requests for records under subpart C.


(e) Subpart E of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning processing fees applicable to records made available under subpart B or requested under subpart C.
