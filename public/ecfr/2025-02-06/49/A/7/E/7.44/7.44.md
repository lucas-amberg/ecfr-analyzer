# ยง 7.44   How can I pay a processing fee for records requested under subpart B or subpart C of this part?

Fees typically should be paid online, using a credit card, debit card, or electronic check. The DOT FOIA page (*http://www.dot.gov/foia*) has direct links to the electronic payment site. Any fees paid with a paper check, draft, or money order must be made payable to the U.S. Treasury and delivered as directed by the applicable FOIA Requester Service Center identified in ยง 7.27 (if the fees are for records made available under subpart C) or the DOT Dockets Office identified in ยง 7.12(b)(1) (if the fees are for records made available under subpart B).
