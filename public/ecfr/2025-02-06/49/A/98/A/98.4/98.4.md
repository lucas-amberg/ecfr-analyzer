(a) Whenever the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights and General Law has determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that a former Departmental employee has violated 18 U.S.C. 207, the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General Law:


(1) Shall expeditiously provide that information to the Director, Office of Government Ethics, and to the Criminal Division, Department of Justice; and


(2) After coordinating any proceeding with the Criminal Division, Department of Justice, to avoid prejudicing criminal proceedings, may institute an administrative disciplinary proceeding in accordance with this part.

(1) In a case where the last Departmental employer of the alleged violator is the Office of the Secretary, the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights and General Law, or his or her designee; or


(2) In a case where the last Departmental employer of the alleged violator is an administration, the Chief Counsel, or his or her designee, for that administration.


(c) Before beginning an administrative disciplinary proceeding, the Departmental counsel shall provide the former employee with actual notice of the institution of a proceeding. This notice must include:


(1) A statement of allegations and the basis for those allegations, which statement must be sufficiently detailed to enable the former employee to prepare an adequate defense;


(2) Notification of the right to a hearing;


(3) An explanation of the method by which a hearing may be requested; and


(4) A statement of the possible sanctions that may be imposed if a violation by the former employee is found to have occurred.
