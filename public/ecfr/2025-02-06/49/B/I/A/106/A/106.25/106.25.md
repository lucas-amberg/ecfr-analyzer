# ยง 106.25   Revising regulations without first issuing an ANPRM or NPRM.

PHMSA may add, amend, or delete regulations without first issuing an ANPRM or NPRM in the following situations: 


(a) We may go directly to a final rule or interim final rule if, for good cause, we find that a notice of proposed rulemaking is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We must place that finding and a brief statement of the reasons for it in the final rule or interim final rule. 


(b) We may issue a direct final rule (see ยง 106.40).
