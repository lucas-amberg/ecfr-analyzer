# ยง 106.80   Public meeting procedures.

A public meeting is a non-adversarial, fact-finding proceeding conducted by a PHMSA representative. Generally, public meetings are announced in the _Federal Register._ Interested persons are invited to attend and to present their views to the agency on specific issues. There are no formal pleadings and no adverse parties, and any regulation issued afterward is not necessarily based exclusively on the record of the meeting. Sections 556 and 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 556 and 557) do not apply to public meetings under this part.
