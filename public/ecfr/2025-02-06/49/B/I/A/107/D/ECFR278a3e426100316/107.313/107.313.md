(a) Within 30 days of receipt of a notice of probable violation, the respondent must either:


(1) Admit the violation under ยง 107.315;


(2) Make an informal response under ยง 107.317; or


(3) Request a hearing under ยง 107.319.


(b) Failure of the respondent to file a reply as provided in this section constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations and authorizes the Chief Counsel, without further notice to the respondent, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of probable violation and issue an order directing compliance or assess a civil penalty, or, if proposed in the notice, both. Failure to request a hearing under paragraph (a)(3) of this section constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to a hearing.


(c) Upon the request of the respondent, the Office of Chief Counsel may, for good cause shown and filed within the 30 days prescribed in the notice of probable violation, extend the 30-day response period.
