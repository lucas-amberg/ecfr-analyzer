# § 109.13   Closing packages and safe resumption of transportation.

(a) *No imminent hazard found.* If, after an agent exercises an authority under § 109.5, the agent finds that no imminent hazard exists, and the package otherwise conforms to applicable requirements in subchapter C of this chapter, the agent will:


(1) Assist in preparing the package for safe and prompt transportation, when practicable, by reclosing the package in accordance with the packaging manufacturer's closure instructions or other appropriate closure method;


(2) Mark and certify the reclosed package to indicate that it was opened and reclosed in accordance with this part;


(3) Return the package to the person from whom the agent obtained it, as soon as practicable; and


(4) For a package containing a perishable hazardous material, assist in resuming the safe and expeditious transportation of the package as soon as practicable after determining that the package presents no imminent hazard.


(b) *Imminent hazard found.* If an imminent hazard is found to exist after an agent exercises an authority under § 109.5, the Administrator or his/her designee may issue an out-of-service order prohibiting the movement of the package until the package has been brought into compliance with subchapter C of this chapter. Upon receipt of the out-of-service order, the person in possession of, or responsible for, the package must remove the package from transportation until it is brought into compliance.


(c) *Package does not contain hazardous material.* If, after an agent exercises an authority under § 109.5, the agent finds that a package does not contain a hazardous material, the agent shall securely close the package, mark and certify the reclosed package to indicate that it was opened and reclosed, and return the package to transportation.


(d) *Non-compliant package.* If, after an agent exercises an authority under § 109.5, the agent finds that a package contains hazardous material and does not conform to requirements in subchapter C of this chapter, but does not present an imminent hazard, the agent will return the package to the person in possession of the package at the time the non-compliance is discovered for appropriate corrective action. A non-compliant package may not continue in transportation until all identified non-compliance issues are resolved.
