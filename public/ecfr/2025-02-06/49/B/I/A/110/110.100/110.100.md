If a recipient fails to comply with any term of the grant agreement, a noncompliance action may be taken. The recipient will have the opportunity to object and provide information and documentation challenging the suspension or termination action. Costs incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of the grant agreement are not allowable unless the Associate Administrator authorizes it in writing. Grant agreements may also be terminated in whole or in part with the consent of the recipient at any agreed upon effective date, or by the recipient upon written notification.
