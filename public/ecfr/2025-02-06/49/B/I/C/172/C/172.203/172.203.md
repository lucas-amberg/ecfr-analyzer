For example, “UN 2924, Flammable liquid, corrosive, n.o.s., 3 (8), II (contains Methanol, Potassium hydroxide)”.


(2) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply—


(i) To a material that is a hazardous waste and described using the proper shipping name “Hazardous waste, liquid *or* solid, n.o.s.”, classed as a miscellaneous Class 9, provided the EPA hazardous waste number is included on the shipping paper in association with the basic description, or provided the material is described in accordance with the provisions of § 172.203(c) of this part.


(ii) To a material for which the hazard class is to be determined by testing under the criteria in § 172.101(c)(11).


(iii) If the n.o.s. description for the material (other than a mixture of hazardous materials of different classes meeting the definitions of more than one hazard class) contains the name of the chemical element or group which is primarily responsible for the material being included in the hazard class indicated.

Where two or more components that make the material a marine pollutant are present, the names of at least two of the components most predominantly contributing to the marine pollutant designation must appear in parentheses in association with the basic description. For material described using “UN3077, Environmentally hazardous substance, solid, n.o.s.” and “UN3082, Environmentally hazardous substance, liquid, n.o.s.,” *see* § 172.102(c)(1), special provision 441 for additional provisions.


(2) The words “Marine Pollutant” shall be entered in association with the basic description for a material which is a marine pollutant.

(m) *Poisonous Materials.* Notwithstanding the hazard class to which a material is assigned, for materials that are poisonous by inhalation (see § 171.8 of this subchapter), the words “Poison-Inhalation Hazard” or “Toxic-Inhalation Hazard” and the words “Zone A”, “Zone B”, “Zone C”, or “Zone D” for gases or “Zone A” or “Zone B” for liquids, as appropriate, shall be entered on the shipping paper immediately following the shipping description. The word “Poison” or “Toxic” need not be repeated if it otherwise appears in the shipping description.


(n) *Elevated temperature materials.* If a liquid material in a package meets the definition of an elevated temperature material in § 171.8 of this subchapter, and the fact that it is an elevated temperature material is not disclosed in the proper shipping name (for example, when the words “Molten” or “Elevated temperature” are part of the proper shipping name), the word “HOT” must immediately precede the proper shipping name of the material on the shipping paper.
