# § 172.324   Hazardous substances in non-bulk packagings.

For each non-bulk package that contains a hazardous substance—


(a) Except for packages of radioactive material labeled in accordance with § 172.403, if the proper shipping name of a material that is a hazardous substance does not identify the hazardous substance by name, the name of the hazardous substance must be marked on the package, in parentheses, in association with the proper shipping name. If the material contains two or more hazardous substances, at least two hazardous substances, including the two with the lowest reportable quantities (RQs), must be identified. For a hazardous waste, the waste code (e.g., D001), if appropriate, may be used to identify the hazardous substance.


(b) The letters “RQ” must be marked on the package in association with the proper shipping name.


(c) A package of limited quantity material marked in accordance with § 172.315 must also be marked in accordance with the applicable requirements of this section.
