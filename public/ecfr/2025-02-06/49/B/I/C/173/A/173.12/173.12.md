(4) Each package is loaded by the shipper and unloaded by the consignee, unless the motor carrier is a private or contract carrier.


(5) The packaging may be used only once under this paragraph and may not be used again for shipment of hazardous materials except in accordance with § 173.28.


(d) *Technical names for n.o.s. descriptions.* The requirements for the inclusion of technical names for n.o.s. descriptions on shipping papers and package markings, §§ 172.203 and 172.301 of this subchapter, respectively, do not apply to packages prepared in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, except that packages containing materials meeting the definition of a hazardous substance must be described as required in § 172.203 of this subchapter and marked as required in § 172.324 of this subchapter.
