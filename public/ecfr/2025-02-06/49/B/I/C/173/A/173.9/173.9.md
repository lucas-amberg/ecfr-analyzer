# § 173.9   Transport vehicles or freight containers containing lading which has been fumigated.

(a) For the purpose of this section, not including 49 CFR part 387, a rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer in which the lading has been fumigated with any material, or is undergoing fumigation, is a package containing a hazardous material.


(b) No person may offer for transportation or transport a rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer in which the lading has been fumigated or treated with any material, or is undergoing fumigation, unless the FUMIGANT marking specified in paragraph (e) of this section is prominently displayed so that it can be seen by any person attempting to enter the interior of the transport vehicle or freight container. For domestic transportation, a hazard warning label authorized by EPA under 40 CFR part 156 may be used as an alternative to the FUMIGANT marking.


(c) No person may affix or display on a rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer the FUMIGANT marking specified in paragraph (e) of this section, unless the lading has been fumigated or is undergoing fumigation.


(d) The FUMIGANT marking required by paragraph (b) of this section must remain on the rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer until the rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer has been completely ventilated either by opening the doors of the unit or by mechanical ventilation to ensure no harmful concentration of gas remains after fumigation has been completed.


(e) *FUMIGANT marking.* (1) The FUMIGANT marking must consist of black letters on a white background that is a rectangle at least 400 mm (15.75 inches) wide and at least 300 mm (11.8 inches) high as measured to the outside of the lines forming the border of the marking. The minimum width of the line forming the border must be 2 mm and the text on the marking must not be less than 25 mm high. Except for size and color, the FUMIGANT marking must be as shown in the following figure. Where dimensions are not specified, all features shall be in approximate proportion to those shown.


(i) The marking, and all required information, must be capable of withstanding, without deterioration or a substantial reduction in effectiveness, a 30-day exposure to open weather conditions.


(ii) [Reserved]


(2) The “*” shall be replaced with the technical name of the fumigant.


(f) A closed cargo transport unit that has been fumigated is not subject to any other provisions of this subchapter if it—


(1) Has been completely ventilated either by opening the doors of the unit or by mechanical ventilation after fumigation, and


(2) Displays the FUMIGANT marking, including the date of ventilation.


(g) For international shipments, transport documents should indicate the date of fumigation, type and amount of fumigant used, and instructions for disposal of any residual fumigant, including fumigation devices.


(h) Any person subject to the requirements of this section, solely due to the fumigated lading, must be informed of the requirements of this section and the safety precautions necessary to protect themselves and others in the event of an incident or accident involving the fumigated lading.


(i) Any person who offers for transportation or transports a rail car, freight container, truck body or trailer that is subject to this subchapter solely because of the hazardous materials designation specified in paragraph (a) of this section is not subject to any requirements of this subchapter other than those contained in this section.
