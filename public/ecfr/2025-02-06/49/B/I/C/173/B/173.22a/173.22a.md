(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person may offer a hazardous material for transportation in a packaging the use of which is dependent upon an exemption or special permit issued under subpart B of part 107 of this title, unless that person is the holder of or a party to the exemption or special permit.


(b) If an exemption or special permit authorizes the use of a packaging for the transportation of a hazardous material by any person or class of persons other than or in addition to the holder of the exemption or special permit, that person or a member of that class of persons may use the packaging for the purposes authorized in the exemption or special permit subject to the terms specified therein. Copies of exemptions and special permits may be obtained by accessing the Hazardous Materials Safety Web site at *http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/regs/sp-a”* or by writing to the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety, U.S. Department of Transportation, East Building, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001, Attention: Records Center.


(c) When an exemption or special permit issued to a person who offers a hazardous material contains requirements that apply to a carrier of the hazardous material, the offeror shall furnish a copy of the current exemption or special permit to the carrier before or at the time a shipment is tendered.
