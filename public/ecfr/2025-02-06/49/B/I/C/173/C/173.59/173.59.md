*Explosive, extremely insensitive substance (EIS).* A substance that has demonstrated through tests that it is so insensitive that there is very little probability of accidental initiation.


*Explosive, primary.* Explosive substance which is manufactured with a view to producing a practical effect by explosion, is very sensitive to heat, impact, or friction, and even in very small quantities, detonates. The major primary explosives are mercury fulminate, lead azide, and lead styphnate.


*Explosive, secondary.* An explosive substance which is relatively insensitive (when compared to primary explosives) and is usually initiated by primary explosives with or without the aid of boosters or supplementary charges. Such an explosive may react as a deflagrating or as a detonating explosive.

*Initiation, means of.* (1) A device intended to cause the detonation of an explosive (for example: detonator, detonator for ammunition, or detonating fuze).


(2) The term *with its own means of initiation* means that the contrivance has its normal initiating device assembled to it and this device is considered to present a significant risk during transport but not one great enough to be unacceptable. The term does not apply, however, to a contrivance packed together with its means of initiation, provided the device is packaged so as to eliminate the risk of causing detonation of the contrivance in the event of functioning of the initiating device. The initiating device can even be assembled in the contrivance provided there are protective features ensuring that the device is very unlikely to cause detonation of the contrivance under conditions which are associated with transport.


(3) For the purposes of classification, any means of initiation without two effective protective features should be regarded as Compatibility Group B; an article with its own means of initiation, without two effective protective features, is Compatibility Group F. A means of initiation which itself possesses two effective protective features is Compatibility Group D, and an article with its own means of initiation which possesses two effective features is Compatibility Group D or E. A means of initiation, adjudged as having two effective protective features, must be approved by the Associate Administrator. A common and effective way of achieving the necessary degree of protection is to use a means of initiation which incorporates two or more independent safety features.

The phlegmatizer renders the explosive insensitive, or less sensitive, to the following actions: heat, shock, impact, percussion or friction. Typical phlegmatizing agents include, but are not limited to: wax, paper, water, polymers (such as chlorofluoropolymers), alcohol and oils (such as petroleum jelly and paraffin).

*Powder, smokeless.* Substance based on nitrocellulose used as propellant. The term includes propellants with a single base (nitrocellulose (NC) alone), those with a double base (such as NC and nitroglycerin (NG)) and those with a triple base (such as NC/NG/nitroguanidine).
