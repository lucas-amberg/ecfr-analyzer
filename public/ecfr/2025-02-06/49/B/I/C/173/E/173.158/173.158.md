(1) In 4C1, 4C2, 4D or 4F wooden boxes with inner packagings consisting of glass bottles further individually overpacked in tightly closed metal packagings. Glass bottles must be of 2.5 L (0.66 gallon) or less capacity and cushioned with a non-reactive, absorbent material within the metal packagings.


(2) In combination packagings with 1A2, 1B2, 1N2, 1D, 1G, 1H2, 3H2, 4A, 4B, 4N or 4G outer packagings with inner glass packagings of 2.5 L (0.66 gallons) or less capacity cushioned with a non-reactive, absorbent material and packed within a tightly closed intermediate packaging of metal or plastic.


(e) Nitric acid of less than 90 percent concentration, when offered for transportation or transported by rail, highway, or water may be packaged in 4A, 4B, or 4N metal boxes, 4G fiberboard boxes or 4C1, 4C2, 4D or 4F wooden boxes with inside glass packagings of not over 2.5 L (0.66 gallon) capacity each. Beginning September 17, 2018, when placed in wooden or fiberboard outer packagings, glass inner packagings must be packed in tightly-closed, intermediate packagings and cushioned with absorbent material sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the package. The intermediate packaging and absorbent material must be compatible with the nitric acid. See § 173.24(e).


(f) Nitric acid of 70 percent or less concentration, when offered for transportation or transported by rail, highway, or water, may be packaged as follows:


(1) In composite packagings 6PA1, 6PA2, 6PB1, 6PB2, 6PC, 6PD1, 6PH1, or 6PH2. 6HH1 and 6HA1 composite packaging with plastic inner receptacles meeting the compatibility requirements § 173.24(e) (e.g., PFA Teflon) are authorized.


(2) In 4H1 expanded plastic boxes with inner glass packagings of not over 2.5 L (0.66 gallon) each.


(3) In combination packagings with 1A2, 1B2, 1N2, 1D, 1G, 1H2, 3H2, 4C1, 4C2, 4D, 4F, 4G, 4A, 4B or 4N outer packagings and plastic inner packagings not over 2.5 L (0.66 gallon) capacity further individually overpacked in tightly closed metal packagings.


(g) Nitric acid of more than 70 percent concentration, when offered for transportation or transported by cargo aircraft only, must be packaged in combination packagings with 1A2, 1B2, 1N2, 1D, 1G, 1H2, 3H2, 4C1, 4C2, 4D, 4F, 4G, 4A, 4B or 4N outer packagings with glass or earthenware inner packagings of not over 1 L (0.3 gallon) or glass ampoules of not over 0.5 L (0.1 gallon).

(1) Each drum may only be used one time and must be destroyed after emptying.


(2) Each drum must be permanently and legibly marked “Single Trip Only” and “Must be Destroyed When Empty.”


(j) Nitric acid solutions, other than red fuming, with more than 70% nitric acid and Nitric acid solutions, other than red fuming, with not more than 70% nitric acid, when offered for transportation or transported by rail, highway, cargo vessel, or cargo-only aircraft may be packaged in a UN 4G outer fiberboard box meeting the Packing Group I or II performance level, as appropriate, subject to the following conditions:
