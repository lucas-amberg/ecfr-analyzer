# § 173.164   Mercury (metallic and articles containing mercury).

(a) For transportation by aircraft, mercury must be packaged in packagings which meet the requirements of part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group I performance level, as follows:


(1) In inner packagings of earthenware, glass or plastic containing not more than 3.5 kg (7.7 pounds) of mercury, or inner packagings that are glass ampoules containing not more than 0.5 kg (1.1 pounds) of mercury, or iron or steel quicksilver flasks containing not more than 35 kg (77 pounds) of mercury. The inner packagings or flasks must be packed in steel drums (1A1, 1A2), metal, other than steel or aluminum drums (1N1, 1N2), steel jerricans (3A2), wooden boxes (4C1, 4C2), plywood boxes (4D), reconstituted wood boxes (4F), fiberboard boxes (4G), metal, other than steel or aluminum boxes (4N), plastic boxes (4H2), plywood drums (1D) or fiber drums (1G).


(2) [Reserved] 


(3) When inner packagings of earthenware, glass or plastic are used, they must be packed in the outer packaging with sufficient cushioning material to prevent breakage.


(4) Either the inner packagings or the outer packagings must have inner linings or bags of strong leakproof and puncture-resistant material impervious to mercury, completely surrounding the contents, so that the escape of mercury will be prevented irrespective of the position of the package.


(5) [Reserved]


(b) When transported as cargo, manufactured articles or apparatuses, each containing not more than 100 mg (0.0035 ounce) of mercury and packaged so that the quantity of mercury per package does not exceed 1 g (0.035 ounce) are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.


(c) Manufactured articles or apparatuses containing mercury are excepted from the specification packaging requirements of this subchapter when packaged as follows:


(1) Manufactured articles or apparatuses of which metallic mercury is a component part, such as manometers, pumps, thermometers, switches, etc. (for electron tubes, mercury vapor tubes and similar tubes, see paragraph (c)(3) of this section), must be in strong outer packagings, having sealed inner liners or bags of strong leakproof and puncture-resistant material impervious to mercury, which will prevent the escape of mercury from the package irrespective of its position. Mercury switches and relays are excepted from these packaging requirements, if they are totally enclosed, leakproof and in sealed metal or plastic units.


(2) When transported as cargo, thermometers, switches and relays, each containing a total quantity of not more than 15 g (0.53 ounces) of mercury, are excepted from the requirements of this subchapter if installed as an integral part of a machine or apparatus and so fitted that shock of impact damage, leading to leakage of mercury, is unlikely to occur under conditions normally incident to transport.


(3) Electron tubes, mercury vapor tubes and similar tubes must be packaged as follows:


(i) Tubes which are packed in strong outer packagings with all seams and joints sealed with self-adhesive, pressure-sensitive tape which will prevent the escape of mercury from the package, are authorized up to a total net quantity of 450 g (15.9 ounces) of mercury per package;


(ii) Tubes with more than 450 g (15.9 ounces) of mercury are authorized only when packed in strong outer packagings, having sealed inner liners or bags of strong leakproof and puncture-resistant material impervious to mercury which will prevent escape of mercury from the package irrespective of its position;


(iii) Tubes which do not contain more than 5 g (0.2 ounce) of mercury each and which are packed in the manufacturer's original packagings, are authorized up to a total net quantity of 30 g (1.1 ounces) of mercury per package;


(iv) Tubes which are completely jacketed in sealed leakproof metal cases are authorized in the manufacturer's original packagings.


(4) A person offering for transportation electron tubes, mercury vapor tubes, and similar tubes shall indicate the quantity of mercury therein on the shipping paper.


(5) Mercurial barometers conforming to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which are loaded and unloaded from an aircraft under the supervision of, and accompanied in flight by, a National Weather Service official or similar United States agency official, are excepted from any other requirements of this subchapter.


(d) For transportation by other than aircraft, mercury must be packaged—


(1) In any packaging which meets the requirements of part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group III performance level; or


(2) In non-specification reusable metal packagings.


(e) Except for a hazardous substance or a hazardous waste or for transportation by aircraft or vessel, packages containing less than 0.45 kg (1.0 pound) net weight of mercury are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.


(f) For vessel transport, manufactured articles or instruments containing less than 0.45 kg (1.0 pound) of mercury are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
