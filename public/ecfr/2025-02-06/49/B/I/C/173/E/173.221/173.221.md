# § 173.221   Polymeric beads, expandable and Plastic molding compound.

(a) For non-bulk shipments of Polymeric beads (or granules), expandable *evolving flammable vapor* and Plastic molding compound *in dough, sheet, or extruded rope form, evolving flammable vapor* the following packagings are authorized:


(1) *Single packagings.* Metal box (4A, 4B, or 4N); Wooden box (4C1 or 4C2); Plywood box (4D); Fiberboard box (4G); Reconstituted wood box (4F); Plastic box (4H1 or 4H2); Plywood drums: (1D) or Fiber drums (1G) with sealed inner plastic liners; in vapor tight metal or plastic drums (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 1B2, 1N1, 1N2, 1H1 or 1H2); or in vapor tight metal or plastic jerricans (3A1, 3A2, 3B1, 3B2, 3H1, or 3H2).


(2) *Combination packagings*—(i) *Outer packagings:* Steel drum: 1A1 or 1A2; Aluminum drum: 1B1 or 1B2; Plywood drum: 1D; Fiber drum: 1G; Plastic drum: 1H1 or 1H2; Metal drum other than steel or aluminum: 1N1 or 1N2; Steel jerrican: 3A1 or 3A2; Plastic jerrican: 3H1 or 3H2; Aluminum jerrican: 3B1 or 3B2; Steel box: 4A; Aluminum box: 4B; Natural wood box: 4C1 or 4C2; Plywood box: 4D; Reconstituted wood box: 4F; Fiberboard box: 4G; Plastic box: 4H1 or 4H2; or Metal box other than steel or aluminum: 4N.


(ii) *Inner packagings.* Glass receptacles, Plastic receptacles, Metal receptacles, Paper receptacles, or Fiber receptacles.


(3) *Non-specification packagings.* Non-specification packagings when transported in dedicated vehicles or freight containers. The packagings need not conform to the requirements for package testing in part 178 of this subchapter but must be capable of containing any evolving gases from the contents during normal conditions of transportation.


(b) Bulk shipments of Polymeric beads (or granules), expandable, *evolving flammable vapor* or Plastic molding compounds *in dough, sheet or extruded rope, evolving flammable vapor* may be packed in non-specification bulk packagings. Except for transportation by highway and rail, bulk packagings must be capable of containing any gases evolving from the contents during normal conditions of transportation.


(c) For transportation by vessel, the provisions of § 176.907 must be met.


(d) *Exceptions.* When it can be demonstrated that no flammable vapor, resulting in a flammable atmosphere, is evolved according to test U1 (Test method for substances liable to evolve flammable vapors) of Part III, sub-section 38.4.4 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), polymeric beads, expandable need not be classed as Class 9 (UN2211). This test should only be performed when de-classification of a substance is considered.
