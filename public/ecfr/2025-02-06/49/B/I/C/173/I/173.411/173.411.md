# § 173.411   Industrial packages.

(a) *General.* Each industrial package must comply with the requirements of this section which specifies package tests, and record retention applicable to Industrial Package Type 1 (Type IP-1), Industrial Package Type 2 (Type IP-2), and Industrial Package Type 3 (Type IP-3).


(b) *Industrial package certification and tests.* (1) Each Type IP-1 package must meet the general design requirements prescribed in § 173.410.


(2) Each Type IP-2 package must meet the general design requirements prescribed in § 173.410 and when subjected to the tests specified in § 173.465(c) and (d) or evaluated against these tests by any of the methods authorized by § 173.461(a), must prevent:


(i) Loss or dispersal of the radioactive contents; and


(ii) A significant increase in the radiation levels recorded or calculated at the external surfaces for the condition before the test.


(3) Each Type IP-3 package must meet the requirements for Type IP-1 and Type IP-2 packages, and must meet the requirements specified in § 173.412(a) through (j).


(4) A portable tank may be used as a Type IP-2 or Type IP-3 package provided that:


(i) It meets the requirements for Type IP-1 packages specified in paragraph (b)(1);


(ii) It meets the requirements prescribed in Chapter 6.7 of the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, (IBR, *see* § 171.7 of this subchapter), “Requirements for the Design, Construction, Inspection and Testing of Portable Tanks and Multiple-Element Gas Containers (MEGCs),” or other requirements at least equivalent to those standards;


(iii) It is capable of withstanding a test pressure of 265 kPa (38.4 psia); and


(iv) It is designed so that any additional shielding which is provided must be capable of withstanding the static and dynamic stresses resulting from handling and routine conditions of transport and of preventing more than a 20% increase in the maximum radiation level at any external surface of the portable tanks.


(5) A cargo tank or a tank car may be used as Type IP-2 or Type IP-3 package for transporting LSA-I and LSA-II liquids and gases as prescribed in Table 6 of § 173.427, provided that:


(i) It meets the requirements for a Type IP-1 package specified in paragraph (b)(1);


(ii) It is capable of withstanding a test pressure of 265 kPa (38.4 psia); and


(iii) It is designed so that any additional shielding which is provided must be capable of withstanding the static and dynamic stresses resulting from handling and routine conditions of transport and of preventing more than a 20% increase in the maximum radiation level at any external surface of the tanks.


(6) A freight container may be used as Type IP-2 or Type IP-3 packages provided:


(i) The radioactive contents are restricted to solid materials;


(ii) It meets the requirements for a Type IP-1 packages specified in paragraph (b)(1); and


(iii) It meets the standards prescribed in the International Organization for Standardization document ISO 1496-1: “Series 1 Freight Containers—Specifications and Testing—Part 1: General Cargo Containers; excluding dimensions and ratings (IBR, *see* § 171.7 of this subchapter). It must be designed such that if subjected to the tests prescribed in that document and the accelerations occurring during routine conditions of transport it would prevent:


(A) Loss or dispersal of the radioactive contents; and


(B) More than a 20% increase in the maximum radiation level at any external surface of the freight containers.


(7) A metal intermediate bulk containers may be used as a Type IP-2 or Type IP-3 package, provided:


(i) It meets the requirements for a Type IP-1 package specified in paragraph (b)(1); and


(ii) It meets the requirements prescribed in Chapter 6.5 of the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), “Requirements for the Construction and Testing of Intermediate Bulk Containers,” for Packing Group I or II, and if subjected to the tests prescribed in that document, but with the drop test conducted in the most damaging orientation, it would prevent:


(A) Loss or dispersal of the radioactive contents; and


(B) More than a 20% increase in the maximum radiation level at any external surface of the intermediate bulk container.


(c) Except for Type IP-1 packages, each offeror of an industrial package must maintain on file for at least two years after the offeror's latest shipment, and must provide to the Associate Administrator on request, complete documentation of tests and an engineering evaluation or comparative data showing that the construction methods, package design, and materials of construction comply with that specification.
