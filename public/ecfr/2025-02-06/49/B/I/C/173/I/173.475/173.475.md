# § 173.475   Quality control requirements prior to each shipment of Class 7 (radioactive) materials.

Before each shipment of any Class 7 (radioactive) materials package, the offeror must ensure, by examination or appropriate tests, that—


(a) The packaging is proper for the contents to be shipped;


(b) The packaging is in unimpaired physical condition, except for superficial marks;


(c) Each closure device of the packaging, including any required gasket, is properly installed, secured, and free of defects;


(d) For fissile material, each moderator and neutron absorber, if required, is present and in proper condition;


(e) Each special instruction for filling, closing, and preparation of the packaging for shipment has been followed;


(f) Each closure, valve, or other opening of the containment system through which the radioactive content might escape is properly closed and sealed;


(g) Each packaging containing liquid in excess of an A_2_ quantity and intended for air shipment has been tested to show that it will not leak under an ambient atmospheric pressure of not more than 25 kPa, absolute (3.6 psia). The test must be conducted on the entire containment system, or on any receptacle or vessel within the containment system, to determine compliance with this requirement;


(h) The internal pressure of the containment system will not exceed the design pressure during transportation; and


(i) External radiation and contamination levels are within the allowable limits specified in this subchapter.
