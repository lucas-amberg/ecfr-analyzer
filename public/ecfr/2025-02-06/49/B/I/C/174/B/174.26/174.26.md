# § 174.26   Notice to train crews.

(a) Prior to movement of a train, a railroad must provide the train crew with train consist information as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter in hard-copy (printed paper) form that includes: a railroad-designated emergency response point of contact (including contact phone number) in a conspicuous location; and the position in the train and contents of each hazardous material rail car by reporting mark and number, to include the:


(1) Point of origin and destination of the train;


(2) Shipping paper information required by §§ 172.201 to 172.203 of this subchapter; and


(3) Emergency response information required by § 172.602(a) of this subchapter.


(b) The train crew must update the train consist information to reflect any changes in the train consist information occurring at intermediate stops prior to continued movement of the train. Additionally, any update to the train consist information must be made and reflected in the electronic train consist information required pursuant to § 174.28 of this subpart prior to continued movement of the train. The train crew may use electronic, radio communications, or other means to notify the railroad to update the electronic train consist information. Class III railroads complying with the alternative compliance requirements described in § 174.28(c) of this subpart are not subject to the requirement to update electronic train consist information.


(c) The train consist information must always be immediately available for use by the train crew while the train is in transportation. When the train crew is aboard the train locomotive, the train consist information shall be stowed in a conspicuous location of the occupied locomotive.


(d) Railroad operating rules for use of electronic devices by the train crew and use of electronic devices by the train crew in association with updates to train consist information requirements of this section and § 174.28 of this subchapter must comply with 49 CFR part 220, subpart C.
