# § 174.83   Switching placarded rail cars, transport vehicles, freight containers, and bulk packagings.

(a) In switching operations where the use of hand brakes is necessary—


(1) It must be determined by trial whether a loaded, placarded car, or a car occupied by a rider in a draft containing a placarded car, has its hand brakes in proper working condition before it is cut off;


(2) A loaded, placarded tank car or a draft which includes a loaded placarded tank car may not be cut off until the preceding rail car clears the ladder track; and


(3) A loaded, placarded tank car or a draft which includes a loaded placarded tank car must clear the ladder track before another rail car is allowed to follow.


(b) Any loaded rail car placarded for a Division 1.1 or Division 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A gas or a Division 6.1 PG I Hazard Zone A material, or a Class DOT 113 tank car displaying a Division 2.1 (flammable gas) placard, including a Class DOT 113 tank car containing only a residue of a Division 2.1 material, may not be:


(1) Cut off while in motion;


(2) Coupled into with more force than is necessary to complete the coupling; or


(3) Struck by any car moving under its own momentum.


(c) A placarded flatcar, or a flatcar carrying a placarded transport vehicle, freight container, or bulk packaging under this subchapter may not be cut off while in motion.


(d) No rail car moving under its own momentum may be permitted to strike any placarded flatcar or any flatcar carrying a placarded transport vehicle, freight container, or bulk packaging.


(e) No placarded flatcar or any flatcar carrying a placarded transport vehicle, freight container, or bulk packaging may be coupled into with more force than is necessary to complete the coupling.


(f) When transporting a rail car, transport vehicle, or freight container placarded for Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials in a terminal, yard, or on a side track or siding, the placarded rail car must be separated from the engine by at least one non-placarded rail car and must be placed in a location so that it will be safe from danger of fire. A rail car, transport vehicle, or freight container placarded for Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials may not be placed under a bridge or overhead crossing, or in or alongside a passenger shed or station, except during transfer operations.
