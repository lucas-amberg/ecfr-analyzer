# § 174.750   Incidents involving leakage.

(a) In addition to the incident reporting requirements of §§ 171.15 and 171.16 of this subchapter, the carrier shall also notify the offeror at the earliest practicable moment following any incident in which there has been breakage, spillage, or suspected radioactive contamination involving Class 7 (radioactive) materials shipments. Transport vehicles, buildings, areas, or equipment in which Class 7 (radioactive) materials have been spilled may not be again placed in service or routinely occupied until the radiation dose rate at every accessible surface is less than 0.005 mSv per hour (0.5 mrem per hour) and there is no significant removable radioactive surface contamination (see § 173.443 of this subchapter).


(b) The package or materials should be segregated as far as practicable from personnel contact. If radiological advice or assistance is needed, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) should also be notified. In case of obvious leakage, or if it appears likely that the inside container may have been damaged, care should be taken to avoid inhalation, ingestion, or contact with the Class 7 (radioactive) material. Any loose Class 7 (radioactive) materials should be left in a segregated area and held pending disposal instructions, from qualified persons.
