(a) When a hazardous material subject to the provisions of this subchapter is carried in an aircraft, the operator of the aircraft must provide the pilot-in-command and the flight dispatcher or other ground support personnel with responsibilities for operational control of the aircraft with accurate and legible written information (e.g., handwritten, printed, or electronic form) as early as practicable before departure of the aircraft, but in no case later than when the aircraft moves under its own power, which specifies at least the following:


(1) The date of the flight;


(2) The air waybill number (when issued);


(3) The proper shipping name (the technical name(s) shown on the shipping paper is not required), hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) corresponding to a required label(s), packing group and identification number of the material as specified in § 172.101 of this subchapter or the ICAO Technical Instructions (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(4) The total number of packages;


(5) The exact loading location of the packages;


(6) The net quantity or gross mass, as applicable, for each package except those containing Class 7 (radioactive) materials. For a shipment consisting of multiple packages containing hazardous materials bearing the same proper shipping name and identification number, only the total quantity and an indication of the quantity of the largest and smallest package at each loading location need to be provided. For consumer commodities, the information provided may be either the gross mass of each package or the average gross mass of the packages as shown on the shipping paper;


(7) For Class 7 (radioactive) materials, the number of packages overpacks or freight containers, their category, transport index (if applicable), and their exact loading location;


(8) Confirmation that the package must be carried on cargo-only aircraft;


(9) The airport at which the package(s) is to be unloaded;


(10) An indication, when applicable, that a hazardous material is being carried under terms of a special permit or under a State exemption as prescribed in the ICAO Technical Instructions (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter);


(11) The telephone number from whom the information contained in the information to the pilot-in-command can be obtained. The aircraft operator must ensure the telephone number is monitored at all times the aircraft is in flight. The telephone number is not required to be placed on the information to the pilot-in-command if the phone number is in a location in the cockpit available and known to the pilot-in-command;


(12) For UN1845, Carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice), the information required by this paragraph (a) may be replaced by the UN number, proper shipping name, hazard class, total quantity in each cargo compartment aboard the aircraft, and the airport at which the package(s) is to be unloaded; and


(13)(i) For UN3480, Lithium ion batteries, and UN3090, Lithium metal batteries, the information required by paragraph (a) of this section may be replaced by the UN number, proper shipping name, hazard class, total quantity at each specific loading location, the airport at which the package(s) is to be unloaded, and whether the package must be carried on cargo-only aircraft.


(ii) For UN3480, Lithium ion batteries, and UN3090, Lithium metal batteries, carried under a special permit or a State exemption as prescribed in the ICAO Technical Instructions (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must meet all of the requirements of this section.


(iii) UN3481 and UN3091 are not required to appear on the information provided to the pilot-in-command when prepared in accordance with § 173.185(c).


(b)(1) The information provided to the pilot-in-command must also include a signed confirmation or some other indication from the person responsible for loading the aircraft that there was no evidence of any damage to or leakage from the packages or any leakage from the unit load devices loaded on the aircraft;


(2) The information to the pilot-in-command and the emergency response information required by subpart G of part 172 of this subchapter shall be readily available to the pilot-in-command and flight dispatcher during flight.


(3) The pilot-in-command must indicate in writing (e.g., handwritten, printed, or electronic form) that the information to the pilot-in-command has been received.


(c) The aircraft operator must—


(1) *For shipping papers.* (i) Ensure a copy of the shipping paper required by § 175.30(a)(2) accompanies the shipment it covers during transportation aboard the aircraft.


(ii) Retain a copy of the shipping paper required by § 175.30(a)(2) or an electronic image thereof, that is accessible at or through its principal place of business and must make the shipping paper available, upon request, to an authorized official of a federal, state, or local government agency at reasonable times and locations. For a hazardous waste, each shipping paper copy must be retained for three years after the material is accepted by the initial carrier. For all other hazardous materials, each shipping paper copy must be retained by the operator for one year after the material is accepted by the initial carrier. Each shipping paper copy must include the date of acceptance by the carrier. The date on the shipping paper may be the date a shipper notifies the air carrier that a shipment is ready for transportation, as indicated on the air waybill or bill of lading, as an alternative to the date the shipment is picked up or accepted by the carrier. Only an initial carrier must receive and retain a copy of the shipper's certification, as required by § 172.204 of this subchapter.


(2) *For information to the pilot-in-command.* Retain for 90 days at the airport of departure or the operator's principal place of business.

(4) Make available, upon request, to an authorized official of a Federal, State, or local government agency (which includes emergency responders) at reasonable times and locations, the documents or information required to be retained by this paragraph. In the event of a reportable incident, as defined in § 171.15 of this subchapter, the aircraft operator must make immediately available to an authorized official of a Federal, State, or local government agency (which includes emergency responders), the documents or information required to be retained by this paragraph (c).


(5) Specify the personnel to be provided the information required by paragraph (a) of this section in their operations manual and/or other appropriate manuals.
