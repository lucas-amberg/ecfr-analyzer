The plate is found in the door area of the container.


*Deck structure* means a structure of substantial weight and size located on the weather deck of a vessel and integral with the deck. This term includes superstructures, deck houses, mast houses, and bridge structures.


*Draft* means a load or combination of loads capable of being hoisted into or out of a vessel in a single lift.


*Dunnage* means lumber of not less than 25 mm (0.98 inch) commercial thickness or equivalent material laid over or against structures such as tank tops, decks, bulkheads, frames, plating, or ladders, or used for filling voids or fitting around cargo, to prevent damage during transportation.


*Explosives anchorage* means an anchorage so designated under 33 CFR part 110, subpart B.


*Explosive article* means an article or device that contains one or more explosive substances. Individual explosive substances are identified in column 17 of the Dangerous Goods List in the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). 


*Explosives handling facility* means—


(1) A “designated waterfront facility” designated under 33 CFR part 126 when loading, handling, and unloading Class 1 (explosives) materials; or


(2) A facility for loading, unloading, and handling military Class 1 (explosives) materials which is operated or controlled by an agency of the Department of Defense.


*Explosive substance* means a solid or liquid material, or a mixture of materials, which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to its surroundings. Individual explosive substances are identified in column 17 of the Dangerous Goods List in the IMDG Code. 


*Handling* means the operation of loading and unloading a vessel; transfer to, from, or within a vessel, and any ancillary operations.


*Hold* means a compartment below deck that is used exclusively for the carriage of cargo.


*In containers or the like* means any clean, substantial, weatherproof box structure which can be secured to the vessel's structure, including a portable magazine or a closed cargo transport unit. Whenever this stowage is specified, stowage in deckhouses, mast lockers and oversized weatherproof packages (overpacks) is also acceptable. 


*Incompatible materials* means two materials whose stowage together may result in undue hazards in the case of leakage, spillage, or other accident.


*INF cargo* means packaged irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium or high-level radioactive wastes as those terms are defined in the “International Code for the Safe Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes on Board Ships” (INF Code) contained in the IMDG Code. 


*Landing mat* means a shock absorbing pad used in loading Class 1 (explosive) materials on vessels.


*Machinery Spaces of Category* A are those spaces, and trunks to such spaces, which contain:


(1) Internal combustion machinery used for main propulsion:


(2) Internal combustion machinery used for purposes other than main propulsion where such machinery has in the aggregate a total power output of not less than 375 kw; or


(3) any oil-fired boiler or fuel unit.


*Magazine* means an enclosure designed to protect certain goods of Class 1 (explosive) materials from damage by other cargo and adverse weather conditions during loading, unloading, and when in transit; and to prevent unauthorized access. A magazine may be a fixed structure or compartment in the vessel, a closed freight container, a closed transport vehicle, or a portable magazine. Magazines may be positioned in any part of the ship conforming with the relevant provisions for Class 1 (explosive) materials contained in Subpart G of this part provided that magazines which are fixed structures are sited so that their doors, where fitted, are easily accessible. 


*Master of the Vessel,* as used in this part, includes the person in charge of an unmanned vessel or barge.


*Open freight container* means a freight container that does not totally enclose its contents by permanent structures.


*Overstowed* means a package or container is stowed directly on top of another. However, with regard to Class 1 (explosive) stowage, such goods may themselves be stacked to a safe level but other goods should not be stowed directly on top of them.


*Pallet* means a portable platform for stowing, handling, and moving cargo.


*Palletized unit* means packages or unpackaged objects stacked on a pallet, banded and secured to the pallet by metal, fabric, or plastic straps for the purpose of handling as a single unit.


*Pie plate* means a round, oval, or hexagonal pallet without sideboards, used in conjunction with a cargo net to handle loose cargo on board a vessel.

*Potential or possible sources of ignition* means, but is not limited to, open fires, machinery exhausts, galley uptakes, electrical outlets and electrical equipment including those on refrigerated or heated cargo transport units unless they are of a type designed to operate in a hazardous environment.


*Protected from sources of heat* means that packages and cargo transport units must be stowed at least 2.4 m from heated ship structures, where the surface temperature is liable to exceed 131 °F (55 °C). Examples of heated structures are steam pipes, heating coils, top or side walls of heated fuel and cargo tanks, and bulkheads of machinery spaces. In addition, packages not loaded inside a cargo transport unit and stowed on deck must be shaded from direct sunlight. The surface of a cargo transport unit can heat rapidly when in direct sunlight in nearly windless conditions and the cargo may also become heated. Depending on the nature of the goods in the cargo transport unit, and the planned voyage, precautions must be taken to ensure that exposure to direct sunlight is reduced.


*Readily combustible material* means a material which may or may not be classed as a hazardous material but which is easily ignited and supports combustion. Examples of readily combustible materials include wood, paper, straw, vegetable fibers, products made from such materials, coal, lubricants, and oils. This definition does not apply to packaging material or dunnage.
