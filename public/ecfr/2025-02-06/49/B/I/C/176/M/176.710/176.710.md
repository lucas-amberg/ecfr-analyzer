# ยง 176.710   Care following leakage or sifting of radioactive materials.

(a) In case of fire, collision, or breakage involving any shipment of radioactive materials, other than materials of low specific activity, the radioactive materials must be segregated from unnecessary contact with personnel. In case of obvious leakage, or if the inside container appears to be damaged, the stowage area (hold, compartment, or deck area) containing this cargo must be isolated as much as possible to prevent radioactive material from entering any person's body through contact, inhalation, or ingestion. No person may handle the material or remain in the vicinity unless supervised by a qualified person.


(b) A hold or compartment in which leakage of radioactive materials has occurred may not be used for other cargo until it is decontaminated in accordance with the requirements of ยง 176.715.


(c) For reporting requirements, see ยง 171.15 of this subchapter.
