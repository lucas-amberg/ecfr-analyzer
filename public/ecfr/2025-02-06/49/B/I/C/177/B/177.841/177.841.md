# § 177.841   Division 6.1 (poisonous) materials and Division 2.3 (poisonous gas) materials.

(See also § 177.834 (a) to (j).)


(a) *Arsenical compounds in bulk.* Care shall be exercised in the loading and unloading of “arsenical dust”, “arsenic trioxide”, and “sodium arsenate”, allowable to be loaded into sift-proof, steel hopper-type or dump-type motor-vehicle bodies equipped with water-proof, dust-proof covers well secured in place on all openings, to accomplish such loading with the minimum spread of such compounds into the atmosphere by all means that are practicable; and no such loading or unloading shall be done near or adjacent to any place where there are or are likely to be, during the loading or unloading process assemblages of persons other than those engaged in the loading or unloading process, or upon any public highway or in any public place. Before any motor vehicle may be used for transporting any other articles, all detectable traces of arsenical materials must be removed therefrom by flushing with water, or by other appropriate method, and the marking removed.


(b) [Reserved]


(c) *Division 2.3 (poisonous gas) or Division 6.1 (poisonous) materials.* The transportation of a Division 2.3 (poisonous gas) or Division 6.1 (poisonous) material is not permitted if there is any interconnection between packagings.


(d) [Reserved]


(e) A motor carrier may not transport a package:


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, bearing or required to bear a POISON or POISON INHALATION HAZARD label or placard in the same motor vehicle with material that is marked as or known to be foodstuffs, feed or edible material intended for consumption by humans or animals unless the poisonous material is packaged in accordance with this subchapter and is: 


(i) Overpacked in a metal drum as specified in § 173.25(c) of this subchapter; or


(ii) Loaded into a closed unit load device and the foodstuffs, feed, or other edible material are loaded into another closed unit load device;


(2) Bearing or required to bear a POISON, POISON GAS or POISON INHALATION HAZARD label in the driver's compartment (including a sleeper berth) of a motor vehicle; or


(3) Bearing a POISON label displaying the text “PG III,” or bearing a “PG III” mark adjacent to the POISON label, with materials marked as, or known to be, foodstuffs, feed or any other edible material intended for consumption by humans or animals, unless the package containing the Division 6.1, Packing Group III material is separated in a manner that, in the event of leakage from packages under conditions normally incident to transportation, commingling of hazardous materials with foodstuffs, feed or any other edible material would not occur.


(f) Notwithstanding the segregation requirements of § 177.848(d), when transported by highway by private or contract motor carrier, Division 6.1 PG I, Hazard Zone A toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials meeting the definition of a hazardous waste as provided in § 171.8 of this subchapter, may be transported on the same transport vehicle with materials classed as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5, and Class 8. The Division 6.1 PG I, Hazard Zone A materials must be loaded on pallets and separated from the Class 3, Class 4, Class 5, and Class 8 materials by a minimum horizontal distance of 2.74 m (9 feet) when in conformance with the following:


(1) The TIH materials are packaged in combination packagings as prescribed in § 173.226(c) of this subchapter.


(2) The combination packages containing TIH materials must be:


(i) Filled and packed by the offeror's hazmat employees;


(ii) Be placed on pallets, when in a transport vehicle; and


(iii) Separated from hazardous materials classed as Class 3, Class 8 or Divisions 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, or 5.2 by a nine-foot (minimum distance) buffer zone, when in a transport vehicle. The buffer zone maybe established by:


(A) A load lock;


(B) Empty drums;


(C) Drums containing hazardous materials (e.g., Class 9) that are compatible with materials in all other drums immediately around them; or


(D) Drums containing non-hazardous materials that are compatible with materials in all other drums immediately around them.
