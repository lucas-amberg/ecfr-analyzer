# Appendix D to Part 178—Thermal Resistance Test


1. *Scope.* This test method evaluates the thermal resistance capabilities of a compressed oxygen generator and the outer packaging for a cylinder of compressed oxygen or other oxidizing gas and an oxygen generator. When exposed to a temperature of 205 °C (400 °F) for a period of not less than three hours, the outer surface of the cylinder may not exceed a temperature of 93 °C (199 °F) and the oxygen generator must not actuate.


2. *Apparatus.*

2.1 *Test Oven.* The oven must be large enough in size to fully house the test outer package without clearance problems. The test oven must be capable of maintaining a minimum steady state temperature of 205 °C (400 °F).


2.2 *Thermocouples.* At least three thermocouples must be used to monitor the temperature inside the oven and an additional three thermocouples must be used to monitor the temperature of the cylinder. The thermocouples must be 
1/16 inch, ceramic packed, metal sheathed, type K (Chromel-Alumel), grounded junction with a nominal 30 American wire gauge (AWG) size conductor. The thermocouples measuring the temperature inside the oven must be placed at varying heights to ensure even temperature and proper heat-soak conditions. For the thermocouples measuring the temperature of the cylinder: (1) Two of them must be placed on the outer cylinder side wall at approximately 2 inches (5 cm) from the top and bottom shoulders of the cylinder; and (2) one must be placed on the cylinder valve body near the pressure relief device. Alternatively, the thermocouples may be replaced with other devices such as a remote temperature sensor, metal fuse on the valve, or coated wax, provided the device is tested and the test report is retained for verification. Under this alternative, it is permissible to record the highest temperature to which the cylinder is subjected instead of temperature measurements in intervals of not more than five (5) minutes.


2.3 *Instrumentation.* A calibrated recording device or a computerized data acquisition system with an appropriate range should be provided to measure and record the outputs of the thermocouples.


3. *Test Specimen.*

3.1 *Specimen Configuration.* Each outer package material type and design must be tested, including any features such as handles, latches, fastening systems, etc., that may compromise the ability of the outer package to provide thermal protection.


3.2 *Test Specimen Mounting.* The tested outer package must be supported at the four corners using fire brick or other suitable means. The bottom surface of the outer package must be exposed to allow exposure to heat.


4. *Preparation for Testing.*

4.1 It is recommended that the cylinder be closed at ambient temperature and configured as when filled with a valve and pressure relief device. The oxygen generator must be filled with an oxidizing agent and may be tested with or without packaging.


4.2 Place the package or generator onto supporting bricks or a stand inside the test oven in such a manner to ensure even temperature flow.


5. *Test Procedure.*

5.1 Close oven door and check for proper reading on thermocouples.


5.2 Raise the temperature of the oven to a minimum temperature of 205 °C ±2 °C (400 °F ±5 °F). Maintain a minimum oven temperature of 205 °C ±2 °C (400 °F ±5 °F) for at least three hours. Exposure time begins when the oven steady state temperature reaches a minimum of 205 °C ±2 °C (400 °F ±5 °F).


5.3 At the conclusion of the three-hour period, the outer package may be removed from the oven and allowed to cool naturally.


6. *Recordkeeping.*

6.1 Record a complete description of the material being tested, including the manufacturer, size of cylinder, etc.


6.2 Record any observations regarding the behavior of the test specimen during exposure, such as smoke production, delamination, resin ignition, and time of occurrence of each event.


6.3 Record the temperature and time history of the cylinder temperature during the entire test for each thermocouple location. Temperature measurements must be recorded at intervals of not more than five (5) minutes. Record the maximum temperatures achieved at all three thermocouple locations and the corresponding time.


7. *Requirements.*

7.1 For a cylinder, the outer package must provide adequate protection such that the outer surface of the cylinder and valve does not exceed a temperature of 93 °C (199 °F) at any of the three points where the thermocouples are located.


7.2 For an oxygen generator, the generator must not actuate.
