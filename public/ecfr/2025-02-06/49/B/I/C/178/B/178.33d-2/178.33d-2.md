# § 178.33d-2   Variation 1.

Notwithstanding the variation provided in this paragraph, each container must otherwise conform to a DOT 2Q container in accordance with § 178.33a. The following conditions also apply under Variation 1—


(a) *Type and size.* The maximum capacity of containers in this class may not exceed 0.40 L (24.4 cubic inches). The maximum inside diameter shall not exceed 2.1 inches.


(b) *Manufacture.* Ends: The top of the container must be designed with a pressure relief system consisting of radial scores on the top seam(s). The bottom of the container must be designed to buckle at a pressure greater than the pressure at which the top buckles and vents.


(c) *Wall thickness.* The minimum wall thickness for any container shall be 0.0085 inches.


(d) *Tests.* (1) Two containers (one without a pressure relief system and one with) out of each lot of 25,000 or less, successively produced per day shall be pressure tested to destruction at gauge pressure. The container without a pressure relief system must not burst below 320 psig. The container assembled with a pressure relief system as described in paragraph (b) of this section must be tested to destruction. The bottom of the container must buckle at a pressure greater than the pressure at which the top buckles and vents.


(2) Each such 25,000 containers or less, successively produced per day, shall constitute a lot and if the test container(s) shall fail, the lot shall be rejected. Otherwise, ten (10) additional pairs of containers may be selected at random and subjected to the test under which failure occurred. Should any of the containers thus tested fail, the entire lot must be rejected. All containers constituting a lot shall be of like material, size, design construction, finish, and quality.


(e) *Marking.* By means of printing, lithographing, embossing, or stamping, each container must be marked:


(1) DOT-2Q1.


(2) With the name or symbol of the person making the mark. A symbol, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator.
