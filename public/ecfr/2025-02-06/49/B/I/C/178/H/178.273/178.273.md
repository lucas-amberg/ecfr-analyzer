(7) Upon successful completion of all requirements of this subpart, the approval agency must:


(i) Apply its name, identifying mark or identifying number, and the date upon which the approval was issued, to the metal identification marking plate attached to the portable tank. Any approvals for UN portable tanks authorizing design or construction alternatives (Alternate Arrangements) approved by the Associate Administrator (see § 178.274(a)(2)) must be indicated on the plate as specified in § 178.274(i).


(ii) Issue an approval certificate for each portable tank or, in the case of a series of identical portable tanks manufactured to a single design type, for each series of portable tanks. The approval certificate must include all the information required to be displayed on the metal identification plate required by § 178.274(i). The approval certificate must certify that the approval agency designated to approve the portable tank has approved the portable tank in accordance with the procedures in subpart E of part 107 of this subchapter and that the portable tank is suitable for its intended purpose and meets the requirements of this subchapter. When a series of portable tanks is manufactured without change in the design type, the certificate may be valid for the entire series of portable tanks representing a single design type. For UN portable tanks, the certificate must refer to the prototype test report, the hazardous material or group of hazardous materials allowed to be transported, the materials of construction of the shell and lining (when applicable) and an approval number. The approval number must consist of the distinguishing sign or mark of the country (“USA” for the United States of America) where the approval was granted and a registration number.


(iii) Retain a copy of each approval certificate.


(8) For UN portable tanks, the approval certificate must also include the following:


(i) The results of the applicable framework and rail impact test specified in part 180, subpart G, of this subchapter; and


(ii) The results of the initial inspection and test in § 178.274(j).


(9) The approval agency shall be independent from the manufacturer. The approval agency and the authorized inspector may be the same entity.


(c) *Manufacturers' responsibilities.* The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the applicable specifications for the design and construction of portable tanks. In addition to responsibility for compliance, manufacturers are responsible for ensuring that the contracted approval agency and authorized inspector, if applicable, are qualified, reputable and competent. The manufacturer of a portable tank shall—


(1) Comply with all the applicable requirements of the ASME Code and of this subpart including, but not limited to, ensuring that the quality control, design calculations and required tests are performed and that all aspects of the portable tank meet the applicable requirements.


(2) Obtain and use a designated approval agency, if applicable, and obtain and use a DOT-designated approval agency to approve the design, construction and certification of the portable tank.


(3) Provide a statement in the manufacturers' data report certifying that each portable tank that is manufactured complies with the relevant specification and all the applicable requirements of this subchapter.


(4) Maintain records of the qualification of portable tanks for at least 5 years and provide copies to the approval agency, the owner or lessee of the tank. Upon request, provide these records to a representative of DOT.


(d) *Denial of application for approval.* If an approval agency finds that a portable tank cannot be approved for any reason, it shall notify the applicant in writing and shall provide the applicant with the reasons for which the approval is denied. A copy of the notification letter shall be provided to the Associate Administrator. An applicant aggrieved by a decision of an approval agency may appeal the decision in writing, within 90 days of receipt, to the Associate Administrator.


(e) *Modifications to approved portable tanks.* (1) Prior to modification of any UN portable tank which may affect conformance and the safe use of the portable tank, which may involve a change to the design type or which may affect its ability to retain hazardous material in transportation, the person desiring to make such modification shall inform the approval agency that issued the initial approval of the portable tank (or if unavailable, another approval agency) of the nature of the modification and request approval of the modification.
